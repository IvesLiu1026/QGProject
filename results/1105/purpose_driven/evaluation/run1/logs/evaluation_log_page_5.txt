**Transcript**:
I don’t know about you, but I thought to
be chameleon-like was to be someone who could fit in anywhere. Adapt. Blend in. Turns out that is all wrong. Chameleons don’t change color to match their
environment. In fact, it’s just the opposite. Their baseline is camouflage. When chameleons are relaxed, they’re mostly
green. They naturally blend into their home in the
forest canopy. They even mimic leaves by dancing around a
little. But when they feel threatened, or annoyed,
or just want to show a little swagger – that is when their color changes. They transform into living mood rings. Chameleons change color to make a statement. The faster their skin changes colors, the
more excited they are. How do they do this? Well it turns out we’ve been getting that
wrong too. Until this year, scientists thought chameleons
change color by spreading out pigments in their cells, like the skin of the squid we’re
seeing right here. But the truth is way more complex. Just below the surface of their skin is a
layer of cells called iridophores. These cells contain tiny, nano-scale salt
crystals. They’re only a 130 nanometers across – that’s
less than one hundredth of the width of a human hair. The crystals are arranged in a three-dimensional
lattice. When light hits the lattice, it shatters into
different wavelengths. Some are absorbed and some bounce back. The result, to our eyes, appears green or
red or blue. The wings of the Morpho butterfly have similar
structures, which reflect brilliant blue hues. But unlike Morpho butterflies, chameleons
can stretch or contract the lattice, which moves the distance between crystals. Each of these points of light is an array
of crystals. When the distance changes, the crystals reflect
a different wavelength of light. The result is a dramatic shift in color. So what if we could come up with some kind
of material that could change from one brilliant color to another? Electrical engineers at UC Berkeley are trying
to do that. To mimic a chameleon’s structural color
control with synthetic materials. They arranged tiny, nano-scale silicon ribbons
on a sheet of flexible plastic. Each one of these “pixels” is made up
of about 160 ribbons. When the plastic stretches, the space between
the ribbons becomes greater and a different wavelength of light is reflected – just
like chameleon skin. Well, almost. This synthetic chameleon skin has just one
layer of nano-scale arrays. The salt crystals in real chameleon skin are
stacked in several layers, which makes their skin some of the most colorful and complex
in the animal kingdom. They produce colors that aren’t even visible
to human eyes. What I like about chameleons is they show
us how wrong we can be about science. What we called “camouflage” is an entire
language… as alien to us as the clicks of a dolphin or the low rumble of an elephant. A visual language … made of colors we can
only begin to imitate and imagine.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content of the transcript, I can identify a question that is related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the animal that scientists believed had a similar color-changing mechanism to chameleons. In the transcript, it is mentioned that scientists thought chameleons changed color by spreading out pigments in their cells, like the skin of the squid.

Although there isn't a direct match, Question 2 mentions the iridophores in a chameleon's skin and their function, which is related to the color-changing mechanism. However, it does not directly compare it to another animal.

But Question 4 has an option C that says "By producing pigments and spreading them across the skin," which is similar to what is mentioned in the transcript about the squid. 

However, since none of the questions directly ask about the comparison with the squid, I will choose a question that is closest in terms of content.

The closest generated MCQ is Question 4, but it is not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
For centuries we’ve been warned of the dangers
that lurk deep below the ocean’s surface. Maybe there’s a horrifying colossal squid,
or a Kraken, or an evil villain’s lair. As it turns out, the reality is far worse. Hey there polluting population, Jules here
for DNews! The Mariana Trench is the deepest known part
of the ocean, stretching down roughly 36,000 feet. You’d imagine that at those depths, the
ocean floor is pristine, almost untouched by human activity. Well, I’ve got some bad news for ya. Turns out, the bottom of the ocean is very,
very polluted. And that’s not some click-bait hyperbole;
it is more polluted than some of the most polluted regions on the surface of the globe. One probe into the Marianas Trench only had
to go about 16,000 feet down to find physical remnants of actual garbage, not just waste
byproducts. Beer cans, plastic bags, even an entire, unopened
can of SPAM was found resting along the Trench’s wall. And unless it is removed, this trash can stay
down there indefinitely, just piling up. Plastics, for example, are made up of super-strong
carbon to carbon bonds. These bonds are not prone to being broken
down by organic organisms; the material hasn’t existed in nature long enough for there to
have evolved much to break it down. In 2016 scientists found one type of microbe
that can do it, but only for a specific type of plastic. And even if we could solve this physical trash
problem, there lies an even deeper problem. Literally. In late 2016, a paper published in the journal
Nature, examined the inhabitants of two of the deepest oceanic trenches in the world. Small little crustaceans called amphipods
are the perfect study specimen, as they have fatty tissue, which stores not just fat but
also any chemicals that are ingested. And despite these amphipods being located
in two different parts of the world, thousands of feet below the surface, they were ALL contaminated
by what are called “persistent organic pollutants” or POPs. “Persistent” meaning that they don’t
break down in their environment, and are almost impossible to remove. These include chemicals that have been banned
from use for decades, at least in the United States, like polychlorinated biphenyls, which
have been shown to be birth defect and cancer-causing. Other chemicals like pesticides were present
as well. The concentration of POPs was SO high that
it was 50 times greater than in one of China’s most polluted rivers, and was roughly equal
to that of Suruga Bay in Japan, an industrial waste dumping ground. So, how did this pollution make it all the
way down there? Well the researchers suggest that, in the
case of the Mariana Trench, it may have to do with a little something called the Great
Pacific Garbage Patch. While there are many areas where trash congregates
in the ocean, the paper refers to a huge floating clump of garbage in the Northwest Pacific
ocean that floats just near the Mariana’s Trench, and so plastics and other chemicals
end up sinking to its depths. There’s another theory that the pollution
found down there is the result of POP chemicals entering the food chain. The amphipods that live in these deep waters
are scavengers. When a larger animal, like a dolphin or a
whale, dies, it slowly sinks to the bottom of the ocean floor, a phenomenon known as
carrion-falls. If this carrion lived in polluted waters,
then it could have pollution in its system, and that pollution would persist in animals
that eat it. The paper does say that this is unlikely,
however, given that there is consistent contamination at different depths. But either of these theories for how the POPs
got so deep would be a huge problem for us humans. If these chemicals are so persistent within
the food chain, then they eventually reach our own food supply, contaminating it with
our own contaminants. But it isn’t just bad for us, it’s bad
for every living thing. Ocean pollution saps the amount of oxygen
in the water, which can lead to mass death of marine life. Certain chemicals can even create reproductive
issues for animals in the ocean, so even if they do survive, they can’t do much for
their species. Society has spent the last few centuries dumping
tons of trash into the ocean, including industrial waste, radioactive waste, munitions, and sewage. The EPA says, quote, “Wastes were frequently
dumped in coastal and ocean waters based on the assumption that marine waters had an unlimited
capacity to mix and disperse wastes.” But now we’re learning that this isn’t
really the case. The out of sight out, of mind is killing ocean
creatures and endangering our own health. It turns out nowhere is safe from pollution. Not even the deepest part of the ocean. We can’t do DNews episodes without our sponsors. Thanks to Graze for sponsoring this episode. Graze makes snacking exciting by combining

**Transcript**:
For centuries we’ve been warned of the dangers
that lurk deep below the ocean’s surface. Maybe there’s a horrifying colossal squid,
or a Kraken, or an evil villain’s lair. As it turns out, the reality is far worse. Hey there polluting population, Jules here
for DNews! The Mariana Trench is the deepest known part
of the ocean, stretching down roughly 36,000 feet. You’d imagine that at those depths, the
ocean floor is pristine, almost untouched by human activity. Well, I’ve got some bad news for ya. Turns out, the bottom of the ocean is very,
very polluted. And that’s not some click-bait hyperbole;
it is more polluted than some of the most polluted regions on the surface of the globe. One probe into the Marianas Trench only had
to go about 16,000 feet down to find physical remnants of actual garbage, not just waste
byproducts. Beer cans, plastic bags, even an entire, unopened
can of SPAM was found resting along the Trench’s wall. And unless it is removed, this trash can stay
down there indefinitely, just piling up. Plastics, for example, are made up of super-strong
carbon to carbon bonds. These bonds are not prone to being broken
down by organic organisms; the material hasn’t existed in nature long enough for there to
have evolved much to break it down. In 2016 scientists found one type of microbe
that can do it, but only for a specific type of plastic. And even if we could solve this physical trash
problem, there lies an even deeper problem. Literally. In late 2016, a paper published in the journal
Nature, examined the inhabitants of two of the deepest oceanic trenches in the world. Small little crustaceans called amphipods
are the perfect study specimen, as they have fatty tissue, which stores not just fat but
also any chemicals that are ingested. And despite these amphipods being located
in two different parts of the world, thousands of feet below the surface, they were ALL contaminated
by what are called “persistent organic pollutants” or POPs. “Persistent” meaning that they don’t
break down in their environment, and are almost impossible to remove. These include chemicals that have been banned
from use for decades, at least in the United States, like polychlorinated biphenyls, which
have been shown to be birth defect and cancer-causing. Other chemicals like pesticides were present
as well. The concentration of POPs was SO high that
it was 50 times greater than in one of China’s most polluted rivers, and was roughly equal
to that of Suruga Bay in Japan, an industrial waste dumping ground. So, how did this pollution make it all the
way down there? Well the researchers suggest that, in the
case of the Mariana Trench, it may have to do with a little something called the Great
Pacific Garbage Patch. While there are many areas where trash congregates
in the ocean, the paper refers to a huge floating clump of garbage in the Northwest Pacific
ocean that floats just near the Mariana’s Trench, and so plastics and other chemicals
end up sinking to its depths. There’s another theory that the pollution
found down there is the result of POP chemicals entering the food chain. The amphipods that live in these deep waters
are scavengers. When a larger animal, like a dolphin or a
whale, dies, it slowly sinks to the bottom of the ocean floor, a phenomenon known as
carrion-falls. If this carrion lived in polluted waters,
then it could have pollution in its system, and that pollution would persist in animals
that eat it. The paper does say that this is unlikely,
however, given that there is consistent contamination at different depths. But either of these theories for how the POPs

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the definition of the word "pristine." While none of the generated MCQs ask about the definition of a word, Question 2 mentions the idea of the ocean floor being "pristine" in its context.

However, a more suitable match can be found in the generated MCQs that discuss the ocean's environment and pollution. Among these, Question 7 is the most relevant, as it discusses the problem caused by pollution in the ocean.

But if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, I would choose Question 3. This question asks about the type of bonds found in plastics, which is related to the idea of the ocean floor being polluted, as mentioned in the context of the ground truth MCQ.

However, please note that this is a weak match, and the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

For centuries we’ve been warned of the dangers

**Transcript**:
For centuries we’ve been warned of the dangers
that lurk deep below the ocean’s surface. Maybe there’s a horrifying colossal squid,
or a Kraken, or an evil villain’s lair. As it turns out, the reality is far worse. Hey there polluting population, Jules here
for DNews! The Mariana Trench is the deepest known part
of the ocean, stretching down roughly 36,000 feet. You’d imagine that at those depths, the
ocean floor is pristine, almost untouched by human activity. Well, I’ve got some bad news for ya. Turns out, the bottom of the ocean is very,
very polluted. And that’s not some click-bait hyperbole;
it is more polluted than some of the most polluted regions on the surface of the globe. One probe into the Marianas Trench only had
to go about 16,000 feet down to find physical remnants of actual garbage, not just waste
byproducts. Beer cans, plastic bags, even an entire, unopened
can of SPAM was found resting along the Trench’s wall. And unless it is removed, this trash can stay
down there indefinitely, just piling up. Plastics, for example, are made up of super-strong
carbon to carbon bonds. These bonds are not prone to being broken
down by organic organisms; the material hasn’t existed in nature long enough for there to
have evolved much to break it down. In 2016 scientists found one type of microbe
that can do it, but only for a specific type of plastic. And even if we could solve this physical trash
problem, there lies an even deeper problem. Literally. In late 2016, a paper published in the journal
Nature, examined the inhabitants of two of the deepest oceanic trenches in the world. Small little crustaceans called amphipods
are the perfect study specimen, as they have fatty tissue, which stores not just fat but
also any chemicals that are ingested. And despite these amphipods being located
in two different parts of the world, thousands of feet below the surface, they were ALL contaminated
by what are called “persistent organic pollutants” or POPs. “Persistent” meaning that they don’t
break down in their environment, and are almost impossible to remove. These include chemicals that have been banned
from use for decades, at least in the United States, like polychlorinated biphenyls, which
have been shown to be birth defect and cancer-causing. Other chemicals like pesticides were present
as well. The concentration of POPs was SO high that
it was 50 times greater than in one of China’s most polluted rivers, and was roughly equal
to that of Suruga Bay in Japan, an industrial waste dumping ground. So, how did this pollution make it all the
way down there? Well the researchers suggest that, in the
case of the Mariana Trench, it may have to do with a little something called the Great
Pacific Garbage Patch. While there are many areas where trash congregates
in the ocean, the paper refers to a huge floating clump of garbage in the Northwest Pacific
ocean that floats just near the Mariana’s Trench, and so plastics and other chemicals
end up sinking to its depths. There’s another theory that the pollution
found down there is the result of POP chemicals entering the food chain. The amphipods that live in these deep waters
are scavengers. When a larger animal, like a dolphin or a
whale, dies, it slowly sinks to the bottom of the ocean floor, a phenomenon known as
carrion-falls. If this carrion lived in polluted waters,
then it could have pollution in its system, and that pollution would persist in animals
that eat it. The paper does say that this is unlikely,
however, given that there is consistent contamination at different depths. But either of these theories for how the POPs
got so deep would be a huge problem for us humans. If these chemicals are so persistent within
the food chain, then they eventually reach our own food supply, contaminating it with
our own contaminants. But it isn’t just bad for us, it’s bad
for every living thing. Ocean pollution saps the amount of oxygen
in the water, which can lead to mass death of marine life. Certain chemicals can even create reproductive
issues for animals in the ocean, so even if they do survive, they can’t do much for
their species. Society has spent the last few centuries dumping
tons of trash into the ocean, including industrial waste, radioactive waste, munitions, and sewage. The EPA says, quote, “Wastes were frequently
dumped in coastal and ocean waters based on the assumption that marine waters had an unlimited
capacity to mix and disperse wastes.” But now we’re learning that this isn’t
really the case. The out of sight out, of mind is killing ocean
creatures and endangering our own health. It turns out nowhere is safe from pollution. Not even the deepest part of the ocean. We can’t do DNews episodes without our sponsors. Thanks to Graze for sponsoring this episode. Graze makes snacking exciting by combining

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about POPs (persistent organic pollutants), and the correct answer is D, which states that POPs are "almost impossible to remove once in an environment" and "persistent organic pollutants".

Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is about the type of bonds found in plastics, which is related to the persistence of plastics in the environment. However, it does not directly address the definition or characteristics of POPs.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the closest, as it mentions POPs, but the question and options are not similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2 (although it's not a good match)

Note: The generated MCQs seem to be focused on the topic of ocean pollution, but they do not directly address the specific concept of POPs as defined in the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: What is the phenomenon known as the "carrion-falls" in the ocean?

This question is related to the concept of "carrion" mentioned in the ground truth MCQ. Although the question is not directly asking for the definition of "carrion," it is asking about a phenomenon that involves the concept of "carrion" (i.e., the sinking of dead animals to the ocean floor). 

However, an even more similar question would be one that directly asks about the definition of "carrion." Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 5.

it can feel good lounging around and doing nothing sometimes too good whether it's to avoid work or Escape physical activity we've all had those days but why are some people way lazier than others is there a couch potato Gene that causes lazy Behavior Evolution has molded our brains and bodies to respond positively to Natural Rewards such as food sex and even exercise wait exercise yep the pleasure we experience comes largely from the dopamine system in our brain which conveys these messages throughout the body ultimately helping to ensure the surv Ral of our species for many the pleasure derived from exercise can become just as addictive as food and sex but while we're all up for more food and sex many struggle with the desire for physical activity even though it's an essential part of human biology scientists studying mice have found an interesting genetic connection after separating mice into two groups those that chose to run on their wheel more often and those that decided not to run as much the difference was clear in their offspring after 10 Generations the running mice would run on their wheels 75% more often than the other group and by 16 Generations they were running 7 m a day as opposed to the average 4 miles it seemed their motivation for physical activity was genetic we all inherit genes from our parents that play a key role in the development of our brains and these genes can make some literally crave activity in fact the brains of the running mice had larger dopamine systems and regions that deal with motivation and reward they needed activity otherwise their brains would react similar to a drug addicted rodent when deprived of cocaine or nicotine they were genetically addicted to running we also inherit genes responsible for our other traits from impulsivity to procrastination to work ethic and straight up laziness and it turns out our physical laziness may be linked to a couch potato gene or rather a mutation in a normal Gene which regulates activity levels this Gene is responsible for a type of dopamine receptor without it you're more likely to prefer sitting around and simply doing less than those who have the properly functioning Gene so the truth is your desire for activity may not be entirely up to you but many environment mental factors are also at play which means you aren't doomed to a life of laziness although making a change will be harder for some knowledge is power so if you think you're genetically lazy get off the couch and fight your DNA your brain will reward you in the end need some help to get there check out our past video on the science of productivity which might help you improve your motivation and fight that laziness and if you'd like to learn more about the amazing science behind extraordinary athletic performance check out one of our favorite books the sports Gene by David Epstein which was a major source for this episode it's a great read and you can get a copy of it using the link in the description below and subscribe for more weekly science videos

**Transcript**:
Human history is intertwined with some of Earth’s mightiest species, but there is one graceful creature that rises above the
rest. Only when seen it in its ideal habitat, can
we truly appreciate this king among birds. Behold: the nobel pigeon.” If you think they’re only good for pooping
on statues, then think again. [OPENING MUSIC] In On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin
presented an idea that changed the world. He knew if he was right, this idea was gonna
turn science on its head, so in chapter 1, you know what he chose as his very first
example? It wasn’t the tortoises, or finches, or
even the giant fossil armadillos he found during his journeys. He chose pigeons. Over giant fossil armadillos. But he had a good reason, and if you think
otherwise, then you’ve never seen FANCY pigeons. These are the birds that got Darwin’s attention,
because underneath all that feathery fashion, is just one species, like dogs with wings
instead of rats with wings. All of that variation was tweaked from one
ancient mold. The wild rock dove. Thousands of years before they were eating
old hot dog buns out of the trash, these birds were found on seaside cliffs, but pretty much
as soon as cities sprung up, they moved in, because to a pigeon, a building is just
a cliff with better architecture. Pigeons are uniquely suited to city life,
but they were only able to conquer all of Earth’s urban areas because we brought them
there. Why? Because we liked feeding them… to ourselves. In fact, from Egypt to Rome to the early 20th
century, the main roles of a pigeon were dinner, or something for rich people to breed into
silly shapes. Over time here and there, a few of these domestic
birds escaped and returned to a “wild” life, they just never left the city. But for some reason along that journey, our opinion
of pigeons went from this… to this. Watch pigeons pecking at the sidewalk and
you’re not looking at the smartest birds in the tree. They can’t solve puzzles like crows. They can’t talk like parrots. A pigeon’s brain is only about the size
of that fingertip… but like most things in nature there’s more to the story. Most of their skull is eyeball: if they were
the size of humans, their eyes would be as big as grapefruits… Those huge eyes have five color receptors,
compared to our three, letting them see things we can’t imagine. One pigeon named Linus was trained to remember
nearly a thousand images. Pigeons can peck out a Monet from a Picasso,
they can even judge if a child’s drawing is good or bad. Pigeons can tell correctly spelled words among
misspelled words, As if they aren’t annoying enough.. They can even put groups of objects in numerical
order, which sounds easy because we’re smart, but pigeons do numbers as well as monkeys
do, Pigeon vision is the bomb. Literally. During WW II, psychologist B.F. Skinner tried
to turn these birds into weapons. He trained pigeons to keep an image centered
on a tiny screen by pecking at it. He hooked this up to a navigation system,
and then loaded it inside of a bomb. He wanted to create explosive missiles piloted
by kamikaze pigeons. He built several successful prototypes using
money from the General Mills cereal company… yes, the people who make Cheerios, but the
Army never let it get off the ground. Pigeon navigation goes a lot farther than
bird bombs. Just like /human/ city-dwellers, pigeons are
commuters, flying out in the morning to find food and coming back at night. They’re tightly bonded to their home, and
this instinct is so strong that we’ve used them as messengers for centuries, like Flapchat
instead of Snapchat. Before Paul Reuter founded a global news service,
he used pigeons to deliver news. During World War I and II, racing pigeons
with names like Cher Ami and GI Joe were given actual medals for delivering messages under
fire. How are pigeons so good at finding their way
home from places they’ve never been? Different experiments have found pigeons use
visual maps, Earth’s magnetic field, the angle of the sun, even smells to navigate. But when scientists knock each of these senses
out, some birds can still find their way home. What we do know is pigeons use a lot of senses,
maybe even some we don’t know about yet. Even though pigeons are everywhere, there’s
one thing you never seem to see: Baby pigeons. They do exist, and… they are ugly. But it’s a reminder that even a bird that’s
everywhere only gives us glimpses into its life. Darwin’s ideas about natural selection were
born on a voyage around the world. But you don’t have to go to exotic places
to have your mind blown by evolution’s awesomeness. Darwin knew that, and that’s why he picked
the pigeon to introduce the world to his theory. If you know where to look, wildlife is everywhere that
we are: just make sure if you look up to admire it, you keep your mouth closed. Stay curious. I want to thank our friends from BBC Earth
for helping us make this episode, because pigeons look awesome in slow-motion. Some of pigeons’ oldest enemies have followed
them to cities: birds of prey. These scientists are studying peregrine falcons
for Planet Earth II, the sequel to the groundbreaking BBC series. It’s part of “Cities”, an entire episode
dedicated to urban wildlife. Of course, birds of prey aren’t pigeons’
only urban predators. For Planet Earth II, the team filmed a pigeon
hunt you have to see to believe. You can find Planet Earth II on BBC One in
the UK and coming soon to BBC America. For more information, check out their website.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is related to the content of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the size of human eyeballs if they were comparable to pigeon eyeballs. The closest generated MCQ is Question 5, which mentions that a pigeon's brain has five color receptors, but it also mentions that "Most of their skull is eyeball" in the transcript. Although it does not directly ask about the size of human eyeballs, it is related to the unique feature of pigeon eyeballs.

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I must conclude that there is no exact match.

But if I had to choose the closest one, I would say Question 5 is the most similar, but with a significant difference in question intent and content.

Index: 5 (with a note that it's not an exact match)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, Question 5 does not ask about the size of a pigeon's brain. Instead, it asks about what is unique about a pigeon's brain compared to other birds.

A more relevant question would be one that asks about the size of a pigeon's brain. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content of the transcript, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible match based on the content of the transcript.

According to the transcript, "A pigeon's brain is only about the size of that fingertip…" This information is related to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is related to the content of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 5 is the closest, but it's not an exact match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: None (or 5, if you consider it as a related question)

**Transcript**:
Human history is intertwined with some of Earth’s mightiest species, but there is one graceful creature that rises above the
rest. Only when seen it in its ideal habitat, can
we truly appreciate this king among birds. Behold: the nobel pigeon.” If you think they’re only good for pooping
on statues, then think again. [OPENING MUSIC] In On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin
presented an idea that changed the world. He knew if he was right, this idea was gonna
turn science on its head, so in chapter 1, you know what he chose as his very first
example? It wasn’t the tortoises, or finches, or
even the giant fossil armadillos he found during his journeys. He chose pigeons. Over giant fossil armadillos. But he had a good reason, and if you think
otherwise, then you’ve never seen FANCY pigeons. These are the birds that got Darwin’s attention,
because underneath all that feathery fashion, is just one species, like dogs with wings
instead of rats with wings. All of that variation was tweaked from one
ancient mold. The wild rock dove. Thousands of years before they were eating
old hot dog buns out of the trash, these birds were found on seaside cliffs, but pretty much
as soon as cities sprung up, they moved in, because to a pigeon, a building is just
a cliff with better architecture. Pigeons are uniquely suited to city life,
but they were only able to conquer all of Earth’s urban areas because we brought them
there. Why? Because we liked feeding them… to ourselves. In fact, from Egypt to Rome to the early 20th
century, the main roles of a pigeon were dinner, or something for rich people to breed into
silly shapes. Over time here and there, a few of these domestic
birds escaped and returned to a “wild” life, they just never left the city. But for some reason along that journey, our opinion
of pigeons went from this… to this. Watch pigeons pecking at the sidewalk and
you’re not looking at the smartest birds in the tree. They can’t solve puzzles like crows. They can’t talk like parrots. A pigeon’s brain is only about the size
of that fingertip… but like most things in nature there’s more to the story. Most of their skull is eyeball: if they were
the size of humans, their eyes would be as big as grapefruits… Those huge eyes have five color receptors,
compared to our three, letting them see things we can’t imagine. One pigeon named Linus was trained to remember
nearly a thousand images. Pigeons can peck out a Monet from a Picasso,
they can even judge if a child’s drawing is good or bad. Pigeons can tell correctly spelled words among
misspelled words, As if they aren’t annoying enough.. They can even put groups of objects in numerical
order, which sounds easy because we’re smart, but pigeons do numbers as well as monkeys
do, Pigeon vision is the bomb. Literally. During WW II, psychologist B.F. Skinner tried
to turn these birds into weapons. He trained pigeons to keep an image centered
on a tiny screen by pecking at it. He hooked this up to a navigation system,
and then loaded it inside of a bomb. He wanted to create explosive missiles piloted
by kamikaze pigeons. He built several successful prototypes using
money from the General Mills cereal company… yes, the people who make Cheerios, but the
Army never let it get off the ground. Pigeon navigation goes a lot farther than
bird bombs. Just like /human/ city-dwellers, pigeons are
commuters, flying out in the morning to find food and coming back at night. They’re tightly bonded to their home, and
this instinct is so strong that we’ve used them as messengers for centuries, like Flapchat
instead of Snapchat. Before Paul Reuter founded a global news service,
he used pigeons to deliver news. During World War I and II, racing pigeons
with names like Cher Ami and GI Joe were given actual medals for delivering messages under
fire. How are pigeons so good at finding their way
home from places they’ve never been? Different experiments have found pigeons use
visual maps, Earth’s magnetic field, the angle of the sun, even smells to navigate. But when scientists knock each of these senses
out, some birds can still find their way home. What we do know is pigeons use a lot of senses,
maybe even some we don’t know about yet. Even though pigeons are everywhere, there’s
one thing you never seem to see: Baby pigeons. They do exist, and… they are ugly. But it’s a reminder that even a bird that’s
everywhere only gives us glimpses into its life. Darwin’s ideas about natural selection were
born on a voyage around the world. But you don’t have to go to exotic places
to have your mind blown by evolution’s awesomeness. Darwin knew that, and that’s why he picked
the pigeon to introduce the world to his theory. If you know where to look, wildlife is everywhere that
we are: just make sure if you look up to admire it, you keep your mouth closed. Stay curious. I want to thank our friends from BBC Earth
for helping us make this episode, because pigeons look awesome in slow-motion. Some of pigeons’ oldest enemies have followed
them to cities: birds of prey. These scientists are studying peregrine falcons
for Planet Earth II, the sequel to the groundbreaking BBC series. It’s part of “Cities”, an entire episode
dedicated to urban wildlife. Of course, birds of prey aren’t pigeons’
only urban predators. For Planet Earth II, the team filmed a pigeon
hunt you have to see to believe. You can find Planet Earth II on BBC One in
the UK and coming soon to BBC America. For more information, check out their website.

**Transcript**:
High over the water off the California coast,
riding the air on eight feet of wings, a brown pelican spots its target below. They have a pretty effective way to catch
that fish. First they take aim…bank left... Then dive downward at 40 miles an hour. Bulls-eye! But one mistake, and they could wind up with
a broken wing, a snapped neck, even blind. So how does this massive bird survive a 40-foot
drop onto rock-hard water? A big part of it is just good form. See how the wings shoot back right before
impact? That safeguards the delicate bones there. At the same instant, powerful muscles tense
around the spine, keeping the bird from snapping its neck. While sheaths called nictitating membranes slide over the eyes like a pair of swim goggles. But most of the credit goes to that magnificent,
sword-shaped bill. It’s contoured to slice into the surface
at high speed with almost no drag. Pelicans are surface hunters, not divers. When they hit the water, they also hit the
brakes, reaching with their necks to snag fish. They slow down thanks to a built-in life vest,
a special network of extra air sacs under the skin around their neck and belly, even
in their bones. When it plummets, the pelican takes a deep
breath and air rushes into those tiny caverns, called pneumatic foramina. That air cushions the impact and makes them
float. And this bird comes equipped with another
flotation device. Meet the gular pouch. See how it pops open, like a parachute? That also helps slow the bird down. It’s made of super-stretchy skin, re-enforced
with collagen fibers that keep it from breaking. Pretty handy fishing net, too, thanks to extra-flexible
jaw that can open sideways….not just up and down. A pelican’s pouch holds much more than its
belly can, about three gallons of water, which has to be squeezed out before the big gulp. The whole routine takes practice. These young ones have got some room for improvement. But pelicans have been making it work for
an incredibly long time. This fossil is 30 million years old, and it's
almost identical to the aerodynamic high-divers that you see living today. This pelican looks more red than brown, right? That’s a sign that it’s breeding season,
which for California pelicans, is in the winter. That’s when they get gussied up and head
south to Baja. Don’t miss a single Deep Look! Sign up for our newsletter to get a new video

**Transcript**:
High over the water off the California coast,
riding the air on eight feet of wings, a brown pelican spots its target below. They have a pretty effective way to catch
that fish. First they take aim…bank left... Then dive downward at 40 miles an hour. Bulls-eye! But one mistake, and they could wind up with
a broken wing, a snapped neck, even blind. So how does this massive bird survive a 40-foot
drop onto rock-hard water? A big part of it is just good form. See how the wings shoot back right before
impact? That safeguards the delicate bones there. At the same instant, powerful muscles tense
around the spine, keeping the bird from snapping its neck. While sheaths called nictitating membranes slide over the eyes like a pair of swim goggles. But most of the credit goes to that magnificent,
sword-shaped bill. It’s contoured to slice into the surface
at high speed with almost no drag. Pelicans are surface hunters, not divers. When they hit the water, they also hit the
brakes, reaching with their necks to snag fish. They slow down thanks to a built-in life vest,
a special network of extra air sacs under the skin around their neck and belly, even
in their bones. When it plummets, the pelican takes a deep
breath and air rushes into those tiny caverns, called pneumatic foramina. That air cushions the impact and makes them
float. And this bird comes equipped with another
flotation device. Meet the gular pouch. See how it pops open, like a parachute? That also helps slow the bird down. It’s made of super-stretchy skin, re-enforced
with collagen fibers that keep it from breaking. Pretty handy fishing net, too, thanks to extra-flexible
jaw that can open sideways….not just up and down. A pelican’s pouch holds much more than its
belly can, about three gallons of water, which has to be squeezed out before the big gulp. The whole routine takes practice. These young ones have got some room for improvement. But pelicans have been making it work for
an incredibly long time. This fossil is 30 million years old, and it's
almost identical to the aerodynamic high-divers that you see living today. This pelican looks more red than brown, right? That’s a sign that it’s breeding season,
which for California pelicans, is in the winter. That’s when they get gussied up and head
south to Baja. Don’t miss a single Deep Look! Sign up for our newsletter to get a new video

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: What is the name of the special pouch in the pelican's throat that helps slow it down during a dive? Options: A. Gular pouch, B. Built-in life vest, C. Flotation device, D. Pneumatic foramina.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only asks for the name of the pouch, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks for the function of the pouch. A more similar question would be one that asks about the function of the gular pouch.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 7: What is the main purpose of the pelican's pouch? Options: A. To catch fish, B. To slow down during a dive, C. To hold water, D. To regulate the pelican's body temperature, is also similar to the ground truth MCQ.

However, the most similar generated MCQ is not a perfect match. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 and Question 7 are both similar, but Question 7 is more similar in terms of the content and intent of the question.

But since Question 6 is more specific to the gular pouch, I will choose Question 6 as the most similar.

**Transcript**:
Whether you’re swimming or washing the dishes
or just taking nice, long, well-deserved bath --- if you’re immersed in water for longer
than 10 minutes, chances are your fingers and toes will emerge looking like raisins. So what’s up with the wrinkled digits? For years, scientists thought the phenomenon
was the result of a type of osmosis, caused by water passing into the dry outer layer
of skin. The influx of water, the thinking went, would
expand the skin’s surface area, but not the tissue below it, so the skin would bunch
up and wrinkle. But in 1935, a pair of doctors noticed that
this effect didn’t happen in their patients with nerve damage. One patient, for example, was a boy who had
lost the feeling in three of his fingers. The researchers found that, when his hand
got wet, the fingers that he could feel wrinkled as normal, but the ones that were numb remained
smooth. It turned out that pruney digits weren’t
caused just by the passive flow of water through the skin -- it was an active response of the
nervous system to prolonged moisture. The nervous system causes the wrinkling by
constricting blood vessels below the skin, which causes the upper layers of skin to pucker. Since the phenomenon is caused by an involuntary
nerve response, some biologists have thought that it must have some evolutionary function. But what possible purpose could it serve? One recent theory suggests that wrinkly skin
may have given our ancestors a better grip while working in wet conditions -- like gathering
food from a stream or damp vegetation. And it may also have given us better footing
while walking across slippery landscapes in the rain. In a 2013 study, evolutionary biologists tested
this theory by asking subjects with either wrinkly and non-wrinkly fingers to pick up
a variety of wet and dry objects, like marbles. They found that the subjects with wrinkly
digits picked up the wet objects 12 percent faster than their counterparts. But there was no difference when it came to
picking up dry objects. The wrinkles apparently helped channel the
water away, much like the treads on your car’s tires. But then this raises the question: If wrinkly
skin gives us a better grip, then why isn’t our skin wrinkly ALL of the time? Well, maybe because shriveled fingers and
toes are less sensitive, which is no advantage at all. Thanks for asking! And if you’d like to submit questions for

**Transcript**:
It seems natural to most of us that we
shouldn't burp loudly in front of strangers, touch their behinds without
permission or spit in the face of those who annoy us but history shows us a
different story. What we might take to be normal impulses
to be modest, restrained and dignified are the hard-won fruits of a long and always
unsteady civilizing process. Human beings have gradually and
painfully learned to tame the beast inside for the sake of propriety and
kindness. At a moment in time when some people question manners and the pressures they impose on us, it can be fruitful to look back in time
in order to trace key moments in the history of manners and to search their
by for the future of manners. 13,000 BC, Gough's Cave, Somerset, England W're in a cave in what's known as The Magdalenian period, one of the later cultures of the Upper
Paleolithic Age in Western Europe. Our ancestors have learned to use harpoons made of bone antlers. They've domesticated dogs and in their
spare time have developed a taste for making remarkable images of the fiercest
wildlife around them especially hyena reindeer and mammoths. We look a little different from the way we do now: our bodies are generally heavier and
more solid with strong musculature and straight foreheads with only slight brow
ridges and prominent chins. Our manners would surprise us to: we sleep around a lot and openly. There is a lot of what we now call
rape. We do everything in front of one another in our caves and most strikingly
we have an occasional habit of eating our human enemies. Following a squabble the leader of a
group will take an enemy severed head carefully remove the brains and tissues
and prepare the skull for use as a ceremonial drinking vessel. Primitive humans don't do manners. Circus Maximus, Rome, 20 AD We are at one of the high points
of ancient civilization in the West. In many areas of daily life we won't have this many manners and complex etiquette for another 1400 years
at least. We're taking fascinating care to tame nature within us. For the wealthy ones among us at least we've taken to having at least a bath a week, to removing nasal hair, ? tailing displays of violence, to policing the way men behave towards women, to carving chicken and fish and brushing our teeth a lot, conscious of our bad breath and its effect on the
sensitivities of others. However, with little knowledge of odontology Romans use a variety of somewhat random ingredients for toothpaste: crushed bone and oyster shell is popular, horse urine is another favorite especially from Iberian breeds. The specifics of the Roman approach to oral hygiene may be questionable but the mentality is advanced and fascinating. Good personal appearance and cleanliness are believed to be what set Romans apart in their minds from what they term the
Barbaria: the people who live north of the famous olive line, the line above which the noble olive tree will not grow, the Germanics and Celts among them. Humanity will have to wait a while until
Charlemagne is next recorded as brushing his teeth with thyme. Poitiers, France, 1152 French Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine marries Henry II of England at her court in the South of France. She employs a poet, the troubadour Bernart de Ventadorn to compose songs of love for her and her husband. This sounds merely romantic but the
songs are not simple sentimentality. They are part of Eleanor's subtle
attempt to civilize her husband and the men around him by putting into verse how a good man should treat his lady. She and her ladies-in-waiting learn to use poetry to set expectations of how military men should act around women. Slowly thanks in part to Eleanor and
attitude known as chivalry develops in the courts of Europe: an idea that men
need to moderate their force and sexual impulses to protect what is termed the
honor and dignity of women. Eleanor of Aquitaine is making an early
highly coded call from ?? to what we would nowadays more bluntly term sexual harassment. London, England, 1209 The Book of the Civilized Man is published by Daniel of Beccles. It's a poem written in Latin that explains how to act with courtesy
and decorum in social situations. It advises for example if you wish to
belch remember to look up to the ceiling, do not attack your enemy while he is
squatting to defecate, never pest a lady or look too closely at their dress. Don't mount your horse in the hole and
in front of grandees do not openly excavate your nostril by twisting your
fingers. Slowly the aristocracy is becoming more self-aware about its conduct in social circumstances. In particular, men are being asked to behave with more decorum around women and as an ever-increasing sensor of picking one's
nose in public. Murano, Venice 1450 A new kind of tableware, the Venetian glass goblet or flute takes Europe by storm, under the direction of the Venetian
master glass-maker Angelo Barovier. On the island of Murano, some 3,000 glass blowers are sating demand for a new highly delicate and ornamented kind of glass. Part of the reason for the demand is that the glasses are extremely easy to break. Any slightly rough handling of them and they shatter like a dry autumn leaf. The Venetian drinking glass is not fragile because of a deficiency or by mistake; it's not as if its maker was trying to
make it tough and hardy and then stupidly ended up with something a child could snap. It is fragile and easily harmed as the consequence of a deliberate search for extreme delicacy. The underlying thesis is that it's the
duty of civilization to create environments where it's okay to be fragile. It's obvious the glass could easily be
smashed so it forces people especially men to use their fingers very tenderly. It teaches people that moderation is
admirable and elegant not just a tedious demand. It tells us that being careful is
glamorous and exciting even fashionable. It's a moral tale about gentleness told
by means of a drinking vessel. The Venetian glass makes a big claim: being mannered and civilized involves being aware of the effect of one's strength on others. Marseille, France, 1533 14-year-old Catherine de' Medici marries the future Henry II of France. Her home city of Florence is by now the epicenter of culture in the Western world. And she brings with her new culinary fashions that quickly become all the rage:
macaroons, gelato and most significantly a collection of forks. The fork adds a bizarre complication to
the rituals of eating dinner: instead of using our fingers which are ideally made for tearing meat off the bone fast, we'll slow down on purpose and may use the strange new instrument so as to temper and guide our appetite. The fork quickly spreads around Europe, by 1600 no European court is without a large set of forks. This marks out the savages from the
civilized. Marais, Paris, 1750 A Swiss philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau publishes an extraordinary essay: "A Discourse on the Arts and Sciences". What makes it so revolutionary and such a milestone in the history of manners is that for the first time in Western
culture an author sticks up for the so called "un-mannered savage". For the guys who would have ? not brush their teeth, never employed a fork and had a lot of nasal hair, but whom Russo now contrast favorably with modern mannered
people. Rousseau tells us that people living in
what he calls the state of nature were in his eyes far superior to educated and mannered Parisians. Their manners may have been simple but they were honest and
forthright without the sins of what he now terms the "over-civilized". Russa retells the story of civilization as one of loss and decline, from a primordial state of fresh-faced curiosity, honesty and enthusiasm to barbarous over
politeness, fakery and deceit. He describes the elaborate French
court Versay as less civilized than an early human cave. Readers across Europe are astonished and not a little impressed by this impudence. For hundreds of years moralists have been arguing that our natural selves are wild, harmful, over-sexual and dangerous and that we must
learn to a tame them for the sake of others. Now Russo suggest the diametrical
opposite: civilization has gone too far, it's our mannered selves that have become the problem, and the task of a properly evolved civilization is to throw off the
chains of manners, to relax us, strip off the etiquette and return to primitive
frankness. Russo's point continues to echo down to our own times. It is his voice we
can here whenever someone sticks up for the simpler life and suggest we dress
less formally, eat dinner more casually and more readily say whatever is passing through our minds. New York, United States, 1827 A French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville is on a tour of the young United States, in an effort to understand the spirit of a new kind of society: A democracy. He is immediately struck by American
manners or lack thereof. In Europe, reflects de Tocqueville manners have been codified to emphasize hierarchical differences between people. Ordinary people defer to aristocrats, aristocrats to royalty and so on but in
the United States everything is done so as to suggest that there are no differences between people. No one takes off their hat to anyone, a
postman can casually greet a judge, a mule driver can strike up cheerful banter
with a wealthy merchant, and one can not tell by someone's clothes whether they
might be living in a mansion or a hut. Expressions like "how you doing" and "hi" are heard everywhere across the new republic. It could be charming but the
aristocratic de Tocqueville wryly notes a problem: these casual
manners do not do away with class and wealth
differences, they merely sentimentally disguise them. The manners of old Europe
have been accused of being cruel in their stress on hierarchy but now
de Tocqueville  accuses American casual democratic manners of their own kind of cruelty: because they pretend that everyone is in the same boat when clearly they're not really. At least in old Europe everyone knew who the king and the aristocrats were, adds de Tocqueville. Now the casual manners teach everyone to think of themselves as alike and encourage them to dream of making it to the top of the pile. But when society remains very unequal
and opportunities for genuine advancement and not as widespread as is
thought then bitterness and a sense of failure are likely to be the result to
de Tocqueville ? notes. Casual manners can be their own form of
fakery. Northern Ireland, June 2013 At a meeting of the G8
developed countries a few eyebrows are raised when some of the most powerful
men in the world including Barrack Obama of the United States David Cameron of the United Kingdom and François Hollande of France all appear at a press conference without ties. The men also hug and in some cases high-five each other during the course
of the summit. The absence of ties is an inadvertent and continuing tribute to Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Ties have been deemed a symbol of oppression and hierarchy by the people who control the nuclear codes and direct the world economy. Between 1996 and 2008 sales of ties in the U.S halved. In the UK, the Tirerack company, for 20 years the country's biggest seller of ties goes into administration in late 2014. By early 2015 in The United States only 18 percent of male employees regularly wear a tie to work. One-third show up in jeans at least once a week. Southwark Crown Court, London, September 2014 Eleanor of Aquitaine's long campaign to civilized men reaches a new milestone: A minor British DJ Dave Lee Travis is
found guilty of indecently assaulting a woman two decades earlier. He is accused by a judge of having
displayed primitive behavior when he groped a young female employees breasts at his radio offices. Patting bottoms, eyeing breasts and throwing out leary comments is now deemed deeply anachronistic and vile manners. Dave Lee Travis, a 69 year old father of two is roundly punished and humiliated for his actions. Travis is in a long line of men who in
the early 21st century are called to account for their behavior towards women. They are puzzled and at a certain level
incensed by this. They had come of age in a period when Victorian manners towards women were on the retreat seen as outdated and
hypocritical. These men had believed in messages about casualness and sexual
liberation but it seems they had fatally misinterpreted what a world with a few
less sexual manners would actually be like. Slowly society is learning to re-heed some of the basic lessons of Victorian etiquette books always stressed: That men must be
careful around women, that they must never touch or look at them
inappropriately and that the overwhelming priority is never to cause
anyone else discomfort through one's advances. Men like Dave Lee Travis are
judged to be pathological and sexual predators. Looked at through a longer lens
they could also simply be accused of having forgotten their manners. The history of manners shows an ongoing
search for the best way to be kind. For long periods, it seemed that being mannered had to be about hiding and moderating the inner self which was associated with something beastly and cruel. Then under the
influence of Rousseau and the Romantic philosophy to which he gave birth good manners were associated with being
natural and free, letting out the inner self which was deemed to be good and
spontaneously kind. But we have come to learn that there are in fact limitations
to the natural approach. There is unwitting cruelty and political
subterfuge in the defense of natural manners which suggests we're all equal
when we're not which allow one gender to pester another. there's a fine line between being natural about things and being bothersome to others. Aline we are continuing to explore often at great cost to all concerned. There are no doubt many behaviors which many of us
subscribe to now which a later age may come to see is no less vulgar than
Catherine de Medici found a meal without a fork. The aspiration to be well-mannered
shouldn't be seen as pretentious or fake. It should be generously
interpreted as always belonging to a highly important wish not to cause other
people distress through one's impulses and needs. The history of manners goes on.

**Transcript**:
It seems natural to most of us that we
shouldn't burp loudly in front of strangers, touch their behinds without
permission or spit in the face of those who annoy us but history shows us a
different story. What we might take to be normal impulses
to be modest, restrained and dignified are the hard-won fruits of a long and always
unsteady civilizing process. Human beings have gradually and
painfully learned to tame the beast inside for the sake of propriety and
kindness. At a moment in time when some people question manners and the pressures they impose on us, it can be fruitful to look back in time
in order to trace key moments in the history of manners and to search their
by for the future of manners. 13,000 BC, Gough's Cave, Somerset, England W're in a cave in what's known as The Magdalenian period, one of the later cultures of the Upper
Paleolithic Age in Western Europe. Our ancestors have learned to use harpoons made of bone antlers. They've domesticated dogs and in their
spare time have developed a taste for making remarkable images of the fiercest
wildlife around them especially hyena reindeer and mammoths. We look a little different from the way we do now: our bodies are generally heavier and
more solid with strong musculature and straight foreheads with only slight brow
ridges and prominent chins. Our manners would surprise us to: we sleep around a lot and openly. There is a lot of what we now call
rape. We do everything in front of one another in our caves and most strikingly
we have an occasional habit of eating our human enemies. Following a squabble the leader of a
group will take an enemy severed head carefully remove the brains and tissues
and prepare the skull for use as a ceremonial drinking vessel. Primitive humans don't do manners. Circus Maximus, Rome, 20 AD We are at one of the high points
of ancient civilization in the West. In many areas of daily life we won't have this many manners and complex etiquette for another 1400 years
at least. We're taking fascinating care to tame nature within us. For the wealthy ones among us at least we've taken to having at least a bath a week, to removing nasal hair, ? tailing displays of violence, to policing the way men behave towards women, to carving chicken and fish and brushing our teeth a lot, conscious of our bad breath and its effect on the
sensitivities of others. However, with little knowledge of odontology Romans use a variety of somewhat random ingredients for toothpaste: crushed bone and oyster shell is popular, horse urine is another favorite especially from Iberian breeds. The specifics of the Roman approach to oral hygiene may be questionable but the mentality is advanced and fascinating. Good personal appearance and cleanliness are believed to be what set Romans apart in their minds from what they term the
Barbaria: the people who live north of the famous olive line, the line above which the noble olive tree will not grow, the Germanics and Celts among them. Humanity will have to wait a while until
Charlemagne is next recorded as brushing his teeth with thyme. Poitiers, France, 1152 French Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine marries Henry II of England at her court in the South of France. She employs a poet, the troubadour Bernart de Ventadorn to compose songs of love for her and her husband. This sounds merely romantic but the
songs are not simple sentimentality. They are part of Eleanor's subtle
attempt to civilize her husband and the men around him by putting into verse how a good man should treat his lady. She and her ladies-in-waiting learn to use poetry to set expectations of how military men should act around women. Slowly thanks in part to Eleanor and
attitude known as chivalry develops in the courts of Europe: an idea that men
need to moderate their force and sexual impulses to protect what is termed the
honor and dignity of women. Eleanor of Aquitaine is making an early
highly coded call from ?? to what we would nowadays more bluntly term sexual harassment. London, England, 1209 The Book of the Civilized Man is published by Daniel of Beccles. It's a poem written in Latin that explains how to act with courtesy
and decorum in social situations. It advises for example if you wish to
belch remember to look up to the ceiling, do not attack your enemy while he is
squatting to defecate, never pest a lady or look too closely at their dress. Don't mount your horse in the hole and
in front of grandees do not openly excavate your nostril by twisting your
fingers. Slowly the aristocracy is becoming more self-aware about its conduct in social circumstances. In particular, men are being asked to behave with more decorum around women and as an ever-increasing sensor of picking one's
nose in public. Murano, Venice 1450 A new kind of tableware, the Venetian glass goblet or flute takes Europe by storm, under the direction of the Venetian
master glass-maker Angelo Barovier. On the island of Murano, some 3,000 glass blowers are sating demand for a new highly delicate and ornamented kind of glass. Part of the reason for the demand is that the glasses are extremely easy to break. Any slightly rough handling of them and they shatter like a dry autumn leaf. The Venetian drinking glass is not fragile because of a deficiency or by mistake; it's not as if its maker was trying to
make it tough and hardy and then stupidly ended up with something a child could snap. It is fragile and easily harmed as the consequence of a deliberate search for extreme delicacy. The underlying thesis is that it's the
duty of civilization to create environments where it's okay to be fragile. It's obvious the glass could easily be
smashed so it forces people especially men to use their fingers very tenderly. It teaches people that moderation is

You know that the best way to prevent the
spread of coronavirus is to wash your hands. Wash your hands, doo doo, doo doo, doo doo. Wash your hands! But … why? It’s because soap — regular soap, fancy
honeysuckle soap, artisan peppermint soap, just any soap — absolutely annihilates viruses
like the coronavirus. Here’s how. This is what a virus, like coronavirus, looks
like. It’s a bit of material surrounded by a coating
of proteins — and fat. Viruses easily stick to places like your hands,
but when you rinse your hands with just water, it rushes right over the virus. That’s because that layer of fat makes the
virus behave kind of like a drop of oil. You can see it happening in this demonstration. Oils are just liquid fats. What happens when you pour oil into water? It floats — it doesn’t mix. But add soap… And suddenly that fatty oil dissolves into
the water. That’s because inside, soap has two-sided
molecules. One end of the molecule is attracted to water,
the other end to fat. So when the soap molecules come in contact
with water and fat, these dual attractions literally pull the fat apart, surrounding
the oil particles and dispersing them through the water.   Let’s go back to our coronavirus molecule. With that layer of fat holding everything
together. When it interacts with soap … bam! The fat gets pulled out by the soap. Soap literally pulls apart and demolishes
these viruses. And then the water rinses the harmless, leftover
shards of virus down the drain. But, and you know where I'm going with this, it takes time for this effect to happen. 20 seconds, to be specific. To show why, we ordered this lotion that mimics
viruses and their fatty layers. It glows under a UV light. If you just rinse your hands under regular
water … nothing comes off. If you wash for just 5 seconds or 10 seconds,
your hands are still covered. The virus is still here, able to get you and
others sick. But 20 full seconds: Now the soap is actually
destroying the virus. Hand sanitizer works too, because it’s mostly
alcohol, and alcohol works in a somewhat similar way to soap, breaking down that fatty layer. You need a high concentration of alcohol to
make that work. The CDC recommends hand sanitizers with at
least 60% alcohol. But even with 60% alcohol, the CDC recommends
using soap if you can. If your hands are sweaty or dirty when you
use the sanitizer, that can dilute it and diminish its effectiveness. As for soap, just any old soap works. You don’t need soap marketed as antibacterial,
even. The FDA says skip it — there’s no proof

**Transcript**:
You know that the best way to prevent the
spread of coronavirus is to wash your hands. Wash your hands, doo doo, doo doo, doo doo. Wash your hands! But … why? It’s because soap — regular soap, fancy
honeysuckle soap, artisan peppermint soap, just any soap — absolutely annihilates viruses
like the coronavirus. Here’s how. This is what a virus, like coronavirus, looks
like. It’s a bit of material surrounded by a coating
of proteins — and fat. Viruses easily stick to places like your hands,
but when you rinse your hands with just water, it rushes right over the virus. That’s because that layer of fat makes the
virus behave kind of like a drop of oil. You can see it happening in this demonstration. Oils are just liquid fats. What happens when you pour oil into water? It floats — it doesn’t mix. But add soap… And suddenly that fatty oil dissolves into
the water. That’s because inside, soap has two-sided
molecules. One end of the molecule is attracted to water,
the other end to fat. So when the soap molecules come in contact
with water and fat, these dual attractions literally pull the fat apart, surrounding
the oil particles and dispersing them through the water.   Let’s go back to our coronavirus molecule. With that layer of fat holding everything
together. When it interacts with soap … bam! The fat gets pulled out by the soap. Soap literally pulls apart and demolishes
these viruses. And then the water rinses the harmless, leftover
shards of virus down the drain. But, and you know where I'm going with this, it takes time for this effect to happen. 20 seconds, to be specific. To show why, we ordered this lotion that mimics
viruses and their fatty layers. It glows under a UV light. If you just rinse your hands under regular
water … nothing comes off. If you wash for just 5 seconds or 10 seconds,
your hands are still covered. The virus is still here, able to get you and
others sick. But 20 full seconds: Now the soap is actually
destroying the virus. Hand sanitizer works too, because it’s mostly
alcohol, and alcohol works in a somewhat similar way to soap, breaking down that fatty layer. You need a high concentration of alcohol to
make that work. The CDC recommends hand sanitizers with at
least 60% alcohol. But even with 60% alcohol, the CDC recommends
using soap if you can. If your hands are sweaty or dirty when you
use the sanitizer, that can dilute it and diminish its effectiveness. As for soap, just any old soap works. You don’t need soap marketed as antibacterial,
even. The FDA says skip it — there’s no proof
it is any more effective. Just be sure to wash your hands. For 20 seconds. That’s “Happy Birthday” twice. Or the chorus to Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts.” Or Prince. Or Eminem. Or even Dolly. Just as long as it’s 20 seconds. And you’re using the ultimate virus annihilator:

Okay, humans, we make a lot of garbage, and we don't have any perfect solutions for what to do with it. So, instead of just putting it under the ground, why don't we just throw it into the volcanoes? Well, as convenient as burning our trash into oblivion might sound, a couple of major reasons to consider. For one thing sending all that trash to the nearest active Volcano could get pretty expensive, especially because lots of places are thousands of kilometers away from a volcano while most cities send their trash tens or hundreds of kilometres to landfills. Some cities also burn a lot of their trash in incineration plants and use that heat to make electricity, so electric bills could go up if we started using volcanoes instead. But different places already handle trash differently, so why don't cities near volcanoes just use them as big flaming trash piles? Well, cost isn't the only problem here. Volcanoes aren't usually the bubbling pits of exposed lava that you see in movies and cartoons. Many volcanoes just look like mountains or hills with a crater near the top and if the craters are filled with anything, liquid water is more common than a lava lake. So you would have to wait for those kinds of volcanoes to erupt and then drop your trash in, which is incredibly dangerous; lots of those eruptions can be pretty violent. Or you can try to drill down into a Volcano's magma chamber, where the Molten rock sits under lots of pressure until eruption. Given how hard it is to predict what exactly will flip a volcano's switch, drilling down into that super pressurized chamber or shooting trash into the magma probably aren't great ideas either. Other kinds of volcanoes like Kilauea in Hawaii have pretty constant calm lava flows. But even though slow-moving lava might seem like a safer and easier way to get rid of garbage, there is another big issue. Clumps of organic matter like food scraps don't just burn when they hit lava, they explode. Very sadly there is little research into why these explosions happen, but there are plenty of experiments and YouTube videos that show pretty clearly that they do, which does not mean that you should, like, give it a try for fun. The most likely explanation is that any water in the trash immediately boils when it hits some thousand-degree molten lava. That steam expands, forcing the trash and lava out of the way to create an explosive fountain of molten rock. But we don't know for sure, so get on it science! What we do know is that with your average american generating a couple of kilograms of trash a day, that would be a lot of exploding lava. Not to mention the stuff that probably wouldn't explode, like plastic, tends to give off dangerous fumes when burned, which is a whole other problem. So even if you live near an active volcano and even if there's lava at the surface and even if it sounds kind of cool, don't use it as your garbage disposal. A controlled science experiment or two may be fine but tons of trash creating noxious lava fountains, not so much. Thanks to our Patreon patrons for asking. If you would like to learn more about trash, you can check out our video on how we dealt with it over time a hundred percent without volcanoes. *SciShow Jingle*

like if it suddenly proposed. Yeah, I hate it too. Let’s play it again: Now of course, that’s not a real monkey, it’s
a computer simulation that was part of a study on monkey vocal tracts.
And what it shows is that monkeys have a strikingly similar vocal structure to humans. But despite all these similarities, they can’t
speak So here’s a question.
Compared to monkeys, birds are nothing like us. Yet this bird’s talking to me right now. How? Birds don’t have lips. They don’t have
teeth, their “nose” is totally different from
ours, but they do have something we don’t. They actually have a different
kind of voice box than we do. It's called a syrinx. This is Mya Thompson – She studies birds
at Cornell University. They actually have two independent voice boxes. In birds, and in humans, the lower respiratory system is shaped sort of like an upside down
slingshot. The top part is the trachea, or windpipe, the bottom part is the lungs, and
these two pieces move air in and out. In humans, the voice box is called the larynx,
and it’s located above the trachea. It contains vocal “folds” that vibrate when air flows
through to produce sound. And humans primarily shape that sound with
their mouths. But in birds, the voice box is called the
"syrinx". And it’s at the bottom of the trachea. Instead of just sending air through vocal
folds like we do, birds actually control the muscles on the walls of the syrinx to shape
and produce sound. Take a look at this cardinal as it sings. You can actually see that the noise comes
directly from the chest. The bird extends and shortens its neck and opens or closes its
beak to refine the noise, but most of the control is actually happening in the syrinx. It’s a powerful sound for such a small animal,
but that’s not even the most impressive part: Cardinals tend to make these "whoop" notes and they go by very very quickly. They're
able to produce more pitches than a piano in less than a tenth of a second. They're actually switching from
one side of the syrinx to another seamlessly to make this very very incredible span of
pitches. The syrinx also lets some birds replicate
sounds with astonishing accuracy. For example, BBC Wildlife caught a lyrebird
perfectly imitating a camera in the wild And of course, some of them imitate us. Parrots are born communicators. From the start
their brains are wired for speech. So when they're first hatched they're learning right away and they're learning from
everything around them. But speaking human is no easy feat. We’ve got our vowels
A - E - I - O - U. Our plosives
“Pocket”. And a variety of consonants – that we
even sometimes struggle to enunciate clearly So to pull off such clarity in human speech, parrots
really show off their ability to manipulate their vocal tract.
Plosives, for example, require using our lips. To make up for the lack of lips, parrots use something called esophageal speech – it's almost
like burping that comes from within the trachea. The force of air replicates the plosive. As for vowels, where we use our lips, tongue and jaw,
researchers have found that parrots move their tongues forward and backward and adjust their
beak opening to alter the sound. It seems like they are the only
birds that are actually using their tongue like humans do to shape the sound that's coming
out. Parrots have a natural desire to communicate.
In the wild they form strong bonds with their flocks, but in captivity, the parrot forms a social bond with you and they want to communicate with you and
they have the vocal anatomy to start mimicking you. When parrots live with us, we’re their flock and they’re determined to sing our song. So in this video I showed you some of the physiology that lets birds produce sounds. But I wanted a quick and easy way to show you some of the interesting background research on the neurology that allows some of them to speak. So I created a website with Wix, where I've compiled a bunch of extras, including research and related content that gets you inside the brains of these animals. It's a super easy way to make a website, so click on the link below to make your own. Wix doesn't directly impact editorial, but their support does make videos like this one possible, so go check them out.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar in terms of question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the shape of the lower respiratory system in humans and birds. The correct answer is "Upside down slingshot".

Among the generated MCQs, none of them directly ask about the shape of the lower respiratory system. However, Question 9 mentions the syrinx and how birds control the muscles on its walls to shape and produce sound. It also mentions extending and shortening the neck, which is related to the anatomy of the respiratory system.

Although Question 9 is not a direct match, it is the closest one in terms of content and intent. Therefore, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is:

 Question 9: How do birds control the muscles on the walls of the syrinx to shape and produce sound? Options: A. By using their beak, B. By using their tongue, C. By extending and shortening their neck, D. By opening and closing their beak 

However, please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be needed to directly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In December 2019 the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities. In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days. This virus is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 that causes the disease called Covid-19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus. What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do? [Intro Music] A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins, arguably not even a living thing. It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell. Corona may spread via surfaces, but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them. Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection when people cough, or if you touch someone who's ill and then your face, say rubbing your eyes or nose. The virus starts its journey here, and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into the body Its destinations are the intestines, the spleen or the lungs, where it can have the most dramatic effect. Even just a few corona viruses can cause quite a dramatic situation. The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells. These are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa waiting to be infected. Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victim's membranes to inject its genetic material. The cell, ignorant of what's happening, executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple: copy and reassemble. It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical point and receives one final order, self-destruct. The cell sort of melts away, releasing new corona particles ready to attack more cells. The number of infected cells grows exponentially After about 10 days, millions of body cells are infected, and billions of viruses swarmed the lungs. The virus has not caused too much damage yet, but corona is now going to release a real beast on you, your own immune system. The immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself and needs tight regulation. And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, Corona infects some of them and creates confusion. Cells have neither ears nor eyes. They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines. Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them. Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder. In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage. Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc. First, neutrophils, which are great at killing stuff, including our cells. As they arrive in their thousands, they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends as enemies. The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T-cells, which usually order infected cells to commit controlled suicide. Confused as they are, they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too. The more and more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy lung tissue they kill. This might get so bad that it can cause permanent irreversible damage, that leads to lifelong disabilities. In most cases, the immune system slowly regains control. It kills the infected cells, intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones and cleans up the battlefield. Recovery begins. The majority of people infected by Corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms. But many cases become severe or even critical. We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified, but it's safe to say that there is a lot more than with the flu. In more severe cases, Millions of epithelial cells have died and with them, the lungs' protective lining is gone. That means that the alveoli - tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs - can be infected by bacteria that aren't usually a big problem. Patients get pneumonia. Respiration becomes hard or even fails, and patients need ventilators to survive. The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons. And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply, it is overwhelmed. They enter the blood and overrun the body; if this happens, death is very likely. The Corona virus is often compared to the flu, but actually, it's much more dangerous. While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic, we know for sure that it's much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu. There are two futures for a pandemic like Corona: fast and slow. Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak. A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives; a slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books. The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection because there are no counter measures in place to slow it down. Why is this so bad? In a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time. If the numbers get too large, health care systems become unable to handle it. There aren't enough resources, like medical staff or equipment like ventilators, left to help everybody. People will die untreated. And as more health care workers get sick themselves, the capacity of health care systems falls even further. If this becomes the case, then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live and who doesn't. The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario. To avoid this, the world - that means all of us - needs to do what it can to turn this into a slow pandemic. A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses. Especially in the early phase, so that everyone who gets sick can get treatment and there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals. Since we don't have a vaccine for Corona, we have to socially engineer our behaviour, to act like a social vaccine. This simply means two things: 1. Not getting infected; and 2. Not infecting others. Although it sounds trivial, the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands. The soap is actually a powerful tool. The corona virus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat; soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you. It also makes your hands slippery, and with the mechanical motions of washing, viruses are ripped away. To do it properly, wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapeños and want to put in your contact lenses next. The next thing is social distancing, which is not a nice experience, but a nice thing to do. This means: no hugging, no handshakes. If you can stay at home, stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function: from doctors to cashiers, or police officers;. You depend on all of them; they all depend on you to not get sick. On a larger level, there are quarantines, which can mean different things, from travel restrictions or actual orders to stay at home. Quarantines are not great to experience and certainly not popular. But they buy us - and specially the researchers working on medication and vaccinations - crucial time So if you are put under quarantine, you should understand why, and respect it. None of this is fun. But looking at the big picture, it is a really small price to pay. The question of how pandemics end, depends on how they start; if they start fast with a steep slope, they end badly. If they start slow, with a not-so-steep slope, they end okay-ish. And, in this day and age, it really is in all of our hands. Literally, and figuratively. A huge thanks to the experts who helped us on short notice with this video, specially Our World In Data, the online publication for research and data on the world's largest problems and how to make progress solving them.

Especially in the early phase, so that everyone who gets sick can get treatment and there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals. Since we don't have a vaccine for Corona, we have to socially engineer our behaviour, to act like a social vaccine. This simply means two things: 1. Not getting infected; and 2. Not infecting others. Although it sounds trivial, the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands. The soap is actually a powerful tool. The corona virus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat; soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you. It also makes your hands slippery, and with the mechanical motions of washing, viruses are ripped away. To do it properly, wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapeños and want to put in your contact lenses next. The next thing is social distancing, which is not a nice experience, but a nice thing to do. This means: no hugging, no handshakes. If you can stay at home, stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function: from doctors to cashiers, or police officers;. You depend on all of them; they all depend on you to not get sick. On a larger level, there are quarantines, which can mean different things, from travel restrictions or actual orders to stay at home. Quarantines are not great to experience and certainly not popular. But they buy us - and specially the researchers working on medication and vaccinations - crucial time So if you are put under quarantine, you should understand why, and respect it. None of this is fun. But looking at the big picture, it is a really small price to pay. The question of how pandemics end, depends on how they start; if they start fast with a steep slope, they end badly. If they start slow, with a not-so-steep slope, they end okay-ish. And, in this day and age, it really is in all of our hands. Literally, and figuratively.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest that Question 2: "What happens when a cell is infected by the Corona virus?" is the closest match.

The correct option for Question 2 is not explicitly "A virus can only make more of itself by entering a living cell," but option C states, "The cell copies and reassembles the virus, leading to an exponential growth of infected cells," which is a consequence of the fact that a virus can only make more of itself by entering a living cell.

However, if I had to choose an index from the provided options, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: **2**

Please note that the generated MCQs do not have an exact match for the ground truth MCQ, and the suggested index is based on the closest match in terms of content and intent.

**Transcript**:
In December 2019 the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities. In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days. This virus is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 that causes the disease called Covid-19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus. What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do? [Intro Music] A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins, arguably not even a living thing. It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell. Corona may spread via surfaces, but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them. Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection when people cough, or if you touch someone who's ill and then your face, say rubbing your eyes or nose. The virus starts its journey here, and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into the body Its destinations are the intestines, the spleen or the lungs, where it can have the most dramatic effect. Even just a few corona viruses can cause quite a dramatic situation. The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells. These are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa waiting to be infected. Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victim's membranes to inject its genetic material. The cell, ignorant of what's happening, executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple: copy and reassemble. It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical point and receives one final order, self-destruct. The cell sort of melts away, releasing new corona particles ready to attack more cells. The number of infected cells grows exponentially After about 10 days, millions of body cells are infected, and billions of viruses swarmed the lungs. The virus has not caused too much damage yet, but corona is now going to release a real beast on you, your own immune system. The immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself and needs tight regulation. And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, Corona infects some of them and creates confusion. Cells have neither ears nor eyes. They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines. Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them. Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder. In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage. Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc. First, neutrophils, which are great at killing stuff, including our cells. As they arrive in their thousands, they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends as enemies. The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T-cells, which usually order infected cells to commit controlled suicide. Confused as they are, they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too. The more and more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy lung tissue they kill. This might get so bad that it can cause permanent irreversible damage, that leads to lifelong disabilities. In most cases, the immune system slowly regains control. It kills the infected cells, intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones and cleans up the battlefield. Recovery begins. The majority of people infected by Corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms. But many cases become severe or even critical. We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified, but it's safe to say that there is a lot more than with the flu. In more severe cases, Millions of epithelial cells have died and with them, the lungs' protective lining is gone. That means that the alveoli - tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs - can be infected by bacteria that aren't usually a big problem. Patients get pneumonia. Respiration becomes hard or even fails, and patients need ventilators to survive. The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons. And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply, it is overwhelmed. They enter the blood and overrun the body; if this happens, death is very likely. The Corona virus is often compared to the flu, but actually, it's much more dangerous. While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic, we know for sure that it's much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu. There are two futures for a pandemic like Corona: fast and slow. Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak. A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives; a slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books. The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection because there are no counter measures in place to slow it down. Why is this so bad? In a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time. If the numbers get too large, health care systems become unable to handle it. There aren't enough resources, like medical staff or equipment like ventilators, left to help everybody. People will die untreated. And as more health care workers get sick themselves, the capacity of health care systems falls even further. If this becomes the case, then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live and who doesn't. The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario. To avoid this, the world - that means all of us - needs to do what it can to turn this into a slow pandemic. A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses.

In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage. Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc. First, neutrophils, which are great at killing stuff, including our cells. As they arrive in their thousands, they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends as enemies. The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T-cells, which usually order infected cells to commit controlled suicide. Confused as they are, they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too. The more and more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy lung tissue they kill. This might get so bad that it can cause permanent irreversible damage, that leads to lifelong disabilities. In most cases, the immune system slowly regains control. It kills the infected cells, intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones and cleans up the battlefield. Recovery begins. The majority of people infected by Corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms. But many cases become severe or even critical. We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified, but it's safe to say that there is a lot more than with the flu. In more severe cases, Millions of epithelial cells have died and with them, the lungs' protective lining is gone. That means that the alveoli - tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs - can be infected by bacteria that aren't usually a big problem. Patients get pneumonia. Respiration becomes hard or even fails, and patients need ventilators to survive. The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons. And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply, it is overwhelmed. They enter the blood and overrun the body; if this happens, death is very likely. The Corona virus is often compared to the flu, but actually, it's much more dangerous. While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic, we know for sure that it's much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu. There are two futures for a pandemic like Corona: fast and slow. Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak. A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives; a slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books. The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection because there are no counter measures in place to slow it down. Why is this so bad? In a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time. If the numbers get too large, health care systems become unable to handle it. There aren't enough resources, like medical staff or equipment like ventilators, left to help everybody. People will die untreated. And as more health care workers get sick themselves, the capacity of health care systems falls even further. If this becomes the case, then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live and who doesn't. The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario. To avoid this, the world - that means all of us - needs to do what it can to turn this into a slow pandemic. A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses. Especially in the early phase, so that everyone who gets sick can get treatment and there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals. Since we don't have a vaccine for Corona, we have to socially engineer our behaviour, to act like a social vaccine. This simply means two things: 1. Not getting infected; and 2. Not infecting others. Although it sounds trivial, the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands. The soap is actually a powerful tool. The corona virus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat; soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you. It also makes your hands slippery, and with the mechanical motions of washing, viruses are ripped away. To do it properly, wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapeños and want to put in your contact lenses next. The next thing is social distancing, which is not a nice experience, but a nice thing to do. This means: no hugging, no handshakes. If you can stay at home, stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function: from doctors to cashiers, or police officers;. You depend on all of them; they all depend on you to not get sick. On a larger level, there are quarantines, which can mean different things, from travel restrictions or actual orders to stay at home. Quarantines are not great to experience and certainly not popular. But they buy us - and specially the researchers working on medication and vaccinations - crucial time So if you are put under quarantine, you should understand why, and respect it. None of this is fun. But looking at the big picture, it is a really small price to pay. The question of how pandemics end, depends on how they start; if they start fast with a steep slope, they end badly. If they start slow, with a not-so-steep slope, they end okay-ish. And, in this day and age, it really is in all of our hands. Literally, and figuratively.

**Transcript**:
In December 2019 the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities. In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days. This virus is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 that causes the disease called Covid-19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus. What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do? [Intro Music] A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins, arguably not even a living thing. It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell. Corona may spread via surfaces, but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them. Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection when people cough, or if you touch someone who's ill and then your face, say rubbing your eyes or nose. The virus starts its journey here, and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into the body Its destinations are the intestines, the spleen or the lungs, where it can have the most dramatic effect. Even just a few corona viruses can cause quite a dramatic situation. The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells. These are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa waiting to be infected. Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victim's membranes to inject its genetic material. The cell, ignorant of what's happening, executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple: copy and reassemble. It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical point and receives one final order, self-destruct. The cell sort of melts away, releasing new corona particles ready to attack more cells. The number of infected cells grows exponentially After about 10 days, millions of body cells are infected, and billions of viruses swarmed the lungs. The virus has not caused too much damage yet, but corona is now going to release a real beast on you, your own immune system. The immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself and needs tight regulation. And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, Corona infects some of them and creates confusion. Cells have neither ears nor eyes. They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines. Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them. Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder. In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage. Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc.

**Transcript**:
In December 2019 the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities. In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days. This virus is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 that causes the disease called Covid-19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus. What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do? [Intro Music] A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins, arguably not even a living thing. It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell. Corona may spread via surfaces, but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them. Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection when people cough, or if you touch someone who's ill and then your face, say rubbing your eyes or nose. The virus starts its journey here, and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into the body Its destinations are the intestines, the spleen or the lungs, where it can have the most dramatic effect. Even just a few corona viruses can cause quite a dramatic situation. The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells. These are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa waiting to be infected. Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victim's membranes to inject its genetic material. The cell, ignorant of what's happening, executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple: copy and reassemble. It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical point and receives one final order, self-destruct. The cell sort of melts away, releasing new corona particles ready to attack more cells. The number of infected cells grows exponentially After about 10 days, millions of body cells are infected, and billions of viruses swarmed the lungs. The virus has not caused too much damage yet, but corona is now going to release a real beast on you, your own immune system. The immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself and needs tight regulation. And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, Corona infects some of them and creates confusion. Cells have neither ears nor eyes. They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines. Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them. Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder. In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage. Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc. First, neutrophils, which are great at killing stuff, including our cells. As they arrive in their thousands, they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends as enemies. The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T-cells, which usually order infected cells to commit controlled suicide. Confused as they are, they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too. The more and more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy lung tissue they kill. This might get so bad that it can cause permanent irreversible damage, that leads to lifelong disabilities. In most cases, the immune system slowly regains control. It kills the infected cells, intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones and cleans up the battlefield. Recovery begins. The majority of people infected by Corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms. But many cases become severe or even critical. We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified, but it's safe to say that there is a lot more than with the flu. In more severe cases, Millions of epithelial cells have died and with them, the lungs' protective lining is gone. That means that the alveoli - tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs - can be infected by bacteria that aren't usually a big problem. Patients get pneumonia. Respiration becomes hard or even fails, and patients need ventilators to survive. The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons. And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply, it is overwhelmed. They enter the blood and overrun the body; if this happens, death is very likely. The Corona virus is often compared to the flu, but actually, it's much more dangerous. While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic, we know for sure that it's much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu. There are two futures for a pandemic like Corona: fast and slow. Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak. A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives; a slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books. The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection because there are no counter measures in place to slow it down. Why is this so bad? In a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time. If the numbers get too large, health care systems become unable to handle it. There aren't enough resources, like medical staff or equipment like ventilators, left to help everybody. People will die untreated. And as more health care workers get sick themselves, the capacity of health care systems falls even further. If this becomes the case, then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live and who doesn't. The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario. To avoid this, the world - that means all of us - needs to do what it can to turn this into a slow pandemic. A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses. Especially in the early phase, so that everyone who gets sick can get treatment and there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals. Since we don't have a vaccine for Corona, we have to socially engineer our behaviour, to act like a social vaccine. This simply means two things: 1. Not getting infected; and 2. Not infecting others. Although it sounds trivial, the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands. The soap is actually a powerful tool. The corona virus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat; soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you. It also makes your hands slippery, and with the mechanical motions of washing, viruses are ripped away. To do it properly, wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapeños and want to put in your contact lenses next. The next thing is social distancing, which is not a nice experience, but a nice thing to do. This means: no hugging, no handshakes. If you can stay at home, stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function: from doctors to cashiers, or police officers;. You depend on all of them; they all depend on you to not get sick. On a larger level, there are quarantines, which can mean different things, from travel restrictions or actual orders to stay at home. Quarantines are not great to experience and certainly not popular. But they buy us - and specially the researchers working on medication and vaccinations - crucial time So if you are put under quarantine, you should understand why, and respect it. None of this is fun. But looking at the big picture, it is a really small price to pay. The question of how pandemics end, depends on how they start; if they start fast with a steep slope, they end badly. If they start slow, with a not-so-steep slope, they end okay-ish. And, in this day and age, it really is in all of our hands. Literally, and figuratively.

**Transcript**:
Old TV shows made it seem really easy to appeal
to the Supreme Court. Like when this lady wanted to fight her speeding ticket. Or on Gilligan’s Island, when Thurston Howell
is locked in a bamboo jail and he says, But even though they make it sound like a right, nobody is entitled to an appearance at the Supreme Court. That’s entirely at the discretion of the Justices and they choose very carefully. Only a small number of cases get to the Supreme
Court, and it’s getting smaller. Roughly 8,000 cases are submitted each year,
but only 80 cases are accepted. That’s a 1% acceptance rate. And to get to that 1%, most cases start at
the bottom. The federal court system consists of three
layers and the lowest is the district level. If you lose in a district court you can appeal
to the circuit level. Most of The United States is divided into
eleven circuits, but there’s a twelfth for DC and a federal circuit that mostly hears patent
and military cases. Above the circuit level is the Supreme Court,
the highest court in the land as long as you don’t count the basketball
court that’s above the Supreme Court. And to get to the Supreme Court, nearly all
cases require submitting something called a "petition for a writ of certio- certioror? certiori? “The writ of certiorari”, which is shortened,
usually, to “the writ of cert”. A petition for the writ of cert is a written
request asking the Supreme Court to hear a case. Instead of asking the court to resolve the facts of a case, which are nearly always settled in lower courts, the reasons for granting the petition concern important questions about federal law. The overarching goal of the court is to make sure that federal law is the same across the country and, so, by federal law I mean the
US Constitution and laws passed by Congress. Professor Greene clerked for Justice John Paul Stevens, where he became very familiar with cert petitions. That’s because the clerks review cert petitions
for their justices, who then choose to grant a petition if it
passes “the rule of four”, meaning that four justices want to hear the case. When the court does not grant cert, it does
not imply a decision. It doesn’t mean that it agrees with the
lower court. It doesn’t mean that the individual justices agree with the lower court decision.
It just means that the court has decided that this particular case is not a case where the court is going to choose to set law for the whole country. If cert is granted, a case probably falls into one of three categories describing most Supreme Court cases. The first is a case of national importance, such as when the court decided Bush v. Gore in order to help determine who had won the 2000 presidential election. “Drawing on very rarely used legal powers,
The Supreme Court has, for the first time in American history, decided to step into
a legal dispute in the midst of a presidential election." A second type of case is when a lower court
issues a ruling that invalidates federal law. An example is "Gonsalez v. Raich", in which
Angel Raich, a California woman, challenged federal drug laws after agents destroyed marijuana plants she had been consuming for medical use. On her appeal in the Ninth Circuit, judges
ruled in favor of Raich, deciding that she was compliant with a state
law authorizing her use of medical pot. But that ruling conflicted with federal law
prohibiting marijuana use. So when the Ninth Circuit said "it doesn’t
apply" that means that if you are medical marijuana user in California then you can use it without
fear of federal prosecution, but if you are a medical marijuana user in Florida or in New York then it’s still banned under federal law. By ruling on the case, Justices were able to establish the authority of federal law
prohibiting the use of medical marijuana. In the Raich case, the Supreme Court overruled
the Ninth Circuit and said that the federal drug laws can apply to local marijuana use,
which means that someone like Angel Raich can still be prosecuted under federal law
even though she can’t be prosecuted under state law. Third, the court accepts cases in order to
resolve a split decision in the lower courts. This happened in the case "Obergefell v. Hodges", where a Sixth Circuit ruling that banned same-sex marriage conflicted with rulings in other
circuits that had upheld the right to same-sex marriage. Obergefell was someone living in Ohio who wanted to marry his same-sex partner and was not permitted to do so under Ohio law. It made its way to the Sixth Circuit. The
Sixth Circuit said, “you have no right to be married because you are a same-sex couple” and that created a “split”: a division of authority between
the Sixth Circuit, which governs Ohio, and a number of other circuit courts. And so, once that happened, it was fairly clear to, I think, most legal observers that the Supreme Court was likely to hear the case because it meant that federal law, the federal Constitution in this case, applied differently in Ohio than it would in Pennsylvania, for example. By ruling in favor of Obergefell, the court
resolved a circuit split and made same-sex marriage a right nationwide. But these three categories are just a framework for understanding why The Court might select a case. They are not rules. Ultimately, which cases get to the court depends
on the decisions of individuals: the sitting justices of The US Supreme Court.

**Transcript**:
Murders are in the news so frequently that you may quietly wonder: are people just naturally violent? We can answer that question by looking at the rest of the animal kingdom. Are we Homo sapiens any more murderous than, say, monkeys, mice, or meerkats? [Music] A team of researchers in Spain found out by gathering data for more than one thousand mammal species, and they found that killing is actually pretty rare. Okay sure, predators will eat prey, but less than half of the studied species kill members of their own kind. And we humans are nowhere near the top of the chart of the most murderous mammals. We’re not even in the top 30. Some of those top species include obvious ones: predators like lions, bears, and wolves. But the list has surprises too. Cute things like ground squirrels, wild horses, deer. The adorable long-tailed chinchilla is sitting at number 14. And at the number 1 most murderous mammal? The meerkat. They might seem lovable, but around 20 percent of meerkats lose their lives to other meerkats. Primates, the group we belong to, turn out to be an unusually violent bunch. They are 8 times more likely to kill each other than other mammals are. This makes sense: Primates are both territorial and social, two factors that provide the motive and opportunity for murder. So we descend from a group of unusually murderous mammals. But what’s happened since then? To find out, the Spanish team combed through archeological data and historical records. They found that in paleolithic times, lethal violence caused 3.5% of all human deaths, making our ancestors only slightly more violent than the average primate. But as our societies got bigger, our rates of lethal violence increased, rising to around 12% during the Medieval period. But, once we formed large states and became more organized, institutions and the rule of law reduced rates of murder, which are now much lower than in our prehistoric past. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes would have approved. In the 17th century, he argued that modern society protects us from our brutish nature. Not so, said Jean-Jacques Rousseau, another philosopher who believed that humans are naturally good, and civilization is what corrupts us. So did Hobbes win this age old debate? Well maybe, but there's a catch. Some researchers argue that how a mammal species kills its own kind matters more than the rate at which it does the killing. And for primates, the most common MO is infanticide. They kill their babies. But what makes humans so different is that we kill each other as adults at an exceptionally high rate. It is adult homicide that makes us part of a very small club of violent mammals that includes the like of wolves, lions, and spotted hyenas. Human violence may be rooted in our evolutionary past, and we may tamed our lethal proclivities, but like it or not, when it comes to violence, humans are still exceptional. This is You Are Here, a new series from the Atlantic about the science behind everyday life. Let us know what topics you want us to explore in the comments. I’m Ed Yong, thanks for watching.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage of meerkats that lose their lives to other meerkats. While there isn't a direct match, Question 4 is the closest in terms of asking about a specific percentage related to violence.

However, a more relevant question would be Question 2, which asks about the meerkat being the number 1 most murderous mammal. Although it doesn't ask about the percentage, it does relate to the same topic of meerkat violence.

If I had to choose, I would say that neither of the generated MCQs is a good match for the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to pick one, I would say Question 4 is the closest in terms of style, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of content.

Since I must provide an index, I will provide the index of Question 2, which is the closest in terms of content.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 2

We’re not even in the top 30. Some of those top species include obvious ones: predators like lions, bears, and wolves. But the list has surprises too. Cute things like ground squirrels, wild horses, deer. The adorable long-tailed chinchilla is sitting at number 14. And at the number 1 most murderous mammal? The meerkat. They might seem lovable, but around 20 percent of meerkats lose their lives to other meerkats. Primates, the group we belong to, turn out to be an unusually violent bunch. They are 8 times more likely to kill each other than other mammals are. This makes sense: Primates are both territorial and social, two factors that provide the motive and opportunity for murder. So we descend from a group of unusually murderous mammals. But what’s happened since then? To find out, the Spanish team combed through archeological data and historical records. They found that in paleolithic times, lethal violence caused 3.5% of all human deaths, making our ancestors only slightly more violent than the average primate. But as our societies got bigger, our rates of lethal violence increased, rising to around 12% during the Medieval period. But, once we formed large states and became more organized, institutions and the rule of law reduced rates of murder, which are now much lower than in our prehistoric past. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes would have approved. In the 17th century, he argued that modern society protects us from our brutish nature. Not so, said Jean-Jacques Rousseau, another philosopher who believed that humans are naturally good, and civilization is what corrupts us. So did Hobbes win this age old debate? Well maybe, but there's a catch. Some researchers argue that how a mammal species kills its own kind matters more than the rate at which it does the killing. And for primates, the most common MO is infanticide. They kill their babies. But what makes humans so different is that we kill each other as adults at an exceptionally high rate. It is adult homicide that makes us part of a very small club of violent mammals that includes the like of wolves, lions, and spotted hyenas. Human violence may be rooted in our evolutionary past, and we may tamed our lethal proclivities, but like it or not, when it comes to violence, humans are still exceptional. This is You Are Here, a new series from the Atlantic about the science behind everyday life. Let us know what topics you want us to explore in the comments. I’m Ed Yong, thanks for watching.

**Transcript**:
"Barbecue"!! The word derives from the word
"barabicu", which to the Taíno people in the Caribbean islands meant "sacred fire pit".
We are definitely on sacred ground today. If we can get in. [MUSIC] I'm here to learn a little about the science
of BBQ, so I came to a man who knows a little bit about that, Aaron Franklin... Well that's debatable. How's it going? So what is BBQ? I think BBQ is something that's cooked over
a live fire, so that could encompass grilling, slow offset cooking, cooking in the ground,
cooking whole hogs over coals, any of those kinds of things I call BBQ, but for me on
a personal level, it's a German/Czech style, offset cooking." I experiment all the time, at the end of the
day feel trumps black and white number or equation you could possibly have. If something's
not tender, it's just not tender, if something's dry, it's just too dry. BUT, the science behind
these things how wood burns, how airflow works, if you start thinking about fluid dynamics
inside of a cooker, then science has a pretty huge part of it. I think good BBQ is a balance
between science and natural gut instinct. Cooking is really just thermodynamics and
chemistry, but tastier. Inside the smoker, air molecules are moving around really rapidly
thanks to that fire, they're vibrating all crazy, and when they smack into the brisket,
they transfer that energy to the meat, either contributing chemical reactions or raising
the temperature. Meat browns when it cooks, whether it's direct
heat like a steak or slow like BBQ. Heat breaks proteins down into amino acids, which then
react with sugars to create molecular deliciousness, which happens to be brown. It's not caramelization,
it's something called the Maillard reaction. King of BBQ here in Texas is brisket. It started
out with whole animals, you would sell what you could and then whatever was left, as a
method of preservation, you would BBQ stuff on Sundays For us to fully understand the science of
BBQ, we need to know a little about the hunk of meat we're cooking. Meat in general is
muscle, which is primarily protein, fat, some vitamins and minerals, and whole lot of water. Brisket comes from across chest area of cow,
right here, and since cattle don't have collarbones like us, this muscle has to support more than
half their body weight. That means it's got a lot of three things: hard-working muscle,
fat, and connective tissue. It's basically the opposite of filet mignon. But if we apply
the right kind of science, those three things can come together like Voltron to make something
very tasty. So at the end of the day you want it to be
tender, juicy, good bark, with good fat render. Some of you might not want to hear this, but
making good BBQ is like making Jell-O. Ribs, brisket, pork shoulder, all cuts of meat that
have tons of connective tissue, the molecular glue that supports all those muscle fibers.
Collagen, one of the proteins in connective tissue, can make up a quarter of all the protein
in a mammal's body. Cook 'em fast, and those proteins snap up
tight like rubber bands, they have the texture of them too. If you cook them slow, they melt.
When collagen is heated slowly and held there for hours (and hours), its long protein chains
break down and water works its way in. That collagen turns to gelatin, exactly the same
stuff that's in this box. That's what makes good BBQ so tender inside. It's meat Jell-O. BBQ cuts also have a good amount of fat. Animal
fats are made of triglycerides which have mostly saturated fatty acids. These have much
higher melting points than unsaturated fats like, say, vegetable or olive oil you have
in your kitchen, because those straight triglyceride tails are stable, packed nice and close. As
we heat these saturated fats up, slowly, we can disrupt those hydrogen bonds and turn
to liquid, called rendering. Which is delicious. Together, melting collagen to gelatin and
liquefying fat make the meat OH SO TENDER. You need no teeth to eat dis beef. What's fun about an oven? There's nothing
fun about ovens. Did they have ovens back in the early days, coming up through Mexico?
No you dug a hole in the ground, you buried a head, on coals, you cooked on a fire. And
that's where I'm coming from more on the traditional side of it. I'm not gonna use electricity,
not gonna use gas no assisted heat source of any kind.We have light bulbs, and I don't
even like that so much. And it tastes good. That gets into a whole
other thing too, how you're using wood, green wood, dry wood, post oak, hickory, mesquite,
pecan, any of these different kinds of woods they all taste different, they all cook different. The hardwoods used in BBQ smoke have lots
of cellulose and lignin. When burnt slowly, cellulose caramelizes into sugar molecules
that flavor the meat. And lignin is converted into all kinds of aromatic chemicals that
flavor the meat, and can even act as chemical preservatives.
You just can't have brisket, or any BBQ, without that beautiful smoke ring. Now THIS is some
cool chemistry! Or hot chemistry. Meat starts out pink because it's full of oxygen-carrying
molecule called myoglobin. That iron-containing myoglobin starts out red, but as it heats
up the iron in its heme group oxidizes and it turns this brown color. So why is the ring still red? Well, BBQ smoke
contains gases like carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, made by burning wood. That gas diffuse
into the edges of the meat, bind to the myoglobin in place of oxygen. And those nitric oxide-myoglobin
compounds just so happen to be pink. The edge stays nice and red while the interior gets
brown like normal. Kinda the art of working a fire is to control
those things and get certain flavors out of a piece of wood. It's not just heat, it's not just the temperature
on a gauge, it's how the smoke is coming out of the smokestack, it's how a piece of wood
if it flames up and dies out real quick, it's about a heat curve, how long is it gonna last,
are you forcing a piece of wood to do something it doesn't want to do? You can't really make a piece of meat do what
you want it to do, you can only guide it to do what you think you want it to do. So, kind
of go with that, it's all about trial and error, don't give up, keep working on it.
And if you really wanted to you could watch the BBQ With Franklin videos. Out here we might have beer cans and aprons
instead of test tubes and lab coats, but BBQ is SCIENCE, y'all. It's chemistry, it's physics,
and the best part is you get to eat your experiments. Stay curious. And hungry. I'm gonna go get
some food. Special thanks to Aaron Franklin and the whole
crew at Franklin BBQ. If you're ever in Austin, Texas, line up early, because this is the
best BBQ joint in the US. Seriously, you can look it up.

brown like normal. Kinda the art of working a fire is to control
those things and get certain flavors out of a piece of wood. It's not just heat, it's not just the temperature
on a gauge, it's how the smoke is coming out of the smokestack, it's how a piece of wood
if it flames up and dies out real quick, it's about a heat curve, how long is it gonna last,
are you forcing a piece of wood to do something it doesn't want to do? You can't really make a piece of meat do what
you want it to do, you can only guide it to do what you think you want it to do. So, kind
of go with that, it's all about trial and error, don't give up, keep working on it.
And if you really wanted to you could watch the BBQ With Franklin videos. Out here we might have beer cans and aprons
instead of test tubes and lab coats, but BBQ is SCIENCE, y'all. It's chemistry, it's physics,
and the best part is you get to eat your experiments. Stay curious. And hungry. I'm gonna go get
some food. Special thanks to Aaron Franklin and the whole
crew at Franklin BBQ. If you're ever in Austin, Texas, line up early, because this is the
best BBQ joint in the US. Seriously, you can look it up.

[♪ INTRO ♪] Parents have a bunch of catchphrases. Things like, “Don’t eat with your mouth
open” or “Don’t run with scissors." Another one you might recognize is “don’t sit too close to the TV; it’ll hurt your eyes." But it turns out that the science behind that one isn’t actually true—at least, not anymore. Your eyes might start to feel tired, but the
TV won’t actually hurt them. That idea came from some faulty televisions back in the late 1960s. About 50 years ago, General Electric accidentally released a line of color televisions that emitted X-rays from 10 to 100,000 times more than was considered safe. Talk about a manufacturing flaw. Like most other old, boxy TVs, the GE ones used cathode ray tubes, or CRTs, to generate a picture. Inside the glass vacuum tubes, electrons were fired at a screen covered in red, green, and blue phosphors, a type of material that glows when hit by something like electrons. And when fast-moving electrons strike something in a vacuum, it generates X-rays. To protect people from this radiation, engineers mixed lead into the glass ray tubes— but this batch of GE televisions was produced with faulty tubes. Two pieces were misaligned, which meant that the X-rays were deflected out of the bottom of the TV set and toward the ground right under
the television, where some kid was probably singing along to The Flintstones theme song. A recall notice estimated that sitting under the TV for a total of 40 hours would expose someone to so much radiation that their skin would turn red and painful. Which is... not great. But the good news is it doesn’t seem like
anyone was hurt. Thankfully, modern LCD TVs don’t emit harmful radiation at all, so you can sit as close as you want. But if you do spend too much time binging Netflix, you might still develop a headache. If you stare at the TV—or basically anything, including a book or your smartphone—for too long, you can tire out the muscles in and around your eyes and develop eye-strain. After a while, whatever you’re staring at
will start to get wobbly and fuzzy, and you might get a headache or feel tired. Fortunately there’s an easy fix: Go do something else, or at least just look away for a few seconds. Now, kids can focus on things close up much better than adults can without developing eye-strain, which is why they tend to get in the habit of sitting super close to screens—like televisions. And, in the 1960s, that might have been a
problem. But today, kids won’t get radiation burns
by doing it, no matter what their parents say. So the next time you’re in the mood for
a vintage movie marathon, you can sit wherever you’d like. But when Netflix asks you if you’re still
watching, it might be time to give your eyes a break. Thanks for asking, and thanks to all of our patrons on Patreon who keep the answers coming. If you’d like to submit a question to be

Here at SciShow HQ we have a little food area for the employees - Sometimes there are donuts. Sometimes there are nuts. Sometimes dried mango. But the one thing that never sticks around and is gone as soon as we can buy it is the wonderful, beautiful, noble banana. Unfortunately for us, they may not be around forever. [Intro Music] First, the good: bananas are healthy,
packed with nutrition and energy, they fit in your hand and give nice little
cues when they're perfectly ripe, and are easy to peel and eat; shocking statistic,
the banana is Wal-mart's number one selling item.
Not the potato chip, not Coca-Cola, not Fifty Shades of Grey, bananas. They
appear to be so perfect for human consumption that Kirk Cameron attempted
to use them to prove the existence of God. Of course this banana was not created by
God, or really even nature. Bananas, at least the ones that you see at the store, were created by people. Don't get me
wrong, there are wild banana plants - lots of them - they're native to South and
Southeast Asia, and there are dozens of species and
thousands of varieties. They're just not the ones we eat. Some
those species, as you might suspect, have seeds, 'cause that's what fruits
are, they're fleshy bodies containing seeds. So you might wonder, why have you never
eaten a banana seed? Well, you have... kinda. In cultivated bananas the
seeds have pretty much stopped existing. If you look closely you can see tiny black specks. Those are all that's
left, and they're not fertile seeds. If you
plant them, nothing grows. Today's bananas are sterile mutants. I'm
not trying to be mean, that's just the truth. Unless you were alive in the 1960's (hats off to all those older SciShow viewers out there) every banana you
have ever eaten was pretty much genetically identical. This is a Cavendish, the virtually seedless
variety that we all eat today, but it wasn't always our banana of choice. Until the
1960s, everyone was eating the same banana, it
was just a different banana - the Gros Michel, a bigger, sweeter fruit
with thicker skin. You might notice that banana flavored things don't really
taste like bananas. Well they do - they taste like the Gros Michel. The
genetic monotony of the Gros Michel crop was its undoing. A fungicide
resistant pathogen called the Panama disease began
infecting Gros Michel crop. By the time growers understood how
vulnerable their crops were, the Gros Michel variety was all but extinct. The entire banana industry had to be
retooled for the Cavendish. Since they're seedless, the only way to reproduce them
is to transplant part of the plant stem, and for the last 50 years we've been
good with the Cavendish, 'cause it's more resistant to the Panama
disease. However somewhat terrifyingly a strain of Panama disease that affects
the Cavendish strain that we all eat has been identified. A global monoculture of genetically
identical individuals is a beautiful sight to a pathogen. The fungus only has to figure out how to
infect and destroy a single individual, and suddenly there is no diversity to
stop it, or even slow it down. That's led to a lot
of scientists worrying about or even predicting the outright demise of the
Cavendish. This wonderful most popular of fruits might
completely cease existence. The good news is we now have a much better
understanding of genetics, epidemics, fungi, and pathology.
Scientists and growers have already taken steps to protect the Cavendish. Some growers are creating genetically
different bananas that might replace the Cavendish crop if it fails, while
scientists are attempting to genetically engineer Cavendish plants with immunity
to Panama disease. Plus we learned a lot from the Gros
Michel debacle. Infected fields are quickly being destroyed and new crops are
grown from pathogen-free lab-grown plant stock. So thanks to the people who work
tirelessly to grow and harvest bananas and bring them to us so that we can offer them inexpensively
to our employees, and thanks to the growers and scientists working
tirelessly to make sure that they don't go the way of the Gros Michel. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow, if

**Transcript**:
Here at SciShow HQ we have a little food area for the employees - Sometimes there are donuts. Sometimes there are nuts. Sometimes dried mango. But the one thing that never sticks around and is gone as soon as we can buy it is the wonderful, beautiful, noble banana. Unfortunately for us, they may not be around forever. [Intro Music] First, the good: bananas are healthy,
packed with nutrition and energy, they fit in your hand and give nice little
cues when they're perfectly ripe, and are easy to peel and eat; shocking statistic,
the banana is Wal-mart's number one selling item.
Not the potato chip, not Coca-Cola, not Fifty Shades of Grey, bananas. They
appear to be so perfect for human consumption that Kirk Cameron attempted
to use them to prove the existence of God. Of course this banana was not created by
God, or really even nature. Bananas, at least the ones that you see at the store, were created by people. Don't get me
wrong, there are wild banana plants - lots of them - they're native to South and
Southeast Asia, and there are dozens of species and
thousands of varieties. They're just not the ones we eat. Some
those species, as you might suspect, have seeds, 'cause that's what fruits
are, they're fleshy bodies containing seeds. So you might wonder, why have you never
eaten a banana seed? Well, you have... kinda. In cultivated bananas the
seeds have pretty much stopped existing. If you look closely you can see tiny black specks. Those are all that's
left, and they're not fertile seeds. If you
plant them, nothing grows. Today's bananas are sterile mutants. I'm
not trying to be mean, that's just the truth. Unless you were alive in the 1960's (hats off to all those older SciShow viewers out there) every banana you
have ever eaten was pretty much genetically identical. This is a Cavendish, the virtually seedless
variety that we all eat today, but it wasn't always our banana of choice. Until the
1960s, everyone was eating the same banana, it
was just a different banana - the Gros Michel, a bigger, sweeter fruit
with thicker skin. You might notice that banana flavored things don't really
taste like bananas. Well they do - they taste like the Gros Michel. The
genetic monotony of the Gros Michel crop was its undoing. A fungicide
resistant pathogen called the Panama disease began
infecting Gros Michel crop. By the time growers understood how
vulnerable their crops were, the Gros Michel variety was all but extinct. The entire banana industry had to be
retooled for the Cavendish. Since they're seedless, the only way to reproduce them
is to transplant part of the plant stem, and for the last 50 years we've been
good with the Cavendish, 'cause it's more resistant to the Panama
disease. However somewhat terrifyingly a strain of Panama disease that affects
the Cavendish strain that we all eat has been identified. A global monoculture of genetically
identical individuals is a beautiful sight to a pathogen. The fungus only has to figure out how to
infect and destroy a single individual, and suddenly there is no diversity to
stop it, or even slow it down. That's led to a lot
of scientists worrying about or even predicting the outright demise of the
Cavendish. This wonderful most popular of fruits might
completely cease existence. The good news is we now have a much better
understanding of genetics, epidemics, fungi, and pathology.
Scientists and growers have already taken steps to protect the Cavendish. Some growers are creating genetically
different bananas that might replace the Cavendish crop if it fails, while
scientists are attempting to genetically engineer Cavendish plants with immunity
to Panama disease. Plus we learned a lot from the Gros
Michel debacle. Infected fields are quickly being destroyed and new crops are
grown from pathogen-free lab-grown plant stock. So thanks to the people who work
tirelessly to grow and harvest bananas and bring them to us so that we can offer them inexpensively
to our employees, and thanks to the growers and scientists working
tirelessly to make sure that they don't go the way of the Gros Michel. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow, if

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since the options in Question 3 do not match the ground truth MCQ, I will continue to analyze the generated MCQs.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I found that Question 1, Question 3, and Question 6 contain elements of the ground truth MCQ, but none of them exactly match the question intent, options, and content.

Considering the options and the question intent, I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that combines elements of Question 1, Question 3, and Question 6.

However, if I had to choose one of the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, but with significant differences in the options.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3 (with significant differences in the options)

Please note that the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, and it would be best to create a new generated MCQ that accurately reflects the question intent, options, and content of the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the most similar generated MCQ would be:

Question 4: What is the name of the variety of banana that was eaten before the Cavendish?

Although this question does not directly ask about the native region of wild banana plants, it does relate to the topic of banana varieties, which is also discussed in the context of the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ would be:

Question: What is the native region of wild banana plants?
Options: A. South America, B. Southeast Asia, C. South Asia, D. both B and C

However, since this question is not among the generated MCQs, the closest match is not available.

If I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that none of them are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Here at SciShow HQ we have a little food area for the employees - Sometimes there are donuts. Sometimes there are nuts. Sometimes dried mango. But the one thing that never sticks around and is gone as soon as we can buy it is the wonderful, beautiful, noble banana. Unfortunately for us, they may not be around forever. [Intro Music] First, the good: bananas are healthy,
packed with nutrition and energy, they fit in your hand and give nice little
cues when they're perfectly ripe, and are easy to peel and eat; shocking statistic,
the banana is Wal-mart's number one selling item.
Not the potato chip, not Coca-Cola, not Fifty Shades of Grey, bananas. They
appear to be so perfect for human consumption that Kirk Cameron attempted
to use them to prove the existence of God. Of course this banana was not created by
God, or really even nature. Bananas, at least the ones that you see at the store, were created by people. Don't get me
wrong, there are wild banana plants - lots of them - they're native to South and
Southeast Asia, and there are dozens of species and
thousands of varieties. They're just not the ones we eat. Some
those species, as you might suspect, have seeds, 'cause that's what fruits
are, they're fleshy bodies containing seeds. So you might wonder, why have you never
eaten a banana seed? Well, you have... kinda. In cultivated bananas the
seeds have pretty much stopped existing. If you look closely you can see tiny black specks. Those are all that's
left, and they're not fertile seeds. If you
plant them, nothing grows. Today's bananas are sterile mutants. I'm
not trying to be mean, that's just the truth. Unless you were alive in the 1960's (hats off to all those older SciShow viewers out there) every banana you
have ever eaten was pretty much genetically identical. This is a Cavendish, the virtually seedless
variety that we all eat today, but it wasn't always our banana of choice. Until the
1960s, everyone was eating the same banana, it
was just a different banana - the Gros Michel, a bigger, sweeter fruit
with thicker skin. You might notice that banana flavored things don't really
taste like bananas. Well they do - they taste like the Gros Michel. The
genetic monotony of the Gros Michel crop was its undoing. A fungicide
resistant pathogen called the Panama disease began
infecting Gros Michel crop. By the time growers understood how
vulnerable their crops were, the Gros Michel variety was all but extinct. The entire banana industry had to be
retooled for the Cavendish. Since they're seedless, the only way to reproduce them
is to transplant part of the plant stem, and for the last 50 years we've been
good with the Cavendish, 'cause it's more resistant to the Panama
disease. However somewhat terrifyingly a strain of Panama disease that affects
the Cavendish strain that we all eat has been identified. A global monoculture of genetically
identical individuals is a beautiful sight to a pathogen. The fungus only has to figure out how to
infect and destroy a single individual, and suddenly there is no diversity to
stop it, or even slow it down. That's led to a lot
of scientists worrying about or even predicting the outright demise of the
Cavendish. This wonderful most popular of fruits might
completely cease existence. The good news is we now have a much better
understanding of genetics, epidemics, fungi, and pathology.
Scientists and growers have already taken steps to protect the Cavendish. Some growers are creating genetically
different bananas that might replace the Cavendish crop if it fails, while
scientists are attempting to genetically engineer Cavendish plants with immunity
to Panama disease. Plus we learned a lot from the Gros
Michel debacle. Infected fields are quickly being destroyed and new crops are
grown from pathogen-free lab-grown plant stock. So thanks to the people who work
tirelessly to grow and harvest bananas and bring them to us so that we can offer them inexpensively
to our employees, and thanks to the growers and scientists working
tirelessly to make sure that they don't go the way of the Gros Michel. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow, if

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since the options in Question 3 do not match the ground truth MCQ, I will continue to analyze the generated MCQs.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I found that none of the questions exactly match the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 3: What is the main reason why bananas have no seeds? Options: A. They are not genetically engineered., B. They are not fertile., C. They are not cultivated., D. They are not natural.

Although the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question content is related to the fact that bananas are sterile mutants.

A more suitable generated MCQ could be created by combining the content of Question 3 with the options from the ground truth MCQ.

Since none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ:

there are 196 countries in the world
today and virtually none of them have purple on their national flag.
Throughout history, purple was never used to represent a kingdom civilization or
Empire. So what's wrong with purple? It's such a popular color today.
why would no country use it in their flag? the answer is really quite simple
purple was just far too expensive. No countries have purple on their flag
because up until the 1800s purple was worth more than its weight in gold
the color purple has been associated with royalty power and wealth for
centuries. In fact, Queen Elizabeth the first forbade anyone except close
members of the royal family to wear it. Purple's elite status stems from the
rarity and cost of the dye originally used to produce it the dye initially
used to make purple came from the Phoenician trading city of Tyre which is
now in modern-day Lebanon fabric traders obtained the dye from a small sea snail
that was only found in the tyre region of the Mediterranean a lot of work went
into producing the dye as more than 10,000 snails were needed to create just
one gram of tyree and purple since only wealthy rulers could afford to buy and
wear the color it became associated with the Imperial classes of Rome Egypt and
Persia purple also came to represent spirituality and holiness because the
ancient Emperor's kings and queens that wore the color were often thought of as
gods or descendants of the gods sometimes however the dye was too
expensive even for royalty third century Roman Emperor aurelion famously wouldn't
allow his wife to buy a shawl made from tyree and purple silk because it
literally cost three times its weight in gold
a single pound of dye cost three pounds of gold which is the equivalent of fifty
six thousand dollars today so since the sheer price of purple was so
astronomically high no one not
when the richest nations could afford to have purple on their flag the hue became
more accessible to lower-class is about a century and a half ago in 1856 18-year
old English chemist William Henry Perkin accidentally created a synthetic purple
compound while attempting to synthesize quinine an anti-malaria drug he noticed
that the compound could be used to dye fabrics so he patented the dye
manufactured it and got filthy rich purple dye was then mass-produced so
just about everybody could afford it the elite stopped valuing purple and the
status symbol faded away but the country flags remain the same since 1900 a
handful of new national flags have been designed and a few of them have opted to
use purple in their flag so don't be making any bets just yet hopefully you

**Transcript**:
This is the Guimaras oil spill of 2006 and
it's the worst of its kind in the Philippine's history. More than 130
thousand gallons of bunker oil gushed into the Panay Gulf. In an attempt to contain the spill locals turn to an unconventional method: these
freaky-looking sausage things are all filled with synthetic materials
fabricated in a lab. It's also organic stuff you can find on most continents
and probably in your shower drain. It's human hair. After the Exxon Valdez oil
spill in Alaska Phil McCroy, a hair stylist in Alabama, had a novel idea for
the cleanup effort. On TV he noticed how a sea otter's fur had become saturated with
oil and thought if that's what oil would do to an otter's fur, then the same must
be true for human hair. He took scraps of hair trimmings from
work, stuffed them into his wife's pantyhose and tested his new invention
in a small spill he created at his house. NASA's studied and confirmed Phil's
invention worked. I called every hair stylist in Alabama 'til I found him. He said that his garage was full of hair being donated from salons all over the
place, but he'd never been able to make a business out of it and so from like
about 2000, 2001 we were partners. They teamed up on the Clean Wave program. It
collects donated hair, fur, feathers, and other fibers to make recycled felted
mats and hair booms that can mop up oil spills. Turns out hair is pretty good at cleaning up oil. It repels water and can
collect contaminants. Water goes into a sponge and it blows up and that's called
absorbent but oil coats hair on the outside so like it's called adsorbent. Hair is also natural, cheap, and renewable which makes it an ideal material for
cleaning up oil spills. Making a hair boom is pretty straightforward. All you need is human hair and pantyhose. Take the hair, stuff it into the hose, and
voilà. After getting over the freaky feeling of
handling someone else's clumped up hair, place it into contaminated water and
watch the hair boom do its thing. There's little diesel spills all the
time, so like every little harbor can use that stuff. You know, it was a great way
to just kind of string from dock to dock and kind of protect your private beaches. But hair booms and hair mats haven't been the principal method to clean major
oil spills. They weren't used extensively in the aftermath of the Deepwater
Horizon spill, where over the course of 87 days 134 million gallons of oil
gushed into the Gulf of Mexico. Instead, crews used 1.8 million gallons of
chemical dispersants, oil skimmers, fire, and booms and barriers made of synthetic
material to clean up the mess. With oil spills, time is of the essence. The longer oil is in the ocean the harder it is to retrieve. The immediate
ecological impact of oil spills is obvious. It kills marine wildlife and
destroys habitats and breeding grounds. The chemicals used to clean up oil
spills also pose a danger to human health. As of now, hair booms and hair
mats are not the primary tools used to contain oil spills, but possibly one day
they could be. It was very interesting for us to see the public desire to help. There's so many hair salons in every city and billions more people
with hair to spare. So it's not out of the realm of possibilities that help for
the next oil spill maybe just one snip away.

**Transcript**:
This is the Guimaras oil spill of 2006 and
it's the worst of its kind in the Philippine's history. More than 130
thousand gallons of bunker oil gushed into the Panay Gulf. In an attempt to contain the spill locals turn to an unconventional method: these
freaky-looking sausage things are all filled with synthetic materials
fabricated in a lab. It's also organic stuff you can find on most continents
and probably in your shower drain. It's human hair. After the Exxon Valdez oil
spill in Alaska Phil McCroy, a hair stylist in Alabama, had a novel idea for
the cleanup effort. On TV he noticed how a sea otter's fur had become saturated with
oil and thought if that's what oil would do to an otter's fur, then the same must
be true for human hair. He took scraps of hair trimmings from
work, stuffed them into his wife's pantyhose and tested his new invention
in a small spill he created at his house. NASA's studied and confirmed Phil's
invention worked. I called every hair stylist in Alabama 'til I found him. He said that his garage was full of hair being donated from salons all over the
place, but he'd never been able to make a business out of it and so from like
about 2000, 2001 we were partners. They teamed up on the Clean Wave program. It
collects donated hair, fur, feathers, and other fibers to make recycled felted
mats and hair booms that can mop up oil spills. Turns out hair is pretty good at cleaning up oil. It repels water and can
collect contaminants. Water goes into a sponge and it blows up and that's called
absorbent but oil coats hair on the outside so like it's called adsorbent. Hair is also natural, cheap, and renewable which makes it an ideal material for
cleaning up oil spills. Making a hair boom is pretty straightforward. All you need is human hair and pantyhose. Take the hair, stuff it into the hose, and
voilà. After getting over the freaky feeling of
handling someone else's clumped up hair, place it into contaminated water and
watch the hair boom do its thing. There's little diesel spills all the

**Transcript**:
I don’t know about you, but I thought to
be chameleon-like was to be someone who could fit in anywhere. Adapt. Blend in. Turns out that is all wrong. Chameleons don’t change color to match their
environment. In fact, it’s just the opposite. Their baseline is camouflage. When chameleons are relaxed, they’re mostly
green. They naturally blend into their home in the
forest canopy. They even mimic leaves by dancing around a
little. But when they feel threatened, or annoyed,
or just want to show a little swagger – that is when their color changes. They transform into living mood rings. Chameleons change color to make a statement. The faster their skin changes colors, the
more excited they are. How do they do this? Well it turns out we’ve been getting that
wrong too. Until this year, scientists thought chameleons
change color by spreading out pigments in their cells, like the skin of the squid we’re
seeing right here. But the truth is way more complex. Just below the surface of their skin is a
layer of cells called iridophores. These cells contain tiny, nano-scale salt
crystals. They’re only a 130 nanometers across – that’s
less than one hundredth of the width of a human hair. The crystals are arranged in a three-dimensional
lattice. When light hits the lattice, it shatters into
different wavelengths. Some are absorbed and some bounce back. The result, to our eyes, appears green or
red or blue. The wings of the Morpho butterfly have similar
structures, which reflect brilliant blue hues. But unlike Morpho butterflies, chameleons
can stretch or contract the lattice, which moves the distance between crystals. Each of these points of light is an array
of crystals. When the distance changes, the crystals reflect
a different wavelength of light. The result is a dramatic shift in color. So what if we could come up with some kind
of material that could change from one brilliant color to another? Electrical engineers at UC Berkeley are trying
to do that. To mimic a chameleon’s structural color
control with synthetic materials. They arranged tiny, nano-scale silicon ribbons
on a sheet of flexible plastic. Each one of these “pixels” is made up
of about 160 ribbons. When the plastic stretches, the space between
the ribbons becomes greater and a different wavelength of light is reflected – just
like chameleon skin. Well, almost. This synthetic chameleon skin has just one
layer of nano-scale arrays. The salt crystals in real chameleon skin are
stacked in several layers, which makes their skin some of the most colorful and complex
in the animal kingdom. They produce colors that aren’t even visible
to human eyes. What I like about chameleons is they show
us how wrong we can be about science. What we called “camouflage” is an entire
language… as alien to us as the clicks of a dolphin or the low rumble of an elephant. A visual language … made of colors we can
only begin to imitate and imagine.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: In the past, scientists believed that chameleons changed their skin to match their surroundings. What did they learn that taught them differently.
Options: A. Chameleon's baseline color is white which reflects their surroundings naturally., B. Chameleon's baseline color is black which absorbs their surrounding color naturally., C. Chameleon's baseline color is camouflage. When calm, their natural color is green., D. Chameleon's baseline color is red. When angered, their color blends to match surroundings.
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the main misconception about chameleons' ability to change color?
Options: A. They change color to match their environment., B. They change color to communicate with other animals., C. They change color to regulate their body temperature., D. They change color to protect themselves from predators.

**Transcript**:
For centuries we’ve been warned of the dangers
that lurk deep below the ocean’s surface. Maybe there’s a horrifying colossal squid,
or a Kraken, or an evil villain’s lair. As it turns out, the reality is far worse. Hey there polluting population, Jules here
for DNews! The Mariana Trench is the deepest known part
of the ocean, stretching down roughly 36,000 feet. You’d imagine that at those depths, the
ocean floor is pristine, almost untouched by human activity. Well, I’ve got some bad news for ya. Turns out, the bottom of the ocean is very,
very polluted. And that’s not some click-bait hyperbole;
it is more polluted than some of the most polluted regions on the surface of the globe. One probe into the Marianas Trench only had
to go about 16,000 feet down to find physical remnants of actual garbage, not just waste
byproducts. Beer cans, plastic bags, even an entire, unopened
can of SPAM was found resting along the Trench’s wall. And unless it is removed, this trash can stay
down there indefinitely, just piling up. Plastics, for example, are made up of super-strong
carbon to carbon bonds. These bonds are not prone to being broken
down by organic organisms; the material hasn’t existed in nature long enough for there to
have evolved much to break it down. In 2016 scientists found one type of microbe
that can do it, but only for a specific type of plastic. And even if we could solve this physical trash
problem, there lies an even deeper problem. Literally. In late 2016, a paper published in the journal
Nature, examined the inhabitants of two of the deepest oceanic trenches in the world. Small little crustaceans called amphipods
are the perfect study specimen, as they have fatty tissue, which stores not just fat but
also any chemicals that are ingested. And despite these amphipods being located
in two different parts of the world, thousands of feet below the surface, they were ALL contaminated
by what are called “persistent organic pollutants” or POPs. “Persistent” meaning that they don’t
break down in their environment, and are almost impossible to remove. These include chemicals that have been banned
from use for decades, at least in the United States, like polychlorinated biphenyls, which
have been shown to be birth defect and cancer-causing. Other chemicals like pesticides were present
as well. The concentration of POPs was SO high that
it was 50 times greater than in one of China’s most polluted rivers, and was roughly equal
to that of Suruga Bay in Japan, an industrial waste dumping ground. So, how did this pollution make it all the
way down there? Well the researchers suggest that, in the
case of the Mariana Trench, it may have to do with a little something called the Great
Pacific Garbage Patch. While there are many areas where trash congregates
in the ocean, the paper refers to a huge floating clump of garbage in the Northwest Pacific
ocean that floats just near the Mariana’s Trench, and so plastics and other chemicals
end up sinking to its depths. There’s another theory that the pollution
found down there is the result of POP chemicals entering the food chain. The amphipods that live in these deep waters
are scavengers. When a larger animal, like a dolphin or a
whale, dies, it slowly sinks to the bottom of the ocean floor, a phenomenon known as
carrion-falls. If this carrion lived in polluted waters,
then it could have pollution in its system, and that pollution would persist in animals
that eat it. The paper does say that this is unlikely,
however, given that there is consistent contamination at different depths. But either of these theories for how the POPs
got so deep would be a huge problem for us humans. If these chemicals are so persistent within
the food chain, then they eventually reach our own food supply, contaminating it with
our own contaminants. But it isn’t just bad for us, it’s bad
for every living thing. Ocean pollution saps the amount of oxygen
in the water, which can lead to mass death of marine life. Certain chemicals can even create reproductive
issues for animals in the ocean, so even if they do survive, they can’t do much for
their species. Society has spent the last few centuries dumping
tons of trash into the ocean, including industrial waste, radioactive waste, munitions, and sewage. The EPA says, quote, “Wastes were frequently
dumped in coastal and ocean waters based on the assumption that marine waters had an unlimited
capacity to mix and disperse wastes.” But now we’re learning that this isn’t
really the case. The out of sight out, of mind is killing ocean
creatures and endangering our own health. It turns out nowhere is safe from pollution. Not even the deepest part of the ocean. We can’t do DNews episodes without our sponsors. Thanks to Graze for sponsoring this episode. Graze makes snacking exciting by combining

to that of Suruga Bay in Japan, an industrial waste dumping ground. So, how did this pollution make it all the
way down there? Well the researchers suggest that, in the
case of the Mariana Trench, it may have to do with a little something called the Great
Pacific Garbage Patch. While there are many areas where trash congregates
in the ocean, the paper refers to a huge floating clump of garbage in the Northwest Pacific
ocean that floats just near the Mariana’s Trench, and so plastics and other chemicals
end up sinking to its depths. There’s another theory that the pollution
found down there is the result of POP chemicals entering the food chain. The amphipods that live in these deep waters
are scavengers. When a larger animal, like a dolphin or a
whale, dies, it slowly sinks to the bottom of the ocean floor, a phenomenon known as
carrion-falls. If this carrion lived in polluted waters,
then it could have pollution in its system, and that pollution would persist in animals
that eat it. The paper does say that this is unlikely,
however, given that there is consistent contamination at different depths. But either of these theories for how the POPs
got so deep would be a huge problem for us humans. If these chemicals are so persistent within
the food chain, then they eventually reach our own food supply, contaminating it with
our own contaminants. But it isn’t just bad for us, it’s bad
for every living thing. Ocean pollution saps the amount of oxygen
in the water, which can lead to mass death of marine life. Certain chemicals can even create reproductive
issues for animals in the ocean, so even if they do survive, they can’t do much for
their species. Society has spent the last few centuries dumping
tons of trash into the ocean, including industrial waste, radioactive waste, munitions, and sewage. The EPA says, quote, “Wastes were frequently
dumped in coastal and ocean waters based on the assumption that marine waters had an unlimited
capacity to mix and disperse wastes.” But now we’re learning that this isn’t
really the case. The out of sight out, of mind is killing ocean
creatures and endangering our own health. It turns out nowhere is safe from pollution. Not even the deepest part of the ocean. We can’t do DNews episodes without our sponsors. Thanks to Graze for sponsoring this episode. Graze makes snacking exciting by combining

**Transcript**:
For centuries we’ve been warned of the dangers
that lurk deep below the ocean’s surface. Maybe there’s a horrifying colossal squid,
or a Kraken, or an evil villain’s lair. As it turns out, the reality is far worse. Hey there polluting population, Jules here
for DNews! The Mariana Trench is the deepest known part
of the ocean, stretching down roughly 36,000 feet. You’d imagine that at those depths, the
ocean floor is pristine, almost untouched by human activity. Well, I’ve got some bad news for ya. Turns out, the bottom of the ocean is very,
very polluted. And that’s not some click-bait hyperbole;
it is more polluted than some of the most polluted regions on the surface of the globe. One probe into the Marianas Trench only had
to go about 16,000 feet down to find physical remnants of actual garbage, not just waste
byproducts. Beer cans, plastic bags, even an entire, unopened
can of SPAM was found resting along the Trench’s wall. And unless it is removed, this trash can stay
down there indefinitely, just piling up. Plastics, for example, are made up of super-strong
carbon to carbon bonds. These bonds are not prone to being broken
down by organic organisms; the material hasn’t existed in nature long enough for there to
have evolved much to break it down. In 2016 scientists found one type of microbe
that can do it, but only for a specific type of plastic. And even if we could solve this physical trash
problem, there lies an even deeper problem. Literally. In late 2016, a paper published in the journal
Nature, examined the inhabitants of two of the deepest oceanic trenches in the world. Small little crustaceans called amphipods
are the perfect study specimen, as they have fatty tissue, which stores not just fat but
also any chemicals that are ingested. And despite these amphipods being located
in two different parts of the world, thousands of feet below the surface, they were ALL contaminated
by what are called “persistent organic pollutants” or POPs. “Persistent” meaning that they don’t
break down in their environment, and are almost impossible to remove. These include chemicals that have been banned
from use for decades, at least in the United States, like polychlorinated biphenyls, which
have been shown to be birth defect and cancer-causing. Other chemicals like pesticides were present
as well. The concentration of POPs was SO high that
it was 50 times greater than in one of China’s most polluted rivers, and was roughly equal
to that of Suruga Bay in Japan, an industrial waste dumping ground. So, how did this pollution make it all the

it can feel good lounging around and doing nothing sometimes too good whether it's to avoid work or Escape physical activity we've all had those days but why are some people way lazier than others is there a couch potato Gene that causes lazy Behavior Evolution has molded our brains and bodies to respond positively to Natural Rewards such as food sex and even exercise wait exercise yep the pleasure we experience comes largely from the dopamine system in our brain which conveys these messages throughout the body ultimately helping to ensure the surv Ral of our species for many the pleasure derived from exercise can become just as addictive as food and sex but while we're all up for more food and sex many struggle with the desire for physical activity even though it's an essential part of human biology scientists studying mice have found an interesting genetic connection after separating mice into two groups those that chose to run on their wheel more often and those that decided not to run as much the difference was clear in their offspring after 10 Generations the running mice would run on their wheels 75% more often than the other group and by 16 Generations they were running 7 m a day as opposed to the average 4 miles it seemed their motivation for physical activity was genetic we all inherit genes from our parents that play a key role in the development of our brains and these genes can make some literally crave activity in fact the brains of the running mice had larger dopamine systems and regions that deal with motivation and reward they needed activity otherwise their brains would react similar to a drug addicted rodent when deprived of cocaine or nicotine they were genetically addicted to running we also inherit genes responsible for our other traits from impulsivity to procrastination to work ethic and straight up laziness and it turns out our physical laziness may be linked to a couch potato gene or rather a mutation in a normal Gene which regulates activity levels this Gene is responsible for a type of dopamine receptor without it you're more likely to prefer sitting around and simply doing less than those who have the properly functioning Gene so the truth is your desire for activity may not be entirely up to you but many environment mental factors are also at play which means you aren't doomed to a life of laziness although making a change will be harder for some knowledge is power so if you think you're genetically lazy get off the couch and fight your DNA your brain will reward you in the end need some help to get there check out our past video on the science of productivity which might help you improve your motivation and fight that laziness and if you'd like to learn more about the amazing science behind extraordinary athletic performance check out one of our favorite books the sports Gene by David Epstein which was a major source for this episode it's a great read and you can get a copy of it using the link in the description below and subscribe for more weekly science videos

**Transcript**:
Human history is intertwined with some of Earth’s mightiest species, but there is one graceful creature that rises above the
rest. Only when seen it in its ideal habitat, can
we truly appreciate this king among birds. Behold: the nobel pigeon.” If you think they’re only good for pooping
on statues, then think again. [OPENING MUSIC] In On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin
presented an idea that changed the world. He knew if he was right, this idea was gonna
turn science on its head, so in chapter 1, you know what he chose as his very first
example? It wasn’t the tortoises, or finches, or
even the giant fossil armadillos he found during his journeys. He chose pigeons. Over giant fossil armadillos. But he had a good reason, and if you think
otherwise, then you’ve never seen FANCY pigeons. These are the birds that got Darwin’s attention,
because underneath all that feathery fashion, is just one species, like dogs with wings
instead of rats with wings. All of that variation was tweaked from one
ancient mold. The wild rock dove. Thousands of years before they were eating
old hot dog buns out of the trash, these birds were found on seaside cliffs, but pretty much
as soon as cities sprung up, they moved in, because to a pigeon, a building is just
a cliff with better architecture. Pigeons are uniquely suited to city life,
but they were only able to conquer all of Earth’s urban areas because we brought them
there. Why? Because we liked feeding them… to ourselves. In fact, from Egypt to Rome to the early 20th
century, the main roles of a pigeon were dinner, or something for rich people to breed into
silly shapes. Over time here and there, a few of these domestic
birds escaped and returned to a “wild” life, they just never left the city. But for some reason along that journey, our opinion
of pigeons went from this… to this. Watch pigeons pecking at the sidewalk and
you’re not looking at the smartest birds in the tree. They can’t solve puzzles like crows. They can’t talk like parrots. A pigeon’s brain is only about the size
of that fingertip… but like most things in nature there’s more to the story. Most of their skull is eyeball: if they were
the size of humans, their eyes would be as big as grapefruits… Those huge eyes have five color receptors,
compared to our three, letting them see things we can’t imagine. One pigeon named Linus was trained to remember
nearly a thousand images. Pigeons can peck out a Monet from a Picasso,
they can even judge if a child’s drawing is good or bad. Pigeons can tell correctly spelled words among
misspelled words, As if they aren’t annoying enough.. They can even put groups of objects in numerical
order, which sounds easy because we’re smart, but pigeons do numbers as well as monkeys
do, Pigeon vision is the bomb. Literally. During WW II, psychologist B.F. Skinner tried
to turn these birds into weapons. He trained pigeons to keep an image centered
on a tiny screen by pecking at it. He hooked this up to a navigation system,
and then loaded it inside of a bomb. He wanted to create explosive missiles piloted
by kamikaze pigeons. He built several successful prototypes using
money from the General Mills cereal company… yes, the people who make Cheerios, but the
Army never let it get off the ground. Pigeon navigation goes a lot farther than
bird bombs. Just like /human/ city-dwellers, pigeons are
commuters, flying out in the morning to find food and coming back at night. They’re tightly bonded to their home, and
this instinct is so strong that we’ve used them as messengers for centuries, like Flapchat
instead of Snapchat. Before Paul Reuter founded a global news service,
he used pigeons to deliver news. During World War I and II, racing pigeons
with names like Cher Ami and GI Joe were given actual medals for delivering messages under
fire. How are pigeons so good at finding their way
home from places they’ve never been? Different experiments have found pigeons use
visual maps, Earth’s magnetic field, the angle of the sun, even smells to navigate. But when scientists knock each of these senses
out, some birds can still find their way home. What we do know is pigeons use a lot of senses,
maybe even some we don’t know about yet. Even though pigeons are everywhere, there’s
one thing you never seem to see: Baby pigeons. They do exist, and… they are ugly. But it’s a reminder that even a bird that’s
everywhere only gives us glimpses into its life. Darwin’s ideas about natural selection were
born on a voyage around the world. But you don’t have to go to exotic places
to have your mind blown by evolution’s awesomeness. Darwin knew that, and that’s why he picked
the pigeon to introduce the world to his theory. If you know where to look, wildlife is everywhere that
we are: just make sure if you look up to admire it, you keep your mouth closed. Stay curious. I want to thank our friends from BBC Earth
for helping us make this episode, because pigeons look awesome in slow-motion. Some of pigeons’ oldest enemies have followed
them to cities: birds of prey. These scientists are studying peregrine falcons
for Planet Earth II, the sequel to the groundbreaking BBC series. It’s part of “Cities”, an entire episode
dedicated to urban wildlife. Of course, birds of prey aren’t pigeons’
only urban predators. For Planet Earth II, the team filmed a pigeon
hunt you have to see to believe. You can find Planet Earth II on BBC One in
the UK and coming soon to BBC America. For more information, check out their website.

**Transcript**:
Human history is intertwined with some of Earth’s mightiest species, but there is one graceful creature that rises above the
rest. Only when seen it in its ideal habitat, can
we truly appreciate this king among birds. Behold: the nobel pigeon.” If you think they’re only good for pooping
on statues, then think again. [OPENING MUSIC] In On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin
presented an idea that changed the world. He knew if he was right, this idea was gonna
turn science on its head, so in chapter 1, you know what he chose as his very first
example? It wasn’t the tortoises, or finches, or
even the giant fossil armadillos he found during his journeys. He chose pigeons. Over giant fossil armadillos. But he had a good reason, and if you think
otherwise, then you’ve never seen FANCY pigeons. These are the birds that got Darwin’s attention,
because underneath all that feathery fashion, is just one species, like dogs with wings
instead of rats with wings. All of that variation was tweaked from one
ancient mold. The wild rock dove. Thousands of years before they were eating
old hot dog buns out of the trash, these birds were found on seaside cliffs, but pretty much
as soon as cities sprung up, they moved in, because to a pigeon, a building is just
a cliff with better architecture. Pigeons are uniquely suited to city life,
but they were only able to conquer all of Earth’s urban areas because we brought them
there. Why? Because we liked feeding them… to ourselves. In fact, from Egypt to Rome to the early 20th
century, the main roles of a pigeon were dinner, or something for rich people to breed into
silly shapes. Over time here and there, a few of these domestic
birds escaped and returned to a “wild” life, they just never left the city. But for some reason along that journey, our opinion
of pigeons went from this… to this. Watch pigeons pecking at the sidewalk and
you’re not looking at the smartest birds in the tree. They can’t solve puzzles like crows. They can’t talk like parrots. A pigeon’s brain is only about the size
of that fingertip… but like most things in nature there’s more to the story. Most of their skull is eyeball: if they were
the size of humans, their eyes would be as big as grapefruits… Those huge eyes have five color receptors,
compared to our three, letting them see things we can’t imagine. One pigeon named Linus was trained to remember
nearly a thousand images. Pigeons can peck out a Monet from a Picasso,
they can even judge if a child’s drawing is good or bad. Pigeons can tell correctly spelled words among
misspelled words, As if they aren’t annoying enough.. They can even put groups of objects in numerical
order, which sounds easy because we’re smart, but pigeons do numbers as well as monkeys
do, Pigeon vision is the bomb. Literally. During WW II, psychologist B.F. Skinner tried
to turn these birds into weapons. He trained pigeons to keep an image centered
on a tiny screen by pecking at it. He hooked this up to a navigation system,
and then loaded it inside of a bomb. He wanted to create explosive missiles piloted
by kamikaze pigeons. He built several successful prototypes using
money from the General Mills cereal company… yes, the people who make Cheerios, but the
Army never let it get off the ground. Pigeon navigation goes a lot farther than
bird bombs. Just like /human/ city-dwellers, pigeons are
commuters, flying out in the morning to find food and coming back at night. They’re tightly bonded to their home, and
this instinct is so strong that we’ve used them as messengers for centuries, like Flapchat
instead of Snapchat. Before Paul Reuter founded a global news service,
he used pigeons to deliver news. During World War I and II, racing pigeons
with names like Cher Ami and GI Joe were given actual medals for delivering messages under
fire. How are pigeons so good at finding their way
home from places they’ve never been? Different experiments have found pigeons use
visual maps, Earth’s magnetic field, the angle of the sun, even smells to navigate. But when scientists knock each of these senses
out, some birds can still find their way home. What we do know is pigeons use a lot of senses,
maybe even some we don’t know about yet. Even though pigeons are everywhere, there’s
one thing you never seem to see: Baby pigeons. They do exist, and… they are ugly. But it’s a reminder that even a bird that’s
everywhere only gives us glimpses into its life. Darwin’s ideas about natural selection were
born on a voyage around the world. But you don’t have to go to exotic places
to have your mind blown by evolution’s awesomeness. Darwin knew that, and that’s why he picked
the pigeon to introduce the world to his theory. If you know where to look, wildlife is everywhere that
we are: just make sure if you look up to admire it, you keep your mouth closed. Stay curious. I want to thank our friends from BBC Earth
for helping us make this episode, because pigeons look awesome in slow-motion. Some of pigeons’ oldest enemies have followed
them to cities: birds of prey. These scientists are studying peregrine falcons
for Planet Earth II, the sequel to the groundbreaking BBC series. It’s part of “Cities”, an entire episode
dedicated to urban wildlife. Of course, birds of prey aren’t pigeons’
only urban predators. For Planet Earth II, the team filmed a pigeon
hunt you have to see to believe. You can find Planet Earth II on BBC One in
the UK and coming soon to BBC America. For more information, check out their website.

**Transcript**:
High over the water off the California coast,
riding the air on eight feet of wings, a brown pelican spots its target below. They have a pretty effective way to catch
that fish. First they take aim…bank left... Then dive downward at 40 miles an hour. Bulls-eye! But one mistake, and they could wind up with
a broken wing, a snapped neck, even blind. So how does this massive bird survive a 40-foot
drop onto rock-hard water? A big part of it is just good form. See how the wings shoot back right before
impact? That safeguards the delicate bones there. At the same instant, powerful muscles tense
around the spine, keeping the bird from snapping its neck. While sheaths called nictitating membranes slide over the eyes like a pair of swim goggles. But most of the credit goes to that magnificent,
sword-shaped bill. It’s contoured to slice into the surface
at high speed with almost no drag. Pelicans are surface hunters, not divers. When they hit the water, they also hit the
brakes, reaching with their necks to snag fish. They slow down thanks to a built-in life vest,
a special network of extra air sacs under the skin around their neck and belly, even
in their bones. When it plummets, the pelican takes a deep
breath and air rushes into those tiny caverns, called pneumatic foramina. That air cushions the impact and makes them
float. And this bird comes equipped with another
flotation device. Meet the gular pouch. See how it pops open, like a parachute? That also helps slow the bird down. It’s made of super-stretchy skin, re-enforced
with collagen fibers that keep it from breaking. Pretty handy fishing net, too, thanks to extra-flexible
jaw that can open sideways….not just up and down. A pelican’s pouch holds much more than its
belly can, about three gallons of water, which has to be squeezed out before the big gulp. The whole routine takes practice. These young ones have got some room for improvement. But pelicans have been making it work for
an incredibly long time. This fossil is 30 million years old, and it's
almost identical to the aerodynamic high-divers that you see living today. This pelican looks more red than brown, right? That’s a sign that it’s breeding season,
which for California pelicans, is in the winter. That’s when they get gussied up and head
south to Baja. Don’t miss a single Deep Look! Sign up for our newsletter to get a new video

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
High over the water off the California coast,
riding the air on eight feet of wings, a brown pelican spots its target below. They have a pretty effective way to catch
that fish. First they take aim…bank left... Then dive downward at 40 miles an hour. Bulls-eye! But one mistake, and they could wind up with
a broken wing, a snapped neck, even blind. So how does this massive bird survive a 40-foot
drop onto rock-hard water? A big part of it is just good form. See how the wings shoot back right before
impact? That safeguards the delicate bones there. At the same instant, powerful muscles tense
around the spine, keeping the bird from snapping its neck. While sheaths called nictitating membranes slide over the eyes like a pair of swim goggles. But most of the credit goes to that magnificent,
sword-shaped bill. It’s contoured to slice into the surface
at high speed with almost no drag. Pelicans are surface hunters, not divers. When they hit the water, they also hit the
brakes, reaching with their necks to snag fish. They slow down thanks to a built-in life vest,
a special network of extra air sacs under the skin around their neck and belly, even
in their bones. When it plummets, the pelican takes a deep
breath and air rushes into those tiny caverns, called pneumatic foramina. That air cushions the impact and makes them
float. And this bird comes equipped with another
flotation device. Meet the gular pouch. See how it pops open, like a parachute? That also helps slow the bird down. It’s made of super-stretchy skin, re-enforced
with collagen fibers that keep it from breaking. Pretty handy fishing net, too, thanks to extra-flexible
jaw that can open sideways….not just up and down. A pelican’s pouch holds much more than its
belly can, about three gallons of water, which has to be squeezed out before the big gulp. The whole routine takes practice. These young ones have got some room for improvement. But pelicans have been making it work for
an incredibly long time. This fossil is 30 million years old, and it's
almost identical to the aerodynamic high-divers that you see living today. This pelican looks more red than brown, right? That’s a sign that it’s breeding season,

**Transcript**:
Whether you’re swimming or washing the dishes
or just taking nice, long, well-deserved bath --- if you’re immersed in water for longer
than 10 minutes, chances are your fingers and toes will emerge looking like raisins. So what’s up with the wrinkled digits? For years, scientists thought the phenomenon
was the result of a type of osmosis, caused by water passing into the dry outer layer
of skin. The influx of water, the thinking went, would
expand the skin’s surface area, but not the tissue below it, so the skin would bunch
up and wrinkle. But in 1935, a pair of doctors noticed that
this effect didn’t happen in their patients with nerve damage. One patient, for example, was a boy who had
lost the feeling in three of his fingers. The researchers found that, when his hand
got wet, the fingers that he could feel wrinkled as normal, but the ones that were numb remained
smooth. It turned out that pruney digits weren’t
caused just by the passive flow of water through the skin -- it was an active response of the
nervous system to prolonged moisture. The nervous system causes the wrinkling by
constricting blood vessels below the skin, which causes the upper layers of skin to pucker. Since the phenomenon is caused by an involuntary
nerve response, some biologists have thought that it must have some evolutionary function. But what possible purpose could it serve? One recent theory suggests that wrinkly skin
may have given our ancestors a better grip while working in wet conditions -- like gathering
food from a stream or damp vegetation. And it may also have given us better footing
while walking across slippery landscapes in the rain. In a 2013 study, evolutionary biologists tested
this theory by asking subjects with either wrinkly and non-wrinkly fingers to pick up
a variety of wet and dry objects, like marbles. They found that the subjects with wrinkly
digits picked up the wet objects 12 percent faster than their counterparts. But there was no difference when it came to
picking up dry objects. The wrinkles apparently helped channel the
water away, much like the treads on your car’s tires. But then this raises the question: If wrinkly
skin gives us a better grip, then why isn’t our skin wrinkly ALL of the time? Well, maybe because shriveled fingers and
toes are less sensitive, which is no advantage at all. Thanks for asking! And if you’d like to submit questions for

**Transcript**:
It seems natural to most of us that we
shouldn't burp loudly in front of strangers, touch their behinds without
permission or spit in the face of those who annoy us but history shows us a
different story. What we might take to be normal impulses
to be modest, restrained and dignified are the hard-won fruits of a long and always
unsteady civilizing process. Human beings have gradually and
painfully learned to tame the beast inside for the sake of propriety and
kindness. At a moment in time when some people question manners and the pressures they impose on us, it can be fruitful to look back in time
in order to trace key moments in the history of manners and to search their
by for the future of manners. 13,000 BC, Gough's Cave, Somerset, England W're in a cave in what's known as The Magdalenian period, one of the later cultures of the Upper
Paleolithic Age in Western Europe. Our ancestors have learned to use harpoons made of bone antlers. They've domesticated dogs and in their
spare time have developed a taste for making remarkable images of the fiercest
wildlife around them especially hyena reindeer and mammoths. We look a little different from the way we do now: our bodies are generally heavier and
more solid with strong musculature and straight foreheads with only slight brow
ridges and prominent chins. Our manners would surprise us to: we sleep around a lot and openly. There is a lot of what we now call
rape. We do everything in front of one another in our caves and most strikingly
we have an occasional habit of eating our human enemies. Following a squabble the leader of a
group will take an enemy severed head carefully remove the brains and tissues
and prepare the skull for use as a ceremonial drinking vessel. Primitive humans don't do manners. Circus Maximus, Rome, 20 AD We are at one of the high points
of ancient civilization in the West. In many areas of daily life we won't have this many manners and complex etiquette for another 1400 years
at least. We're taking fascinating care to tame nature within us. For the wealthy ones among us at least we've taken to having at least a bath a week, to removing nasal hair, ? tailing displays of violence, to policing the way men behave towards women, to carving chicken and fish and brushing our teeth a lot, conscious of our bad breath and its effect on the
sensitivities of others. However, with little knowledge of odontology Romans use a variety of somewhat random ingredients for toothpaste: crushed bone and oyster shell is popular, horse urine is another favorite especially from Iberian breeds. The specifics of the Roman approach to oral hygiene may be questionable but the mentality is advanced and fascinating. Good personal appearance and cleanliness are believed to be what set Romans apart in their minds from what they term the
Barbaria: the people who live north of the famous olive line, the line above which the noble olive tree will not grow, the Germanics and Celts among them. Humanity will have to wait a while until
Charlemagne is next recorded as brushing his teeth with thyme. Poitiers, France, 1152 French Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine marries Henry II of England at her court in the South of France. She employs a poet, the troubadour Bernart de Ventadorn to compose songs of love for her and her husband. This sounds merely romantic but the
songs are not simple sentimentality. They are part of Eleanor's subtle
attempt to civilize her husband and the men around him by putting into verse how a good man should treat his lady. She and her ladies-in-waiting learn to use poetry to set expectations of how military men should act around women. Slowly thanks in part to Eleanor and
attitude known as chivalry develops in the courts of Europe: an idea that men
need to moderate their force and sexual impulses to protect what is termed the
honor and dignity of women. Eleanor of Aquitaine is making an early
highly coded call from ?? to what we would nowadays more bluntly term sexual harassment. London, England, 1209 The Book of the Civilized Man is published by Daniel of Beccles. It's a poem written in Latin that explains how to act with courtesy
and decorum in social situations. It advises for example if you wish to
belch remember to look up to the ceiling, do not attack your enemy while he is
squatting to defecate, never pest a lady or look too closely at their dress. Don't mount your horse in the hole and
in front of grandees do not openly excavate your nostril by twisting your
fingers. Slowly the aristocracy is becoming more self-aware about its conduct in social circumstances. In particular, men are being asked to behave with more decorum around women and as an ever-increasing sensor of picking one's
nose in public. Murano, Venice 1450 A new kind of tableware, the Venetian glass goblet or flute takes Europe by storm, under the direction of the Venetian
master glass-maker Angelo Barovier. On the island of Murano, some 3,000 glass blowers are sating demand for a new highly delicate and ornamented kind of glass. Part of the reason for the demand is that the glasses are extremely easy to break. Any slightly rough handling of them and they shatter like a dry autumn leaf. The Venetian drinking glass is not fragile because of a deficiency or by mistake; it's not as if its maker was trying to
make it tough and hardy and then stupidly ended up with something a child could snap. It is fragile and easily harmed as the consequence of a deliberate search for extreme delicacy. The underlying thesis is that it's the
duty of civilization to create environments where it's okay to be fragile. It's obvious the glass could easily be
smashed so it forces people especially men to use their fingers very tenderly. It teaches people that moderation is
admirable and elegant not just a tedious demand. It tells us that being careful is
glamorous and exciting even fashionable. It's a moral tale about gentleness told
by means of a drinking vessel. The Venetian glass makes a big claim: being mannered and civilized involves being aware of the effect of one's strength on others. Marseille, France, 1533 14-year-old Catherine de' Medici marries the future Henry II of France. Her home city of Florence is by now the epicenter of culture in the Western world. And she brings with her new culinary fashions that quickly become all the rage:
macaroons, gelato and most significantly a collection of forks. The fork adds a bizarre complication to
the rituals of eating dinner: instead of using our fingers which are ideally made for tearing meat off the bone fast, we'll slow down on purpose and may use the strange new instrument so as to temper and guide our appetite. The fork quickly spreads around Europe, by 1600 no European court is without a large set of forks. This marks out the savages from the
civilized. Marais, Paris, 1750 A Swiss philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau publishes an extraordinary essay: "A Discourse on the Arts and Sciences". What makes it so revolutionary and such a milestone in the history of manners is that for the first time in Western
culture an author sticks up for the so called "un-mannered savage". For the guys who would have ? not brush their teeth, never employed a fork and had a lot of nasal hair, but whom Russo now contrast favorably with modern mannered
people. Rousseau tells us that people living in
what he calls the state of nature were in his eyes far superior to educated and mannered Parisians. Their manners may have been simple but they were honest and
forthright without the sins of what he now terms the "over-civilized". Russa retells the story of civilization as one of loss and decline, from a primordial state of fresh-faced curiosity, honesty and enthusiasm to barbarous over
politeness, fakery and deceit. He describes the elaborate French
court Versay as less civilized than an early human cave. Readers across Europe are astonished and not a little impressed by this impudence. For hundreds of years moralists have been arguing that our natural selves are wild, harmful, over-sexual and dangerous and that we must
learn to a tame them for the sake of others. Now Russo suggest the diametrical
opposite: civilization has gone too far, it's our mannered selves that have become the problem, and the task of a properly evolved civilization is to throw off the
chains of manners, to relax us, strip off the etiquette and return to primitive
frankness. Russo's point continues to echo down to our own times. It is his voice we
can here whenever someone sticks up for the simpler life and suggest we dress
less formally, eat dinner more casually and more readily say whatever is passing through our minds. New York, United States, 1827 A French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville is on a tour of the young United States, in an effort to understand the spirit of a new kind of society: A democracy. He is immediately struck by American
manners or lack thereof. In Europe, reflects de Tocqueville manners have been codified to emphasize hierarchical differences between people. Ordinary people defer to aristocrats, aristocrats to royalty and so on but in
the United States everything is done so as to suggest that there are no differences between people. No one takes off their hat to anyone, a
postman can casually greet a judge, a mule driver can strike up cheerful banter
with a wealthy merchant, and one can not tell by someone's clothes whether they
might be living in a mansion or a hut. Expressions like "how you doing" and "hi" are heard everywhere across the new republic. It could be charming but the
aristocratic de Tocqueville wryly notes a problem: these casual
manners do not do away with class and wealth
differences, they merely sentimentally disguise them. The manners of old Europe
have been accused of being cruel in their stress on hierarchy but now
de Tocqueville  accuses American casual democratic manners of their own kind of cruelty: because they pretend that everyone is in the same boat when clearly they're not really. At least in old Europe everyone knew who the king and the aristocrats were, adds de Tocqueville. Now the casual manners teach everyone to think of themselves as alike and encourage them to dream of making it to the top of the pile. But when society remains very unequal
and opportunities for genuine advancement and not as widespread as is
thought then bitterness and a sense of failure are likely to be the result to
de Tocqueville ? notes. Casual manners can be their own form of
fakery. Northern Ireland, June 2013 At a meeting of the G8
developed countries a few eyebrows are raised when some of the most powerful
men in the world including Barrack Obama of the United States David Cameron of the United Kingdom and François Hollande of France all appear at a press conference without ties. The men also hug and in some cases high-five each other during the course
of the summit. The absence of ties is an inadvertent and continuing tribute to Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Ties have been deemed a symbol of oppression and hierarchy by the people who control the nuclear codes and direct the world economy. Between 1996 and 2008 sales of ties in the U.S halved. In the UK, the Tirerack company, for 20 years the country's biggest seller of ties goes into administration in late 2014. By early 2015 in The United States only 18 percent of male employees regularly wear a tie to work. One-third show up in jeans at least once a week. Southwark Crown Court, London, September 2014 Eleanor of Aquitaine's long campaign to civilized men reaches a new milestone: A minor British DJ Dave Lee Travis is
found guilty of indecently assaulting a woman two decades earlier. He is accused by a judge of having
displayed primitive behavior when he groped a young female employees breasts at his radio offices. Patting bottoms, eyeing breasts and throwing out leary comments is now deemed deeply anachronistic and vile manners. Dave Lee Travis, a 69 year old father of two is roundly punished and humiliated for his actions. Travis is in a long line of men who in
the early 21st century are called to account for their behavior towards women. They are puzzled and at a certain level
incensed by this. They had come of age in a period when Victorian manners towards women were on the retreat seen as outdated and
hypocritical. These men had believed in messages about casualness and sexual
liberation but it seems they had fatally misinterpreted what a world with a few
less sexual manners would actually be like. Slowly society is learning to re-heed some of the basic lessons of Victorian etiquette books always stressed: That men must be
careful around women, that they must never touch or look at them
inappropriately and that the overwhelming priority is never to cause
anyone else discomfort through one's advances. Men like Dave Lee Travis are
judged to be pathological and sexual predators. Looked at through a longer lens
they could also simply be accused of having forgotten their manners. The history of manners shows an ongoing
search for the best way to be kind. For long periods, it seemed that being mannered had to be about hiding and moderating the inner self which was associated with something beastly and cruel. Then under the
influence of Rousseau and the Romantic philosophy to which he gave birth good manners were associated with being
natural and free, letting out the inner self which was deemed to be good and
spontaneously kind. But we have come to learn that there are in fact limitations
to the natural approach. There is unwitting cruelty and political
subterfuge in the defense of natural manners which suggests we're all equal
when we're not which allow one gender to pester another. there's a fine line between being natural about things and being bothersome to others. Aline we are continuing to explore often at great cost to all concerned. There are no doubt many behaviors which many of us
subscribe to now which a later age may come to see is no less vulgar than
Catherine de Medici found a meal without a fork. The aspiration to be well-mannered
shouldn't be seen as pretentious or fake. It should be generously
interpreted as always belonging to a highly important wish not to cause other
people distress through one's impulses and needs. The history of manners goes on.

**Transcript**:
It seems natural to most of us that we
shouldn't burp loudly in front of strangers, touch their behinds without
permission or spit in the face of those who annoy us but history shows us a
different story. What we might take to be normal impulses
to be modest, restrained and dignified are the hard-won fruits of a long and always
unsteady civilizing process. Human beings have gradually and
painfully learned to tame the beast inside for the sake of propriety and
kindness. At a moment in time when some people question manners and the pressures they impose on us, it can be fruitful to look back in time
in order to trace key moments in the history of manners and to search their
by for the future of manners. 13,000 BC, Gough's Cave, Somerset, England W're in a cave in what's known as The Magdalenian period, one of the later cultures of the Upper
Paleolithic Age in Western Europe. Our ancestors have learned to use harpoons made of bone antlers. They've domesticated dogs and in their
spare time have developed a taste for making remarkable images of the fiercest
wildlife around them especially hyena reindeer and mammoths. We look a little different from the way we do now: our bodies are generally heavier and
more solid with strong musculature and straight foreheads with only slight brow
ridges and prominent chins. Our manners would surprise us to: we sleep around a lot and openly. There is a lot of what we now call
rape. We do everything in front of one another in our caves and most strikingly
we have an occasional habit of eating our human enemies. Following a squabble the leader of a
group will take an enemy severed head carefully remove the brains and tissues
and prepare the skull for use as a ceremonial drinking vessel. Primitive humans don't do manners. Circus Maximus, Rome, 20 AD We are at one of the high points
of ancient civilization in the West. In many areas of daily life we won't have this many manners and complex etiquette for another 1400 years
at least. We're taking fascinating care to tame nature within us. For the wealthy ones among us at least we've taken to having at least a bath a week, to removing nasal hair, ? tailing displays of violence, to policing the way men behave towards women, to carving chicken and fish and brushing our teeth a lot, conscious of our bad breath and its effect on the
sensitivities of others. However, with little knowledge of odontology Romans use a variety of somewhat random ingredients for toothpaste: crushed bone and oyster shell is popular, horse urine is another favorite especially from Iberian breeds. The specifics of the Roman approach to oral hygiene may be questionable but the mentality is advanced and fascinating. Good personal appearance and cleanliness are believed to be what set Romans apart in their minds from what they term the
Barbaria: the people who live north of the famous olive line, the line above which the noble olive tree will not grow, the Germanics and Celts among them. Humanity will have to wait a while until
Charlemagne is next recorded as brushing his teeth with thyme. Poitiers, France, 1152 French Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine marries Henry II of England at her court in the South of France. She employs a poet, the troubadour Bernart de Ventadorn to compose songs of love for her and her husband. This sounds merely romantic but the
songs are not simple sentimentality. They are part of Eleanor's subtle
attempt to civilize her husband and the men around him by putting into verse how a good man should treat his lady. She and her ladies-in-waiting learn to use poetry to set expectations of how military men should act around women. Slowly thanks in part to Eleanor and
attitude known as chivalry develops in the courts of Europe: an idea that men
need to moderate their force and sexual impulses to protect what is termed the
honor and dignity of women. Eleanor of Aquitaine is making an early
highly coded call from ?? to what we would nowadays more bluntly term sexual harassment. London, England, 1209 The Book of the Civilized Man is published by Daniel of Beccles. It's a poem written in Latin that explains how to act with courtesy
and decorum in social situations. It advises for example if you wish to
belch remember to look up to the ceiling, do not attack your enemy while he is
squatting to defecate, never pest a lady or look too closely at their dress. Don't mount your horse in the hole and
in front of grandees do not openly excavate your nostril by twisting your
fingers. Slowly the aristocracy is becoming more self-aware about its conduct in social circumstances. In particular, men are being asked to behave with more decorum around women and as an ever-increasing sensor of picking one's
nose in public. Murano, Venice 1450 A new kind of tableware, the Venetian glass goblet or flute takes Europe by storm, under the direction of the Venetian
master glass-maker Angelo Barovier. On the island of Murano, some 3,000 glass blowers are sating demand for a new highly delicate and ornamented kind of glass. Part of the reason for the demand is that the glasses are extremely easy to break. Any slightly rough handling of them and they shatter like a dry autumn leaf. The Venetian drinking glass is not fragile because of a deficiency or by mistake; it's not as if its maker was trying to
make it tough and hardy and then stupidly ended up with something a child could snap. It is fragile and easily harmed as the consequence of a deliberate search for extreme delicacy. The underlying thesis is that it's the
duty of civilization to create environments where it's okay to be fragile. It's obvious the glass could easily be
smashed so it forces people especially men to use their fingers very tenderly. It teaches people that moderation is
admirable and elegant not just a tedious demand. It tells us that being careful is
glamorous and exciting even fashionable. It's a moral tale about gentleness told
by means of a drinking vessel. The Venetian glass makes a big claim: being mannered and civilized involves being aware of the effect of one's strength on others. Marseille, France, 1533 14-year-old Catherine de' Medici marries the future Henry II of France. Her home city of Florence is by now the epicenter of culture in the Western world. And she brings with her new culinary fashions that quickly become all the rage:
macaroons, gelato and most significantly a collection of forks. The fork adds a bizarre complication to
the rituals of eating dinner: instead of using our fingers which are ideally made for tearing meat off the bone fast, we'll slow down on purpose and may use the strange new instrument so as to temper and guide our appetite. The fork quickly spreads around Europe, by 1600 no European court is without a large set of forks. This marks out the savages from the
civilized. Marais, Paris, 1750 A Swiss philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau publishes an extraordinary essay: "A Discourse on the Arts and Sciences". What makes it so revolutionary and such a milestone in the history of manners is that for the first time in Western
culture an author sticks up for the so called "un-mannered savage". For the guys who would have ? not brush their teeth, never employed a fork and had a lot of nasal hair, but whom Russo now contrast favorably with modern mannered
people. Rousseau tells us that people living in
what he calls the state of nature were in his eyes far superior to educated and mannered Parisians. Their manners may have been simple but they were honest and
forthright without the sins of what he now terms the "over-civilized". Russa retells the story of civilization as one of loss and decline, from a primordial state of fresh-faced curiosity, honesty and enthusiasm to barbarous over
politeness, fakery and deceit. He describes the elaborate French
court Versay as less civilized than an early human cave. Readers across Europe are astonished and not a little impressed by this impudence. For hundreds of years moralists have been arguing that our natural selves are wild, harmful, over-sexual and dangerous and that we must
learn to a tame them for the sake of others. Now Russo suggest the diametrical
opposite: civilization has gone too far, it's our mannered selves that have become the problem, and the task of a properly evolved civilization is to throw off the
chains of manners, to relax us, strip off the etiquette and return to primitive
frankness. Russo's point continues to echo down to our own times. It is his voice we
can here whenever someone sticks up for the simpler life and suggest we dress
less formally, eat dinner more casually and more readily say whatever is passing through our minds. New York, United States, 1827 A French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville is on a tour of the young United States, in an effort to understand the spirit of a new kind of society: A democracy. He is immediately struck by American
manners or lack thereof. In Europe, reflects de Tocqueville manners have been codified to emphasize hierarchical differences between people. Ordinary people defer to aristocrats, aristocrats to royalty and so on but in
the United States everything is done so as to suggest that there are no differences between people. No one takes off their hat to anyone, a
postman can casually greet a judge, a mule driver can strike up cheerful banter
with a wealthy merchant, and one can not tell by someone's clothes whether they
might be living in a mansion or a hut. Expressions like "how you doing" and "hi" are heard everywhere across the new republic. It could be charming but the
aristocratic de Tocqueville wryly notes a problem: these casual
manners do not do away with class and wealth
differences, they merely sentimentally disguise them. The manners of old Europe
have been accused of being cruel in their stress on hierarchy but now
de Tocqueville  accuses American casual democratic manners of their own kind of cruelty: because they pretend that everyone is in the same boat when clearly they're not really. At least in old Europe everyone knew who the king and the aristocrats were, adds de Tocqueville. Now the casual manners teach everyone to think of themselves as alike and encourage them to dream of making it to the top of the pile. But when society remains very unequal
and opportunities for genuine advancement and not as widespread as is
thought then bitterness and a sense of failure are likely to be the result to
de Tocqueville ? notes. Casual manners can be their own form of
fakery. Northern Ireland, June 2013 At a meeting of the G8
developed countries a few eyebrows are raised when some of the most powerful
men in the world including Barrack Obama of the United States David Cameron of the United Kingdom and François Hollande of France all appear at a press conference without ties. The men also hug and in some cases high-five each other during the course

By early 2015 in The United States only 18 percent of male employees regularly wear a tie to work. One-third show up in jeans at least once a week.

You know that the best way to prevent the
spread of coronavirus is to wash your hands. Wash your hands, doo doo, doo doo, doo doo. Wash your hands! But … why? It’s because soap — regular soap, fancy
honeysuckle soap, artisan peppermint soap, just any soap — absolutely annihilates viruses
like the coronavirus. Here’s how. This is what a virus, like coronavirus, looks
like. It’s a bit of material surrounded by a coating
of proteins — and fat. Viruses easily stick to places like your hands,
but when you rinse your hands with just water, it rushes right over the virus. That’s because that layer of fat makes the
virus behave kind of like a drop of oil. You can see it happening in this demonstration. Oils are just liquid fats. What happens when you pour oil into water? It floats — it doesn’t mix. But add soap… And suddenly that fatty oil dissolves into
the water. That’s because inside, soap has two-sided
molecules. One end of the molecule is attracted to water,
the other end to fat. So when the soap molecules come in contact
with water and fat, these dual attractions literally pull the fat apart, surrounding
the oil particles and dispersing them through the water.   Let’s go back to our coronavirus molecule. With that layer of fat holding everything
together. When it interacts with soap … bam! The fat gets pulled out by the soap. Soap literally pulls apart and demolishes
these viruses. And then the water rinses the harmless, leftover
shards of virus down the drain. But, and you know where I'm going with this, it takes time for this effect to happen. 20 seconds, to be specific. To show why, we ordered this lotion that mimics
viruses and their fatty layers. It glows under a UV light. If you just rinse your hands under regular
water … nothing comes off. If you wash for just 5 seconds or 10 seconds,
your hands are still covered. The virus is still here, able to get you and
others sick. But 20 full seconds: Now the soap is actually
destroying the virus. Hand sanitizer works too, because it’s mostly
alcohol, and alcohol works in a somewhat similar way to soap, breaking down that fatty layer. You need a high concentration of alcohol to
make that work. The CDC recommends hand sanitizers with at
least 60% alcohol. But even with 60% alcohol, the CDC recommends
using soap if you can. If your hands are sweaty or dirty when you
use the sanitizer, that can dilute it and diminish its effectiveness. As for soap, just any old soap works. You don’t need soap marketed as antibacterial,
even. The FDA says skip it — there’s no proof
it is any more effective. Just be sure to wash your hands. For 20 seconds. That’s “Happy Birthday” twice. Or the chorus to Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts.” Or Prince. Or Eminem. Or even Dolly. Just as long as it’s 20 seconds. And you’re using the ultimate virus annihilator:
soap.

**Transcript**:
You know that the best way to prevent the
spread of coronavirus is to wash your hands. Wash your hands, doo doo, doo doo, doo doo. Wash your hands! But … why? It’s because soap — regular soap, fancy
honeysuckle soap, artisan peppermint soap, just any soap — absolutely annihilates viruses
like the coronavirus. Here’s how. This is what a virus, like coronavirus, looks
like. It’s a bit of material surrounded by a coating
of proteins — and fat. Viruses easily stick to places like your hands,
but when you rinse your hands with just water, it rushes right over the virus. That’s because that layer of fat makes the
virus behave kind of like a drop of oil. You can see it happening in this demonstration. Oils are just liquid fats. What happens when you pour oil into water? It floats — it doesn’t mix. But add soap… And suddenly that fatty oil dissolves into
the water. That’s because inside, soap has two-sided
molecules. One end of the molecule is attracted to water,
the other end to fat. So when the soap molecules come in contact
with water and fat, these dual attractions literally pull the fat apart, surrounding
the oil particles and dispersing them through the water.   Let’s go back to our coronavirus molecule. With that layer of fat holding everything
together. When it interacts with soap … bam! The fat gets pulled out by the soap. Soap literally pulls apart and demolishes
these viruses. And then the water rinses the harmless, leftover
shards of virus down the drain. But, and you know where I'm going with this, it takes time for this effect to happen. 20 seconds, to be specific. To show why, we ordered this lotion that mimics
viruses and their fatty layers. It glows under a UV light. If you just rinse your hands under regular
water … nothing comes off. If you wash for just 5 seconds or 10 seconds,
your hands are still covered. The virus is still here, able to get you and
others sick. But 20 full seconds: Now the soap is actually
destroying the virus. Hand sanitizer works too, because it’s mostly
alcohol, and alcohol works in a somewhat similar way to soap, breaking down that fatty layer. You need a high concentration of alcohol to
make that work. The CDC recommends hand sanitizers with at
least 60% alcohol. But even with 60% alcohol, the CDC recommends
using soap if you can. If your hands are sweaty or dirty when you
use the sanitizer, that can dilute it and diminish its effectiveness. As for soap, just any old soap works. You don’t need soap marketed as antibacterial,
even. The FDA says skip it — there’s no proof
it is any more effective. Just be sure to wash your hands. For 20 seconds. That’s “Happy Birthday” twice. Or the chorus to Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts.” Or Prince. Or Eminem. Or even Dolly. Just as long as it’s 20 seconds. And you’re using the ultimate virus annihilator:
soap.

**Transcript**:
Okay, humans, we make a lot of garbage, and we don't have any perfect solutions for what to do with it. So, instead of just putting it under the ground, why don't we just throw it into the volcanoes? Well, as convenient as burning our trash into oblivion might sound, a couple of major reasons to consider. For one thing sending all that trash to the nearest active Volcano could get pretty expensive, especially because lots of places are thousands of kilometers away from a volcano while most cities send their trash tens or hundreds of kilometres to landfills. Some cities also burn a lot of their trash in incineration plants and use that heat to make electricity, so electric bills could go up if we started using volcanoes instead. But different places already handle trash differently, so why don't cities near volcanoes just use them as big flaming trash piles? Well, cost isn't the only problem here. Volcanoes aren't usually the bubbling pits of exposed lava that you see in movies and cartoons. Many volcanoes just look like mountains or hills with a crater near the top and if the craters are filled with anything, liquid water is more common than a lava lake. So you would have to wait for those kinds of volcanoes to erupt and then drop your trash in, which is incredibly dangerous; lots of those eruptions can be pretty violent. Or you can try to drill down into a Volcano's magma chamber, where the Molten rock sits under lots of pressure until eruption. Given how hard it is to predict what exactly will flip a volcano's switch, drilling down into that super pressurized chamber or shooting trash into the magma probably aren't great ideas either. Other kinds of volcanoes like Kilauea in Hawaii have pretty constant calm lava flows. But even though slow-moving lava might seem like a safer and easier way to get rid of garbage, there is another big issue. Clumps of organic matter like food scraps don't just burn when they hit lava, they explode. Very sadly there is little research into why these explosions happen, but there are plenty of experiments and YouTube videos that show pretty clearly that they do, which does not mean that you should, like, give it a try for fun. The most likely explanation is that any water in the trash immediately boils when it hits some thousand-degree molten lava. That steam expands, forcing the trash and lava out of the way to create an explosive fountain of molten rock. But we don't know for sure, so get on it science! What we do know is that with your average american generating a couple of kilograms of trash a day, that would be a lot of exploding lava. Not to mention the stuff that probably wouldn't explode, like plastic, tends to give off dangerous fumes when burned, which is a whole other problem. So even if you live near an active volcano and even if there's lava at the surface and even if it sounds kind of cool, don't use it as your garbage disposal. A controlled science experiment or two may be fine but tons of trash creating noxious lava fountains, not so much. Thanks to our Patreon patrons for asking. If you would like to learn more about trash, you can check out our video on how we dealt with it over time a hundred percent without volcanoes. *SciShow Jingle*

**Transcript**:
This is what a macaque monkey would sound
like if it suddenly proposed. Yeah, I hate it too. Let’s play it again: Now of course, that’s not a real monkey, it’s
a computer simulation that was part of a study on monkey vocal tracts.
And what it shows is that monkeys have a strikingly similar vocal structure to humans. But despite all these similarities, they can’t
speak So here’s a question.
Compared to monkeys, birds are nothing like us. Yet this bird’s talking to me right now. How? Birds don’t have lips. They don’t have
teeth, their “nose” is totally different from
ours, but they do have something we don’t. They actually have a different
kind of voice box than we do. It's called a syrinx. This is Mya Thompson – She studies birds
at Cornell University. They actually have two independent voice boxes. In birds, and in humans, the lower respiratory system is shaped sort of like an upside down
slingshot. The top part is the trachea, or windpipe, the bottom part is the lungs, and
these two pieces move air in and out. In humans, the voice box is called the larynx,
and it’s located above the trachea. It contains vocal “folds” that vibrate when air flows
through to produce sound. And humans primarily shape that sound with
their mouths. But in birds, the voice box is called the
"syrinx". And it’s at the bottom of the trachea. Instead of just sending air through vocal
folds like we do, birds actually control the muscles on the walls of the syrinx to shape
and produce sound. Take a look at this cardinal as it sings. You can actually see that the noise comes
directly from the chest. The bird extends and shortens its neck and opens or closes its
beak to refine the noise, but most of the control is actually happening in the syrinx. It’s a powerful sound for such a small animal,
but that’s not even the most impressive part: Cardinals tend to make these "whoop" notes and they go by very very quickly. They're
able to produce more pitches than a piano in less than a tenth of a second. They're actually switching from
one side of the syrinx to another seamlessly to make this very very incredible span of
pitches. The syrinx also lets some birds replicate
sounds with astonishing accuracy. For example, BBC Wildlife caught a lyrebird
perfectly imitating a camera in the wild And of course, some of them imitate us. Parrots are born communicators. From the start
their brains are wired for speech. So when they're first hatched they're learning right away and they're learning from
everything around them. But speaking human is no easy feat. We’ve got our vowels
A - E - I - O - U. Our plosives
“Pocket”. And a variety of consonants – that we
even sometimes struggle to enunciate clearly So to pull off such clarity in human speech, parrots
really show off their ability to manipulate their vocal tract.
Plosives, for example, require using our lips. To make up for the lack of lips, parrots use something called esophageal speech – it's almost
like burping that comes from within the trachea. The force of air replicates the plosive. As for vowels, where we use our lips, tongue and jaw,
researchers have found that parrots move their tongues forward and backward and adjust their
beak opening to alter the sound. It seems like they are the only
birds that are actually using their tongue like humans do to shape the sound that's coming
out. Parrots have a natural desire to communicate.
In the wild they form strong bonds with their flocks, but in captivity, the parrot forms a social bond with you and they want to communicate with you and
they have the vocal anatomy to start mimicking you. When parrots live with us, we’re their flock and they’re determined to sing our song. So in this video I showed you some of the physiology that lets birds produce sounds. But I wanted a quick and easy way to show you some of the interesting background research on the neurology that allows some of them to speak. So I created a website with Wix, where I've compiled a bunch of extras, including research and related content that gets you inside the brains of these animals. It's a super easy way to make a website, so click on the link below to make your own. Wix doesn't directly impact editorial, but their support does make videos like this one possible, so go check them out.

So in this video I showed you some of the physiology that lets birds produce sounds. But I wanted a quick and easy way to show you some of the interesting background research on the neurology that allows some of them to speak. So I created a website with Wix, where I've compiled a bunch of extras, including research and related content that gets you inside the brains of these animals. It's a super easy way to make a website, so click on the link below to make your own. Wix doesn't directly impact editorial, but their support does make videos like this one possible, so go check them out.

**Transcript**:
In December 2019 the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities. In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days. This virus is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 that causes the disease called Covid-19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus. What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do? [Intro Music] A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins, arguably not even a living thing. It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell. Corona may spread via surfaces, but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them. Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection when people cough, or if you touch someone who's ill and then your face, say rubbing your eyes or nose. The virus starts its journey here, and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into the body Its destinations are the intestines, the spleen or the lungs, where it can have the most dramatic effect. Even just a few corona viruses can cause quite a dramatic situation. The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells. These are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa waiting to be infected. Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victim's membranes to inject its genetic material. The cell, ignorant of what's happening, executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple: copy and reassemble. It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical point and receives one final order, self-destruct. The cell sort of melts away, releasing new corona particles ready to attack more cells. The number of infected cells grows exponentially After about 10 days, millions of body cells are infected, and billions of viruses swarmed the lungs. The virus has not caused too much damage yet, but corona is now going to release a real beast on you, your own immune system. The immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself and needs tight regulation. And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, Corona infects some of them and creates confusion. Cells have neither ears nor eyes. They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines. Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them. Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder. In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage. Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc. First, neutrophils, which are great at killing stuff, including our cells. As they arrive in their thousands, they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends as enemies. The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T-cells, which usually order infected cells to commit controlled suicide. Confused as they are, they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too. The more and more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy lung tissue they kill. This might get so bad that it can cause permanent irreversible damage, that leads to lifelong disabilities. In most cases, the immune system slowly regains control. It kills the infected cells, intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones and cleans up the battlefield. Recovery begins. The majority of people infected by Corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms. But many cases become severe or even critical. We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified, but it's safe to say that there is a lot more than with the flu. In more severe cases, Millions of epithelial cells have died and with them, the lungs' protective lining is gone. That means that the alveoli - tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs - can be infected by bacteria that aren't usually a big problem. Patients get pneumonia. Respiration becomes hard or even fails, and patients need ventilators to survive. The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons. And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply, it is overwhelmed. They enter the blood and overrun the body; if this happens, death is very likely. The Corona virus is often compared to the flu, but actually, it's much more dangerous. While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic, we know for sure that it's much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu. There are two futures for a pandemic like Corona: fast and slow. Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak. A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives; a slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books. The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection because there are no counter measures in place to slow it down. Why is this so bad? In a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time. If the numbers get too large, health care systems become unable to handle it. There aren't enough resources, like medical staff or equipment like ventilators, left to help everybody. People will die untreated. And as more health care workers get sick themselves, the capacity of health care systems falls even further. If this becomes the case, then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live and who doesn't. The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario. To avoid this, the world - that means all of us - needs to do what it can to turn this into a slow pandemic. A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses. Especially in the early phase, so that everyone who gets sick can get treatment and there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals. Since we don't have a vaccine for Corona, we have to socially engineer our behaviour, to act like a social vaccine. This simply means two things: 1. Not getting infected; and 2. Not infecting others. Although it sounds trivial, the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands. The soap is actually a powerful tool. The corona virus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat; soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you. It also makes your hands slippery, and with the mechanical motions of washing, viruses are ripped away. To do it properly, wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapeños and want to put in your contact lenses next. The next thing is social distancing, which is not a nice experience, but a nice thing to do. This means: no hugging, no handshakes. If you can stay at home, stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function: from doctors to cashiers, or police officers;. You depend on all of them; they all depend on you to not get sick. On a larger level, there are quarantines, which can mean different things, from travel restrictions or actual orders to stay at home. Quarantines are not great to experience and certainly not popular. But they buy us - and specially the researchers working on medication and vaccinations - crucial time So if you are put under quarantine, you should understand why, and respect it. None of this is fun. But looking at the big picture, it is a really small price to pay. The question of how pandemics end, depends on how they start; if they start fast with a steep slope, they end badly. If they start slow, with a not-so-steep slope, they end okay-ish. And, in this day and age, it really is in all of our hands. Literally, and figuratively. A huge thanks to the experts who helped us on short notice with this video, specially Our World In Data, the online publication for research and data on the world's largest problems and how to make progress solving them.

**Transcript**:
In December 2019 the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities. In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days. This virus is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 that causes the disease called Covid-19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus. What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do? [Intro Music] A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins, arguably not even a living thing. It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell. Corona may spread via surfaces, but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them. Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection when people cough, or if you touch someone who's ill and then your face, say rubbing your eyes or nose. The virus starts its journey here, and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into the body Its destinations are the intestines, the spleen or the lungs, where it can have the most dramatic effect. Even just a few corona viruses can cause quite a dramatic situation. The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells. These are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa waiting to be infected. Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victim's membranes to inject its genetic material. The cell, ignorant of what's happening, executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple: copy and reassemble. It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical point and receives one final order, self-destruct. The cell sort of melts away, releasing new corona particles ready to attack more cells. The number of infected cells grows exponentially After about 10 days, millions of body cells are infected, and billions of viruses swarmed the lungs. The virus has not caused too much damage yet, but corona is now going to release a real beast on you, your own immune system. The immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself and needs tight regulation. And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, Corona infects some of them and creates confusion. Cells have neither ears nor eyes. They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines. Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them. Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder. In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage. Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc. First, neutrophils, which are great at killing stuff, including our cells. As they arrive in their thousands, they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends as enemies. The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T-cells, which usually order infected cells to commit controlled suicide. Confused as they are, they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too. The more and more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy lung tissue they kill. This might get so bad that it can cause permanent irreversible damage, that leads to lifelong disabilities. In most cases, the immune system slowly regains control. It kills the infected cells, intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones and cleans up the battlefield. Recovery begins. The majority of people infected by Corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms. But many cases become severe or even critical. We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified, but it's safe to say that there is a lot more than with the flu. In more severe cases, Millions of epithelial cells have died and with them, the lungs' protective lining is gone. That means that the alveoli - tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs - can be infected by bacteria that aren't usually a big problem. Patients get pneumonia. Respiration becomes hard or even fails, and patients need ventilators to survive. The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons. And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply, it is overwhelmed. They enter the blood and overrun the body; if this happens, death is very likely. The Corona virus is often compared to the flu, but actually, it's much more dangerous. While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic, we know for sure that it's much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu. There are two futures for a pandemic like Corona: fast and slow. Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak. A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives; a slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books. The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection because there are no counter measures in place to slow it down. Why is this so bad? In a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time. If the numbers get too large, health care systems become unable to handle it. There aren't enough resources, like medical staff or equipment like ventilators, left to help everybody. People will die untreated. And as more health care workers get sick themselves, the capacity of health care systems falls even further. If this becomes the case, then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live and who doesn't. The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario. To avoid this, the world - that means all of us - needs to do what it can to turn this into a slow pandemic. A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses. Especially in the early phase, so that everyone who gets sick can get treatment and there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals. Since we don't have a vaccine for Corona, we have to socially engineer our behaviour, to act like a social vaccine. This simply means two things: 1. Not getting infected; and 2. Not infecting others. Although it sounds trivial, the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands. The soap is actually a powerful tool. The corona virus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat; soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you. It also makes your hands slippery, and with the mechanical motions of washing, viruses are ripped away. To do it properly, wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapeños and want to put in your contact lenses next. The next thing is social distancing, which is not a nice experience, but a nice thing to do. This means: no hugging, no handshakes. If you can stay at home, stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function: from doctors to cashiers, or police officers;. You depend on all of them; they all depend on you to not get sick. On a larger level, there are quarantines, which can mean different things, from travel restrictions or actual orders to stay at home. Quarantines are not great to experience and certainly not popular. But they buy us - and specially the researchers working on medication and vaccinations - crucial time So if you are put under quarantine, you should understand why, and respect it. None of this is fun. But looking at the big picture, it is a really small price to pay. The question of how pandemics end, depends on how they start; if they start fast with a steep slope, they end badly. If they start slow, with a not-so-steep slope, they end okay-ish. And, in this day and age, it really is in all of our hands. Literally, and figuratively. A huge thanks to the experts who helped us on short notice with this video, specially Our World In Data, the online publication for research and data on the world's largest problems and how to make progress solving them.

**Transcript**:
In December 2019 the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities. In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days. This virus is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 that causes the disease called Covid-19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus. What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do? [Intro Music] A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins, arguably not even a living thing. It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell. Corona may spread via surfaces, but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them. Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection when people cough, or if you touch someone who's ill and then your face, say rubbing your eyes or nose. The virus starts its journey here, and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into the body Its destinations are the intestines, the spleen or the lungs, where it can have the most dramatic effect. Even just a few corona viruses can cause quite a dramatic situation. The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells. These are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa waiting to be infected. Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victim's membranes to inject its genetic material. The cell, ignorant of what's happening, executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple: copy and reassemble. It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical point and receives one final order, self-destruct. The cell sort of melts away, releasing new corona particles ready to attack more cells. The number of infected cells grows exponentially After about 10 days, millions of body cells are infected, and billions of viruses swarmed the lungs. The virus has not caused too much damage yet, but corona is now going to release a real beast on you, your own immune system. The immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself and needs tight regulation. And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, Corona infects some of them and creates confusion. Cells have neither ears nor eyes. They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines. Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them. Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder. In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage. Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc. First, neutrophils, which are great at killing stuff, including our cells. As they arrive in their thousands, they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends as enemies. The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T-cells, which usually order infected cells to commit controlled suicide. Confused as they are, they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too. The more and more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy lung tissue they kill. This might get so bad that it can cause permanent irreversible damage, that leads to lifelong disabilities. In most cases, the immune system slowly regains control. It kills the infected cells, intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones and cleans up the battlefield. Recovery begins. The majority of people infected by Corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms. But many cases become severe or even critical. We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified, but it's safe to say that there is a lot more than with the flu. In more severe cases, Millions of epithelial cells have died and with them, the lungs' protective lining is gone. That means that the alveoli - tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs - can be infected by bacteria that aren't usually a big problem. Patients get pneumonia. Respiration becomes hard or even fails, and patients need ventilators to survive. The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons. And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply, it is overwhelmed. They enter the blood and overrun the body; if this happens, death is very likely. The Corona virus is often compared to the flu, but actually, it's much more dangerous. While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic, we know for sure that it's much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu. There are two futures for a pandemic like Corona: fast and slow. Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak. A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives; a slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books. The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection because there are no counter measures in place to slow it down. Why is this so bad? In a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time. If the numbers get too large, health care systems become unable to handle it. There aren't enough resources, like medical staff or equipment like ventilators, left to help everybody. People will die untreated. And as more health care workers get sick themselves, the capacity of health care systems falls even further. If this becomes the case, then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live and who doesn't. The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario. To avoid this, the world - that means all of us - needs to do what it can to turn this into a slow pandemic. A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses. Especially in the early phase, so that everyone who gets sick can get treatment and there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals. Since we don't have a vaccine for Corona, we have to socially engineer our behaviour, to act like a social vaccine. This simply means two things: 1. Not getting infected; and 2. Not infecting others. Although it sounds trivial, the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands. The soap is actually a powerful tool. The corona virus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat; soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you. It also makes your hands slippery, and with the mechanical motions of washing, viruses are ripped away. To do it properly, wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapeños and want to put in your contact lenses next. The next thing is social distancing, which is not a nice experience, but a nice thing to do. This means: no hugging, no handshakes. If you can stay at home, stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function: from doctors to cashiers, or police officers;. You depend on all of them; they all depend on you to not get sick. On a larger level, there are quarantines, which can mean different things, from travel restrictions or actual orders to stay at home. Quarantines are not great to experience and certainly not popular. But they buy us - and specially the researchers working on medication and vaccinations - crucial time So if you are put under quarantine, you should understand why, and respect it. None of this is fun. But looking at the big picture, it is a really small price to pay. The question of how pandemics end, depends on how they start; if they start fast with a steep slope, they end badly. If they start slow, with a not-so-steep slope, they end okay-ish. And, in this day and age, it really is in all of our hands. Literally, and figuratively. A huge thanks to the experts who helped us on short notice with this video, specially Our World In Data, the online publication for research and data on the world's largest problems and how to make progress solving them.

**Transcript**:
Old TV shows made it seem really easy to appeal
to the Supreme Court. Like when this lady wanted to fight her speeding ticket. Or on Gilligan’s Island, when Thurston Howell
is locked in a bamboo jail and he says, But even though they make it sound like a right, nobody is entitled to an appearance at the Supreme Court. That’s entirely at the discretion of the Justices and they choose very carefully. Only a small number of cases get to the Supreme
Court, and it’s getting smaller. Roughly 8,000 cases are submitted each year,
but only 80 cases are accepted. That’s a 1% acceptance rate. And to get to that 1%, most cases start at
the bottom. The federal court system consists of three
layers and the lowest is the district level. If you lose in a district court you can appeal
to the circuit level. Most of The United States is divided into
eleven circuits, but there’s a twelfth for DC and a federal circuit that mostly hears patent
and military cases. Above the circuit level is the Supreme Court,
the highest court in the land as long as you don’t count the basketball
court that’s above the Supreme Court. And to get to the Supreme Court, nearly all
cases require submitting something called a "petition for a writ of certio- certioror? certiori? “The writ of certiorari”, which is shortened,
usually, to “the writ of cert”. A petition for the writ of cert is a written
request asking the Supreme Court to hear a case. Instead of asking the court to resolve the facts of a case, which are nearly always settled in lower courts, the reasons for granting the petition concern important questions about federal law. The overarching goal of the court is to make sure that federal law is the same across the country and, so, by federal law I mean the
US Constitution and laws passed by Congress. Professor Greene clerked for Justice John Paul Stevens, where he became very familiar with cert petitions. That’s because the clerks review cert petitions
for their justices, who then choose to grant a petition if it
passes “the rule of four”, meaning that four justices want to hear the case. When the court does not grant cert, it does
not imply a decision. It doesn’t mean that it agrees with the
lower court. It doesn’t mean that the individual justices agree with the lower court decision.
It just means that the court has decided that this particular case is not a case where the court is going to choose to set law for the whole country. If cert is granted, a case probably falls into one of three categories describing most Supreme Court cases. The first is a case of national importance, such as when the court decided Bush v. Gore in order to help determine who had won the 2000 presidential election. “Drawing on very rarely used legal powers,
The Supreme Court has, for the first time in American history, decided to step into
a legal dispute in the midst of a presidential election." A second type of case is when a lower court
issues a ruling that invalidates federal law. An example is "Gonsalez v. Raich", in which
Angel Raich, a California woman, challenged federal drug laws after agents destroyed marijuana plants she had been consuming for medical use. On her appeal in the Ninth Circuit, judges
ruled in favor of Raich, deciding that she was compliant with a state
law authorizing her use of medical pot. But that ruling conflicted with federal law
prohibiting marijuana use. So when the Ninth Circuit said "it doesn’t
apply" that means that if you are medical marijuana user in California then you can use it without
fear of federal prosecution, but if you are a medical marijuana user in Florida or in New York then it’s still banned under federal law. By ruling on the case, Justices were able to establish the authority of federal law
prohibiting the use of medical marijuana. In the Raich case, the Supreme Court overruled
the Ninth Circuit and said that the federal drug laws can apply to local marijuana use,
which means that someone like Angel Raich can still be prosecuted under federal law
even though she can’t be prosecuted under state law. Third, the court accepts cases in order to
resolve a split decision in the lower courts. This happened in the case "Obergefell v. Hodges", where a Sixth Circuit ruling that banned same-sex marriage conflicted with rulings in other
circuits that had upheld the right to same-sex marriage. Obergefell was someone living in Ohio who wanted to marry his same-sex partner and was not permitted to do so under Ohio law. It made its way to the Sixth Circuit. The
Sixth Circuit said, “you have no right to be married because you are a same-sex couple” and that created a “split”: a division of authority between
the Sixth Circuit, which governs Ohio, and a number of other circuit courts. And so, once that happened, it was fairly clear to, I think, most legal observers that the Supreme Court was likely to hear the case because it meant that federal law, the federal Constitution in this case, applied differently in Ohio than it would in Pennsylvania, for example. By ruling in favor of Obergefell, the court
resolved a circuit split and made same-sex marriage a right nationwide. But these three categories are just a framework for understanding why The Court might select a case. They are not rules. Ultimately, which cases get to the court depends
on the decisions of individuals: the sitting justices of The US Supreme Court.

**Transcript**:
Murders are in the news so frequently that you may quietly wonder: are people just naturally violent? We can answer that question by looking at the rest of the animal kingdom. Are we Homo sapiens any more murderous than, say, monkeys, mice, or meerkats? [Music] A team of researchers in Spain found out by gathering data for more than one thousand mammal species, and they found that killing is actually pretty rare. Okay sure, predators will eat prey, but less than half of the studied species kill members of their own kind. And we humans are nowhere near the top of the chart of the most murderous mammals. We’re not even in the top 30. Some of those top species include obvious ones: predators like lions, bears, and wolves. But the list has surprises too. Cute things like ground squirrels, wild horses, deer. The adorable long-tailed chinchilla is sitting at number 14. And at the number 1 most murderous mammal? The meerkat. They might seem lovable, but around 20 percent of meerkats lose their lives to other meerkats. Primates, the group we belong to, turn out to be an unusually violent bunch. They are 8 times more likely to kill each other than other mammals are. This makes sense: Primates are both territorial and social, two factors that provide the motive and opportunity for murder. So we descend from a group of unusually murderous mammals. But what’s happened since then? To find out, the Spanish team combed through archeological data and historical records. They found that in paleolithic times, lethal violence caused 3.5% of all human deaths, making our ancestors only slightly more violent than the average primate. But as our societies got bigger, our rates of lethal violence increased, rising to around 12% during the Medieval period. But, once we formed large states and became more organized, institutions and the rule of law reduced rates of murder, which are now much lower than in our prehistoric past. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes would have approved. In the 17th century, he argued that modern society protects us from our brutish nature. Not so, said Jean-Jacques Rousseau, another philosopher who believed that humans are naturally good, and civilization is what corrupts us. So did Hobbes win this age old debate? Well maybe, but there's a catch. Some researchers argue that how a mammal species kills its own kind matters more than the rate at which it does the killing. And for primates, the most common MO is infanticide. They kill their babies. But what makes humans so different is that we kill each other as adults at an exceptionally high rate. It is adult homicide that makes us part of a very small club of violent mammals that includes the like of wolves, lions, and spotted hyenas. Human violence may be rooted in our evolutionary past, and we may tamed our lethal proclivities, but like it or not, when it comes to violence, humans are still exceptional. This is You Are Here, a new series from the Atlantic about the science behind everyday life. Let us know what topics you want us to explore in the comments. I’m Ed Yong, thanks for watching.

The philosopher Thomas Hobbes would have approved. In the 17th century, he argued that modern society protects us from our brutish nature. Not so, said Jean-Jacques Rousseau, another philosopher who believed that humans are naturally good, and civilization is what corrupts us. So did Hobbes win this age old debate? Well maybe, but there's a catch. Some researchers argue that how a mammal species kills its own kind matters more than the rate at which it does the killing. And for primates, the most common MO is infanticide. They kill their babies. But what makes humans so different is that we kill each other as adults at an exceptionally high rate. It is adult homicide that makes us part of a very small club of violent mammals that includes the like of wolves, lions, and spotted hyenas. Human violence may be rooted in our evolutionary past, and we may tamed our lethal proclivities, but like it or not, when it comes to violence, humans are still exceptional. This is You Are Here, a new series from the Atlantic about the science behind everyday life. Let us know what topics you want us to explore in the comments. I’m Ed Yong, thanks for watching.

**Transcript**:
"Barbecue"!! The word derives from the word
"barabicu", which to the Taíno people in the Caribbean islands meant "sacred fire pit".
We are definitely on sacred ground today. If we can get in. [MUSIC] I'm here to learn a little about the science
of BBQ, so I came to a man who knows a little bit about that, Aaron Franklin... Well that's debatable. How's it going? So what is BBQ? I think BBQ is something that's cooked over
a live fire, so that could encompass grilling, slow offset cooking, cooking in the ground,
cooking whole hogs over coals, any of those kinds of things I call BBQ, but for me on
a personal level, it's a German/Czech style, offset cooking." I experiment all the time, at the end of the
day feel trumps black and white number or equation you could possibly have. If something's
not tender, it's just not tender, if something's dry, it's just too dry. BUT, the science behind
these things how wood burns, how airflow works, if you start thinking about fluid dynamics
inside of a cooker, then science has a pretty huge part of it. I think good BBQ is a balance
between science and natural gut instinct. Cooking is really just thermodynamics and
chemistry, but tastier. Inside the smoker, air molecules are moving around really rapidly
thanks to that fire, they're vibrating all crazy, and when they smack into the brisket,
they transfer that energy to the meat, either contributing chemical reactions or raising
the temperature. Meat browns when it cooks, whether it's direct
heat like a steak or slow like BBQ. Heat breaks proteins down into amino acids, which then
react with sugars to create molecular deliciousness, which happens to be brown. It's not caramelization,
it's something called the Maillard reaction. King of BBQ here in Texas is brisket. It started
out with whole animals, you would sell what you could and then whatever was left, as a
method of preservation, you would BBQ stuff on Sundays For us to fully understand the science of
BBQ, we need to know a little about the hunk of meat we're cooking. Meat in general is
muscle, which is primarily protein, fat, some vitamins and minerals, and whole lot of water. Brisket comes from across chest area of cow,
right here, and since cattle don't have collarbones like us, this muscle has to support more than
half their body weight. That means it's got a lot of three things: hard-working muscle,
fat, and connective tissue. It's basically the opposite of filet mignon. But if we apply
the right kind of science, those three things can come together like Voltron to make something
very tasty. So at the end of the day you want it to be
tender, juicy, good bark, with good fat render. Some of you might not want to hear this, but
making good BBQ is like making Jell-O. Ribs, brisket, pork shoulder, all cuts of meat that
have tons of connective tissue, the molecular glue that supports all those muscle fibers.
Collagen, one of the proteins in connective tissue, can make up a quarter of all the protein
in a mammal's body. Cook 'em fast, and those proteins snap up
tight like rubber bands, they have the texture of them too. If you cook them slow, they melt.
When collagen is heated slowly and held there for hours (and hours), its long protein chains
break down and water works its way in. That collagen turns to gelatin, exactly the same
stuff that's in this box. That's what makes good BBQ so tender inside. It's meat Jell-O. BBQ cuts also have a good amount of fat. Animal
fats are made of triglycerides which have mostly saturated fatty acids. These have much
higher melting points than unsaturated fats like, say, vegetable or olive oil you have
in your kitchen, because those straight triglyceride tails are stable, packed nice and close. As
we heat these saturated fats up, slowly, we can disrupt those hydrogen bonds and turn
to liquid, called rendering. Which is delicious. Together, melting collagen to gelatin and
liquefying fat make the meat OH SO TENDER. You need no teeth to eat dis beef. What's fun about an oven? There's nothing
fun about ovens. Did they have ovens back in the early days, coming up through Mexico?
No you dug a hole in the ground, you buried a head, on coals, you cooked on a fire. And
that's where I'm coming from more on the traditional side of it. I'm not gonna use electricity,
not gonna use gas no assisted heat source of any kind.We have light bulbs, and I don't
even like that so much. And it tastes good. That gets into a whole
other thing too, how you're using wood, green wood, dry wood, post oak, hickory, mesquite,
pecan, any of these different kinds of woods they all taste different, they all cook different. The hardwoods used in BBQ smoke have lots
of cellulose and lignin. When burnt slowly, cellulose caramelizes into sugar molecules
that flavor the meat. And lignin is converted into all kinds of aromatic chemicals that
flavor the meat, and can even act as chemical preservatives.
You just can't have brisket, or any BBQ, without that beautiful smoke ring. Now THIS is some
cool chemistry! Or hot chemistry. Meat starts out pink because it's full of oxygen-carrying
molecule called myoglobin. That iron-containing myoglobin starts out red, but as it heats
up the iron in its heme group oxidizes and it turns this brown color. So why is the ring still red? Well, BBQ smoke
contains gases like carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, made by burning wood. That gas diffuse
into the edges of the meat, bind to the myoglobin in place of oxygen. And those nitric oxide-myoglobin
compounds just so happen to be pink. The edge stays nice and red while the interior gets
brown like normal. Kinda the art of working a fire is to control
those things and get certain flavors out of a piece of wood. It's not just heat, it's not just the temperature
on a gauge, it's how the smoke is coming out of the smokestack, it's how a piece of wood
if it flames up and dies out real quick, it's about a heat curve, how long is it gonna last,
are you forcing a piece of wood to do something it doesn't want to do? You can't really make a piece of meat do what
you want it to do, you can only guide it to do what you think you want it to do. So, kind
of go with that, it's all about trial and error, don't give up, keep working on it.
And if you really wanted to you could watch the BBQ With Franklin videos. Out here we might have beer cans and aprons
instead of test tubes and lab coats, but BBQ is SCIENCE, y'all. It's chemistry, it's physics,
and the best part is you get to eat your experiments. Stay curious. And hungry. I'm gonna go get
some food. Special thanks to Aaron Franklin and the whole
crew at Franklin BBQ. If you're ever in Austin, Texas, line up early, because this is the
best BBQ joint in the US. Seriously, you can look it up.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
[♪ INTRO ♪] Parents have a bunch of catchphrases. Things like, “Don’t eat with your mouth
open” or “Don’t run with scissors." Another one you might recognize is “don’t sit too close to the TV; it’ll hurt your eyes." But it turns out that the science behind that one isn’t actually true—at least, not anymore. Your eyes might start to feel tired, but the
TV won’t actually hurt them. That idea came from some faulty televisions back in the late 1960s. About 50 years ago, General Electric accidentally released a line of color televisions that emitted X-rays from 10 to 100,000 times more than was considered safe. Talk about a manufacturing flaw. Like most other old, boxy TVs, the GE ones used cathode ray tubes, or CRTs, to generate a picture. Inside the glass vacuum tubes, electrons were fired at a screen covered in red, green, and blue phosphors, a type of material that glows when hit by something like electrons. And when fast-moving electrons strike something in a vacuum, it generates X-rays. To protect people from this radiation, engineers mixed lead into the glass ray tubes— but this batch of GE televisions was produced with faulty tubes. Two pieces were misaligned, which meant that the X-rays were deflected out of the bottom of the TV set and toward the ground right under
the television, where some kid was probably singing along to The Flintstones theme song. A recall notice estimated that sitting under the TV for a total of 40 hours would expose someone to so much radiation that their skin would turn red and painful. Which is... not great. But the good news is it doesn’t seem like
anyone was hurt. Thankfully, modern LCD TVs don’t emit harmful radiation at all, so you can sit as close as you want. But if you do spend too much time binging Netflix, you might still develop a headache. If you stare at the TV—or basically anything, including a book or your smartphone—for too long, you can tire out the muscles in and around your eyes and develop eye-strain. After a while, whatever you’re staring at
will start to get wobbly and fuzzy, and you might get a headache or feel tired. Fortunately there’s an easy fix: Go do something else, or at least just look away for a few seconds. Now, kids can focus on things close up much better than adults can without developing eye-strain, which is why they tend to get in the habit of sitting super close to screens—like televisions. And, in the 1960s, that might have been a
problem. But today, kids won’t get radiation burns
by doing it, no matter what their parents say. So the next time you’re in the mood for
a vintage movie marathon, you can sit wherever you’d like. But when Netflix asks you if you’re still
watching, it might be time to give your eyes a break. Thanks for asking, and thanks to all of our patrons on Patreon who keep the answers coming. If you’d like to submit a question to be

**Transcript**:
Here at SciShow HQ we have a little food area for the employees - Sometimes there are donuts. Sometimes there are nuts. Sometimes dried mango. But the one thing that never sticks around and is gone as soon as we can buy it is the wonderful, beautiful, noble banana. Unfortunately for us, they may not be around forever. [Intro Music] First, the good: bananas are healthy,
packed with nutrition and energy, they fit in your hand and give nice little
cues when they're perfectly ripe, and are easy to peel and eat; shocking statistic,
the banana is Wal-mart's number one selling item.
Not the potato chip, not Coca-Cola, not Fifty Shades of Grey, bananas. They
appear to be so perfect for human consumption that Kirk Cameron attempted
to use them to prove the existence of God. Of course this banana was not created by
God, or really even nature. Bananas, at least the ones that you see at the store, were created by people. Don't get me
wrong, there are wild banana plants - lots of them - they're native to South and
Southeast Asia, and there are dozens of species and
thousands of varieties. They're just not the ones we eat. Some
those species, as you might suspect, have seeds, 'cause that's what fruits
are, they're fleshy bodies containing seeds. So you might wonder, why have you never
eaten a banana seed? Well, you have... kinda. In cultivated bananas the
seeds have pretty much stopped existing. If you look closely you can see tiny black specks. Those are all that's
left, and they're not fertile seeds. If you
plant them, nothing grows. Today's bananas are sterile mutants. I'm
not trying to be mean, that's just the truth. Unless you were alive in the 1960's (hats off to all those older SciShow viewers out there) every banana you
have ever eaten was pretty much genetically identical. This is a Cavendish, the virtually seedless
variety that we all eat today, but it wasn't always our banana of choice. Until the
1960s, everyone was eating the same banana, it
was just a different banana - the Gros Michel, a bigger, sweeter fruit
with thicker skin. You might notice that banana flavored things don't really
taste like bananas. Well they do - they taste like the Gros Michel. The
genetic monotony of the Gros Michel crop was its undoing. A fungicide
resistant pathogen called the Panama disease began
infecting Gros Michel crop. By the time growers understood how
vulnerable their crops were, the Gros Michel variety was all but extinct. The entire banana industry had to be
retooled for the Cavendish. Since they're seedless, the only way to reproduce them
is to transplant part of the plant stem, and for the last 50 years we've been
good with the Cavendish, 'cause it's more resistant to the Panama
disease. However somewhat terrifyingly a strain of Panama disease that affects
the Cavendish strain that we all eat has been identified. A global monoculture of genetically
identical individuals is a beautiful sight to a pathogen. The fungus only has to figure out how to
infect and destroy a single individual, and suddenly there is no diversity to
stop it, or even slow it down. That's led to a lot
of scientists worrying about or even predicting the outright demise of the
Cavendish. This wonderful most popular of fruits might
completely cease existence. The good news is we now have a much better
understanding of genetics, epidemics, fungi, and pathology.
Scientists and growers have already taken steps to protect the Cavendish. Some growers are creating genetically
different bananas that might replace the Cavendish crop if it fails, while
scientists are attempting to genetically engineer Cavendish plants with immunity
to Panama disease. Plus we learned a lot from the Gros
Michel debacle. Infected fields are quickly being destroyed and new crops are
grown from pathogen-free lab-grown plant stock. So thanks to the people who work
tirelessly to grow and harvest bananas and bring them to us so that we can offer them inexpensively
to our employees, and thanks to the growers and scientists working
tirelessly to make sure that they don't go the way of the Gros Michel. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow, if

good with the Cavendish, 'cause it's more resistant to the Panama
disease. However somewhat terrifyingly a strain of Panama disease that affects
the Cavendish strain that we all eat has been identified. A global monoculture of genetically
identical individuals is a beautiful sight to a pathogen. The fungus only has to figure out how to
infect and destroy a single individual, and suddenly there is no diversity to
stop it, or even slow it down. That's led to a lot
of scientists worrying about or even predicting the outright demise of the
Cavendish. This wonderful most popular of fruits might
completely cease existence. The good news is we now have a much better
understanding of genetics, epidemics, fungi, and pathology.
Scientists and growers have already taken steps to protect the Cavendish. Some growers are creating genetically
different bananas that might replace the Cavendish crop if it fails, while
scientists are attempting to genetically engineer Cavendish plants with immunity
to Panama disease. Plus we learned a lot from the Gros
Michel debacle. Infected fields are quickly being destroyed and new crops are
grown from pathogen-free lab-grown plant stock. So thanks to the people who work
tirelessly to grow and harvest bananas and bring them to us so that we can offer them inexpensively
to our employees, and thanks to the growers and scientists working
tirelessly to make sure that they don't go the way of the Gros Michel. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow, if

**Transcript**:
Here at SciShow HQ we have a little food area for the employees - Sometimes there are donuts. Sometimes there are nuts. Sometimes dried mango. But the one thing that never sticks around and is gone as soon as we can buy it is the wonderful, beautiful, noble banana. Unfortunately for us, they may not be around forever. [Intro Music] First, the good: bananas are healthy,
packed with nutrition and energy, they fit in your hand and give nice little
cues when they're perfectly ripe, and are easy to peel and eat; shocking statistic,
the banana is Wal-mart's number one selling item.
Not the potato chip, not Coca-Cola, not Fifty Shades of Grey, bananas. They
appear to be so perfect for human consumption that Kirk Cameron attempted
to use them to prove the existence of God. Of course this banana was not created by
God, or really even nature. Bananas, at least the ones that you see at the store, were created by people. Don't get me
wrong, there are wild banana plants - lots of them - they're native to South and
Southeast Asia, and there are dozens of species and
thousands of varieties. They're just not the ones we eat. Some
those species, as you might suspect, have seeds, 'cause that's what fruits
are, they're fleshy bodies containing seeds. So you might wonder, why have you never
eaten a banana seed? Well, you have... kinda. In cultivated bananas the
seeds have pretty much stopped existing. If you look closely you can see tiny black specks. Those are all that's
left, and they're not fertile seeds. If you
plant them, nothing grows. Today's bananas are sterile mutants. I'm
not trying to be mean, that's just the truth. Unless you were alive in the 1960's (hats off to all those older SciShow viewers out there) every banana you
have ever eaten was pretty much genetically identical. This is a Cavendish, the virtually seedless
variety that we all eat today, but it wasn't always our banana of choice. Until the
1960s, everyone was eating the same banana, it
was just a different banana - the Gros Michel, a bigger, sweeter fruit
with thicker skin. You might notice that banana flavored things don't really
taste like bananas. Well they do - they taste like the Gros Michel. The
genetic monotony of the Gros Michel crop was its undoing. A fungicide
resistant pathogen called the Panama disease began
infecting Gros Michel crop. By the time growers understood how
vulnerable their crops were, the Gros Michel variety was all but extinct. The entire banana industry had to be
retooled for the Cavendish. Since they're seedless, the only way to reproduce them
is to transplant part of the plant stem, and for the last 50 years we've been

**Transcript**:
Here at SciShow HQ we have a little food area for the employees - Sometimes there are donuts. Sometimes there are nuts. Sometimes dried mango. But the one thing that never sticks around and is gone as soon as we can buy it is the wonderful, beautiful, noble banana. Unfortunately for us, they may not be around forever. [Intro Music] First, the good: bananas are healthy,
packed with nutrition and energy, they fit in your hand and give nice little
cues when they're perfectly ripe, and are easy to peel and eat; shocking statistic,
the banana is Wal-mart's number one selling item.
Not the potato chip, not Coca-Cola, not Fifty Shades of Grey, bananas. They
appear to be so perfect for human consumption that Kirk Cameron attempted
to use them to prove the existence of God. Of course this banana was not created by
God, or really even nature. Bananas, at least the ones that you see at the store, were created by people. Don't get me
wrong, there are wild banana plants - lots of them - they're native to South and
Southeast Asia, and there are dozens of species and
thousands of varieties. They're just not the ones we eat. Some
those species, as you might suspect, have seeds, 'cause that's what fruits
are, they're fleshy bodies containing seeds. So you might wonder, why have you never
eaten a banana seed? Well, you have... kinda. In cultivated bananas the
seeds have pretty much stopped existing. If you look closely you can see tiny black specks. Those are all that's
left, and they're not fertile seeds. If you
plant them, nothing grows. Today's bananas are sterile mutants. I'm
not trying to be mean, that's just the truth. Unless you were alive in the 1960's (hats off to all those older SciShow viewers out there) every banana you
have ever eaten was pretty much genetically identical. This is a Cavendish, the virtually seedless
variety that we all eat today, but it wasn't always our banana of choice. Until the
1960s, everyone was eating the same banana, it
was just a different banana - the Gros Michel, a bigger, sweeter fruit
with thicker skin. You might notice that banana flavored things don't really
taste like bananas. Well they do - they taste like the Gros Michel. The
genetic monotony of the Gros Michel crop was its undoing. A fungicide
resistant pathogen called the Panama disease began
infecting Gros Michel crop. By the time growers understood how
vulnerable their crops were, the Gros Michel variety was all but extinct. The entire banana industry had to be
retooled for the Cavendish. Since they're seedless, the only way to reproduce them
is to transplant part of the plant stem, and for the last 50 years we've been
good with the Cavendish, 'cause it's more resistant to the Panama
disease. However somewhat terrifyingly a strain of Panama disease that affects
the Cavendish strain that we all eat has been identified. A global monoculture of genetically
identical individuals is a beautiful sight to a pathogen. The fungus only has to figure out how to
infect and destroy a single individual, and suddenly there is no diversity to
stop it, or even slow it down. That's led to a lot
of scientists worrying about or even predicting the outright demise of the
Cavendish. This wonderful most popular of fruits might
completely cease existence. The good news is we now have a much better
understanding of genetics, epidemics, fungi, and pathology.
Scientists and growers have already taken steps to protect the Cavendish. Some growers are creating genetically
different bananas that might replace the Cavendish crop if it fails, while
scientists are attempting to genetically engineer Cavendish plants with immunity
to Panama disease. Plus we learned a lot from the Gros
Michel debacle. Infected fields are quickly being destroyed and new crops are
grown from pathogen-free lab-grown plant stock. So thanks to the people who work
tirelessly to grow and harvest bananas and bring them to us so that we can offer them inexpensively
to our employees, and thanks to the growers and scientists working
tirelessly to make sure that they don't go the way of the Gros Michel. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow, if

**Transcript**:
there are 196 countries in the world
today and virtually none of them have purple on their national flag.
Throughout history, purple was never used to represent a kingdom civilization or
Empire. So what's wrong with purple? It's such a popular color today.
why would no country use it in their flag? the answer is really quite simple
purple was just far too expensive. No countries have purple on their flag
because up until the 1800s purple was worth more than its weight in gold
the color purple has been associated with royalty power and wealth for
centuries. In fact, Queen Elizabeth the first forbade anyone except close
members of the royal family to wear it. Purple's elite status stems from the
rarity and cost of the dye originally used to produce it the dye initially
used to make purple came from the Phoenician trading city of Tyre which is
now in modern-day Lebanon fabric traders obtained the dye from a small sea snail
that was only found in the tyre region of the Mediterranean a lot of work went
into producing the dye as more than 10,000 snails were needed to create just
one gram of tyree and purple since only wealthy rulers could afford to buy and
wear the color it became associated with the Imperial classes of Rome Egypt and
Persia purple also came to represent spirituality and holiness because the
ancient Emperor's kings and queens that wore the color were often thought of as
gods or descendants of the gods sometimes however the dye was too
expensive even for royalty third century Roman Emperor aurelion famously wouldn't
allow his wife to buy a shawl made from tyree and purple silk because it
literally cost three times its weight in gold
a single pound of dye cost three pounds of gold which is the equivalent of fifty
six thousand dollars today so since the sheer price of purple was so
astronomically high no one not
when the richest nations could afford to have purple on their flag the hue became
more accessible to lower-class is about a century and a half ago in 1856 18-year
old English chemist William Henry Perkin accidentally created a synthetic purple
compound while attempting to synthesize quinine an anti-malaria drug he noticed
that the compound could be used to dye fabrics so he patented the dye
manufactured it and got filthy rich purple dye was then mass-produced so
just about everybody could afford it the elite stopped valuing purple and the
status symbol faded away but the country flags remain the same since 1900 a
handful of new national flags have been designed and a few of them have opted to
use purple in their flag so don't be making any bets just yet hopefully you
found this interesting sometimes the simplest questions have the most
fascinating answers for more interesting videos like this one please subscribe

ancient Emperor's kings and queens that wore the color were often thought of as
gods or descendants of the gods sometimes however the dye was too
expensive even for royalty third century Roman Emperor aurelion famously wouldn't
allow his wife to buy a shawl made from tyree and purple silk because it
literally cost three times its weight in gold
a single pound of dye cost three pounds of gold which is the equivalent of fifty
six thousand dollars today so since the sheer price of purple was so
astronomically high no one not
when the richest nations could afford to have purple on their flag the hue became
more accessible to lower-class is about a century and a half ago in 1856 18-year
old English chemist William Henry Perkin accidentally created a synthetic purple
compound while attempting to synthesize quinine an anti-malaria drug he noticed
that the compound could be used to dye fabrics so he patented the dye
manufactured it and got filthy rich purple dye was then mass-produced so
just about everybody could afford it the elite stopped valuing purple and the
status symbol faded away but the country flags remain the same since 1900 a
handful of new national flags have been designed and a few of them have opted to
use purple in their flag so don't be making any bets just yet hopefully you
