**Transcript**:
Mining unobtainium is hard work. The rare mineral appears 
in only 1% of rocks in the mine. But your friend Tricky Joe 
has something up his sleeve. The unobtainium detector he’s been 
perfecting for months is finally ready. The device never fails 
to detect unobtainium if any is present. Otherwise, it’s still highly reliable, returning accurate 
readings 90% of the time. On his first day trying 
it out in the field, the device goes off, and 
Joe happily places the rock in his cart. As the two of you head back to camp 
where the ore can be examined, Joe makes you an offer: he’ll sell you the ore for just $200. You know that a piece of unobtanium 
that size would easily be worth $1000, but any other minerals 
would be effectively worthless. Should you make the trade? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Intuitively, it seems like a good deal. Since the detector 
is correct most of the time, shouldn’t you be able
to trust its reading? Unfortunately, no. Here’s why. Imagine the mine 
has exactly 1,000 pieces of ore. An unobtainium rarity of 1% means that there are only 10 rocks 
with the precious mineral inside. All 10 would set off the detector. But what about the other 990
rocks without unobtainium? Well, 90% of them,
891 rocks, to be exact, won’t set off anything. But 10%, or 99 rocks, 
will set off the detector despite not having unobtanium, a result known as a false positive. Why does that matter? Because it means that all in all, 109 rocks will have 
triggered the detector. And Joe’s rock could be any one of them, from the 10 that contain the mineral to the 99 that don’t, which means the chances of it containing 
unobtainium are 10 out of 109 – about 9%. And paying $200 for a 9%
chance of getting $1000 isn’t great odds. So why is this result so unexpected, and why did Joe’s rock seem 
like such a sure bet? The key is something called 
the base rate fallacy. While we’re focused on the relatively 
high accuracy of the detector, our intuition makes us forget to account for how rare the unobtanium 
was in the first place. But because the device’s error rate of 10% is still higher than 
the mineral’s overall occurrence, any time it goes off is still more likely 
to be a false positive than a real finding. This problem is an example 
of conditional probability. The answer lies neither in the overall 
chance of finding unobtainium, nor the overall chance 
of receiving a false positive reading. This kind of background information 
that we’re given before anything happens is known as unconditional, 
or prior probability. What we’re looking for, though,
is the chance of finding unobtainium once we know that the device did
return a positive reading. This is known as the conditional, 
or posterior probability, determined once the possibilities have 
been narrowed down through observation. Many people are confused 
by the false positive paradox because we have a bias 
for focusing on specific information over the more general, especially when immediate decisions 
come into play. And while in many cases 
it’s better to be safe than sorry, false positives can have 
real negative consequences. False positives in medical testing 
are preferable to false negatives, but they can still lead to stress or
unnecessary treatment. And false positives in mass surveillance can cause innocent people to be
wrongfully arrested, jailed, or worse. As for this case, the one thing 
you can be positive about is that Tricky Joe is trying 
to take you for a ride.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

Although Question 1 does not directly ask for the number of rocks containing unobtanium, it does ask for the percentage of rocks in the mine that contain unobtanium. Given that the ground truth MCQ is based on a scenario where there are 1000 rocks in the mine and 1% of them contain unobtanium (as stated in the transcript), the intent and content of Question 1 are closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. But among the options, Question 1 is the most similar.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of rocks that will set off the detector despite not having unobtanium. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 3 is related to the concept of false positives and the accuracy of the detector.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 9: What is an example of a false positive paradox? Options: A. A medical test returning a false positive result, B. A mass surveillance system wrongly arresting an innocent person, C. A situation where a test or device returns a false positive result despite being highly accurate, D. A situation where a test or device returns a true positive result despite being highly inaccurate.

But since this question does not have the same intent or options as the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ.

If you insist on an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not available, but if I had to choose, it would be Question 9, so the index would be 9.

it out in the field, the device goes off, and 
Joe happily places the rock in his cart. As the two of you head back to camp 
where the ore can be examined, Joe makes you an offer: he’ll sell you the ore for just $200. You know that a piece of unobtanium 
that size would easily be worth $1000, but any other minerals 
would be effectively worthless. Should you make the trade? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Intuitively, it seems like a good deal. Since the detector 
is correct most of the time, shouldn’t you be able
to trust its reading? Unfortunately, no. Here’s why. Imagine the mine 
has exactly 1,000 pieces of ore. An unobtainium rarity of 1% means that there are only 10 rocks 
with the precious mineral inside. All 10 would set off the detector. But what about the other 990
rocks without unobtainium? Well, 90% of them,
891 rocks, to be exact, won’t set off anything. But 10%, or 99 rocks, 
will set off the detector despite not having unobtanium, a result known as a false positive. Why does that matter? Because it means that all in all, 109 rocks will have 
triggered the detector. And Joe’s rock could be any one of them, from the 10 that contain the mineral to the 99 that don’t, which means the chances of it containing 
unobtainium are 10 out of 109 – about 9%. And paying $200 for a 9%
chance of getting $1000 isn’t great odds. So why is this result so unexpected, and why did Joe’s rock seem 
like such a sure bet? The key is something called 
the base rate fallacy. While we’re focused on the relatively 
high accuracy of the detector, our intuition makes us forget to account for how rare the unobtanium 
was in the first place. But because the device’s error rate of 10% is still higher than 
the mineral’s overall occurrence, any time it goes off is still more likely 
to be a false positive than a real finding. This problem is an example 
of conditional probability. The answer lies neither in the overall 
chance of finding unobtainium, nor the overall chance 
of receiving a false positive reading. This kind of background information 
that we’re given before anything happens is known as unconditional, 
or prior probability. What we’re looking for, though,
is the chance of finding unobtainium once we know that the device did
return a positive reading. This is known as the conditional, 
or posterior probability, determined once the possibilities have 
been narrowed down through observation. Many people are confused 
by the false positive paradox because we have a bias 
for focusing on specific information over the more general, especially when immediate decisions 
come into play. And while in many cases 
it’s better to be safe than sorry, false positives can have 
real negative consequences. False positives in medical testing 
are preferable to false negatives, but they can still lead to stress or
unnecessary treatment. And false positives in mass surveillance can cause innocent people to be
wrongfully arrested, jailed, or worse. As for this case, the one thing 
you can be positive about is that Tricky Joe is trying 
to take you for a ride.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: What type of probability is determined after observing the results of a test or device? 

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match can be found in Question 7: What is the difference between prior and posterior probability? Options: A. Prior probability is determined after observing results, while posterior probability is determined before observing results, B. Prior probability is determined before observing results, while posterior probability is determined after observing results, C. Prior probability is the overall chance of an event, while posterior probability is the chance of an event given new information, D. Prior probability is the chance of an event given new information, while posterior probability is the overall chance of an event.

Among these options, option B contains information that closely matches the definition of prior probability in the ground truth MCQ.

However, an even better match can be found by rephrasing Question 6 to focus on the definition of prior probability. 

Since none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ but Question 6 is the closest after rephrasing, and Question 7 option B partially contains the definition, I will provide the index of Question 6.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is 6.

Visiting the bathroom is part 
of the daily human experience. But occasionally, constipation strikes, a condition that causes 
a backup in your digestive system. The food you eat can take several days 
to exit your body. And for many, 
constipation can become chronic, meaning regularly passing lumpy 
hard stools accompanied by straining. What's behind this 
unsettling phenomenon? Constipation arises in the colon, 
also known as the large intestine. This muscular organ is split
into four sections: the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon, which connects with the rectum and anus. The small intestine delivers stool consisting of ingested food, 
bile, and digestive juices to the large intestine. As this stool moves through the colon, the organ siphons off most 
of the water it contains, transforming it from liquid to solid. The longer this transmission takes, the more reabsorption occurs,
resulting in increasingly solid stool. Once it reaches the sigmoid colon, a final bout of reabsorption 
occurs before it enters the rectum, distending its walls and telling
the internal anal sphincter to relax. This is the point where you can usually 
decide whether to physically expel or retain the stool. That’s regulated by 
the pelvic floor muscles, particularly the puborectalis and external anal sphincter. The puborectalis forms 
a sling-like formation around the rectum called the anorectal angle. And when you voluntarily relax 
your external anal sphincter, the stool is finally expelled. When you’re constipated, however, a desire to visit the bathroom isn't
enough to coax your body into action. Usually there's two factors 
behind this problem: the stool’s slow movement 
through the colon and/or pelvic floor dysfunction. In the first, stool moves excessively 
slowly through the intestines, causing over-absorption of liquid, 
which makes the stool dry and hard. With pelvic floor dysfunction, stool becomes difficult 
to eliminate from the rectum because of tightened pelvic floor muscles,
or due to a pelvic organ prolapse, usually through childbirth or aging. Both of these problems 
make the anorectal angle more acute and it becomes difficult to expel waste. To identify constipation precisely, researchers have developed metrics,
such as the Bristol Stool Chart. Most people who look at that chart will be able to tell they’ve experienced 
constipation before. When you’re on the toilet, you should
ideally be in a squatting position. With your buttocks firmly 
on the toilet seat, you can elevate your feet on a stool and lean forwards with a straight back, which straightens the anorectal angle
and eases the passage of waste. Going a day without a bowel movement 
isn’t necessarily cause for alarm. But if you are experiencing 
chronic constipation, simple dietary and lifestyle changes, like fibrous vegetables, regular exercise, abdominal massage, and 6 to 8 cups of water per day may help restore your daily
trip to the toilet.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is the correct technique for squatting?
Options: A. Elevate your feet on a stool and lean backward with a straight back, B. Elevate your feet on a stool and lean forward with a straight back, C. Keep your feet on the ground and lean forward with a straight back, D. Keep your feet on the ground and lean backward with a straight back
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQs**:
Question 1: Where does constipation typically arise in the human body? Options: A. The small intestine, B. The stomach, C. The colon (large intestine), D. The liver Correct Option: None
Question 2: What is the primary function of the colon in the digestive system? Options: A. To break down food into smaller molecules, B. To absorb nutrients from the small intestine, C. To siphon off water from stool and transform it from liquid to solid, D. To produce digestive enzymes Correct Option: None
Question 3: What is the Bristol Stool Chart used for? Options: A. To diagnose digestive disorders, B. To track bowel movements, C. To identify constipation precisely, D. D: To measure body temperature Correct Option: None
Question 4: What is the recommended position for defecation according to the transcript? Options: A. Standing up, B. Sitting on the toilet seat, C. Squatting with feet elevated on a stool, D. Lying down Correct Option: None
Question 5: What is the role of the pelvic floor muscles in the defecation process? Options: A. To absorb water from the stool, B. To break down food into smaller molecules, C. To relax and allow the stool to be expelled, D. To produce digestive enzymes Correct Option: None
Question 6: What are two common factors behind constipation? Options: A. Slow movement of stool through the colon and pelvic floor dysfunction, B. Over-absorption of liquid and under-absorption of nutrients, C. Tightened pelvic floor muscles and pelvic organ prolapse, D. Inadequate fiber intake and lack of exercise Correct Option: None
Question 7: What is the result of over-absorption of liquid in the colon? Options: A. Soft and wet stool, B. Dry and hard stool, C. Increased bowel movements, D. Reduced appetite Correct Option: None
Question 8: What is the recommended daily water intake to help restore bowel movements? Options: A. 2-3 cups, B. 4-5 cups, C. 6-8 cups, D. 10 cups Correct Option: None
Question 9: What is the name of the muscular organ that forms a sling-like formation around the rectum? Options: A. Puborectalis, B. External anal sphincter, C. Anorectal angle, D. Rectum Correct Option: None
Question 10: What is the recommended dietary change to help restore bowel movements? Options: A. Increased intake of sugary foods, B. Increased intake of fiber-rich vegetables, C. Increased intake of processed meats, D. Increased intake of dairy products Correct Option: None

**Transcript**:
Visiting the bathroom is part 
of the daily human experience. But occasionally, constipation strikes, a condition that causes 
a backup in your digestive system. The food you eat can take several days 
to exit your body. And for many, 
constipation can become chronic, meaning regularly passing lumpy 
hard stools accompanied by straining. What's behind this 
unsettling phenomenon? Constipation arises in the colon, 
also known as the large intestine. This muscular organ is split
into four sections: the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon, which connects with the rectum and anus. The small intestine delivers stool consisting of ingested food, 
bile, and digestive juices to the large intestine. As this stool moves through the colon, the organ siphons off most 
of the water it contains, transforming it from liquid to solid. The longer this transmission takes, the more reabsorption occurs,
resulting in increasingly solid stool. Once it reaches the sigmoid colon, a final bout of reabsorption 
occurs before it enters the rectum, distending its walls and telling
the internal anal sphincter to relax. This is the point where you can usually 
decide whether to physically expel or retain the stool. That’s regulated by 
the pelvic floor muscles, particularly the puborectalis and external anal sphincter. The puborectalis forms 
a sling-like formation around the rectum called the anorectal angle. And when you voluntarily relax 
your external anal sphincter, the stool is finally expelled. When you’re constipated, however, a desire to visit the bathroom isn't
enough to coax your body into action. Usually there's two factors 
behind this problem: the stool’s slow movement 
through the colon and/or pelvic floor dysfunction. In the first, stool moves excessively 
slowly through the intestines, causing over-absorption of liquid, 
which makes the stool dry and hard. With pelvic floor dysfunction, stool becomes difficult 
to eliminate from the rectum because of tightened pelvic floor muscles,
or due to a pelvic organ prolapse, usually through childbirth or aging. Both of these problems 
make the anorectal angle more acute and it becomes difficult to expel waste. To identify constipation precisely, researchers have developed metrics,
such as the Bristol Stool Chart. Most people who look at that chart will be able to tell they’ve experienced 
constipation before. When you’re on the toilet, you should
ideally be in a squatting position. With your buttocks firmly 
on the toilet seat, you can elevate your feet on a stool and lean forwards with a straight back, which straightens the anorectal angle
and eases the passage of waste. Going a day without a bowel movement 
isn’t necessarily cause for alarm. But if you are experiencing 
chronic constipation, simple dietary and lifestyle changes, like fibrous vegetables, regular exercise, abdominal massage, and 6 to 8 cups of water per day may help restore your daily
trip to the toilet.

**Transcript**:

**Transcript**:
We're sometimes not too sure how we get into good friendships. It seems to happen rather mysteriously. We talk of somewhat
randomly clicking with people. Trying to plan for this sounds like cheating. but there is something at the heart of many friendships that seemed important to identify and in a way to get good at: Vulnerability. It's too easy to assume
that what makes us likable , are our strengths our accomplishments, the things
we're proud of. Certainly this impresses, but it isn't what draws others to us. We get close to someone the more they, and we find ourselves able gracefully to
depart from the official story of what human beings are like, and can start to show the awkward truths which underlie the cheerful facade. These are the truths with which we've
been lonely for too long. How unlike normal sexuality our sex lives actually are; how full of envy are our careers are proving; how unsatisfactory our family can be; how worried we are, all the time. Revealing any of these things places us
in great danger. Others could laugh; social media would have a field day. That's the point. We can only get close by revealing things which would, in the wrong hands, be capable of inflicting appalling
humiliation on us. Friendship is the dividend of gratitude, that flows from acknowledgement that one has offered something very valuable to someone. Not a fancy present, but something even more precious: the key to one's self-esteem and dignity. It's deeply poignant that we should expend so much effort on trying to look strong before the world. When, all the while, it's really only ever the
revelation of the somewhat embarrassing, sad melancholy and anxious bits of us that
are what makes us endearing to others and can transform strangers into friends.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking whether fear is at the heart of many friendships, with the correct answer being False. However, upon examining the transcript, it becomes clear that the concept being discussed is not fear, but rather vulnerability.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content is Question 8: "What is the relationship between vulnerability and friendship?" This question is asking about the connection between vulnerability and friendship, which is a central theme in the transcript.

Although the options in Question 8 do not directly match the True/False format of the ground truth MCQ, the correct answer (B. Vulnerability is a key to forming friendships) aligns with the idea presented in the transcript that vulnerability is essential for forming deep connections and friendships.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 8.

**Transcript**:
Time... makes sense in small pieces. But when you look at huge stretches of time, it's almost impossible to wrap your head around things. So, let's start small-- with minutes, hours, days. You probably spent the last 24 hours mostly sleeping and working, and you probably wasted a good chunk of yesterday on the Internet. Days become weeks, weeks become months, and then we have a year. Let's look at 2017. France started to train eagles to hunt terrorist drones, A Czech nuclear power plant held a bikini contest to pick their new intern, and people on the Internet made a challenge out of eating bleach. You know, the usual stuff. Let's go back further. A kid born in the first year of the 21st Century is 18 years old now. But the century is still young, even if you're not. It was largely shaped by the attacks on 9/11, which led to the war in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq. In March 2011, the Syrian Civil War began, and is still ongoing after seven years. Most of us were born in the 20th century, which had the two most devastating wars in human history, and the Cold War. For the first time ever, we could destroy ourselves with the nuclear weapons, and we almost did, but we also had a space race and left Earth for the first time. The Internet was also invented, which led to memes , but also to Facebook and Twitter, so all in all, we're not sure if this was a GOOD development. The average human lives about 79 years, which covers a good chunk of recent history. The oldest living person on Earth is currently Celino Jaramillo, who was born in 1896, which means that his birth was closer to Napoleon ruling Europe than to the current day. Only 250 years ago, the Industrial Revolution turned the world into a progress machine. Farmers became workers, and knowledge became easier to distribute. Around this time, we started the progress that is causing climate change today. Not that long ago, actually. The Theory of Evolution changed how we saw ourselves and the world we live in. Newton wrote down his theory of gravity. We discovered distant stars and very close bacteria. The 15th century was very eventful. Columbus's "discovery" of America and the fall of Constantinople marked the end of the Middle Ages. War was all the rage in the Middle Ages, but the number one killer was disease. The Black Plague killed every third European in just six years. Around 2,000 years ago, we set the arbitrary Year 1 of our calendar that most of the world follows today. But to a Roman, the world was already ancient. The Great Pyramids were constructed 4,500 years ago. So, to a Roman, the pyramids were older than the Romans are to us today. So long ago, that there were still living mammoths on Earth. A lot of history happened before that, even. Around 7,000 years ago, humans began writing things down. About 12,000 years ago, human organization exploded. We built our first temple, and around the world, mankind began farming, which enabled the rise of larger communities. Our dominance over planet Earth really begins here. Homo sapiens sapiens, the modern human, evolved at least 200,000 years ago. 50,000 years ago, the Cognitive Revolution expanded our minds and innovation. Back then, we shared Earth with at least five other human species that either died out or were killed by us. At least 2 million years ago, our ancestors already had control over fire and constructed tools from wood and stone. And six million years ago, the last common ancestors of chimpanzees and humans existed. So this graph is all of human history. Our close relative, Homo erectus, survived 10 times longer than we have existed. This tiny part is the human era. We have to zoom in a lot to even see your lifetime. Still, all of human history is not that long. 65 million years ago, the age of the dinosaurs ended in an enormous explosion. The dinosaurs ruled the Earth for over 165 million years. 27 times as long as all humans. That's so long, that it means a T-rex that lived at 65 million years ago is closer to us today than to a live Stegosaurus. Dinosaurs in the form of mighty chickens are still around today. Animal life on this planet started 600 million years ago. The earliest animals were fish and other small simple sea creatures, then came insects, then reptiles and finally, around 200 million years ago, mammals joined the party. Life itself began much further back. There is evidence that it appeared up to 4.1 BILLION years ago. For at least 3.5 billion years, life consisted only of single-celled organisms. 4.5 billion years ago, the Sun was born from a gigantic imploding gas cloud. 60 million years later, Earth formed. In those early years, frequent bombardment by comets and asteroids supplied the Earth with large oceans. But as far as the whole universe goes, our solar system is pretty new. 13.75 billion years ago, the universe was born. And about half a billion years later, our own galaxy formed from billions of stars. But what came before the Big Bang? The truth is... we don't know, and maybe we never will. And there you have it... The past. Now let's take a look at what we know about the future. In roughly 1 billion years, the Sun will be so hot that life on Earth becomes impossible. The death of the Sun 4 billion years later marks the end of life in the solar system. If we want to have a chance to survive, we need to have ventured to the stars. And what happens after that? In the next 100 billion years, most of the biggest stars around will die. The universe becomes dimmer and dimmer, illuminated only by smaller red and white dwarfs. But they too will eventually burn out and one day... the last star in the universe will die. The universe will turn dark, and at some point, even black holes will evaporate and die. When they do our, universe will reach its final stage: Heat death. Nothing changes anymore; the universe is dead. Forever. Now, you're feeling some pretty weird feelings right now, aren't you? We are, too. It's only natural. The good news is this is all far, far away. The only time that actually matters is now. That cute girl or boy you like, ask them out! Time is precious. Make it count!

The ground truth MCQ is about the Industrial Revolution and its results. Among the generated MCQs, none of them directly address the Industrial Revolution. However, some of them do talk about historical events and timelines.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar, but only in terms of historical events. It mentions the 15th century, which is not directly related to the Industrial Revolution, but it's the closest one in terms of historical context.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that directly address the Industrial Revolution and its results.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2 (but with a low confidence level)

**Transcript**:
Time... makes sense in small pieces. But when you look at huge stretches of time, it's almost impossible to wrap your head around things. So, let's start small-- with minutes, hours, days. You probably spent the last 24 hours mostly sleeping and working, and you probably wasted a good chunk of yesterday on the Internet. Days become weeks, weeks become months, and then we have a year. Let's look at 2017. France started to train eagles to hunt terrorist drones, A Czech nuclear power plant held a bikini contest to pick their new intern, and people on the Internet made a challenge out of eating bleach. You know, the usual stuff. Let's go back further. A kid born in the first year of the 21st Century is 18 years old now. But the century is still young, even if you're not. It was largely shaped by the attacks on 9/11, which led to the war in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq. In March 2011, the Syrian Civil War began, and is still ongoing after seven years. Most of us were born in the 20th century, which had the two most devastating wars in human history, and the Cold War. For the first time ever, we could destroy ourselves with the nuclear weapons, and we almost did, but we also had a space race and left Earth for the first time. The Internet was also invented, which led to memes , but also to Facebook and Twitter, so all in all, we're not sure if this was a GOOD development. The average human lives about 79 years, which covers a good chunk of recent history. The oldest living person on Earth is currently Celino Jaramillo, who was born in 1896, which means that his birth was closer to Napoleon ruling Europe than to the current day. Only 250 years ago, the Industrial Revolution turned the world into a progress machine. Farmers became workers, and knowledge became easier to distribute. Around this time, we started the progress that is causing climate change today. Not that long ago, actually. The Theory of Evolution changed how we saw ourselves and the world we live in. Newton wrote down his theory of gravity. We discovered distant stars and very close bacteria. The 15th century was very eventful. Columbus's "discovery" of America and the fall of Constantinople marked the end of the Middle Ages. War was all the rage in the Middle Ages, but the number one killer was disease. The Black Plague killed every third European in just six years. Around 2,000 years ago, we set the arbitrary Year 1 of our calendar that most of the world follows today. But to a Roman, the world was already ancient. The Great Pyramids were constructed 4,500 years ago. So, to a Roman, the pyramids were older than the Romans are to us today. So long ago, that there were still living mammoths on Earth. A lot of history happened before that, even. Around 7,000 years ago, humans began writing things down. About 12,000 years ago, human organization exploded. We built our first temple, and around the world, mankind began farming, which enabled the rise of larger communities. Our dominance over planet Earth really begins here. Homo sapiens sapiens, the modern human, evolved at least 200,000 years ago. 50,000 years ago, the Cognitive Revolution expanded our minds and innovation. Back then, we shared Earth with at least five other human species that either died out or were killed by us. At least 2 million years ago, our ancestors already had control over fire and constructed tools from wood and stone. And six million years ago, the last common ancestors of chimpanzees and humans existed. So this graph is all of human history. Our close relative, Homo erectus, survived 10 times longer than we have existed. This tiny part is the human era. We have to zoom in a lot to even see your lifetime. Still, all of human history is not that long. 65 million years ago, the age of the dinosaurs ended in an enormous explosion. The dinosaurs ruled the Earth for over 165 million years. 27 times as long as all humans. That's so long, that it means a T-rex that lived at 65 million years ago is closer to us today than to a live Stegosaurus. Dinosaurs in the form of mighty chickens are still around today. Animal life on this planet started 600 million years ago. The earliest animals were fish and other small simple sea creatures, then came insects, then reptiles and finally, around 200 million years ago, mammals joined the party. Life itself began much further back. There is evidence that it appeared up to 4.1 BILLION years ago. For at least 3.5 billion years, life consisted only of single-celled organisms. 4.5 billion years ago, the Sun was born from a gigantic imploding gas cloud. 60 million years later, Earth formed. In those early years, frequent bombardment by comets and asteroids supplied the Earth with large oceans. But as far as the whole universe goes, our solar system is pretty new. 13.75 billion years ago, the universe was born. And about half a billion years later, our own galaxy formed from billions of stars. But what came before the Big Bang? The truth is... we don't know, and maybe we never will. And there you have it... The past. Now let's take a look at what we know about the future. In roughly 1 billion years, the Sun will be so hot that life on Earth becomes impossible. The death of the Sun 4 billion years later marks the end of life in the solar system. If we want to have a chance to survive, we need to have ventured to the stars. And what happens after that? In the next 100 billion years, most of the biggest stars around will die. The universe becomes dimmer and dimmer, illuminated only by smaller red and white dwarfs. But they too will eventually burn out and one day... the last star in the universe will die. The universe will turn dark, and at some point, even black holes will evaporate and die. When they do our, universe will reach its final stage: Heat death. Nothing changes anymore; the universe is dead. Forever. Now, you're feeling some pretty weird feelings right now, aren't you? We are, too. It's only natural. The good news is this is all far, far away. The only time that actually matters is now. That cute girl or boy you like, ask them out! Time is precious. Make it count!

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although Question 5 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the duration of single-celled organisms, while Question 5 asks about the approximate time when life on Earth began. However, both questions are related to the timeline of life on Earth, and the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ (3.5 billion years) is related to the information provided in the transcript near the mention of life beginning 4.1 billion years ago.

A more suitable generated MCQ would have options that include the duration of single-celled organisms, but given the available options, Question 5 is the most similar.

**Transcript**:
More than two kilometers below 
the surface of northern Ontario, suspended in 345,000 liters 
of ultra-pure water, there’s a perfect sphere. It contains 3600 kilograms 
of liquid argon, cooled to -180 degrees Celsius. Scientists continuously monitor 
this chamber from above ground, looking for a glimmer 
of light in the darkness. Because down here, deep beneath the Earth’s surface 
and cocooned in a watery shield, that light would indicate the presence of
one of the universe’s greatest mysteries: dark matter. All the matter we can see,
planets, stars and galaxies, doesn’t create enough gravitational pull to explain
the universe’s larger structure. It’s dark matter, which is estimated 
to make up 25% of the known universe. But despite its prevalence, so far we haven’t been able 
to detect it directly. It’s no small challenge. Dark matter was so named because it
doesn’t interact with any type of light, visible or otherwise, which means our usual observation tools simply don’t work 
when trying to observe it. But while dark matter may not be visible 
in the electromagnetic spectrum, it’s still matter, so we should be able to measure 
its interactions with other matter. And if our current model 
of physics is correct, billions of sub-atomic 
dark matter particles are passing through 
the Earth every second. Despite the prevalence of dark matter, its interactions are predicted to be rare 
and extremely weak. To detect these interactions, dark matter experiments need to be
incredibly sensitive. With such sensitive equipment, the ever-present background radiation 
on Earth’s surface would create so much noise in the data that any dark matter particles 
would be completely overwhelmed. It would be like trying to hear
a pin drop on a busy city street. To solve this problem, scientists have had 
to dig deep into the Earth. Dark matter experiments are set up 
in specialized underground labs, either in mines or inside mountains. The rock that makes up 
the Earth’s crust works like a filter, absorbing radiation 
and stopping disruptive particles. The ultra-pure water
in which the detector is suspended adds an additional layer 
of radiation filtering. This shielding ensures that only 
the particles scientists are looking for can make their way into the detectors. Once these particles reach 
an experiment’s inner vessel, scientists have a chance 
of detecting them. The detector media are chosen because 
they’re exquisitely sensitive detectors that can be purified extremely well. These could be a liquid noble gas, germanium and silicon crystals, a refrigerant, or other materials. When radiation interacts, 
it leaves tell-tale signs, such as light or bubbles, which can be picked up by the sensors
inside the detector. The detector media are held 
in a central chamber made of glass or a special type of acrylic. These chambers have to be able 
to hold the substance inside without interacting with it while withstanding incredible pressure 
from the water outside. The inner vessel is surrounded 
by powerful sensors designed to detect even the
tiniest blips of light, or the sound vibrations 
caused by a single bubble. Each sensor records data 24/7, and experiments run for months 
and years at a time, generating terabytes of data every day. Building dark matter detectors 
is as much a feat of engineering as it is a feat of physics. By the time an experiment 
is ready to start collecting data, years or decades of work and investment 
have already gone into it, to the tune of tens 
of millions of dollars. As of 2017, no dark matter particles 
have been directly detected. That’s not entirely surprising. Physicists expect these interactions to be
incredibly rare and difficult to detect. In the meantime, scientists continue 
to develop new technologies and increase detector sensitivity, closing in on where dark matter is hiding. And when they find it, we’ll finally be able to bring the 
universe’s darkest secrets into the light.

**Transcript**:
More than two kilometers below 
the surface of northern Ontario, suspended in 345,000 liters 
of ultra-pure water, there’s a perfect sphere. It contains 3600 kilograms 
of liquid argon, cooled to -180 degrees Celsius. Scientists continuously monitor 
this chamber from above ground, looking for a glimmer 
of light in the darkness. Because down here, deep beneath the Earth’s surface 
and cocooned in a watery shield, that light would indicate the presence of
one of the universe’s greatest mysteries: dark matter. All the matter we can see,
planets, stars and galaxies, doesn’t create enough gravitational pull to explain
the universe’s larger structure. It’s dark matter, which is estimated 
to make up 25% of the known universe. But despite its prevalence, so far we haven’t been able 
to detect it directly. It’s no small challenge. Dark matter was so named because it
doesn’t interact with any type of light, visible or otherwise, which means our usual observation tools simply don’t work 
when trying to observe it. But while dark matter may not be visible 
in the electromagnetic spectrum, it’s still matter, so we should be able to measure 
its interactions with other matter. And if our current model 
of physics is correct, billions of sub-atomic 
dark matter particles are passing through 
the Earth every second. Despite the prevalence of dark matter, its interactions are predicted to be rare 
and extremely weak. To detect these interactions, dark matter experiments need to be
incredibly sensitive. With such sensitive equipment, the ever-present background radiation 
on Earth’s surface would create so much noise in the data that any dark matter particles 
would be completely overwhelmed. It would be like trying to hear
a pin drop on a busy city street. To solve this problem, scientists have had 
to dig deep into the Earth. Dark matter experiments are set up 
in specialized underground labs, either in mines or inside mountains. The rock that makes up 
the Earth’s crust works like a filter, absorbing radiation 
and stopping disruptive particles. The ultra-pure water
in which the detector is suspended adds an additional layer 
of radiation filtering. This shielding ensures that only 
the particles scientists are looking for can make their way into the detectors. Once these particles reach 
an experiment’s inner vessel, scientists have a chance 
of detecting them. The detector media are chosen because 
they’re exquisitely sensitive detectors that can be purified extremely well. These could be a liquid noble gas, germanium and silicon crystals, a refrigerant, or other materials. When radiation interacts, 
it leaves tell-tale signs, such as light or bubbles, which can be picked up by the sensors
inside the detector. The detector media are held 
in a central chamber made of glass or a special type of acrylic. These chambers have to be able 
to hold the substance inside without interacting with it while withstanding incredible pressure 
from the water outside. The inner vessel is surrounded 
by powerful sensors designed to detect even the
tiniest blips of light, or the sound vibrations 
caused by a single bubble. Each sensor records data 24/7, and experiments run for months 
and years at a time, generating terabytes of data every day. Building dark matter detectors 
is as much a feat of engineering as it is a feat of physics. By the time an experiment 
is ready to start collecting data, years or decades of work and investment 
have already gone into it, to the tune of tens 
of millions of dollars. As of 2017, no dark matter particles

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: What type of detectors are used in dark matter experiments? Options: A. Liquid noble gases, B. Germanium and silicon crystals, C. Refrigerants, D. All of the above.

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it asks about the types of detectors used in dark matter experiments, which is related to the ground truth MCQ's question about what cannot be used as a detector medium. Although the questions are not identical, they both deal with the topic of detector media and options.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more ideal match would be a question that asks about what cannot be used as a detector medium, with options that include materials that are not suitable for dark matter detection.

**Transcript**:
The oldest glue in the world 
is over 8,000 years old and comes from a cave near the Dead Sea. Ancient people used this glue, made from a mixture of animal bone 
and plant materials, to waterproof baskets 
and construct utensils. And for thousands of years after, plants and animals were the glue 
that held human civilization together. Today, we have enough types of tape and
glue to build and repair almost anything. But what gives glue 
and tape their stickiness? And is one stronger than the other? Adhesives can be made 
from synthetic molecules or natural proteins and carbohydrates like the vegetable starch dextrin, the milk protein casein, and the terpenes in tree resin. In order to work, glue and tape need 
both adhesive bonds and cohesive bonds. Adhesive bonds occur between 
an adhesive’s molecules and the molecules 
of whatever it’s sticking to. Cohesive bonds happen between 
a glue or tape’s own molecules, holding it together. Most glues consist of adhesive polymers 
dissolved in a solvent that prevents them from sticking
to the inside of the bottle. The strong smell of many glues 
comes from the solvent, which evaporates when exposed to air. Some glues use water as a solvent, but others use chemicals 
that can be harmful to inhale. Glues with two or more components that
chemically react instead of just drying can create stronger bonds. Both the adhesive and cohesive bonds 
of glue are strong, but the drying process 
makes them irreversible. This is why, if a glued surface 
is broken after it dries, it can’t be reattached without new glue. By contrast, 
when tape is applied to a surface, it forms weaker, reversible bonds, so you can peel a piece of tape off 
a surface and use it again. These weak bonds, 
called Van der Waals forces, can occur between any two materials, but only if they’re 
extremely close together, closer than the naked eye can see. Tape usually consists of a backing coated 
with a combination of a rubber or rubber-like "stretchy" component, and a compound called a tackifier. That’s the "sticky" component. A tape’s stickiness is determined by the proportion of elastic component 
and tackifier, the thickness of adhesive spread 
onto the backing, and the type of backing material. No chemical reaction occurs 
when tape is pressed onto a surface. Instead, the soft adhesive flows into 
the cracks and grooves of the surface. This ability to slide into cracks and then
stay in place is called viscoelasticity. Once the viscoelastic adhesive fills 
these microscopic crevices, it is close enough to form 
Van der Waals forces. So what’s the world’s strongest adhesive? Well, there’s no one answer. In terms of absolute strength 
of adhesive bonds, glue is stronger than tape, but no single adhesive
works well in all circumstances. Of the glues, cyanoacrylates, 
or super glues, may form the strongest bonds, but two-component epoxy glues have much
higher resistance to heat and shearing, and are compatible 
with a wider range of surfaces. So, if you wanted 
to dangle an anvil in the air, super glue might be your best bet. But if you’re doing so 
over an active volcano, you’d want an epoxy instead. And in order to work at all, glues need enough real estate 
where surfaces touch. If for some reason you wanted 
to make a chain of bowling balls, duct tape would be better. Engineers weigh similar, 
if less absurd, factors all the time. Choosing the right glue to withstand 
the heat inside an engine is a matter of life and death. And though the strength 
of duct tape’s adhesive bonds can’t compete with those of epoxy glues, tape does have the advantage of 
instantaneous stickiness in an emergency. Glue may be necessary 
to get a rocket to space, but when it comes 
to extraterrestrial repairs, stick to duct tape: 
liquid glues don’t work in zero gravity.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. However, the options provided for Question 5 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A closer examination reveals that Question 5's option D states that "Tape forms weaker, reversible bonds," which is related to the ground truth MCQ's statement about glue's adhesive and cohesive bonds being irreversible.

However, upon re-examining the generated MCQs, it appears that none directly address the reversibility of glue's adhesive and cohesive bonds. But we can consider the closest match based on the content.

A more suitable match would be to consider the generated MCQs that discuss the properties of glue and tape. Question 5 is the closest in terms of discussing the properties of glue and tape, but it does not directly address the reversibility of glue's bonds.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 5, with the caveat that the options provided do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The oldest glue in the world 
is over 8,000 years old and comes from a cave near the Dead Sea. Ancient people used this glue, made from a mixture of animal bone 
and plant materials, to waterproof baskets 
and construct utensils. And for thousands of years after, plants and animals were the glue 
that held human civilization together. Today, we have enough types of tape and
glue to build and repair almost anything. But what gives glue 
and tape their stickiness? And is one stronger than the other? Adhesives can be made 
from synthetic molecules or natural proteins and carbohydrates like the vegetable starch dextrin, the milk protein casein, and the terpenes in tree resin. In order to work, glue and tape need 
both adhesive bonds and cohesive bonds. Adhesive bonds occur between 
an adhesive’s molecules and the molecules 
of whatever it’s sticking to. Cohesive bonds happen between 
a glue or tape’s own molecules, holding it together. Most glues consist of adhesive polymers 
dissolved in a solvent that prevents them from sticking
to the inside of the bottle. The strong smell of many glues 
comes from the solvent, which evaporates when exposed to air. Some glues use water as a solvent, but others use chemicals 
that can be harmful to inhale. Glues with two or more components that
chemically react instead of just drying can create stronger bonds. Both the adhesive and cohesive bonds 
of glue are strong, but the drying process 
makes them irreversible. This is why, if a glued surface 
is broken after it dries, it can’t be reattached without new glue. By contrast, 
when tape is applied to a surface, it forms weaker, reversible bonds, so you can peel a piece of tape off 
a surface and use it again. These weak bonds, 
called Van der Waals forces, can occur between any two materials, but only if they’re 
extremely close together, closer than the naked eye can see. Tape usually consists of a backing coated 
with a combination of a rubber or rubber-like "stretchy" component, and a compound called a tackifier. That’s the "sticky" component. A tape’s stickiness is determined by the proportion of elastic component 
and tackifier, the thickness of adhesive spread 
onto the backing, and the type of backing material. No chemical reaction occurs 
when tape is pressed onto a surface. Instead, the soft adhesive flows into 
the cracks and grooves of the surface. This ability to slide into cracks and then
stay in place is called viscoelasticity. Once the viscoelastic adhesive fills 
these microscopic crevices, it is close enough to form 
Van der Waals forces. So what’s the world’s strongest adhesive? Well, there’s no one answer. In terms of absolute strength 
of adhesive bonds, glue is stronger than tape, but no single adhesive
works well in all circumstances. Of the glues, cyanoacrylates, 
or super glues, may form the strongest bonds, but two-component epoxy glues have much
higher resistance to heat and shearing, and are compatible 
with a wider range of surfaces. So, if you wanted 
to dangle an anvil in the air, super glue might be your best bet. But if you’re doing so 
over an active volcano, you’d want an epoxy instead. And in order to work at all, glues need enough real estate 
where surfaces touch. If for some reason you wanted 
to make a chain of bowling balls, duct tape would be better. Engineers weigh similar, 
if less absurd, factors all the time. Choosing the right glue to withstand 
the heat inside an engine is a matter of life and death. And though the strength 
of duct tape’s adhesive bonds can’t compete with those of epoxy glues, tape does have the advantage of 
instantaneous stickiness in an emergency. Glue may be necessary 
to get a rocket to space, but when it comes 
to extraterrestrial repairs, stick to duct tape: 
liquid glues don’t work in zero gravity.

**Transcript**:
Touchscreens are everywhere. Not just in smartphones, but in supermarkets,
ATMs, and even airplane seats. And you may have noticed that not all touchscreens
are the same. The old-school touchscreens can be pretty
tough to use -- sometimes it feels more like a push-really-hard-screen instead of a touchscreen. On the other hand, certain smartphones and
computer monitors are really responsive to many different touch patterns. There are lots of different technologies out
there, but they’re all trying to achieve the same goal: sending precise electrical
signals from specific locations on the screen. One of the most widely used types is the resistive
touchscreen, where you have to physically push and bend the screen to make it work. Resistive touchscreens are made of two separate
layers: The top layer is made from a flexible and
transparent material, such as polyethylene, which is a common plastic used to make things
like soda bottles. And the bottom layer is made of something
more rigid, like a sheet of glass. To make the screen work, both of these layers
are thinly coated with some sort of metal compound that conducts electricity, like indium
tin oxide -- which is commonly used because it’s transparent. These layers are also separated by tiny insulating
dots, which /don’t/ conduct electricity, called spacers. They keep the screens apart to make sure there
aren’t any false touch signals. When the screen is on, a small voltage is
applied across the screen in both the horizontal and vertical directions. As soon as you push down on the flexible screen
with anything, like your finger or a stylus, it connects the two layers together. This changes the voltage, and a small processor
connected to the screen can calculate exactly where you pressed in X and Y coordinates. These resistive touchscreens are pretty affordable
and durable. So, they’re useful for things like credit
card readers in grocery stores, where you need to capture touch data of a messy signature
-- over and over again. But they can be a little frustrating to use
if you don’t push hard enough. Plus, they normally can’t understand multiple-touches
at the same time – so they’re no good for two-finger zoom or more complex tasks. That’s why these days, most smartphones
rely on capacitive touchscreens, where your finger becomes a key part of the electronics. There are different kinds of capacitive touchscreens,
and they can vary from device to device. But one basic design is a sheet of glass containing
a grid of hair-thin lines of a conductive metal, like indium tin oxide. The grid lines in one direction are called
the driving lines, which provide a constant electric current. And the lines in the other direction are called
the sensing lines, which detect this electric current. At every point where the sensing lines and
the driving lines cross, there will be a specific electrostatic field, which is registered as
neutral by the processor in your smartphone or computer. But that all changes when something conductive
comes along and touches it -- like your finger. See, the human body has a natural capacitance,
which means our bodies can conduct electric current, and can store electric charge. So when your finger touches the screen, the
charge in the screen is drawn around that point, distorting that electrostatic field. The electricity doesn’t actually /flow/
through your finger. Basically, the electrostatic field feels the
effects of your electric charge and redistributes itself accordingly. Even really small changes are detected by
the processor, which can then interpret the patterns you’re making – whether it’s
a tap or a slide. Because the lines of the grid are so thin,
capacitive touchscreens are super accurate, and some versions can process multiple touches
at a time. But they won’t work if you have gloves on
-- because the cloth isn’t conductive, unless your gloves have those special fingertips
with metal fibers inside. Plus, something like sweat can affect how
electricity is conducted across the screen, because it’s full of salts. It’s all about the materials that can affect
the electrostatic field generated inside your screen. So next time you’re texting on a smartphone
or scrolling through internet forums on a tablet, just remember: you’re actually a
part of the electronics making it work. Thank you for watching this episode of SciShow,

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the characteristics of polyethylene, which is a material used in the construction of resistive touchscreens. Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is related to the construction of resistive touchscreens, but it asks about the purpose of spacers, not the characteristics of polyethylene.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index of a matching generated MCQ. However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3, but with a note that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If you would like, I can try to generate a new set of MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
On a beautiful day, just a few years ago my wife and I entered a hospital near our home in Oakland, California for the birth of our first daughter, Maya. We had responsibly toured
the birthing center in advance and yet we were somehow
still startled to find ourselves in the place where we would experience one of the most significant
moments of our lives. We were stuck in a windowless room with no hint of the bright
and sunny day that we had left. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, the paint on the walls was beige and machines beeped inexplicably as a wall clock indicated
day turning to night. That clock was placed above a door in direct line of sight to where my wife lay as her contractions
increased hour after hour. Now, I've never given birth -- (Laughter) but she assured me that the last thing
that a birthing woman would ever want is to watch the seconds tick by. (Laughter) An architect by training,
I've always been fascinated watching people experience design
in the world around them. I believe design functions
like the soundtrack that we're not even
fully aware is playing. It sends us subconscious messages
about how to feel and what to expect. That room that we were in
seemed completely misaligned with the moment
that we were experiencing -- welcoming a human being, our daughter, into this world. At one point a nurse, without any prompt, turned to us and said, "I always think to myself, 'I wish I had become an architect, because I could have designed
rooms like this better.'" I said to her, "An architect did design this room." (Laughter) Despite the immense joy
of our daughter's birth, the messages of that hospital room
stick with she and I to this day. Those messages are, "You are not at home, you are in a foreign place." "You are not in control of anything. Not even the lighting." "Your comfort, simply, is secondary." At best, a hospital room like this might just be described
or dismissed as uninspiring. At worst, it is undignifying. And I use it to point out that none of us, anywhere in the world, are immune from bad design. I went into architecture
because I believed it was about creating spaces for people
to live their best lives. And yet what I found
is a profession largely disconnected from the people most directly
impacted by its work. I believe this is because
architecture remains a white, male, elitist profession -- seemingly unconcerned with some of the greatest
needs in the world or even the relatively simple needs
of an expectant mother. Students are trained in school using highly theoretical projects, rarely interacting with real people
or actual communities. Graduates are funneled
through a long, narrow unforgiving path to licensure. Meanwhile, the profession
holds up a select few through relentless award programs focused almost exclusively
on the aesthetics of buildings, rather than the societal impact
or contributions of them. It only goes to reinforce a warped view of professional responsibility and success and yet this isn't
why so many young, hopeful people go into architecture. It's not why I did. I believed then, though I didn't
have a language for it, and I know now, that design
has a unique ability to dignify. It can make people feel valued, respected, honored and seen. Now I'd like for you to just think
about some of the spaces that you inhabit. And I'd like to have you think
about how they make you feel. Now, there are places
that make us feel unhappy, unhealthy or uninspiring. They may be the places that you work or where you heal or even where you live. And I ask, how might these places
be better designed with you in mind? It's a really simple question and it can somehow, sometimes
be very difficult to answer. Because we are conditioned
to feel like we don't have much agency over the spaces and places
that we live, work and play. And in many cases we don't. But we all should. Now, here's a potentially dumb question
for any women watching: Have you ever stood in a disproportionately long
bathroom line? (Laughter) Did you ever think to yourself,
"What is wrong with this picture?" Well, what if the real question is, "What is wrong with the men
that designed these bathrooms?" (Applause) It may seem like a small thing, but it's representative
of a much more serious issue. The contemporary world
was literally built by men who have rarely
taken the time to understand how people unlike them experience their designs. A long bathroom line
might seem like a minor indignity. But the opposite can also be true. Thoughtful design
can make people feel respected and seen. I've come to believe
that dignity is to design what justice is to law and health is to medicine. In the simplest of terms, it's about having the spaces you inhabit
reflect back your value. Over the past two years I had the opportunity to interview
over 100 people from all walks of life about their experience of design. I wanted to test my hunch that dignity and design
are uniquely related. I listened to Gregory, a resident of this cottage community designed specifically for the 50 most chronically
homeless people in Dallas. Gregory had been living on the streets, drifting from town to town
for over 30 years. A broad coalition of social service agencies, funders and designers, created this place. Each 400 square foot cottage
is designed beautifully as a permanent home. Gregory now has a key to a door to his own house. He describes the sense
of security that it brings him. Something he had lived without
for three decades. When he arrived with little more
than the clothes on his back, he found everything: from a toaster, Crock-Pot and stove to a toothbrush and toothpaste
awaiting for him. He describes it simply as heaven. On the other side of the world, I listened to Antoinette, the director of this
training and community center for women in rural Rwanda. Hundreds of women
come to this place daily -- to learn new skills, be in community, and continue rebuilding their lives following the country's civil war. These women literally pressed the 500,000 bricks that make up the 17
classroom pavilions like this one. Antoinette told me, "Everyone is so proud of it." And then back here in the US I listened to Monika, the director of a free clinic primarily serving
the uninsured in Arkansas. Monika loves telling me that the doctors, who volunteer at her free clinic routinely tell her that they've never worked
in such a beautiful, light-filled place. Monika believes that even people experiencing poverty deserve quality health care. And what's more, she believes they deserve
to receive that care in a dignified setting. People like these are invaluable
ambassadors for design and yet they are roundly absent
from architectural discourse. Similarly, the people who can
most benefit from good design often have the least access to it. Your cousin, a homeless veteran; your grandma or grandpa who live in a house with a kitchen
that's no longer accessible to them; your wheelchair-bound sister in a suburban area
planned without sidewalks. If good design
is only for a privileged few, what good is it? It's time designers change this by dedicating their practices
to the public good in the model of firms like Orkidstudio, Studio Gang and MASS Design Group. Their clients are orphaned children in Kenya, foster children in Chicago and pregnant women in Malawi. Their practices are premised on the belief that everyone deserves good design. Dedicating more practices
to the public good will not only create
more design that is dignifying, but it will also
dignify the practice of design. It will not only diversify
the client base of design, but it will also create new,
more diverse forms of design for the world. Now, in order to do this, my architecture and design friends,
especially my fellow white guys, we must simultaneously
and significantly diversify our ranks. If we want the public to believe
that design is for them and for everyone. Today, barely 15 percent of registered architects
in the United States are women. And a far smaller percentage
are persons of color. Other professions, like law and medicine had made far greater strides
in these crucial areas. How might our shared built environment -- our homes, our hospitals,
our schools, our public spaces -- be shaped differently if women and people of color were behind half
of the proverbial blueprints? It is not a question of whether, but to what extent our buildings, our landscapes, our cities and our rural communities are less beautiful, less functional, less equitable and less dignifying because women and people of color
are less likely to be creating them. As Winston Churchill
famously noted in 1943 when he called for the rebuilding of London's war-damaged
parliamentary chambers, "We shape our buildings,
and afterward, they shape us." The good news is
that we can change how we build and who we build for. Be that a health worker in rural Rwanda, or a birthing mother and nervous
new father in the United States. We can do this
by recommitting architecture to the health, safety
and welfare of the public. This will pay dividends. Because once you see what design can do, you can't unsee it. And once you experience dignity, you can't accept anything less. Both become part of your possible. One of my favorite conversation partners
is my 90-year-old grandmother, Audrey Gorwitz, from Oshkosh, Wisconsin. After one of our
conversations about design, she wrote me a letter. She said, "Dear Johnny, I thought the other day,
as I sat in my doctor's office, how depressing it was, from the color on the wall,
to the carpet on the floor. (Laughter) Now I will have to call to see who is responsible
for the drabness in that place." (Laughter) In the same letter, mind you, she said, "I did call, and I got the man in charge, and he said he appreciated
someone calling him. My doctor's office
is now on the list for an upgrade." (Laughter) She signed it by saying, "It is always good
to express one's opinion if done in a proper manner." (Laughter) (Applause) I love my grandma. (Laughter) Like my grandma Audrey, you deserve good design. Because well-designed spaces are not just a matter of taste
or a questions of aesthetics. They literally shape our ideas
about who we are in the world and what we deserve. That is the essence of dignity. And both the opportunity
and the responsibility of design for good and for all. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
On a beautiful day, just a few years ago my wife and I entered a hospital near our home in Oakland, California for the birth of our first daughter, Maya. We had responsibly toured
the birthing center in advance and yet we were somehow
still startled to find ourselves in the place where we would experience one of the most significant
moments of our lives. We were stuck in a windowless room with no hint of the bright
and sunny day that we had left. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, the paint on the walls was beige and machines beeped inexplicably as a wall clock indicated
day turning to night. That clock was placed above a door in direct line of sight to where my wife lay as her contractions
increased hour after hour. Now, I've never given birth -- (Laughter) but she assured me that the last thing
that a birthing woman would ever want is to watch the seconds tick by. (Laughter) An architect by training,
I've always been fascinated watching people experience design
in the world around them. I believe design functions
like the soundtrack that we're not even
fully aware is playing. It sends us subconscious messages
about how to feel and what to expect. That room that we were in
seemed completely misaligned with the moment
that we were experiencing -- welcoming a human being, our daughter, into this world. At one point a nurse, without any prompt, turned to us and said, "I always think to myself, 'I wish I had become an architect, because I could have designed
rooms like this better.'" I said to her, "An architect did design this room." (Laughter) Despite the immense joy
of our daughter's birth, the messages of that hospital room
stick with she and I to this day. Those messages are, "You are not at home, you are in a foreign place." "You are not in control of anything. Not even the lighting." "Your comfort, simply, is secondary." At best, a hospital room like this might just be described
or dismissed as uninspiring. At worst, it is undignifying. And I use it to point out that none of us, anywhere in the world, are immune from bad design. I went into architecture
because I believed it was about creating spaces for people
to live their best lives. And yet what I found
is a profession largely disconnected from the people most directly
impacted by its work. I believe this is because
architecture remains a white, male, elitist profession -- seemingly unconcerned with some of the greatest
needs in the world or even the relatively simple needs
of an expectant mother. Students are trained in school using highly theoretical projects, rarely interacting with real people
or actual communities. Graduates are funneled
through a long, narrow unforgiving path to licensure. Meanwhile, the profession
holds up a select few through relentless award programs focused almost exclusively
on the aesthetics of buildings, rather than the societal impact
or contributions of them. It only goes to reinforce a warped view of professional responsibility and success and yet this isn't
why so many young, hopeful people go into architecture. It's not why I did. I believed then, though I didn't
have a language for it, and I know now, that design
has a unique ability to dignify. It can make people feel valued, respected, honored and seen. Now I'd like for you to just think
about some of the spaces that you inhabit. And I'd like to have you think
about how they make you feel. Now, there are places
that make us feel unhappy, unhealthy or uninspiring. They may be the places that you work or where you heal or even where you live. And I ask, how might these places
be better designed with you in mind? It's a really simple question and it can somehow, sometimes
be very difficult to answer. Because we are conditioned
to feel like we don't have much agency over the spaces and places
that we live, work and play. And in many cases we don't. But we all should. Now, here's a potentially dumb question
for any women watching: Have you ever stood in a disproportionately long
bathroom line? (Laughter) Did you ever think to yourself,
"What is wrong with this picture?" Well, what if the real question is, "What is wrong with the men
that designed these bathrooms?" (Applause) It may seem like a small thing, but it's representative
of a much more serious issue. The contemporary world
was literally built by men who have rarely
taken the time to understand how people unlike them experience their designs. A long bathroom line
might seem like a minor indignity. But the opposite can also be true. Thoughtful design
can make people feel respected and seen. I've come to believe
that dignity is to design what justice is to law and health is to medicine. In the simplest of terms, it's about having the spaces you inhabit
reflect back your value. Over the past two years I had the opportunity to interview
over 100 people from all walks of life about their experience of design. I wanted to test my hunch that dignity and design
are uniquely related. I listened to Gregory, a resident of this cottage community designed specifically for the 50 most chronically
homeless people in Dallas. Gregory had been living on the streets, drifting from town to town
for over 30 years. A broad coalition of social service agencies, funders and designers, created this place. Each 400 square foot cottage
is designed beautifully as a permanent home. Gregory now has a key to a door to his own house. He describes the sense
of security that it brings him. Something he had lived without
for three decades. When he arrived with little more
than the clothes on his back, he found everything: from a toaster, Crock-Pot and stove to a toothbrush and toothpaste
awaiting for him. He describes it simply as heaven. On the other side of the world, I listened to Antoinette, the director of this
training and community center for women in rural Rwanda. Hundreds of women
come to this place daily -- to learn new skills, be in community, and continue rebuilding their lives following the country's civil war. These women literally pressed the 500,000 bricks that make up the 17
classroom pavilions like this one. Antoinette told me, "Everyone is so proud of it." And then back here in the US I listened to Monika, the director of a free clinic primarily serving
the uninsured in Arkansas. Monika loves telling me that the doctors, who volunteer at her free clinic routinely tell her that they've never worked
in such a beautiful, light-filled place. Monika believes that even people experiencing poverty deserve quality health care. And what's more, she believes they deserve
to receive that care in a dignified setting. People like these are invaluable
ambassadors for design and yet they are roundly absent
from architectural discourse. Similarly, the people who can
most benefit from good design often have the least access to it. Your cousin, a homeless veteran; your grandma or grandpa who live in a house with a kitchen
that's no longer accessible to them; your wheelchair-bound sister in a suburban area
planned without sidewalks. If good design
is only for a privileged few, what good is it? It's time designers change this by dedicating their practices
to the public good in the model of firms like Orkidstudio, Studio Gang and MASS Design Group. Their clients are orphaned children in Kenya, foster children in Chicago and pregnant women in Malawi. Their practices are premised on the belief that everyone deserves good design. Dedicating more practices
to the public good will not only create
more design that is dignifying, but it will also
dignify the practice of design. It will not only diversify
the client base of design, but it will also create new,
more diverse forms of design for the world. Now, in order to do this, my architecture and design friends,
especially my fellow white guys, we must simultaneously
and significantly diversify our ranks. If we want the public to believe
that design is for them and for everyone. Today, barely 15 percent of registered architects
in the United States are women. And a far smaller percentage

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the percentage of registered architects in the United States who are women. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 6 mentions the issue of architects not designing buildings that are dignifying and accessible to all, which is related to the speaker's point about the lack of diversity in the architecture profession.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, I would suggest Question 6 is not the best match. Instead, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that the closest match is not available, but if I had to choose I would say Question 5, because it talks about the speaker's proposal for changing the way architecture is practiced, which includes diversifying the profession.

However, please note that this is a very weak match, and the correct answer is actually not available among the generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
In the world of math, many strange results are possible 
when we change the rules. But there’s one rule that most of us 
have been warned not to break: don’t divide by zero. How can the simple combination 
of an everyday number and a basic operation 
cause such problems? Normally, dividing by smaller 
and smaller numbers gives you bigger and bigger answers. Ten divided by two is five, by one is ten, by one-millionth is 10 million, and so on. So it seems like if you divide by numbers that keep shrinking 
all the way down to zero, the answer will grow 
to the largest thing possible. Then, isn’t the answer to 10 
divided by zero actually infinity? That may sound plausible. But all we really know is 
that if we divide 10 by a number that tends towards zero, the answer tends towards infinity. And that’s not the same thing as
saying that 10 divided by zero is equal to infinity. Why not? Well, let’s take a closer look 
at what division really means. Ten divided by two could mean, "How many times must 
we add two together to make 10,” or, “two times what equals 10?” Dividing by a number is essentially 
the reverse of multiplying by it, in the following way: if we multiply any number 
by a given number x, we can ask if there’s a new number 
we can multiply by afterwards to get back to where we started. If there is, the new number is called 
the multiplicative inverse of x. For example, if you multiply 
three by two to get six, you can then multiply 
by one-half to get back to three. So the multiplicative inverse 
of two is one-half, and the multiplicative inverse 
of 10 is one-tenth. As you might notice, the product of any
number and its multiplicative inverse is always one. If we want to divide by zero, we need to find 
its multiplicative inverse, which should be one over zero. This would have to be such a number that
multiplying it by zero would give one. But because anything multiplied
by zero is still zero, such a number is impossible, so zero has no multiplicative inverse. Does that really settle things, though? After all, mathematicians 
have broken rules before. For example, for a long time, there was no such thing as taking 
the square root of negative numbers. But then mathematicians defined 
the square root of negative one as a new number called i, opening up a whole new
mathematical world of complex numbers. So if they can do that, couldn’t we just make up a new rule, say, that the symbol infinity 
means one over zero, and see what happens? Let's try it, imagining we don’t know 
anything about infinity already. Based on the definition 
of a multiplicative inverse, zero times infinity must be equal to one. That means zero times infinity plus
zero times infinity should equal two. Now, by the distributive property, the left side of the equation 
can be rearranged to zero plus zero times infinity. And since zero plus zero 
is definitely zero, that reduces down to zero times infinity. Unfortunately, we’ve already defined 
this as equal to one, while the other side of the equation 
is still telling us it’s equal to two. So, one equals two. Oddly enough, 
that's not necessarily wrong; it's just not true 
in our normal world of numbers. There’s still a way it could
be mathematically valid, if one, two, and every other number 
were equal to zero. But having infinity equal to zero is ultimately not all that useful 
to mathematicians, or anyone else. There actually is something called 
the Riemann sphere that involves dividing by zero 
by a different method, but that’s a story for another day. In the meantime, dividing by zero 
in the most obvious way doesn’t work out so great. But that shouldn’t stop us 
from living dangerously and experimenting 
with breaking mathematical rules to see if we can invent 
fun, new worlds to explore.

**Transcript**:
In the world of math, many strange results are possible 
when we change the rules. But there’s one rule that most of us 
have been warned not to break: don’t divide by zero. How can the simple combination 
of an everyday number and a basic operation 
cause such problems? Normally, dividing by smaller 
and smaller numbers gives you bigger and bigger answers. Ten divided by two is five, by one is ten, by one-millionth is 10 million, and so on. So it seems like if you divide by numbers that keep shrinking 
all the way down to zero, the answer will grow 
to the largest thing possible. Then, isn’t the answer to 10 
divided by zero actually infinity? That may sound plausible. But all we really know is 
that if we divide 10 by a number that tends towards zero, the answer tends towards infinity. And that’s not the same thing as
saying that 10 divided by zero is equal to infinity. Why not? Well, let’s take a closer look 
at what division really means. Ten divided by two could mean, "How many times must 
we add two together to make 10,” or, “two times what equals 10?” Dividing by a number is essentially 
the reverse of multiplying by it, in the following way: if we multiply any number 
by a given number x, we can ask if there’s a new number 
we can multiply by afterwards to get back to where we started. If there is, the new number is called 
the multiplicative inverse of x. For example, if you multiply 
three by two to get six, you can then multiply 
by one-half to get back to three. So the multiplicative inverse 
of two is one-half, and the multiplicative inverse 
of 10 is one-tenth. As you might notice, the product of any
number and its multiplicative inverse is always one. If we want to divide by zero, we need to find 
its multiplicative inverse, which should be one over zero. This would have to be such a number that
multiplying it by zero would give one. But because anything multiplied
by zero is still zero, such a number is impossible, so zero has no multiplicative inverse. Does that really settle things, though? After all, mathematicians 
have broken rules before. For example, for a long time, there was no such thing as taking 
the square root of negative numbers. But then mathematicians defined 
the square root of negative one as a new number called i, opening up a whole new
mathematical world of complex numbers. So if they can do that, couldn’t we just make up a new rule, say, that the symbol infinity 
means one over zero, and see what happens? Let's try it, imagining we don’t know 
anything about infinity already. Based on the definition 
of a multiplicative inverse, zero times infinity must be equal to one. That means zero times infinity plus
zero times infinity should equal two. Now, by the distributive property, the left side of the equation 
can be rearranged to zero plus zero times infinity. And since zero plus zero 
is definitely zero, that reduces down to zero times infinity. Unfortunately, we’ve already defined 
this as equal to one, while the other side of the equation 
is still telling us it’s equal to two. So, one equals two. Oddly enough, 
that's not necessarily wrong; it's just not true 
in our normal world of numbers. There’s still a way it could
be mathematically valid, if one, two, and every other number 
were equal to zero. But having infinity equal to zero is ultimately not all that useful 
to mathematicians, or anyone else. There actually is something called 
the Riemann sphere that involves dividing by zero 
by a different method, but that’s a story for another day. In the meantime, dividing by zero 
in the most obvious way doesn’t work out so great. But that shouldn’t stop us 
from living dangerously and experimenting 
with breaking mathematical rules to see if we can invent 
fun, new worlds to explore.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8: What is the definition of a multiplicative inverse? Options: A. A number that, when multiplied by the original number, gives a different result., B. A number that, when multiplied by the original number, gives the same result., C. A number that, when multiplied by the original number, gives one., D. A number that, when multiplied by the original number, gives zero.

However, the options in Question 8 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that explicitly states the product of a number and its multiplicative inverse. 

A more suitable match would be Question 2, if the options were different. However, among the provided options, Question 8 is the closest match.

But considering the options of Question 2 are not provided as correct, a more suitable match can be found in Question 8, and since the correct option is "C. A number that, when multiplied by the original number, gives one." This can be matched with the correct option in the Ground Truth MCQ which is "B. 1".

However the correct match would be Question 2 if its options were "A. The number itself, B. 1, C. 0, D. 1/2" and its correct option would have been "B. 1".

Since we do not have the correct options in Question 2 and only have the options and the correct answer for Question 8. This makes Question 8 the most suitable match among the generated MCQs.

However if we were to rephrase Question 2 to match the ground truth MCQ it would be the most suitable match.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is 8.

**Transcript**:
In the world of math, many strange results are possible 
when we change the rules. But there’s one rule that most of us 
have been warned not to break: don’t divide by zero. How can the simple combination 
of an everyday number and a basic operation 
cause such problems? Normally, dividing by smaller 
and smaller numbers gives you bigger and bigger answers. Ten divided by two is five, by one is ten, by one-millionth is 10 million, and so on. So it seems like if you divide by numbers that keep shrinking 
all the way down to zero, the answer will grow 
to the largest thing possible. Then, isn’t the answer to 10 
divided by zero actually infinity? That may sound plausible. But all we really know is 
that if we divide 10 by a number that tends towards zero, the answer tends towards infinity. And that’s not the same thing as
saying that 10 divided by zero is equal to infinity. Why not? Well, let’s take a closer look 
at what division really means. Ten divided by two could mean, "How many times must 
we add two together to make 10,” or, “two times what equals 10?” Dividing by a number is essentially 
the reverse of multiplying by it, in the following way: if we multiply any number 
by a given number x, we can ask if there’s a new number 
we can multiply by afterwards to get back to where we started. If there is, the new number is called 
the multiplicative inverse of x. For example, if you multiply 
three by two to get six, you can then multiply 
by one-half to get back to three. So the multiplicative inverse 
of two is one-half, and the multiplicative inverse 
of 10 is one-tenth. As you might notice, the product of any
number and its multiplicative inverse is always one. If we want to divide by zero, we need to find 
its multiplicative inverse, which should be one over zero. This would have to be such a number that
multiplying it by zero would give one. But because anything multiplied
by zero is still zero, such a number is impossible, so zero has no multiplicative inverse. Does that really settle things, though? After all, mathematicians 
have broken rules before. For example, for a long time, there was no such thing as taking 
the square root of negative numbers. But then mathematicians defined 
the square root of negative one as a new number called i, opening up a whole new
mathematical world of complex numbers. So if they can do that, couldn’t we just make up a new rule, say, that the symbol infinity 
means one over zero, and see what happens? Let's try it, imagining we don’t know 
anything about infinity already. Based on the definition 
of a multiplicative inverse, zero times infinity must be equal to one. That means zero times infinity plus
zero times infinity should equal two. Now, by the distributive property, the left side of the equation 
can be rearranged to zero plus zero times infinity. And since zero plus zero 
is definitely zero, that reduces down to zero times infinity. Unfortunately, we’ve already defined 
this as equal to one, while the other side of the equation 
is still telling us it’s equal to two. So, one equals two. Oddly enough, 
that's not necessarily wrong; it's just not true 
in our normal world of numbers. There’s still a way it could
be mathematically valid, if one, two, and every other number 
were equal to zero. But having infinity equal to zero is ultimately not all that useful 
to mathematicians, or anyone else. There actually is something called 
the Riemann sphere that involves dividing by zero 
by a different method, but that’s a story for another day. In the meantime, dividing by zero 
in the most obvious way doesn’t work out so great. But that shouldn’t stop us 
from living dangerously and experimenting 
with breaking mathematical rules to see if we can invent 
fun, new worlds to explore.

**Transcript**:
Never before in history, have there been so many people on Earth as right now. Our numbers have skyrocketed, from 1 billion in 1800, to 2.3 billion in 1940, 3.7 billion in 1970, and 7.4 billion in 2016. The world population increased fourfold in the last century, so what can we expect for the next century? And what does population growth mean for our future? Will there be mass-migration? Overcrowded slums and megacities covering continents? Diseases and pollution? Chaos and violence over energy, water, and food? And a human species focused only on sustaining itself? Will population growth destroy our way of life? Or is this prophecy just ungrounded panic? In the 1960s population growth reached an unprecedented rate. Which lead to apocalyptic prophecies. The poor would pro-create endlessly and overrun the developed world. The legend of overpopulation was born. But it turns out high birth rates and the population explosion are not permanent features of some cultures or countries, But rather a part of a four step process the whole world is going through, The demographic transition. Most developed countries have already made the transition, while other countries are doing it right now. Let's go back to the 18th century, when the entire world, including Europe, was in the first stage of the demographic transition. By today's standards, Europe was worse off, than a developing region, suffering from poor sanitation, poor diets, and poor medicine. A lot of people were born, but lots of them died just as fast, so the population hardly grew. Women had between 4 and 6 children, but only 2 of them would reach adulthood. Then the industrial revolution happened in the UK and bought the greatest change in human living conditions since the agricultural revolution. People went from being peasants to workers. Manufactured goods were mass produced and became widely available. The sciences flourished and advanced transportation, communication, and medicine. The role of women in society shifted and created the conditions for their emancipation. Slowly this economic progress not only formed a middle class, but also raised standards of living and health care for the poor working population. The second transition stage started. Better food supplies, hygiene and medicine, meant people stopped dying all the time, especially so, at a very young age. The result was a population explosion. Doubling the UK's population between 1750 and 1850. The main reasons families used to have lots of children was that only a few of them were likely to survive. Now that had changed, so the third stage of transition was set in motion. Fewer babies were conceived, and population growth slowed down. Eventually a balance emerged, fewer people were dying and fewer children were born, so the death rate and birth rate became stable. Britain had reached the fourth stage of the demographic transition. This didn't only happen in the UK, more and more countries went through the four stages. First, many births and many deaths due to bad living conditions. Second, better living conditions leading to fewer deaths and a population explosion. Third, fewer deaths resulting in fewer births, and population growth came to an end. But if birth rates have dropped so much, why is the population still growing so fast? Well, the children born in the population explosion of the 70s and 80s are having kids themselves now. Leading to a noticeable spike in overall population. But they are having far fewer children on average than their parents. The average today is 2.5, it was 5, 40 years ago. So as this generation gets older, and fertility declines further, the rate of population growth will keep on slowing. This is true for every country. In the west, we tend to overlook progress in other regions of the world. But actually most of the world's countries have made it to the fourth stage. Just look at Bangladesh. In 1971, the average woman had 7 kids, but 25% of them would die before the age of 5. In 2015, the mortality rate was down to 3.8% and women had only 2.2 kids on average. This is the rule, not an exception, we're not special, we just had a head start. It took developed countries about 80 years to reduce fertility from more than 6 children, to less than 3. Others are catching up fast. Malaysia and South Africa did it in only 34 years; Bangladesh took just 20. Iran managed it in 10 years. All these countries that are catching up didn't have to start from scratch and the more support they get, the faster they catch up. This is why programs that help lower child mortality or help poor nations develop, are so important, No matter what your motivation is, whether you dream of a world where all people live in freedom and wealth, or you just want fewer refugees coming into your country, The simple truth is, that it's beneficial to you personally if people on the other side of the globe can live a good life. And we are getting there, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty has never been as low as today. So the future of global population growth is not an apocalyptic prophecy, it's a promise! Population growth will come to an end. The UN forecasts that the 12th billionth human will never be born at all. And as the development level of the world rises, the number of people a higher education will increase tenfold. Countries who used to be a need, will help advance development instead. More people is going to mean more people able to advance our species.

**Transcript**:
Human society is extremely
complex and fragile, built upon various pillars. One of them is the honey bee. One out of three meals eaten by humans
is made possible by honey bees. They are so important that if all the
honey bees were to die out, thousands of plants would follow, which could lead to millions of people
starving in the following years. On top of that, honey bees have
a huge economic impact. The dollar value of plants
pollinated by them each year is around $265 billion. Food we take for granted would just
stop existing without them, or there would be a massive
decrease in productivity. Food including apples, onions, pumpkins,
and also plants used for feeding livestock and thus extremely important
for our milk and meat. Einstein is often quoted as having said, “If honey bees die out, humans
will follow a few years later.” Actually, he probably didn’t say that, but there might be some
truth in the statement. It’s unsettling, but honey bees
have started to disappear. Millions of hives have died
in the last few years. Beekeepers all over the world have seen an
annual loss of 30–90% of their colonies. In the US alone, bees
are steadily declining. >From 5 million hives in 1988
to 2.5 million today. Since 2006, a phenomenon called
“colony collapse disorder” has affected honey bees in many countries. And we’re not entirely sure
what’s causing it. All we know is that it’s pretty serious. Over the last few decades bees have seen
an invasion of very dangerous foes. Parasites straight out of a horror movie,
like Acarapis woodi, microscopic mites that infect the tracheae
(that’s the breathing tubes) of bees. Here, they lay their eggs and feed from
the fluids of their victims, weakening them considerably and spending
their whole life inside the bees. Or Varroa destructor, a fitting name
because they can only reproduce in honey bee hives and are one of
the bees’ greatest enemies. The female mite enters a honey bee brood
cell and lays eggs on the bee larva before it’s about to pupate and before the hive bees cover the
cell with a wax capping. The eggs hatch and the young mites and
their mother feed on the developing bee in the safety of the capped cell. The bee is not normally killed
at this stage, just weakened, so it still has enough strength to chew
its way through the wax capping and release itself from the cell. As it does, it releases the mother mite
and her new offspring from the cell, and these are free to
spread across the hive, starting the process over again
in a cycle of about 10 days. Their numbers grow exponentially,
and after a few months, this can lead to the collapse
of the entire bee hive. Once outside of the cell, adult mites
also suck the bodily fludis of bees and weaken them considerably. To make things worse, they also transmit
viruses that harm the bees even more and can lead to birth defects
like useless wings. But there are other threats too,
such as viruses and fungi. Under normal circumstances, these
phenomena should be manageable and are not enough to explain the horrendous amount of
dying going on in bees. Over recent years new insecticides
have been introduced that are deadly to bees. Neonicotinoids, a chemical family
similar to nicotine, was approved in the early 1990s
as an alternative to chemicals like DDT. They attack insects by harming
their nervous systems. Today, they are the most widely
used insecticides in the world. Globally, they saw sales
of €1.5 billion in 2008, representing 24% of the global
market for insecticides. In 2013, neonicotinoids were used in the
US on about 95% of corn and canola crops, and also on the vast majority
of fruit and vegetables, like apples, cherries, peaches, oranges,
berries, leafy greens, tomatoes, potatoes, cereal grains, rice, nuts,
grapes, and many more. Bees come into contact with the toxin while collecting pollen or
via contaminated water, often bringing material into the hive, where it can accumulate and
slowly kill the whole colony. The toxins harm bees in a
variety of horrible ways. In high enough doses, it quickly leads
to convulsions, paralysis, and death. But even in small doses, it can be fatal. It may lead to bees forgetting
how to navigate the world, so bees fly into the wild, get lost, and
die alone, separated from their hives. If this happens often enough, a hive
can lose its ability to sustain itself. We know that neonicotinoids
are harmful to bees and that we urgently need
an alternative to it, but there are billions of dollars
to be made in delaying this. Studies sponsored by the chemical
industry magically appear to prove a much lower toxicity to bees, compared to
those produced by independent scientists. There are even more factors
contributing to the demise of bees, like too much genetic uniformity,
crop monocultures, poor nutrition due to overcrowding,
stress because of human activities, and other pesticides. Each of those factors on its own is
a major problem for bees, but together, they probably account
for colony collapse disorder. With parasites upping their
game in recent decades, the honey bees are now
fighting for survival. It would be a catastrophe
if they lost this fight. This is a conundrum we have to solve
if we want to continue living with a relative abundance
and diversity of food. Humanity is deeply interconnected with
Earth and the other lifeforms on it, even if we pretend that we’re not. We have to take better care
of our surroundings, if not to preserve the beauty of nature,
then at least to ensure our own survival. This video is supported by the

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not cover the topic of the life cycle of the Varroa destructor mite, which is the main topic of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of them are similar, but I can provide the index of the generated MCQ that is closest in terms of topic relevance. 

Generated MCQ 3 is about the name of the microscopic mite that infects the tracheae of bees, which is related to the topic of parasites that affect honey bees, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

Therefore, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ, but if I had to choose one, I would say Generated MCQ 3 is the closest in terms of topic relevance, but it is still not a match.

Index: 3 (with the caveat that it's not a match)

**Transcript**:
Human society is extremely
complex and fragile, built upon various pillars. One of them is the honey bee. One out of three meals eaten by humans
is made possible by honey bees. They are so important that if all the
honey bees were to die out, thousands of plants would follow, which could lead to millions of people
starving in the following years. On top of that, honey bees have
a huge economic impact. The dollar value of plants
pollinated by them each year is around $265 billion. Food we take for granted would just
stop existing without them, or there would be a massive
decrease in productivity. Food including apples, onions, pumpkins,
and also plants used for feeding livestock and thus extremely important
for our milk and meat. Einstein is often quoted as having said, “If honey bees die out, humans
will follow a few years later.” Actually, he probably didn’t say that, but there might be some
truth in the statement. It’s unsettling, but honey bees
have started to disappear. Millions of hives have died
in the last few years. Beekeepers all over the world have seen an
annual loss of 30–90% of their colonies. In the US alone, bees
are steadily declining. >From 5 million hives in 1988
to 2.5 million today. Since 2006, a phenomenon called
“colony collapse disorder” has affected honey bees in many countries. And we’re not entirely sure
what’s causing it. All we know is that it’s pretty serious. Over the last few decades bees have seen
an invasion of very dangerous foes. Parasites straight out of a horror movie,
like Acarapis woodi, microscopic mites that infect the tracheae
(that’s the breathing tubes) of bees. Here, they lay their eggs and feed from
the fluids of their victims, weakening them considerably and spending
their whole life inside the bees. Or Varroa destructor, a fitting name
because they can only reproduce in honey bee hives and are one of
the bees’ greatest enemies. The female mite enters a honey bee brood
cell and lays eggs on the bee larva before it’s about to pupate and before the hive bees cover the
cell with a wax capping. The eggs hatch and the young mites and
their mother feed on the developing bee in the safety of the capped cell. The bee is not normally killed
at this stage, just weakened, so it still has enough strength to chew
its way through the wax capping and release itself from the cell. As it does, it releases the mother mite
and her new offspring from the cell, and these are free to
spread across the hive, starting the process over again
in a cycle of about 10 days. Their numbers grow exponentially,
and after a few months, this can lead to the collapse
of the entire bee hive. Once outside of the cell, adult mites

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the false statement regarding the importance of honey bees and the consequences of their decline. The closest generated MCQ that relates to this topic is Question 2, which asks about the name of the phenomenon that has affected honey bees in many countries since 2006. However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that asks about the consequences of honey bee decline or the importance of honey bees. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2, but with a low confidence level.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2 (with low confidence)

Note: It would be more accurate to generate new MCQs that directly address the topic of the ground truth MCQ, rather than trying to find a match among the existing generated MCQs.

Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. You won't believe your eyes. You've heard this before right? It's usually like a click bait title to get you to watch an internet video or read a stupid article. But are there cases when you actually can't believe your eyes? Make this video as large as you can on the screen that you're watching and we're gonna do an experiment. Put your head at a set distance from the screen and look at this photo. It's a lighthouse on top of an island but I've inverted the colors. I want you to focus your eyes right on the tip of that lighthouse and don't move them. I'm gonna be quiet now and I'm gonna let you transport your mind to this island off the coast of Tasmania. [ seagulls ] OK I'm about to invert the picture back but I want you to stay focused on that lighthouse. Are you ready? Here we go. Out of the corner of your eye you should see a pale blue sky and a deep royal blue sea with little light green grass spots on the island. Now, take your eyes and move it to the edge of the island. You see that? There is no color in this picture. It's a black and white image. Your brain just made up color that wasn't there. Can you believe your eyes? By the way, just in case you're curious this is what the original image looked like. OK, so I just showed you a black and white image and for some reason your brain saw something like this. What is happening? Is that something going on with your eye? Or is that your brain? For all we know it might be the optic nerve connecting the two. Let's investigate a little bit further. A couple of years ago I saw this video on the internet and at first it just looks like a neat little light toy. But my mind saw something way different. I realized for the first time that I literally could not believe my eyes. Not that I didn't understand what was happening, but I knew that what I was seeing didn't actually exist. As soon as I saw this video it was very clear to me that the dude that made this was a genius. The bad news is though, he lives hundreds of miles away in the desert. So I'm in a kind of a sleazy hotel and uh, I don't want to say sleazy. Have you ever seen somebody do something really cool on the internet and you wanted to meet them? Well that's kinda what happened here. This is Greg. - Hello - And Greg has a pretty interesting gadget that you made? Is that what we're gonna call it? - That's what we're gonna call it. The device. - Did you design this PCB? - I did. - Did you populate it? - I did. That's a lot of small chips on there, but.. - You're a geek man. - Yeah I know. [laughs] It gets easier. - How long did it take to populate the board? - It takes about an hour and a half. - You did that whole thing in an hour and a half? - Yeah. - Yeah but can you change a water pump on a 1990 Chevrolet pickup? - [laughs] - So those are LEDs right? - Yeah they're red green blue RGB LEDs. - That's pretty cool. Now how are you controlling that? - So these LEDs are mounted on a circuit board that's mounted on a DC motor. And if I apply power to the DC motor, it spins. And if I time it just right, I can essentially light up any LED anywhere on the circle that I want, as we can see here. - So you just created these bitmaps and then uploaded them through some software that you wrote? - Yep, so this is a 63 by 63 pixel bitmap, and essentially I take that and there's actually an infrared sensor on the display that can receive data. - Oh look at that. Smarter Every Day. Little homage. So how did you do that? Did you upload that, or.. You did that today didn't you. - Yes actually I just created that image right before driving out to meet you. - This is pretty amazing. So ok, here's the deal. I asked you about this because I wanted to do this. I wanted to use this high speed camera to look at what you've got here. This is a Phantom Miro that we're using here. This is a Miro 320S, and we're gonna setup.. What's your update rate on the microcontroller? - Um it's pretty fast. It's spinning at about 25 revolutions every second. - Ahuh. - And within those it updates 256 times. So we're looking at about a 200 microsecond rate that the LEDs get updated. - OK so a thousand frames per second is not fast enough, is what you're telling me. - No. - OK. Alright, well let's figure out what frame rate we need to hit in order to understand what's going on here. - Alright. - What do we call these? Are these pixels? Cause it's not really like a square thing like cartesians, it's kinda like an arc.. - Right, it's kind of like an arc pixel. - OK, so what do you call that? - An arxel. - Arxel.. like it. We're gonna go with that. How far does the LED bar travel for each individual arxel as you call it? - It's about one and a half degrees. - If it's only going one to two degrees, then why is my brain still seeing that light the whole time it's around? Because it's only one 360th of the sweep, but the rest of it's dark. According to the high speed camera, which I had to crank up to 5500 frames per second, this is what's actually happening. Check it out. Those's dots, or the arxels as Greg likes to call them are kind of flipping around all over the place. Most of the image is dead space. So why is your brain making that image? To understand why the brain sees something that's not there I found a guy that studies this sort of thing that's published over 130 different papers on similar topics. OK I'm on a pretty bad Skype connection with Dr Stuart Anstis who is a genius at the University of California San Diego and what do you study Dr Anstis? - [british accent] I study visual perception, in particular visual illusions which tell us about the normal processes of vision, how the eyes send information to the brain. - That's fantastic. And obviously your accent makes it very clear that you know exactly what you're talking about because I would expect nothing less from a person who studies visual perception. So I want to understand why my eyeball is seeing something where I know there is not light. Why am I seeing that? - It's because of persistence of vision, which means the eye averages what it sees over a short period of time. It's analogous to a camera where you have a long exposure time, and this will give you more light coming in, greater sensitivity, but you have a more sluggish response. So anything moving gets blurred out. - What is the difference in time from the moment the LED is illuminated until my eye registers that the light is there? There has to be a delay time there. What is that? - That delay time varies enormously, over a ten-fold range, anything from 10 to 100 milliseconds. - According to Dr Anstis there's two things going on, and let's look at it. Let's pretend that we have a flashing LED and we want to look at the brain's response to that LED. First of all he said there's a delay, so when the LED first comes on, our brain's not going to immediately see vision, it's gonna take some finite amount of time later. Secondly he said that the eye averages what it sees over a short period of time. Think about that. If we have a moving average, that means that our vision has some sort of inertia to it. It works like this. As the average comes along and is exposed to that LED flash, it starts to ramp up. As the light goes away, that moving average starts to ramp back down. As the light comes back that average starts to go up again, and instead of having gaps that are complete darkness, we have this nice trough in the bottom. Therefore we have a persistence of vision even though there is no light to see at that point in time. Let's look back at that slo mo image from before with all the blinking LEDs. Now, let's add this time average of light and see what the image looks like. Check it out. How cool is that? It looks just like what our eyes see. At what rate would you expect that I would quit seeing a uniform image but I would start to see like a tail dragging across the screen? - Well if the average time is less than one revolution then you're going to see a gap. But supposing as you say, the propellor goes around in 1/25th of a second, that's 40 milliseconds. - I get it now. Do you understand? Think about it. Greg's wheel is rotating at 25 frames per second, and that has to do with the moving time average of the human eye. That's why this video is at least 25, it's actually 30 frames per second. If it wasn't, you would see flickering of the image. So what seems like an imperfection in our eye is actually what smooths things out and makes the world work smoothly for us. That's pretty awesome. If the people watching this video were students in your class what would you want them to know about Greg's wheel and the persistence of vision? - [laughs] Well I would say every system has got a limited time resolution The eye has an engineering problem of trading time resolution against sensitivity to light. And in fact it's got sort of knobs inside which can change that trade-off relationship automatically. The eye is in many ways much cleverer than the camera. It's a beautiful piece of engineering. - Well thank you very much sir, I really appreciate your time. - Thank you. I hope you enjoyed this, feel free to subscribe, if not, no big deal. Hope you're getting Smarter Every Day Have a good one. OK is there any truth to the rumor that you actually proposed using one of these? - There is some truth. [laughs] As I was finishing up the project I thought to myself, Hey it'd be pretty cool if I could like write messages on here so I decided that's how I wanted to propose.

**Transcript**:
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. You won't believe your eyes. You've heard this before right? It's usually like a click bait title to get you to watch an internet video or read a stupid article. But are there cases when you actually can't believe your eyes? Make this video as large as you can on the screen that you're watching and we're gonna do an experiment. Put your head at a set distance from the screen and look at this photo. It's a lighthouse on top of an island but I've inverted the colors. I want you to focus your eyes right on the tip of that lighthouse and don't move them. I'm gonna be quiet now and I'm gonna let you transport your mind to this island off the coast of Tasmania. [ seagulls ] OK I'm about to invert the picture back but I want you to stay focused on that lighthouse. Are you ready? Here we go. Out of the corner of your eye you should see a pale blue sky and a deep royal blue sea with little light green grass spots on the island. Now, take your eyes and move it to the edge of the island. You see that? There is no color in this picture. It's a black and white image. Your brain just made up color that wasn't there. Can you believe your eyes? By the way, just in case you're curious this is what the original image looked like. OK, so I just showed you a black and white image and for some reason your brain saw something like this. What is happening? Is that something going on with your eye? Or is that your brain? For all we know it might be the optic nerve connecting the two. Let's investigate a little bit further. A couple of years ago I saw this video on the internet and at first it just looks like a neat little light toy. But my mind saw something way different. I realized for the first time that I literally could not believe my eyes. Not that I didn't understand what was happening, but I knew that what I was seeing didn't actually exist. As soon as I saw this video it was very clear to me that the dude that made this was a genius. The bad news is though, he lives hundreds of miles away in the desert. So I'm in a kind of a sleazy hotel and uh, I don't want to say sleazy. Have you ever seen somebody do something really cool on the internet and you wanted to meet them? Well that's kinda what happened here. This is Greg. - Hello - And Greg has a pretty interesting gadget that you made? Is that what we're gonna call it? - That's what we're gonna call it. The device. - Did you design this PCB? - I did. - Did you populate it? - I did. That's a lot of small chips on there, but.. - You're a geek man. - Yeah I know. [laughs] It gets easier. - How long did it take to populate the board? - It takes about an hour and a half. - You did that whole thing in an hour and a half? - Yeah. - Yeah but can you change a water pump on a 1990 Chevrolet pickup? - [laughs] - So those are LEDs right? - Yeah they're red green blue RGB LEDs. - That's pretty cool. Now how are you controlling that? - So these LEDs are mounted on a circuit board that's mounted on a DC motor. And if I apply power to the DC motor, it spins. And if I time it just right, I can essentially light up any LED anywhere on the circle that I want, as we can see here. - So you just created these bitmaps and then uploaded them through some software that you wrote? - Yep, so this is a 63 by 63 pixel bitmap, and essentially I take that and there's actually an infrared sensor on the display that can receive data. - Oh look at that. Smarter Every Day. Little homage. So how did you do that? Did you upload that, or.. You did that today didn't you. - Yes actually I just created that image right before driving out to meet you. - This is pretty amazing. So ok, here's the deal. I asked you about this because I wanted to do this. I wanted to use this high speed camera to look at what you've got here. This is a Phantom Miro that we're using here. This is a Miro 320S, and we're gonna setup.. What's your update rate on the microcontroller? - Um it's pretty fast. It's spinning at about 25 revolutions every second. - Ahuh. - And within those it updates 256 times. So we're looking at about a 200 microsecond rate that the LEDs get updated. - OK so a thousand frames per second is not fast enough, is what you're telling me. - No. - OK. Alright, well let's figure out what frame rate we need to hit in order to understand what's going on here. - Alright. - What do we call these? Are these pixels? Cause it's not really like a square thing like cartesians, it's kinda like an arc.. - Right, it's kind of like an arc pixel. - OK, so what do you call that? - An arxel. - Arxel.. like it. We're gonna go with that. How far does the LED bar travel for each individual arxel as you call it? - It's about one and a half degrees. - If it's only going one to two degrees, then why is my brain still seeing that light the whole time it's around? Because it's only one 360th of the sweep, but the rest of it's dark. According to the high speed camera, which I had to crank up to 5500 frames per second, this is what's actually happening. Check it out. Those's dots, or the arxels as Greg likes to call them are kind of flipping around all over the place. Most of the image is dead space. So why is your brain making that image? To understand why the brain sees something that's not there I found a guy that studies this sort of thing that's published over 130 different papers on similar topics. OK I'm on a pretty bad Skype connection with Dr Stuart Anstis who is a genius at the University of California San Diego and what do you study Dr Anstis? - [british accent] I study visual perception, in particular visual illusions which tell us about the normal processes of vision, how the eyes send information to the brain. - That's fantastic. And obviously your accent makes it very clear that you know exactly what you're talking about because I would expect nothing less from a person who studies visual perception. So I want to understand why my eyeball is seeing something where I know there is not light. Why am I seeing that? - It's because of persistence of vision, which means the eye averages what it sees over a short period of time. It's analogous to a camera where you have a long exposure time, and this will give you more light coming in, greater sensitivity, but you have a more sluggish response. So anything moving gets blurred out. - What is the difference in time from the moment the LED is illuminated until my eye registers that the light is there? There has to be a delay time there. What is that? - That delay time varies enormously, over a ten-fold range, anything from 10 to 100 milliseconds. - According to Dr Anstis there's two things going on, and let's look at it.

**Transcript**:
In tropical seas, flying fish leap out of the water, gliding for up to 200 meters 
using wing-like fins, before dipping back into the sea. In the Indo-Pacific, a hunting sailfish can reach speeds 
of 110 kilometers per hour. That’s 11 times faster than Olympic 
swimming champion Michael Phelps. It can then stick up its spiny dorsal fin 
like a brake, grinding to a dead halt, mid-swim. Each of these physical feats is made 
possible by a fish’s form, which in most species is a smooth, 
elongated body, fins, and a tail. These features are shared across thousands
of fish species, each introducing its own variations on
the theme to survive in unique habitats. What makes these features so
commonplace in fish, and what does it reveal about the more 
than 33,000 fish species that inhabit earth’s rivers, 
lakes, and seas? Fish can be split into two main groups, according to the type 
of motion they favor. The first is body 
and caudal fin driven motion, and most fish species, about 85%, 
fall into this group. Here, the body and tail 
are the primary propelling forces, with fins mainly playing 
a stabilizing and steering role. This configuration suits 
many open-water species, which need speed, thrust and control for
constant, efficient swimming. Eels lie at one extreme of this group. Known as anguilliform swimmers, their entire bodies undulate to generate 
a wave-like motion. Compared to anguilliform fish, species like salmon and trout, 
known as subcarangiforms, use about two-thirds of their body mass
to generate motion, while carangiform swimmers, 
such as mackerel, only use about a third. Typically, the less of its mass a fish 
uses to generate motion, the more streamlined its shape. At the other end of the spectrum from eels
are ostraciiform species like boxfish, and thunniform swimmers like tuna. In these fish, the tails, 
also known as caudal fins, do the work. A tuna’s tail is attached by tendons 
to multiple muscles in its body. It powers the body like an engine, forcefully catapulting
the bullet-like fish to speeds up to 69 kilometers per hour. The second major fish group relies 
on median and paired fin motion, meaning they’re propelled through the 
water predominantly by their fins. Fins allow fine-tuned movement 
at slow speeds, so this propulsion 
is typically found in fish that have to navigate complex habitats. Bottom-dwelling fishes, like rays,
fall into this group; using their huge pectoral fins, they can
lift themselves swiftly off the sea floor. That conveniently allows them 
to inhabit shallow seas without being buffeted about by waves. Similarly, shallow-water flatfish 
use their entire bodies as one big fin to hoist 
themselves up off the sand. Ocean sunfish lack tails, so they move around slowly by beating 
their wing-like median fins instead. Similar movements are shared 
by many reef species, like the queen angelfish, surgeonfish, and wrasse. Their focus on fins has taken 
the demand off their bodies, many of which have consequently 
evolved into unusual and inventive shapes. There are fishes within both groups 
that seem to be outliers. But if you look closer, you’ll notice that these 
common traits are disguised. Seahorses, for instance, don’t appear 
fish-shaped in any conventional way, yet they use their flexible 
dorsal fins as makeshift tails. A pufferfish may occasionally 
look more like a lethal balloon, but if it needs to swim rapidly,
it’ll retract its spines. Handfish look like they have legs, but really these limb-like 
structures are fins, modified to help them 
amble across the sea floor. For fish, motion underpins survival, so it’s become a huge evolutionary 
driver of form. The widespread features of fish 
have been maintained across tens of thousands of fish species, not to mention other 
ocean-dwelling animals, like penguins, dolphins, sea slugs, and squids. And that’s precisely because 
they’ve proven so successful.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: Which fish group uses about two-thirds of their body mass to generate motion? Options: A. Anguilliform swimmers, B. Subcarangiform swimmers, C. Carangiform swimmers, D. Ostraciiform swimmers**

Although the question is not an exact match, the options and content are related to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about an anguilliform swimmer, and option A in Question 4 mentions anguilliform swimmers. Additionally, the transcript mentions that eels are anguilliform swimmers and that species like salmon and trout (subcarangiforms) use about two-thirds of their body mass to generate motion.

However, a more direct match would be a question that asks about an example of an anguilliform swimmer. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose **Question 4** as the closest match, but with a note that it's not an exact match.

**Transcript**:
In tropical seas, flying fish leap out of the water, gliding for up to 200 meters 
using wing-like fins, before dipping back into the sea. In the Indo-Pacific, a hunting sailfish can reach speeds 
of 110 kilometers per hour. That’s 11 times faster than Olympic 
swimming champion Michael Phelps. It can then stick up its spiny dorsal fin 
like a brake, grinding to a dead halt, mid-swim. Each of these physical feats is made 
possible by a fish’s form, which in most species is a smooth, 
elongated body, fins, and a tail. These features are shared across thousands
of fish species, each introducing its own variations on
the theme to survive in unique habitats. What makes these features so
commonplace in fish, and what does it reveal about the more 
than 33,000 fish species that inhabit earth’s rivers, 
lakes, and seas? Fish can be split into two main groups, according to the type 
of motion they favor. The first is body 
and caudal fin driven motion, and most fish species, about 85%, 
fall into this group. Here, the body and tail 
are the primary propelling forces, with fins mainly playing 
a stabilizing and steering role. This configuration suits 
many open-water species, which need speed, thrust and control for
constant, efficient swimming. Eels lie at one extreme of this group. Known as anguilliform swimmers, their entire bodies undulate to generate 
a wave-like motion. Compared to anguilliform fish, species like salmon and trout, 
known as subcarangiforms, use about two-thirds of their body mass
to generate motion, while carangiform swimmers, 
such as mackerel, only use about a third. Typically, the less of its mass a fish 
uses to generate motion, the more streamlined its shape. At the other end of the spectrum from eels
are ostraciiform species like boxfish, and thunniform swimmers like tuna. In these fish, the tails, 
also known as caudal fins, do the work. A tuna’s tail is attached by tendons 
to multiple muscles in its body. It powers the body like an engine, forcefully catapulting
the bullet-like fish to speeds up to 69 kilometers per hour. The second major fish group relies 
on median and paired fin motion, meaning they’re propelled through the 
water predominantly by their fins. Fins allow fine-tuned movement 
at slow speeds, so this propulsion 
is typically found in fish that have to navigate complex habitats. Bottom-dwelling fishes, like rays,
fall into this group; using their huge pectoral fins, they can
lift themselves swiftly off the sea floor. That conveniently allows them 
to inhabit shallow seas without being buffeted about by waves. Similarly, shallow-water flatfish 
use their entire bodies as one big fin to hoist 
themselves up off the sand. Ocean sunfish lack tails, so they move around slowly by beating 
their wing-like median fins instead. Similar movements are shared 
by many reef species, like the queen angelfish, surgeonfish, and wrasse. Their focus on fins has taken 
the demand off their bodies, many of which have consequently 
evolved into unusual and inventive shapes. There are fishes within both groups 
that seem to be outliers. But if you look closer, you’ll notice that these 
common traits are disguised. Seahorses, for instance, don’t appear 
fish-shaped in any conventional way, yet they use their flexible 
dorsal fins as makeshift tails. A pufferfish may occasionally 
look more like a lethal balloon, but if it needs to swim rapidly,
it’ll retract its spines. Handfish look like they have legs, but really these limb-like 
structures are fins, modified to help them 
amble across the sea floor. For fish, motion underpins survival, so it’s become a huge evolutionary 
driver of form. The widespread features of fish 
have been maintained across tens of thousands of fish species, not to mention other 
ocean-dwelling animals, like penguins, dolphins, sea slugs, and squids. And that’s precisely because

**Transcript**:
In tropical seas, flying fish leap out of the water, gliding for up to 200 meters 
using wing-like fins, before dipping back into the sea. In the Indo-Pacific, a hunting sailfish can reach speeds 
of 110 kilometers per hour. That’s 11 times faster than Olympic 
swimming champion Michael Phelps. It can then stick up its spiny dorsal fin 
like a brake, grinding to a dead halt, mid-swim. Each of these physical feats is made 
possible by a fish’s form, which in most species is a smooth, 
elongated body, fins, and a tail. These features are shared across thousands
of fish species, each introducing its own variations on
the theme to survive in unique habitats. What makes these features so
commonplace in fish, and what does it reveal about the more 
than 33,000 fish species that inhabit earth’s rivers, 
lakes, and seas? Fish can be split into two main groups, according to the type 
of motion they favor. The first is body 
and caudal fin driven motion, and most fish species, about 85%, 
fall into this group. Here, the body and tail 
are the primary propelling forces, with fins mainly playing 
a stabilizing and steering role. This configuration suits 
many open-water species, which need speed, thrust and control for
constant, efficient swimming. Eels lie at one extreme of this group. Known as anguilliform swimmers, their entire bodies undulate to generate 
a wave-like motion. Compared to anguilliform fish, species like salmon and trout, 
known as subcarangiforms, use about two-thirds of their body mass
to generate motion, while carangiform swimmers, 
such as mackerel, only use about a third. Typically, the less of its mass a fish 
uses to generate motion, the more streamlined its shape. At the other end of the spectrum from eels
are ostraciiform species like boxfish, and thunniform swimmers like tuna. In these fish, the tails, 
also known as caudal fins, do the work. A tuna’s tail is attached by tendons 
to multiple muscles in its body. It powers the body like an engine, forcefully catapulting
the bullet-like fish to speeds up to 69 kilometers per hour. The second major fish group relies 
on median and paired fin motion, meaning they’re propelled through the 
water predominantly by their fins. Fins allow fine-tuned movement 
at slow speeds, so this propulsion 
is typically found in fish that have to navigate complex habitats. Bottom-dwelling fishes, like rays,
fall into this group; using their huge pectoral fins, they can
lift themselves swiftly off the sea floor. That conveniently allows them 
to inhabit shallow seas without being buffeted about by waves. Similarly, shallow-water flatfish 
use their entire bodies as one big fin to hoist 
themselves up off the sand. Ocean sunfish lack tails, so they move around slowly by beating 
their wing-like median fins instead. Similar movements are shared 
by many reef species, like the queen angelfish, surgeonfish, and wrasse. Their focus on fins has taken 
the demand off their bodies, many of which have consequently 
evolved into unusual and inventive shapes. There are fishes within both groups 
that seem to be outliers. But if you look closer, you’ll notice that these 
common traits are disguised. Seahorses, for instance, don’t appear 
fish-shaped in any conventional way, yet they use their flexible 
dorsal fins as makeshift tails. A pufferfish may occasionally 
look more like a lethal balloon, but if it needs to swim rapidly,
it’ll retract its spines. Handfish look like they have legs, but really these limb-like 
structures are fins, modified to help them 
amble across the sea floor. For fish, motion underpins survival, so it’s become a huge evolutionary 
driver of form. The widespread features of fish 
have been maintained across tens of thousands of fish species, not to mention other 
ocean-dwelling animals, like penguins, dolphins, sea slugs, and squids. And that’s precisely because 
they’ve proven so successful.

**Transcript**:
Imagine you’re being attacked 
by a ferocious predator. With no chance of escape, you do what any courageous, 
self-respecting possum would do: curl into an immobile 
state called catatonia, stick out your tongue, drool, and ooze some foul-smelling 
liquid from your anal glands. Disgusted, your assailant 
loosens its grip, decides you’re not the dinner 
it was looking for, and departs. After 10 minutes, 
you resurrect and merrily saunter on. From lemurs to lizards, ants to amphibians, sharks to chickens, hundreds of animals
"play dead" as a survival tactic. Nicknamed "playing possum" 
after its star performer, feigning death is also called thanatosis. That’s from Thanatos, 
the ancient Greek deity of death. But most scientists call it 
tonic immobility, or TI. How and why TI occurs depends 
on the species and situation. Spewing stench and adopting odd postures
are common and often play important roles. Other animals sacrifice their neighbors: quail chicks that freeze 
while their kin run amok have a better chance of survival 
when pursued by a cat. Speaking of cats, feline mothers can pinch
the napes of their kittens’ necks and induce another kind of 
immobility called clipnosis. This keeps their kittens quiet 
and easy to transport. Most of the physiological mechanisms 
underlying these theatrics originate in 
the parasympathetic nervous system, better known for controlling cycles 
of resting and digesting. In possums, the parasympathetic nervous system causes
their heart rates to drop by nearly half, respiration by a third, and body temperatures by more than half a
degree Celsius for up to an hour. The neurotransmitter dopamine 
also plays a part. Flour beetles with low dopamine levels 
play dead more frequently than those with high levels, and anything blocking dopamine receptor 
sites can lengthen catatonia. But maintaining a death ruse isn’t easy. The performers are constantly 
gauging their surroundings for cues on when it’s safe to rise. Chickens, for instance, can sense
when a predator’s eyes are upon them. Researchers know this because when they
used a stuffed hawk in an experiment, their chicken subjects came out of their
catatonia quicker when the hawk’s eyes were averted. Other animals use TI for purposes 
other than defense. When the sleeper cichlid feels peckish, it sinks to the lake floor 
and lies motionless, its splotchy coloration making it 
seem like a rotting carcass. If a small scavenger investigates, 
this undead trickster strikes. Some animals even feign death 
as a sexual ploy. Male nursery spiders offer gifts of
silk-wrapped insects in hopes of wooing females. But those females are known 
to eat love-seeking males. By playing dead while the female 
eagerly devours her snack, these males can cautiously revive and improve their chances 
of successfully mating. So TI can work to an animal’s advantage,
unless someone else knows its secret. California orcas can flip over 
young great white sharks, inducing TI for so long 
the immobilized sharks, who must move to respire, 
essentially suffocate. Humans can also flip sharks into TI. By stroking a shark’s 
electrically-sensitive snout and gently turning it over, researchers can induce TI 
that lasts up to 15 minutes. That’s enough time to insert tags, remove hooks, and even perform surgeries. There are risks however: TI can hamper respiration and induce
hyperglycemia, a sign of stress. So this technique should only 
be used when necessary. Humans can also experience TI when they
freeze with fear during violent assaults. Recognizing this ancient, involuntary
form of self-defense has significant implications 
when trying to understand why some victims don’t flee 
or fight in the face of danger. So, studying TI in non-human animals not only helps us better understand some
odd behaviors, it can also help us better 
understand our own, sometimes counterintuitive, responses to violence.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the different purposes of "playing dead" behavior in animals. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 6, which asks about the purpose of the "playing dead" behavior in the sleeper cichlid. Although Question 6 is specific to one species, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content.

However, I must note that Question 6 does not capture the full scope of the ground truth MCQ, which asks about multiple purposes of "playing dead" behavior. A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the different purposes of "playing dead" behavior in general, but such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Therefore, based on the available options, I would identify Question 6 as the most similar generated MCQ, but with the caveat that it does not fully capture the intent and scope of the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about how humans can place sharks into tonic immobility. The closest generated MCQ is Question 8, which mentions the risk of inducing tonic immobility in sharks. Although it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is related to the topic of tonic immobility in sharks.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ based on the question intent, options, and content, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say Question 2 is the most similar, as it is about a specific species (cats) inducing tonic immobility in another species (kittens), which is somewhat similar to the ground truth MCQ about humans inducing tonic immobility in sharks.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2 (Note: This is a weak match and not a strong recommendation)

**Transcript**:
Imagine you’re being attacked 
by a ferocious predator. With no chance of escape, you do what any courageous, 
self-respecting possum would do: curl into an immobile 
state called catatonia, stick out your tongue, drool, and ooze some foul-smelling 
liquid from your anal glands. Disgusted, your assailant 
loosens its grip, decides you’re not the dinner 
it was looking for, and departs. After 10 minutes, 
you resurrect and merrily saunter on. From lemurs to lizards, ants to amphibians, sharks to chickens, hundreds of animals
"play dead" as a survival tactic. Nicknamed "playing possum" 
after its star performer, feigning death is also called thanatosis. That’s from Thanatos, 
the ancient Greek deity of death. But most scientists call it 
tonic immobility, or TI. How and why TI occurs depends 
on the species and situation. Spewing stench and adopting odd postures
are common and often play important roles. Other animals sacrifice their neighbors: quail chicks that freeze 
while their kin run amok have a better chance of survival 
when pursued by a cat. Speaking of cats, feline mothers can pinch
the napes of their kittens’ necks and induce another kind of 
immobility called clipnosis. This keeps their kittens quiet 
and easy to transport. Most of the physiological mechanisms 
underlying these theatrics originate in 
the parasympathetic nervous system, better known for controlling cycles 
of resting and digesting. In possums, the parasympathetic nervous system causes
their heart rates to drop by nearly half, respiration by a third, and body temperatures by more than half a
degree Celsius for up to an hour. The neurotransmitter dopamine 
also plays a part. Flour beetles with low dopamine levels 
play dead more frequently than those with high levels, and anything blocking dopamine receptor 
sites can lengthen catatonia. But maintaining a death ruse isn’t easy. The performers are constantly 
gauging their surroundings for cues on when it’s safe to rise. Chickens, for instance, can sense
when a predator’s eyes are upon them. Researchers know this because when they
used a stuffed hawk in an experiment, their chicken subjects came out of their
catatonia quicker when the hawk’s eyes were averted. Other animals use TI for purposes 
other than defense. When the sleeper cichlid feels peckish, it sinks to the lake floor 
and lies motionless, its splotchy coloration making it 
seem like a rotting carcass. If a small scavenger investigates, 
this undead trickster strikes. Some animals even feign death 
as a sexual ploy. Male nursery spiders offer gifts of
silk-wrapped insects in hopes of wooing females. But those females are known 
to eat love-seeking males. By playing dead while the female 
eagerly devours her snack, these males can cautiously revive and improve their chances 
of successfully mating. So TI can work to an animal’s advantage,
unless someone else knows its secret. California orcas can flip over 
young great white sharks, inducing TI for so long 
the immobilized sharks, who must move to respire, 
essentially suffocate. Humans can also flip sharks into TI. By stroking a shark’s 
electrically-sensitive snout and gently turning it over, researchers can induce TI 
that lasts up to 15 minutes. That’s enough time to insert tags, remove hooks, and even perform surgeries. There are risks however: TI can hamper respiration and induce
hyperglycemia, a sign of stress. So this technique should only 
be used when necessary. Humans can also experience TI when they
freeze with fear during violent assaults. Recognizing this ancient, involuntary
form of self-defense has significant implications 
when trying to understand why some victims don’t flee 
or fight in the face of danger. So, studying TI in non-human animals not only helps us better understand some
odd behaviors, it can also help us better 
understand our own, sometimes counterintuitive, responses to violence.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, based on the information provided in the transcript, the closest match can be determined by the MCQ that tests the understanding of tonic immobility.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the true statement regarding tonic immobility, with the correct option stating that "Playing dead is not a restful state and takes effort to maintain." This information is mentioned in the transcript as "But maintaining a death ruse isn’t easy. The performers are constantly gauging their surroundings for cues on when it’s safe to rise."

Among the generated MCQs, none directly ask about the effort required to maintain tonic immobility. However, Question 3 asks about the main physiological mechanism underlying tonic immobility, which is related to the concept of effort or physiological control.

Since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, the index of the most similar generated MCQ cannot be accurately determined based on the provided options.

**Transcript**:
In ancient Greece, headaches were
considered powerful afflictions. Victims prayed for relief from Asclepius,
the god of medicine. And if pain continued, a medical practitioner would perform 
the best-known remedy— drilling a small hole in the
skull to drain supposedly infected blood. This dire technique, called trepanation, often replaced the headache 
with a more permanent condition. Fortunately, doctors today don’t resort 
to power tools to cure headaches. But we still have a lot
to learn about this ancient ailment. Today, we’ve classified headaches 
into two camps— primary headaches and secondary headaches. The former are not symptomatic of an
underlying disease, injury, or condition; they are the condition. But we’ll come back to them in a minute because while primary headaches 
account for 50% of reported cases, we actually know much more 
about secondary headaches. These are caused by other health problems, with triggers ranging 
from dehydration and caffeine withdrawal to head and neck injury, and heart disease. Doctors have classified 
over 150 diagnosable types, all with different potential causes, 
symptoms, and treatments. But we’ll take just one common case 
—a sinus infection—as an example. The sinuses are a system of cavities that spread behind 
our foreheads, noses, and upper cheeks. When our sinuses are infected, our immune response heats up the area, roasting the bacteria and inflaming 
the cavities well past their usual size. The engorged sinuses put pressure 
on the cranial arteries and veins, as well as muscles in the neck and head. Their pain receptors, called nociceptors,
trigger in response, cueing the brain to release a flood 
of neuropeptides that inflame the cranial blood
vessels, swelling and heating up the head. This discomfort, 
paired with hyper-sensitive head muscles, creates the sore, 
throbbing pain of a headache. Not all headache pain comes from swelling. Tense muscles and inflamed, 
sensitive nerves cause varying degrees 
of discomfort in each headache. But all cases are reactions 
to some cranial irritant. While the cause is clear 
in secondary headaches, the origins of primary headaches 
remain unknown. Scientists are still investigating 
potential triggers for the three types of primary headaches: recurring, long-lasting migraines; intensely painful, 
rapid-fire cluster headaches; and, most common of all, 
the tension headache. As the name suggests, tension headaches are known for creating 
the sensation of a tight band squeezed around the head. These headaches increase the tenderness of
the pericranial muscles, which then painfully pulse 
with blood and oxygen. Patients report stress, dehydration, 
and hormone changes as triggers, but these don’t fit 
the symptoms quite right. For example, in dehydration headaches, the frontal lobe actually 
shrinks away from the skull, creating forehead swelling that doesn’t match the location 
of the pain in tension headaches. Scientists have theories 
for what the actual cause is, ranging from spasming blood vessels to overly sensitive nociceptors, but no one knows for sure. Meanwhile, most headache research is
focused on more severe primary headaches. Migraines are recurring headaches, which 
create a vise-like sensation on the skull that can last from four hours 
to three days. In 20% of cases, these attacks are
intense enough to overload the brain 
with electrical energy, which hyper-excites sensory nerve endings. This produces hallucinations called auras, which can include seeing flashing lights and geometric patterns 
and experiencing tingling sensations. Cluster headaches, 
another primary headache type, cause burning, stabbing bursts
of pain behind one eye, leading to a red eye, constricted pupil, 
and drooping eyelid. What can be done about these conditions, which dramatically affect 
many people’s quality of life? Tension headaches and most secondary cases can be treated with 
over-the-counter pain medications, such as anti-inflammatory drugs 
that reduce cranial swelling. And many secondary headache triggers, like dehydration, eye strain, and stress, can be proactively avoided. Migraines and cluster headaches 
are more complicated, and we haven’t yet discovered reliable 
treatments that work for everyone. But thankfully, pharmacologists 
and neurologists are hard at work cracking these pressing mysteries 
that weigh so heavily on our minds.

underlying disease, injury, or condition; they are the condition. But we’ll come back to them in a minute because while primary headaches 
account for 50% of reported cases, we actually know much more 
about secondary headaches. These are caused by other health problems, with triggers ranging 
from dehydration and caffeine withdrawal to head and neck injury, and heart disease. Doctors have classified 
over 150 diagnosable types, all with different potential causes, 
symptoms, and treatments. But we’ll take just one common case 
—a sinus infection—as an example. The sinuses are a system of cavities that spread behind 
our foreheads, noses, and upper cheeks. When our sinuses are infected, our immune response heats up the area, roasting the bacteria and inflaming 
the cavities well past their usual size. The engorged sinuses put pressure 
on the cranial arteries and veins, as well as muscles in the neck and head. Their pain receptors, called nociceptors,
trigger in response, cueing the brain to release a flood 
of neuropeptides that inflame the cranial blood
vessels, swelling and heating up the head. This discomfort, 
paired with hyper-sensitive head muscles, creates the sore, 
throbbing pain of a headache. Not all headache pain comes from swelling. Tense muscles and inflamed, 
sensitive nerves cause varying degrees 
of discomfort in each headache. But all cases are reactions 
to some cranial irritant. While the cause is clear 
in secondary headaches, the origins of primary headaches 
remain unknown. Scientists are still investigating 
potential triggers for the three types of primary headaches: recurring, long-lasting migraines; intensely painful, 
rapid-fire cluster headaches; and, most common of all, 
the tension headache. As the name suggests, tension headaches are known for creating 
the sensation of a tight band squeezed around the head. These headaches increase the tenderness of
the pericranial muscles, which then painfully pulse 
with blood and oxygen. Patients report stress, dehydration, 
and hormone changes as triggers, but these don’t fit 
the symptoms quite right. For example, in dehydration headaches, the frontal lobe actually 
shrinks away from the skull, creating forehead swelling that doesn’t match the location 
of the pain in tension headaches. Scientists have theories 
for what the actual cause is, ranging from spasming blood vessels to overly sensitive nociceptors, but no one knows for sure. Meanwhile, most headache research is
focused on more severe primary headaches. Migraines are recurring headaches, which 
create a vise-like sensation on the skull that can last from four hours 
to three days. In 20% of cases, these attacks are
intense enough to overload the brain 
with electrical energy, which hyper-excites sensory nerve endings. This produces hallucinations called auras, which can include seeing flashing lights and geometric patterns 
and experiencing tingling sensations. Cluster headaches, 
another primary headache type, cause burning, stabbing bursts
of pain behind one eye, leading to a red eye, constricted pupil, 
and drooping eyelid. What can be done about these conditions, which dramatically affect 
many people’s quality of life? Tension headaches and most secondary cases can be treated with 
over-the-counter pain medications, such as anti-inflammatory drugs 
that reduce cranial swelling. And many secondary headache triggers, like dehydration, eye strain, and stress, can be proactively avoided. Migraines and cluster headaches 
are more complicated, and we haven’t yet discovered reliable 
treatments that work for everyone. But thankfully, pharmacologists 
and neurologists are hard at work cracking these pressing mysteries 
that weigh so heavily on our minds.

**Transcript**:
The decision whether one should stay or leave is one of the most consequential
and painful any of us ever has to make. On any given day, many millions of people worldwide will be secretly turning the issue over in their minds
as they go about their daily lives. Their partners beside them, possibly having little clue as to the momentous decision weighing upon them. The choice is perhaps more common now than it ever was We expect to be deeply happy in love, and, therefore, spend a good deal of time wondering whether our relationships are essentially normal in their sexual and psychological frustrations or are beset by unusually pathological patterns which will impel us to get out as soon as we can. What films or novels we've been exposed to, the state of our friends' relationships, the degree of noise surrounding new sexually driven dating apps, not to mention how much sleep we've had can all play humblingly large roles in influencing us one way or another. Awkwardly, it seems that no one else actually really minds what we end up doing which gives the decision a degree of existential loneliness it might not always have possessed Historically, the choice was, in a sense, a good deal easier because there were simply so many stern external sanctions around not leaving: religions would insist that god blessed unions and would be furious that they're being torn asunder, society strongly disapproved of breakups and cast separating parties into decades of ignominy and shame, and psychologists would explain that children would be deeply and permanently scarred by any termination in their parents' relationship But, one by one, these objections to quitting have fallen away; religions no longer terrify us into staying society doesn't care, and psychologists now routinely tell us that children would prefer a broken family to an unhappy one The burden of choice therefore falls squarely on us. The only thing determining whether to stay or leave is how we feel which can be pretty hard matter indeed to work out for ourselves, our feelings having a dispirited habit of shifting and evading any efforts of rational qualification. In the circumstances, it might help to have a set of questions, devil's advocate in nature, to fall back upon - a kind of checklist to dialogue within one's mind in the silent hours of the morning, from the chill vantage point of the spare room couch. How much of our unhappiness can be tightly attributed to this particular partner, and how much might it, as we would risk discovering five years and multiple upheavals later, turn out to be simply and inherent feature of any attempt to live in close proximity to another human? Though it is, of course, always essentially their fault, what tiny proportion of the difficulties might we, nevertheless, be contributing to the discord? In what modest way might we be a little hard to be around? Consider the annoying traits in all previous partners we've had and people we've known that our current partners happen not to have what do we manage not to fight about? Start to probe at any new infatuations or crushes, largely by getting to know them better Observe closely how many sexually available and intelligent people the single types around us, especially those hooked up to those new dating apps actually manage to encounter day-to-day. Try to have another converstaion with your partner in which you don't accuse them of mendacity, and instead simply explain, quite calmly, how you actually feel and how sad you are at quite a few things. Reflect on how'd you really feel as a child. If henceforth, you were to have two tiny bedrooms, two new step-parents, and possibly a few more new half-siblings.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about addressing an issue in a relationship and asks what one should not do. The correct option is "Accuse your partner."

Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 and Question 8 are about approaching the decision to stay or leave a relationship, but they do not explicitly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 4 and Question 8 do mention using a checklist of questions to dialogue within one's mind, which is related to the idea of addressing an issue in a relationship.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that asks about how to address an issue in a relationship or how to communicate with one's partner. Unfortunately, such a question is not present in the provided options.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 4 or Question 8. Between these two, I would choose Question 4, as it is more focused on approaching the decision to stay or leave a relationship.

**Transcript**:
The decision whether one should stay or leave is one of the most consequential
and painful any of us ever has to make. On any given day, many millions of people worldwide will be secretly turning the issue over in their minds
as they go about their daily lives. Their partners beside them, possibly having little clue as to the momentous decision weighing upon them. The choice is perhaps more common now than it ever was We expect to be deeply happy in love, and, therefore, spend a good deal of time wondering whether our relationships are essentially normal in their sexual and psychological frustrations or are beset by unusually pathological patterns which will impel us to get out as soon as we can. What films or novels we've been exposed to, the state of our friends' relationships, the degree of noise surrounding new sexually driven dating apps, not to mention how much sleep we've had can all play humblingly large roles in influencing us one way or another. Awkwardly, it seems that no one else actually really minds what we end up doing which gives the decision a degree of existential loneliness it might not always have possessed Historically, the choice was, in a sense, a good deal easier because there were simply so many stern external sanctions around not leaving: religions would insist that god blessed unions and would be furious that they're being torn asunder, society strongly disapproved of breakups and cast separating parties into decades of ignominy and shame, and psychologists would explain that children would be deeply and permanently scarred by any termination in their parents' relationship But, one by one, these objections to quitting have fallen away; religions no longer terrify us into staying society doesn't care, and psychologists now routinely tell us that children would prefer a broken family to an unhappy one The burden of choice therefore falls squarely on us. The only thing determining whether to stay or leave is how we feel which can be pretty hard matter indeed to work out for ourselves, our feelings having a dispirited habit of shifting and evading any efforts of rational qualification. In the circumstances, it might help to have a set of questions, devil's advocate in nature, to fall back upon - a kind of checklist to dialogue within one's mind in the silent hours of the morning, from the chill vantage point of the spare room couch. How much of our unhappiness can be tightly attributed to this particular partner, and how much might it, as we would risk discovering five years and multiple upheavals later, turn out to be simply and inherent feature of any attempt to live in close proximity to another human? Though it is, of course, always essentially their fault, what tiny proportion of the difficulties might we, nevertheless, be contributing to the discord? In what modest way might we be a little hard to be around? Consider the annoying traits in all previous partners we've had and people we've known that our current partners happen not to have what do we manage not to fight about? Start to probe at any new infatuations or crushes, largely by getting to know them better Observe closely how many sexually available and intelligent people the single types around us, especially those hooked up to those new dating apps actually manage to encounter day-to-day. Try to have another converstaion with your partner in which you don't accuse them of mendacity, and instead simply explain, quite calmly, how you actually feel and how sad you are at quite a few things. Reflect on how'd you really feel as a child. If henceforth, you were to have two tiny bedrooms, two new step-parents, and possibly a few more new half-siblings. Compare with the scratchy reality of the current set up. Question how normal it is for any couple to have great sex after twenty-two months. Ask yourself if you're ready to face the risk of perhaps achieving no more than exchanging a familiar kind of unhappiness for a new and more complex variety of unhappiness. Wonder whether you really want to choose hope over experience Then, if you still have the impulse to leave, the chances of subsiquent regret lessened to at least a touch, a heavy heart, and a cautious mind, leave.

Welcome to the United Kingdom
(and a Whole Lot More)
explained by me, C. G. P. Grey. United Kingdom?
England?
Great Britain? Are these three the same place?
Are they different places? Do British people secretly laugh those
who use the terms incorrectly?
Who knows the answers to these questions? I do, and I'm going to tell you right now. For the lost — this is the world, this is the European continent, and this is the place we have to untangle. The area shown in purple is the United Kingdom. Part of the confusion is that the United Kingdom is not a single country, but is instead is a country of countries. It contains, inside of it —
four, co-equal, and sovereign nations. The first of these is England, shown here in red. England is often confused with the United Kingdom,
as a whole, because it's the largest and most populous of the nations,
and contains the de facto capital city, London. To the north is Scotland, shown in blue,
and to the west is Wales, shown in white, and — often forgotten even
by those who live in the United Kingdom —
is Northern Ireland, shown in orange. Each country has a local term for the population. While you can call them all 'British,'
it's not recommended;
as the four countries generally don't like each other. The Northern Irish, Scottish, and Welsh
regard the English as slave-driving, colonial masters (no matter that all three have their own, devolved, Parliaments; and are allowed to vote on English laws despite the reverse not being true), and the English generally regard the rest as rural, yokels who spend too much time with their sheep. However, as the four constituent countries
don't have their own passports, they're all British citizens, like it or not.
They are British citizens of the United Kingdom, whose full name, by the way, is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. So where's Great Britain hiding? Right here, the area covered in black is Great Britain. Unlike England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Great Britain is a geographical —
rather than a political — term. Great Britain is the largest island
among the British Isles. Within the United Kingdom,
the term 'Great Britain' is often used to refer to —
England, Scotland, and Wales alone — with the intentional exclusion of Northern Ireland. This is mostly, but not completely, true, as all three constituent countries have islands
that are not part of Great Britain: such as the Isle of Wight (part of England),
the Welsh Isle of Anglesey, the Scottish Hebrides, the Shetland Islands,
the Orkney Islands, and the Islands of the Clyde. The second biggest island in the British Isles is Ireland. It's worth noting, at this point,
that Ireland is not a country; like Great Britain,
it's a geographical — not political — term. The Island of Ireland contains, on it, two countries: Northern Ireland, which we have already discussed,
and the Republic of Ireland. When people say they are 'Irish,'
they're referring to the Republic of Ireland (which is a separate country from the United Kingdom). However, both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom are members of the European Union — even though England, in particular, likes to
pretend that it's an island in the mid-Atlantic, rather than 50 kilometers off the coast of France —
but that's a story for another time. To review: the two largest islands in the British Isles
are Ireland and Great Britain. Ireland has, on it, two countries —
the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland; while Great Britain, mostly, contains three:
England, Scotland and Wales. These last three, when combined with Northern Ireland, form the United Kingdom. There are still many unanswered questions:
such as, why, when you travel to Canada, is there British royalty on the money? To answer this, we need to talk about empire. You can't have gone to school, in the English-speaking world, without having learned that the British Empire once spanned 1/4th the world's land
and governed nearly 1/4th the world's people. While it's easy to remember the parts of the
British Empire that broke away violently, we often forget how many nations gained independence through diplomacy, not bloodshed. These want-to-be nations struck a deal with the Empire: where they continued to recognize the Monarchy as the Head of State, in exchange
for a local, autonomous parliament. To understand how they are connected,
we need to talk about the Crown. Not the physical crown — that sits behind glass in the Tower of London, and earns millions of tourist pounds for the UK — but the Crown as a complicated, legal entity, best thought of as a one-man corporation. Who created this corporation? God did. According to British tradition, all power is vested in God and the Monarch is crowned in a Christian ceremony. God, however, not wanting to be bothered with micromanagement, conveniently delegates his power his power to an entity called the Crown. While this used to be the physical
crown in the Tower of London, it evolved, over time, into a legal corporation; sole able to be controlled only by the ruling monarch. It's a useful reminder that the United Kingdom is still, technically, a theocracy: with the reigning monarch acting as both the Head of State and the Supreme Governor of the official state religion: Anglicanism. Such are the oddities that arise when dealing with a thousand year-old Monarchy. Back to Canada and the rest. The former colonies that gained their independence through diplomacy, and continue to recognize
the authority of the Crown, are known as the Commonwealth Realm.
They are, in decreasing order of population: Canada, Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Jamaica, the Solomon Islands, Belize, the Bahamas, Barbados, Saint Lucia, 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Tuvalu. All are independent nations, but still recognize the Monarchy as the Head of State (even though it has little
 real power within their borders). There are three further entities that belong to the Crown, and these are the Crown Dependencies:
the Isle of Man, Jersey, and Guernsey. Unlike the Commonwealth Realm, they are not considered independent nations, but are granted local autonomy by the Crown, and a British Citizenship by the United Kingdom (though, the UK does reserve the right to over-rule 
the laws of their local assemblies). Are we all done 𝘯𝘰𝘸?
Almost, but not quite; there are still a couple of loose threads,
such as this place: the tiny city of Gibraltar on the southern coast of Spain. Famous for its rock, 
its monkeys, and for causing diplomatic
tension between the United Kingdom and Spain. But what about the Falkland Islands:
which caused so much tension between the United Kingdom and Argentina, that they went to war over them. These places belong in the last group of Crown properties known as: British Overseas Territories, but their former name,
'Crown Colonies,' gives away their origin. They are the last vestiges of the British Empire.
Unlike the Commonwealth Realm, they have not become independent nations and continue to rely on the United Kingdom for military and, sometimes, economic assistance. Like the Crown Dependencies, everyone born within their borders is a British citizen. The Crown Colonies are,
in decreasing order of population: Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Gibraltar, the British Virgin Islands, 
Akrotiri and Dhekelia, Anguilla, Saint Helena, the Ascension Islands, Tristan da Cunha, Montserrat, the British Indian Ocean Territory,
the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, the Falkland Islands, the British Antarctic Territory,
and the Pitcairn Islands. For our final Venn diagram: the United Kingdom is a country situated
on the British Isles and is part of the Crown,
which is controlled by the Monarchy. Also part of the Crown and the British Isles are the Crown Dependencies. The independent nations of the former Empire that still recognize the Crown are the Commonwealth Realm, and the non-independent remnants of the former Empire and are the British Overseas Territories. Thank you very much for watching!

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not cover the topic of the British Empire's span and governance, which is the focus of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of the UK and its relationships, I would say that Question 5 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and a new generated MCQ that specifically addresses the topic of the British Empire's span and governance would be needed.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
A whip-like straw. Powerful, crushing blades. A pointed, piercing tube. There are nearly a million 
known insect species in the world, but most have one of just 
five common types of mouthparts. And that’s extremely useful to scientists because when they encounter 
an unfamiliar insect in the wild, they can learn a lot about it 
just by examining how it eats. Scientific classification, or taxonomy, is used to organize all 
living things into seven levels: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. The features of an insect’s mouthparts can
help identify which order it belongs to, while also providing clues about how 
it evolved and what it feeds on. The chewing mouthpart is the most common. It’s also the most primitive— all other mouthparts are thought to have 
started out looking like this one before evolving into something different. It features a pair 
of jaws called mandibles with toothed inner edges that cut up 
and crush solid foods, like leaves or other insects. You can find this mouthpart 
on ants from the Hymenoptera order, grasshoppers and crickets 
of the Orthoptera order, dragonflies of the Odonata order, and beetles of the Coleoptera order. The piercing-sucking mouthpart consists of
a long, tube-like structure called a beak. This beak can pierce plant 
or animal tissue to suck up liquids like sap or blood. It can also secrete saliva 
with digestive enzymes that liquefy food for easier sucking. Insects in the Hemiptera order 
have piercing-sucking mouthparts and include bed bugs, cicadas, aphids, and leafhoppers. The siphoning mouthpart, a friendlier version 
of the piercing and sucking beak, also consists of a long, tube-like 
structure called a proboscis that works like a straw 
to suck up nectar from flowers. Insects of the Lepidoptera order— butterflies and moths— keep their proboscises rolled
up tightly beneath their heads when they’re not feeding and unfurl them when 
they come across some sweet nectar. With the sponging mouthpart,
there’s yet another tube, this time ending in two spongy lobes that contain many finer 
tubes called pseudotracheae. The pseudotracheae secrete 
enzyme-filled saliva and soak up fluids 
and dissolved foods by capillary action. House flies, fruit flies, and the other non-biting 
members of the Diptera order are the only insects 
that use this technique. But, there’s a catch. Biting flies within Diptera, like mosquitoes, horse flies, and deer flies, have a piercing-sucking mouthpart 
instead of the sponging mouthpart. And finally, the chewing-lapping mouthpart
is a combination of mandibles and a proboscis with a tongue-like 
structure at its tip for lapping up nectar. On this type of mouthpart, the mandibles themselves 
are not actually used for eating. For bees and wasps,
members of the Hymenoptera order, they serve instead as tools 
for pollen-collecting and wax-molding. Of course, in nature, there are always 
exceptions to the rules. The juvenile stages of some insects, 
for example, have completely different kinds 
of mouths than their adult versions, like caterpillars, which use chewing 
mouthparts to devour leaves before metamorphosing into
butterflies and moths with siphoning mouthparts. Still, mouthpart identification can, 
for the most part, help scientists—and you
—categorize insects. So why not break out a magnifying lens and learn a little more about
who’s nibbling your vegetable garden, biting your arm, or just flying by your ear.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although the wording of the question is different, the intent and content of Question 8 align with the ground truth MCQ. Question 8 asks which order of insects has chewing mouthparts, but one of the options (D) is "All of the above", which includes multiple orders (Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, etc.) mentioned in the transcript as having chewing mouthparts. This question-option alignment implies that the mouthparts can help identify which order an insect belongs to, as stated in the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. Question 8 is the closest match, but it still requires some inference to connect the question to the ground truth MCQ's intent.

it evolved and what it feeds on. The chewing mouthpart is the most common. It’s also the most primitive— all other mouthparts are thought to have 
started out looking like this one before evolving into something different. It features a pair 
of jaws called mandibles with toothed inner edges that cut up 
and crush solid foods, like leaves or other insects. You can find this mouthpart 
on ants from the Hymenoptera order, grasshoppers and crickets 
of the Orthoptera order, dragonflies of the Odonata order, and beetles of the Coleoptera order. The piercing-sucking mouthpart consists of
a long, tube-like structure called a beak. This beak can pierce plant 
or animal tissue to suck up liquids like sap or blood. It can also secrete saliva 
with digestive enzymes that liquefy food for easier sucking. Insects in the Hemiptera order 
have piercing-sucking mouthparts and include bed bugs, cicadas, aphids, and leafhoppers. The siphoning mouthpart, a friendlier version 
of the piercing and sucking beak, also consists of a long, tube-like 
structure called a proboscis that works like a straw 
to suck up nectar from flowers. Insects of the Lepidoptera order— butterflies and moths— keep their proboscises rolled
up tightly beneath their heads when they’re not feeding and unfurl them when 
they come across some sweet nectar. With the sponging mouthpart,
there’s yet another tube, this time ending in two spongy lobes that contain many finer 
tubes called pseudotracheae. The pseudotracheae secrete 
enzyme-filled saliva and soak up fluids 
and dissolved foods by capillary action. House flies, fruit flies, and the other non-biting 
members of the Diptera order are the only insects 
that use this technique. But, there’s a catch. Biting flies within Diptera, like mosquitoes, horse flies, and deer flies, have a piercing-sucking mouthpart 
instead of the sponging mouthpart. And finally, the chewing-lapping mouthpart
is a combination of mandibles and a proboscis with a tongue-like 
structure at its tip for lapping up nectar. On this type of mouthpart, the mandibles themselves 
are not actually used for eating. For bees and wasps,
members of the Hymenoptera order, they serve instead as tools 
for pollen-collecting and wax-molding. Of course, in nature, there are always 
exceptions to the rules. The juvenile stages of some insects, 
for example, have completely different kinds 
of mouths than their adult versions, like caterpillars, which use chewing 
mouthparts to devour leaves before metamorphosing into
butterflies and moths with siphoning mouthparts. Still, mouthpart identification can, 
for the most part, help scientists—and you
—categorize insects. So why not break out a magnifying lens and learn a little more about
who’s nibbling your vegetable garden, biting your arm, or just flying by your ear.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest a closest match.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the function of mandibles in bees and wasps with chewing-lapping mouthparts. The closest match is Question 7, which asks about the function of mandibles in the chewing mouthpart. Although the specific mention of bees and wasps is not present in Question 7, it is the closest match in terms of discussing the function of mandibles.

However, it's essential to note that the options provided in Question 7 do not match the ground truth MCQ's options. Therefore, while Question 7 is the closest match in terms of content, it is not an exact match.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 7 is the closest match, but with the caveat that it's not an exact match.

Index: 7 (with the above-mentioned caveat)

**Transcript**:
There have been two central traditions in European gardening. Each one associated with a great European nation. The first originated in 17th century France, and became known as the "Jardin à la française" or "formal French garden". The most sublime example of this school of gardening is to be found in the chateau of Vaux-le-Vicomte which is about 50 kilometers southeast of Paris. It was laid out in the late 1650s by André le Nôtre the most important figure in the history of the French Garden. And the son of the gardener of Louis XIII. The idea was to arrange everything
around symmetry, flattening the existing natural landscape so as to create
perfect arrangements of borders, flower beds and reflecting pools. A grand perspective, a thousand five hundred meters long extended from the foot of the chateau to the end point: a statue of Hercules. The alleyways were decorated at
regular intervals by statues, basins fountains and carefully sculpted
topiaries. It was in an extremely logical precise
unyielding way perfect . Another masterpiece of French
gardening was then constructed at Versailles also by André Le Nôtreto. Here to there was
astonishing symmetry and a will to bend the unruliness of nature to the designs
of man. The French gardening tradition achieved
enormous popularity and was widely copied in far more modest homes across
Europe for a century at least. But the dominance eventually gave way to a new theory of gardening that developed in England in the 18th century. And was known as the "Jardin à l'anglaise" or "English Garden". The central figure in
this tradition was Capability Brown, a gardener of genius responsible for a
170 gardens up and down the United Kingdom, including Petworth in West Sussex, Chatsworth and Darbyshire Bowood in Wilshire and Blenheim Palace  in Oxfordshire. The Jardin à l'anglaise couldn't have been more different from the Jardin à la française. In the English tradition everything was about working with rather
than flattening natural features . Wildness of nature wasn't the enemy. It was the starting point which the
skilled English gardener would enhance and work with. A good English garden
relish the raw impulses of nature it was about accommodating and
delighting in nature even though this was nature that was
tampered with in order to get it to look just that bit more natural. The English garden usually included a
lake, sweeps of gently rolling lawns and groves of trees. The English tradition reign supreme for
a century at least. These are two historical traditions of gardening but
they are also along the way two modes of being. The French style is about a
confident rationalism and willpower. This is how we might feel when we want
to change the world through thought and planning. The English tradition is about
accommodating ourselves to what already exists, bending with what is there, trying to
make the most out of what we've been given and to see its beauty and its charm. It looks like a battle but ideally we
need the two attitudes, the French and the English in our lives in order to
call upon them in diverse situations. Each of us is probably a bit biased
towards one or the other and could benefit from seeking out the distinctive
wisdom of either the French or the English style. The opposition of the to
gardening styles is stark but in truth we need integration, the Jardin à la française and the Jardin à l'anglaise, rational willpower and acceptance of
nature. There are in fact a few places that do
show the two integrated like Sissinghurst Garden in Kent which
borrows from both traditions. This shows us the model of how an ideal
individual might be, someone with a French and an English garden sight to
their nature. Ready to call upon either faculty depending on the occasion. That would be interesting gardening and
wise psychology.

**Transcript**:
The year is 15 CE
and the Roman Empire is prospering. Most of the credit will go to the emperor, but this success wouldn’t 
have been possible without loyal soldiers like Servius Felix. Servius enlisted as a legionary 
eight years ago at age 18, the son of a poor farmer
with few prospects. Unlike the majority of legionaries,
he doesn’t gamble, so he’s been able to save 
most of his wages. He’s even kept his viaticum, the three gold coins he received 
when he enlisted. If he survives until retirement, 
he’ll receive several acres of land. And he’s grown rather fond 
of a girl back home whom he intends to marry. But he’ll have to wait until he completes 
his 25 years of service before that can happen. And the life of a legionary 
is dangerous and grueling. Today, Servius’s legion, 
along with three others, has undertaken a “great march” 
of 30,000 Roman paces, the equivalent of nearly 36 kilometers. Servius’s armor and weapons, including his gladius, scutum, and two pila, weigh over 20 kilograms. And that’s not counting his backpack, 
or sarcina, which contains food and all the tools
he needs to help build the camp – spade, saw, pickaxe, and basket. Although Servius is exhausted, 
he won’t sleep much tonight. He’s been assigned the first watch, which means looking after 
the baggage animals and keeping alert
against a possible ambush. After he’s done, he lies awake, 
dreading the day ahead, which will force him 
to recall his worst nightmare. At dawn, Servius eats breakfast 
with his seven tent companions. They’re like a family, all bearing scars 
from the battles they’ve fought together. Servius is from Italia, but his fellow soldiers hail 
from all over the empire, which stretches from Syria to Spain. So they’re all far from home 
in the northern land of Germania. Servius’s legion 
and three others with him today are under the command of
Emperor Tiberius’s nephew Germanicus, named for his father’s military successes
against the Germanic tribes. Each legion has close to 5,000 men, divided into cohorts of about 500, further subdivided into centuries 
of around 80-100 men. Each century is commanded by a centurion. An aquilifer, or eagle-bearer, marches at
the head of each legion carrying its eagle standard. The centurions march beside 
the legionaries belting out orders, “Dex, sin, dex, sin," “Right, left, right, left," starting with the right foot as the left 
is considered unlucky or sinister. Despite the strict discipline, 
there’s tension in the air. Last year, some legions 
in the area revolted, demanding better pay 
and a cut in the length of service. Only their general’s charisma
and negotiating skills prevented wholesale mutiny. Today is a “just march,” 
only 30 kilometers. As the marshes and forests of Germania 
lie beyond the empire’s road system the men must build causeways
and bridges to make headway— something they’ve recently spent 
more time doing than fighting. Finally, they arrive at their destination,
a place Servius knows too well. It’s a clearing on the outskirts 
of the Teutoburg Forest, where six years ago, during the
reign of the Emperor Augustus, Germanic tribes under 
their chieftain Arminius ambushed and destroyed three legions. Proceeding along a narrow path, the legions were attacked from 
forest cover under torrential rain with their escape blocked. It was one of the worst defeats 
the Romans ever suffered and Augustus never lived it down. Servius was one of the few survivors. Servius still has nightmares of 
his comrades lying where they fell. But now the army is back to bury 
the dead with full military honors. As he helps in the task, he can’t help wondering whether the bones
he handles belonged to someone he knew. Several times he wants to weep aloud, 
but he pushes on with the task. The glory of the Empire 
can go to the crows. All he craves is to retire 
on a small farm with his wife-to-be, if the gods should spare his life 
for 17 more years.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the age at which Servius retired. Although none of the generated MCQs ask about Servius's retirement age, Question 4 asks about the length of service required for a legionary to receive several acres of land upon retirement.

While this is not a direct match, it is related to the concept of retirement and the requirements for it. Therefore, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: What is the name of the standard-bearer who carries the eagle standard of each legion? 

However, Question 3 is also very similar. 

Between the two, I would say Question 3 is more similar because it specifically mentions "eagle-bearer" which is also mentioned in the ground truth MCQ. 

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 3.

**Transcript**:
The year is 15 CE
and the Roman Empire is prospering. Most of the credit will go to the emperor, but this success wouldn’t 
have been possible without loyal soldiers like Servius Felix. Servius enlisted as a legionary 
eight years ago at age 18, the son of a poor farmer
with few prospects. Unlike the majority of legionaries,
he doesn’t gamble, so he’s been able to save 
most of his wages. He’s even kept his viaticum, the three gold coins he received 
when he enlisted. If he survives until retirement, 
he’ll receive several acres of land. And he’s grown rather fond 
of a girl back home whom he intends to marry. But he’ll have to wait until he completes 
his 25 years of service before that can happen. And the life of a legionary 
is dangerous and grueling. Today, Servius’s legion, 
along with three others, has undertaken a “great march” 
of 30,000 Roman paces, the equivalent of nearly 36 kilometers. Servius’s armor and weapons, including his gladius, scutum, and two pila, weigh over 20 kilograms. And that’s not counting his backpack, 
or sarcina, which contains food and all the tools
he needs to help build the camp – spade, saw, pickaxe, and basket. Although Servius is exhausted, 
he won’t sleep much tonight. He’s been assigned the first watch, which means looking after 
the baggage animals and keeping alert
against a possible ambush. After he’s done, he lies awake, 
dreading the day ahead, which will force him 
to recall his worst nightmare. At dawn, Servius eats breakfast 
with his seven tent companions. They’re like a family, all bearing scars 
from the battles they’ve fought together. Servius is from Italia, but his fellow soldiers hail 
from all over the empire, which stretches from Syria to Spain. So they’re all far from home 
in the northern land of Germania. Servius’s legion 
and three others with him today are under the command of
Emperor Tiberius’s nephew Germanicus, named for his father’s military successes
against the Germanic tribes. Each legion has close to 5,000 men, divided into cohorts of about 500, further subdivided into centuries 
of around 80-100 men. Each century is commanded by a centurion. An aquilifer, or eagle-bearer, marches at
the head of each legion carrying its eagle standard. The centurions march beside 
the legionaries belting out orders, “Dex, sin, dex, sin," “Right, left, right, left," starting with the right foot as the left 
is considered unlucky or sinister. Despite the strict discipline, 
there’s tension in the air. Last year, some legions 
in the area revolted, demanding better pay 
and a cut in the length of service. Only their general’s charisma
and negotiating skills prevented wholesale mutiny. Today is a “just march,” 
only 30 kilometers. As the marshes and forests of Germania 
lie beyond the empire’s road system the men must build causeways

**Transcript**:
Mining unobtainium is hard work. The rare mineral appears 
in only 1% of rocks in the mine. But your friend Tricky Joe 
has something up his sleeve. The unobtainium detector he’s been 
perfecting for months is finally ready. The device never fails 
to detect unobtainium if any is present. Otherwise, it’s still highly reliable, returning accurate 
readings 90% of the time. On his first day trying 
it out in the field, the device goes off, and 
Joe happily places the rock in his cart. As the two of you head back to camp 
where the ore can be examined, Joe makes you an offer: he’ll sell you the ore for just $200. You know that a piece of unobtanium 
that size would easily be worth $1000, but any other minerals 
would be effectively worthless. Should you make the trade? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Intuitively, it seems like a good deal. Since the detector 
is correct most of the time, shouldn’t you be able
to trust its reading? Unfortunately, no. Here’s why. Imagine the mine 
has exactly 1,000 pieces of ore. An unobtainium rarity of 1% means that there are only 10 rocks 
with the precious mineral inside. All 10 would set off the detector. But what about the other 990
rocks without unobtainium? Well, 90% of them,
891 rocks, to be exact, won’t set off anything. But 10%, or 99 rocks, 
will set off the detector despite not having unobtanium, a result known as a false positive. Why does that matter? Because it means that all in all, 109 rocks will have 
triggered the detector. And Joe’s rock could be any one of them, from the 10 that contain the mineral to the 99 that don’t, which means the chances of it containing 
unobtainium are 10 out of 109 – about 9%. And paying $200 for a 9%
chance of getting $1000 isn’t great odds. So why is this result so unexpected, and why did Joe’s rock seem 
like such a sure bet? The key is something called 
the base rate fallacy. While we’re focused on the relatively 
high accuracy of the detector, our intuition makes us forget to account for how rare the unobtanium 
was in the first place. But because the device’s error rate of 10% is still higher than 
the mineral’s overall occurrence, any time it goes off is still more likely 
to be a false positive than a real finding. This problem is an example 
of conditional probability. The answer lies neither in the overall 
chance of finding unobtainium, nor the overall chance 
of receiving a false positive reading. This kind of background information 
that we’re given before anything happens is known as unconditional, 
or prior probability. What we’re looking for, though,
is the chance of finding unobtainium once we know that the device did

**Transcript**:
Mining unobtainium is hard work. The rare mineral appears 
in only 1% of rocks in the mine. But your friend Tricky Joe 
has something up his sleeve. The unobtainium detector he’s been 
perfecting for months is finally ready. The device never fails 
to detect unobtainium if any is present. Otherwise, it’s still highly reliable, returning accurate 
readings 90% of the time. On his first day trying 
it out in the field, the device goes off, and 
Joe happily places the rock in his cart. As the two of you head back to camp 
where the ore can be examined, Joe makes you an offer: he’ll sell you the ore for just $200. You know that a piece of unobtanium 
that size would easily be worth $1000, but any other minerals 
would be effectively worthless. Should you make the trade? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Intuitively, it seems like a good deal. Since the detector 
is correct most of the time, shouldn’t you be able
to trust its reading? Unfortunately, no. Here’s why. Imagine the mine 
has exactly 1,000 pieces of ore. An unobtainium rarity of 1% means that there are only 10 rocks 
with the precious mineral inside. All 10 would set off the detector. But what about the other 990
rocks without unobtainium? Well, 90% of them,
891 rocks, to be exact, won’t set off anything. But 10%, or 99 rocks, 
will set off the detector despite not having unobtanium, a result known as a false positive. Why does that matter? Because it means that all in all, 109 rocks will have 
triggered the detector. And Joe’s rock could be any one of them, from the 10 that contain the mineral to the 99 that don’t, which means the chances of it containing 
unobtainium are 10 out of 109 – about 9%. And paying $200 for a 9%
chance of getting $1000 isn’t great odds. So why is this result so unexpected, and why did Joe’s rock seem 
like such a sure bet? The key is something called 
the base rate fallacy. While we’re focused on the relatively 
high accuracy of the detector, our intuition makes us forget to account for how rare the unobtanium 
was in the first place. But because the device’s error rate of 10% is still higher than 
the mineral’s overall occurrence, any time it goes off is still more likely 
to be a false positive than a real finding. This problem is an example 
of conditional probability. The answer lies neither in the overall 
chance of finding unobtainium, nor the overall chance 
of receiving a false positive reading. This kind of background information 
that we’re given before anything happens is known as unconditional, 
or prior probability. What we’re looking for, though,
is the chance of finding unobtainium once we know that the device did
return a positive reading. This is known as the conditional, 
or posterior probability, determined once the possibilities have 
been narrowed down through observation. Many people are confused 
by the false positive paradox because we have a bias

**Transcript**:
Mining unobtainium is hard work. The rare mineral appears 
in only 1% of rocks in the mine. But your friend Tricky Joe 
has something up his sleeve. The unobtainium detector he’s been 
perfecting for months is finally ready. The device never fails 
to detect unobtainium if any is present. Otherwise, it’s still highly reliable, returning accurate 
readings 90% of the time. On his first day trying 
it out in the field, the device goes off, and 
Joe happily places the rock in his cart. As the two of you head back to camp 
where the ore can be examined, Joe makes you an offer: he’ll sell you the ore for just $200. You know that a piece of unobtanium 
that size would easily be worth $1000, but any other minerals 
would be effectively worthless. Should you make the trade? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Intuitively, it seems like a good deal. Since the detector 
is correct most of the time, shouldn’t you be able
to trust its reading? Unfortunately, no. Here’s why. Imagine the mine 
has exactly 1,000 pieces of ore. An unobtainium rarity of 1% means that there are only 10 rocks 
with the precious mineral inside. All 10 would set off the detector. But what about the other 990
rocks without unobtainium? Well, 90% of them,
891 rocks, to be exact, won’t set off anything. But 10%, or 99 rocks, 
will set off the detector despite not having unobtanium, a result known as a false positive. Why does that matter? Because it means that all in all, 109 rocks will have 
triggered the detector. And Joe’s rock could be any one of them, from the 10 that contain the mineral to the 99 that don’t, which means the chances of it containing 
unobtainium are 10 out of 109 – about 9%. And paying $200 for a 9%
chance of getting $1000 isn’t great odds. So why is this result so unexpected, and why did Joe’s rock seem 
like such a sure bet? The key is something called 
the base rate fallacy. While we’re focused on the relatively 
high accuracy of the detector, our intuition makes us forget to account for how rare the unobtanium 
was in the first place. But because the device’s error rate of 10% is still higher than 
the mineral’s overall occurrence, any time it goes off is still more likely 
to be a false positive than a real finding. This problem is an example 
of conditional probability. The answer lies neither in the overall 
chance of finding unobtainium, nor the overall chance 
of receiving a false positive reading. This kind of background information 
that we’re given before anything happens is known as unconditional, 
or prior probability. What we’re looking for, though,
is the chance of finding unobtainium once we know that the device did
return a positive reading. This is known as the conditional, 
or posterior probability, determined once the possibilities have 
been narrowed down through observation. Many people are confused 
by the false positive paradox because we have a bias 
for focusing on specific information over the more general, especially when immediate decisions 
come into play. And while in many cases 
it’s better to be safe than sorry, false positives can have 
real negative consequences. False positives in medical testing 
are preferable to false negatives, but they can still lead to stress or
unnecessary treatment. And false positives in mass surveillance can cause innocent people to be
wrongfully arrested, jailed, or worse. As for this case, the one thing 
you can be positive about is that Tricky Joe is trying 
to take you for a ride.

**Transcript**:
Visiting the bathroom is part 
of the daily human experience. But occasionally, constipation strikes, a condition that causes 
a backup in your digestive system. The food you eat can take several days 
to exit your body. And for many, 
constipation can become chronic, meaning regularly passing lumpy 
hard stools accompanied by straining. What's behind this 
unsettling phenomenon? Constipation arises in the colon, 
also known as the large intestine. This muscular organ is split
into four sections: the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon, which connects with the rectum and anus. The small intestine delivers stool consisting of ingested food, 
bile, and digestive juices to the large intestine. As this stool moves through the colon, the organ siphons off most 
of the water it contains, transforming it from liquid to solid. The longer this transmission takes, the more reabsorption occurs,
resulting in increasingly solid stool. Once it reaches the sigmoid colon, a final bout of reabsorption 
occurs before it enters the rectum, distending its walls and telling
the internal anal sphincter to relax. This is the point where you can usually 
decide whether to physically expel or retain the stool. That’s regulated by 
the pelvic floor muscles, particularly the puborectalis and external anal sphincter. The puborectalis forms 
a sling-like formation around the rectum called the anorectal angle. And when you voluntarily relax 
your external anal sphincter, the stool is finally expelled. When you’re constipated, however, a desire to visit the bathroom isn't
enough to coax your body into action. Usually there's two factors 
behind this problem: the stool’s slow movement 
through the colon and/or pelvic floor dysfunction. In the first, stool moves excessively 
slowly through the intestines, causing over-absorption of liquid, 
which makes the stool dry and hard. With pelvic floor dysfunction, stool becomes difficult 
to eliminate from the rectum because of tightened pelvic floor muscles,
or due to a pelvic organ prolapse, usually through childbirth or aging. Both of these problems 
make the anorectal angle more acute and it becomes difficult to expel waste. To identify constipation precisely, researchers have developed metrics,
such as the Bristol Stool Chart. Most people who look at that chart will be able to tell they’ve experienced 
constipation before. When you’re on the toilet, you should
ideally be in a squatting position. With your buttocks firmly 
on the toilet seat, you can elevate your feet on a stool and lean forwards with a straight back, which straightens the anorectal angle
and eases the passage of waste. Going a day without a bowel movement 
isn’t necessarily cause for alarm. But if you are experiencing 
chronic constipation, simple dietary and lifestyle changes, like fibrous vegetables, regular exercise, abdominal massage, and 6 to 8 cups of water per day may help restore your daily
trip to the toilet.

**Transcript**:
Visiting the bathroom is part 
of the daily human experience. But occasionally, constipation strikes, a condition that causes 
a backup in your digestive system. The food you eat can take several days 
to exit your body. And for many, 
constipation can become chronic, meaning regularly passing lumpy 
hard stools accompanied by straining. What's behind this 
unsettling phenomenon? Constipation arises in the colon, 
also known as the large intestine. This muscular organ is split
into four sections: the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon, which connects with the rectum and anus. The small intestine delivers stool consisting of ingested food, 
bile, and digestive juices to the large intestine. As this stool moves through the colon, the organ siphons off most 
of the water it contains, transforming it from liquid to solid. The longer this transmission takes, the more reabsorption occurs,
resulting in increasingly solid stool. Once it reaches the sigmoid colon, a final bout of reabsorption 
occurs before it enters the rectum, distending its walls and telling
the internal anal sphincter to relax. This is the point where you can usually 
decide whether to physically expel or retain the stool. That’s regulated by 
the pelvic floor muscles, particularly the puborectalis and external anal sphincter. The puborectalis forms 
a sling-like formation around the rectum called the anorectal angle. And when you voluntarily relax 
your external anal sphincter, the stool is finally expelled. When you’re constipated, however, a desire to visit the bathroom isn't
enough to coax your body into action. Usually there's two factors 
behind this problem: the stool’s slow movement 
through the colon and/or pelvic floor dysfunction. In the first, stool moves excessively 
slowly through the intestines, causing over-absorption of liquid, 
which makes the stool dry and hard. With pelvic floor dysfunction, stool becomes difficult 
to eliminate from the rectum because of tightened pelvic floor muscles,
or due to a pelvic organ prolapse, usually through childbirth or aging. Both of these problems 
make the anorectal angle more acute and it becomes difficult to expel waste. To identify constipation precisely, researchers have developed metrics,
such as the Bristol Stool Chart. Most people who look at that chart will be able to tell they’ve experienced 
constipation before. When you’re on the toilet, you should
ideally be in a squatting position. With your buttocks firmly 
on the toilet seat, you can elevate your feet on a stool and lean forwards with a straight back, which straightens the anorectal angle
and eases the passage of waste. Going a day without a bowel movement 
isn’t necessarily cause for alarm. But if you are experiencing 
chronic constipation, simple dietary and lifestyle changes, like fibrous vegetables, regular exercise, abdominal massage, and 6 to 8 cups of water per day may help restore your daily
trip to the toilet.

We're often left to conclude that we are isolated at the more freakish and revolting end of human nature far from it we're just failing to imagine that others are, of course, every bit as disturbed as we are without knowing exactly what it is that troubles or racks another, outwardly very impressive person we can be sure that it will be something. We might not know exactly what they regret but there will be agonizing feelings of some kind we won't be able to say exactly what kind of unusual, sexual kink obsesses them? but there will be one and we can know this because vulnerabilities and compulsions cannot be curses that have just ascended upon us uniquely they are universal features of human mental equipment the solution to the impostor syndrome lies in making a crucial leap of faith: the leap that others' minds must work in basically much the same way as ours do everyone must be as anxious, uncertain and wayward as we are it's a leap of faith because we just have to accept that the majority of what we feel and are especially the more shameful, unmentionable sides will have a corollary in each and every one of us one of the tasks that works of art should ideally accomplish is to take us more reliably into the minds of people we're intimidated by in order to show us the more average, muddled and fretful experiences that they have that way, we would be helped to understand that we're not barred by our vulnerabilities from doing what they do that's what the philosopher Montaigne writing in the 16th century was attempting to do when he playfully informed his readers in plain French that "kings and philosophers shit and so do ladies!" Montaigne's point is that for all the evidence that exists about this shitting we might not guess that these people ever had to squat on a toilet we never see distinguished types doing this while of course we are immensely well informed about our own digestive activities and therefore we build up a sense that because we have crude and sometimes rather desperate bowels we can't be philosophers, kings or ladies and that if we set ourselves up in these roles we would just be impostors Montaigne's example is a neat one because despite the lack of evidence we know that these exalted people must of course excrete in exactly the same way we do So, with Montaigne's guidance we're invited to take on a saner sense of what grand, powerful and beautiful people are really like but the real target isn't just an under confidence about bodily functions this point extends into the psychological arena too Montaigne might also have said that kings, philosophers and ladies are wracked by self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy sometimes bump into doors and have weird, lustful thoughts about members of their own families Furthermore, instead of considering only the big figures of 16th century France we could update this example and refer to CEOs, corporate lawyers, news presenters and successful start-up entrepreneurs they too, can't cope, feel they might buckle under pressure and look back on certain decisions with shame and regret No less than shitting, such feelings are not what separates us from them our inner frailties don't cut us off from doing what they do If we were in their roles, we'd not be impostors we'd simply be normal Making a leap of faith around what other people are really like helps us to humanize the world it means that whenever we encounter a stranger we're not really encountering a stranger we're in fact encountering someone who is, in spite of the surface evidence to the contrary in basic ways, very much like us and therefore, nothing fundamental stands between us and the possibility of responsibility, success and fulfillment.

Montaigne's point is that for all the evidence that exists about this shitting we might not guess that these people ever had to squat on a toilet we never see distinguished types doing this while of course we are immensely well informed about our own digestive activities and therefore we build up a sense that because we have crude and sometimes rather desperate bowels we can't be philosophers, kings or ladies and that if we set ourselves up in these roles we would just be impostors Montaigne's example is a neat one because despite the lack of evidence we know that these exalted people must of course excrete in exactly the same way we do So, with Montaigne's guidance we're invited to take on a saner sense of what grand, powerful and beautiful people are really like but the real target isn't just an under confidence about bodily functions this point extends into the psychological arena too Montaigne might also have said that kings, philosophers and ladies are wracked by self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy sometimes bump into doors and have weird, lustful thoughts about members of their own families Furthermore, instead of considering only the big figures of 16th century France we could update this example and refer to CEOs, corporate lawyers, news presenters and successful start-up entrepreneurs they too, can't cope, feel they might buckle under pressure and look back on certain decisions with shame and regret No less than shitting, such feelings are not what separates us from them our inner frailties don't cut us off from doing what they do If we were in their roles, we'd not be impostors we'd simply be normal Making a leap of faith around what other people are really like helps us to humanize the world it means that whenever we encounter a stranger we're not really encountering a stranger we're in fact encountering someone who is, in spite of the surface evidence to the contrary in basic ways, very much like us and therefore, nothing fundamental stands between us and the possibility of responsibility, success and fulfillment.

**Transcript**:
We're sometimes not too sure how we get into good friendships. It seems to happen rather mysteriously. We talk of somewhat
randomly clicking with people. Trying to plan for this sounds like cheating. but there is something at the heart of many friendships that seemed important to identify and in a way to get good at: Vulnerability. It's too easy to assume
that what makes us likable , are our strengths our accomplishments, the things
we're proud of. Certainly this impresses, but it isn't what draws others to us. We get close to someone the more they, and we find ourselves able gracefully to
depart from the official story of what human beings are like, and can start to show the awkward truths which underlie the cheerful facade. These are the truths with which we've
been lonely for too long. How unlike normal sexuality our sex lives actually are; how full of envy are our careers are proving; how unsatisfactory our family can be; how worried we are, all the time. Revealing any of these things places us
in great danger. Others could laugh; social media would have a field day. That's the point. We can only get close by revealing things which would, in the wrong hands, be capable of inflicting appalling
humiliation on us. Friendship is the dividend of gratitude, that flows from acknowledgement that one has offered something very valuable to someone. Not a fancy present, but something even more precious: the key to one's self-esteem and dignity. It's deeply poignant that we should expend so much effort on trying to look strong before the world. When, all the while, it's really only ever the
revelation of the somewhat embarrassing, sad melancholy and anxious bits of us that
are what makes us endearing to others and can transform strangers into friends.

**Transcript**:
Time... makes sense in small pieces. But when you look at huge stretches of time, it's almost impossible to wrap your head around things. So, let's start small-- with minutes, hours, days. You probably spent the last 24 hours mostly sleeping and working, and you probably wasted a good chunk of yesterday on the Internet. Days become weeks, weeks become months, and then we have a year. Let's look at 2017. France started to train eagles to hunt terrorist drones, A Czech nuclear power plant held a bikini contest to pick their new intern, and people on the Internet made a challenge out of eating bleach. You know, the usual stuff. Let's go back further. A kid born in the first year of the 21st Century is 18 years old now. But the century is still young, even if you're not. It was largely shaped by the attacks on 9/11, which led to the war in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq. In March 2011, the Syrian Civil War began, and is still ongoing after seven years. Most of us were born in the 20th century, which had the two most devastating wars in human history, and the Cold War. For the first time ever, we could destroy ourselves with the nuclear weapons, and we almost did, but we also had a space race and left Earth for the first time. The Internet was also invented, which led to memes , but also to Facebook and Twitter, so all in all, we're not sure if this was a GOOD development. The average human lives about 79 years, which covers a good chunk of recent history. The oldest living person on Earth is currently Celino Jaramillo, who was born in 1896, which means that his birth was closer to Napoleon ruling Europe than to the current day. Only 250 years ago, the Industrial Revolution turned the world into a progress machine. Farmers became workers, and knowledge became easier to distribute. Around this time, we started the progress that is causing climate change today. Not that long ago, actually. The Theory of Evolution changed how we saw ourselves and the world we live in. Newton wrote down his theory of gravity. We discovered distant stars and very close bacteria. The 15th century was very eventful. Columbus's "discovery" of America and the fall of Constantinople marked the end of the Middle Ages. War was all the rage in the Middle Ages, but the number one killer was disease. The Black Plague killed every third European in just six years. Around 2,000 years ago, we set the arbitrary Year 1 of our calendar that most of the world follows today. But to a Roman, the world was already ancient. The Great Pyramids were constructed 4,500 years ago. So, to a Roman, the pyramids were older than the Romans are to us today. So long ago, that there were still living mammoths on Earth. A lot of history happened before that, even. Around 7,000 years ago, humans began writing things down. About 12,000 years ago, human organization exploded. We built our first temple, and around the world, mankind began farming, which enabled the rise of larger communities. Our dominance over planet Earth really begins here. Homo sapiens sapiens, the modern human, evolved at least 200,000 years ago. 50,000 years ago, the Cognitive Revolution expanded our minds and innovation. Back then, we shared Earth with at least five other human species that either died out or were killed by us. At least 2 million years ago, our ancestors already had control over fire and constructed tools from wood and stone. And six million years ago, the last common ancestors of chimpanzees and humans existed. So this graph is all of human history. Our close relative, Homo erectus, survived 10 times longer than we have existed. This tiny part is the human era. We have to zoom in a lot to even see your lifetime. Still, all of human history is not that long. 65 million years ago, the age of the dinosaurs ended in an enormous explosion. The dinosaurs ruled the Earth for over 165 million years. 27 times as long as all humans. That's so long, that it means a T-rex that lived at 65 million years ago is closer to us today than to a live Stegosaurus. Dinosaurs in the form of mighty chickens are still around today. Animal life on this planet started 600 million years ago. The earliest animals were fish and other small simple sea creatures, then came insects, then reptiles and finally, around 200 million years ago, mammals joined the party. Life itself began much further back. There is evidence that it appeared up to 4.1 BILLION years ago. For at least 3.5 billion years, life consisted only of single-celled organisms. 4.5 billion years ago, the Sun was born from a gigantic imploding gas cloud. 60 million years later, Earth formed. In those early years, frequent bombardment by comets and asteroids supplied the Earth with large oceans. But as far as the whole universe goes, our solar system is pretty new. 13.75 billion years ago, the universe was born. And about half a billion years later, our own galaxy formed from billions of stars. But what came before the Big Bang? The truth is... we don't know, and maybe we never will. And there you have it... The past. Now let's take a look at what we know about the future. In roughly 1 billion years, the Sun will be so hot that life on Earth becomes impossible. The death of the Sun 4 billion years later marks the end of life in the solar system. If we want to have a chance to survive, we need to have ventured to the stars. And what happens after that? In the next 100 billion years, most of the biggest stars around will die. The universe becomes dimmer and dimmer, illuminated only by smaller red and white dwarfs. But they too will eventually burn out and one day... the last star in the universe will die. The universe will turn dark, and at some point, even black holes will evaporate and die. When they do our, universe will reach its final stage: Heat death. Nothing changes anymore; the universe is dead. Forever. Now, you're feeling some pretty weird feelings right now, aren't you? We are, too. It's only natural. The good news is this is all far, far away. The only time that actually matters is now. That cute girl or boy you like, ask them out! Time is precious. Make it count!

Cinco de Mayo Cinco de Mayo a relatively small national holiday in Mexico has evolved into a ridiculously massive celebration in the United States the world's largest Cinco celebration takes place in LA cities like New York Denver and Houston also throw huge parties in honor of this day problem is it continues to be confused with Mexican Independence Day reto did the Lotus which occurred 50 years prior and is instead celebrated on September 16 the truth is May 5th actually commemorates the Battle of Puebla in 1862 when Mexico defended itself from an invasion by the French at the order of Napoleon the third despite having a way smaller army they managed to secure their victory however the French came back a year later and ultimately won anyways Cinco de Mayo became popularized by activists in the 1950s and 60s Chicano activists publicized the holiday as a way to educate Mexican Americans about their cultural history and the holiday also served as a way for Anglo Americans to better understand Mexican culture despite the fact that thirty-three point six million US residents come from Mexican heritage Cinco de Mayo has been criticized for being an Americanized holiday thanks to the efforts of beer companies and other large corporations that's why the tendency is to devote the holiday to the consumption of proteus amounts of guacamole with chips and downing unlimited amounts of margaritas during the festivities Americans bought more than 600 million worth of beer twelve point three million cases of tequila were wiped out and up to 81 million pounds of avocados were concerned whether you've decided to get wasted or reenact battle scenes from a short-lived victory it's probably a good idea to consider that this holiday does have its own historical and cultural significance

Cinco de Mayo Cinco de Mayo a relatively small national holiday in Mexico has evolved into a ridiculously massive celebration in the United States the world's largest Cinco celebration takes place in LA cities like New York Denver and Houston also throw huge parties in honor of this day problem is it continues to be confused with Mexican Independence Day reto did the Lotus which occurred 50 years prior and is instead celebrated on September 16 the truth is May 5th actually commemorates the Battle of Puebla in 1862 when Mexico defended itself from an invasion by the French at the order of Napoleon the third despite having a way smaller army they managed to secure their victory however the French came back a year later and ultimately won anyways Cinco de Mayo became popularized by activists in the 1950s and 60s Chicano activists publicized the holiday as a way to educate Mexican Americans about their cultural history and the holiday also served as a way for Anglo Americans to better understand Mexican culture despite the fact that thirty-three point six million US residents come from Mexican heritage Cinco de Mayo has been criticized for being an Americanized holiday thanks to the efforts of beer companies and other large corporations that's why the tendency is to devote the holiday to the consumption of proteus amounts of guacamole with chips and downing unlimited amounts of margaritas during the festivities Americans bought more than 600 million worth of beer twelve point three million cases of tequila were wiped out and up to 81 million pounds of avocados were concerned whether you've decided to get wasted or reenact battle scenes from a short-lived victory it's probably a good idea to consider that this holiday does have its own historical and cultural significance

**Transcript**:
More than two kilometers below 
the surface of northern Ontario, suspended in 345,000 liters 
of ultra-pure water, there’s a perfect sphere. It contains 3600 kilograms 
of liquid argon, cooled to -180 degrees Celsius. Scientists continuously monitor 
this chamber from above ground, looking for a glimmer 
of light in the darkness. Because down here, deep beneath the Earth’s surface 
and cocooned in a watery shield, that light would indicate the presence of
one of the universe’s greatest mysteries: dark matter. All the matter we can see,
planets, stars and galaxies, doesn’t create enough gravitational pull to explain
the universe’s larger structure. It’s dark matter, which is estimated 
to make up 25% of the known universe. But despite its prevalence, so far we haven’t been able 
to detect it directly. It’s no small challenge. Dark matter was so named because it
doesn’t interact with any type of light, visible or otherwise, which means our usual observation tools simply don’t work 
when trying to observe it. But while dark matter may not be visible 
in the electromagnetic spectrum, it’s still matter, so we should be able to measure 
its interactions with other matter. And if our current model 
of physics is correct, billions of sub-atomic 
dark matter particles are passing through 
the Earth every second. Despite the prevalence of dark matter, its interactions are predicted to be rare 
and extremely weak. To detect these interactions, dark matter experiments need to be
incredibly sensitive. With such sensitive equipment, the ever-present background radiation 
on Earth’s surface would create so much noise in the data that any dark matter particles 
would be completely overwhelmed. It would be like trying to hear
a pin drop on a busy city street. To solve this problem, scientists have had 
to dig deep into the Earth. Dark matter experiments are set up 
in specialized underground labs, either in mines or inside mountains. The rock that makes up 
the Earth’s crust works like a filter, absorbing radiation 
and stopping disruptive particles. The ultra-pure water
in which the detector is suspended adds an additional layer 
of radiation filtering. This shielding ensures that only 
the particles scientists are looking for can make their way into the detectors. Once these particles reach 
an experiment’s inner vessel, scientists have a chance 
of detecting them. The detector media are chosen because 
they’re exquisitely sensitive detectors that can be purified extremely well. These could be a liquid noble gas, germanium and silicon crystals, a refrigerant, or other materials. When radiation interacts, 
it leaves tell-tale signs, such as light or bubbles, which can be picked up by the sensors
inside the detector. The detector media are held 
in a central chamber made of glass or a special type of acrylic. These chambers have to be able 
to hold the substance inside without interacting with it while withstanding incredible pressure 
from the water outside. The inner vessel is surrounded 
by powerful sensors designed to detect even the
tiniest blips of light, or the sound vibrations 
caused by a single bubble. Each sensor records data 24/7, and experiments run for months 
and years at a time, generating terabytes of data every day. Building dark matter detectors 
is as much a feat of engineering as it is a feat of physics. By the time an experiment 
is ready to start collecting data, years or decades of work and investment 
have already gone into it, to the tune of tens 
of millions of dollars. As of 2017, no dark matter particles 
have been directly detected. That’s not entirely surprising. Physicists expect these interactions to be
incredibly rare and difficult to detect. In the meantime, scientists continue 
to develop new technologies and increase detector sensitivity, closing in on where dark matter is hiding. And when they find it, we’ll finally be able to bring the 
universe’s darkest secrets into the light.

of radiation filtering. This shielding ensures that only 
the particles scientists are looking for can make their way into the detectors. Once these particles reach 
an experiment’s inner vessel, scientists have a chance 
of detecting them. The detector media are chosen because 
they’re exquisitely sensitive detectors that can be purified extremely well. These could be a liquid noble gas, germanium and silicon crystals, a refrigerant, or other materials. When radiation interacts, 
it leaves tell-tale signs, such as light or bubbles, which can be picked up by the sensors
inside the detector. The detector media are held 
in a central chamber made of glass or a special type of acrylic. These chambers have to be able 
to hold the substance inside without interacting with it while withstanding incredible pressure 
from the water outside. The inner vessel is surrounded 
by powerful sensors designed to detect even the
tiniest blips of light, or the sound vibrations 
caused by a single bubble. Each sensor records data 24/7, and experiments run for months 
and years at a time, generating terabytes of data every day. Building dark matter detectors 
is as much a feat of engineering as it is a feat of physics. By the time an experiment 
is ready to start collecting data, years or decades of work and investment 
have already gone into it, to the tune of tens 
of millions of dollars. As of 2017, no dark matter particles 
have been directly detected. That’s not entirely surprising. Physicists expect these interactions to be
incredibly rare and difficult to detect. In the meantime, scientists continue 
to develop new technologies and increase detector sensitivity, closing in on where dark matter is hiding. And when they find it, we’ll finally be able to bring the 
universe’s darkest secrets into the light.

**Transcript**:
More than two kilometers below 
the surface of northern Ontario, suspended in 345,000 liters 
of ultra-pure water, there’s a perfect sphere. It contains 3600 kilograms 
of liquid argon, cooled to -180 degrees Celsius. Scientists continuously monitor 
this chamber from above ground, looking for a glimmer 
of light in the darkness. Because down here, deep beneath the Earth’s surface 
and cocooned in a watery shield, that light would indicate the presence of
one of the universe’s greatest mysteries: dark matter. All the matter we can see,
planets, stars and galaxies, doesn’t create enough gravitational pull to explain
the universe’s larger structure. It’s dark matter, which is estimated 
to make up 25% of the known universe. But despite its prevalence, so far we haven’t been able 
to detect it directly. It’s no small challenge. Dark matter was so named because it
doesn’t interact with any type of light, visible or otherwise, which means our usual observation tools simply don’t work 
when trying to observe it. But while dark matter may not be visible 
in the electromagnetic spectrum, it’s still matter, so we should be able to measure 
its interactions with other matter. And if our current model 
of physics is correct, billions of sub-atomic 
dark matter particles are passing through 
the Earth every second. Despite the prevalence of dark matter, its interactions are predicted to be rare 
and extremely weak. To detect these interactions, dark matter experiments need to be
incredibly sensitive. With such sensitive equipment, the ever-present background radiation 
on Earth’s surface would create so much noise in the data that any dark matter particles 
would be completely overwhelmed. It would be like trying to hear
a pin drop on a busy city street. To solve this problem, scientists have had 
to dig deep into the Earth. Dark matter experiments are set up 
in specialized underground labs, either in mines or inside mountains. The rock that makes up 
the Earth’s crust works like a filter, absorbing radiation 
and stopping disruptive particles. The ultra-pure water

**Transcript**:
The oldest glue in the world 
is over 8,000 years old and comes from a cave near the Dead Sea. Ancient people used this glue, made from a mixture of animal bone 
and plant materials, to waterproof baskets 
and construct utensils. And for thousands of years after, plants and animals were the glue 
that held human civilization together. Today, we have enough types of tape and
glue to build and repair almost anything. But what gives glue 
and tape their stickiness? And is one stronger than the other? Adhesives can be made 
from synthetic molecules or natural proteins and carbohydrates like the vegetable starch dextrin, the milk protein casein, and the terpenes in tree resin. In order to work, glue and tape need 
both adhesive bonds and cohesive bonds. Adhesive bonds occur between 
an adhesive’s molecules and the molecules 
of whatever it’s sticking to. Cohesive bonds happen between 
a glue or tape’s own molecules, holding it together. Most glues consist of adhesive polymers 
dissolved in a solvent that prevents them from sticking
to the inside of the bottle. The strong smell of many glues 
comes from the solvent, which evaporates when exposed to air. Some glues use water as a solvent, but others use chemicals 
that can be harmful to inhale. Glues with two or more components that
chemically react instead of just drying can create stronger bonds. Both the adhesive and cohesive bonds 
of glue are strong, but the drying process 
makes them irreversible. This is why, if a glued surface 
is broken after it dries, it can’t be reattached without new glue. By contrast, 
when tape is applied to a surface, it forms weaker, reversible bonds, so you can peel a piece of tape off 
a surface and use it again. These weak bonds, 
called Van der Waals forces, can occur between any two materials, but only if they’re 
extremely close together, closer than the naked eye can see. Tape usually consists of a backing coated 
with a combination of a rubber or rubber-like "stretchy" component, and a compound called a tackifier. That’s the "sticky" component. A tape’s stickiness is determined by the proportion of elastic component 
and tackifier, the thickness of adhesive spread 
onto the backing, and the type of backing material. No chemical reaction occurs 
when tape is pressed onto a surface. Instead, the soft adhesive flows into 
the cracks and grooves of the surface. This ability to slide into cracks and then
stay in place is called viscoelasticity. Once the viscoelastic adhesive fills 
these microscopic crevices, it is close enough to form 
Van der Waals forces. So what’s the world’s strongest adhesive? Well, there’s no one answer. In terms of absolute strength 
of adhesive bonds, glue is stronger than tape, but no single adhesive
works well in all circumstances. Of the glues, cyanoacrylates, 
or super glues, may form the strongest bonds, but two-component epoxy glues have much
higher resistance to heat and shearing, and are compatible 
with a wider range of surfaces. So, if you wanted 
to dangle an anvil in the air, super glue might be your best bet. But if you’re doing so 
over an active volcano, you’d want an epoxy instead. And in order to work at all, glues need enough real estate 
where surfaces touch. If for some reason you wanted 
to make a chain of bowling balls, duct tape would be better. Engineers weigh similar, 
if less absurd, factors all the time. Choosing the right glue to withstand 
the heat inside an engine is a matter of life and death. And though the strength 
of duct tape’s adhesive bonds can’t compete with those of epoxy glues, tape does have the advantage of 
instantaneous stickiness in an emergency. Glue may be necessary 
to get a rocket to space, but when it comes 
to extraterrestrial repairs, stick to duct tape: 
liquid glues don’t work in zero gravity.

**Transcript**:
The oldest glue in the world 
is over 8,000 years old and comes from a cave near the Dead Sea. Ancient people used this glue, made from a mixture of animal bone 
and plant materials, to waterproof baskets 
and construct utensils. And for thousands of years after, plants and animals were the glue 
that held human civilization together. Today, we have enough types of tape and
glue to build and repair almost anything. But what gives glue 
and tape their stickiness? And is one stronger than the other? Adhesives can be made 
from synthetic molecules or natural proteins and carbohydrates like the vegetable starch dextrin, the milk protein casein, and the terpenes in tree resin. In order to work, glue and tape need 
both adhesive bonds and cohesive bonds. Adhesive bonds occur between 
an adhesive’s molecules and the molecules 
of whatever it’s sticking to. Cohesive bonds happen between 
a glue or tape’s own molecules, holding it together. Most glues consist of adhesive polymers 
dissolved in a solvent that prevents them from sticking
to the inside of the bottle. The strong smell of many glues 
comes from the solvent, which evaporates when exposed to air. Some glues use water as a solvent, but others use chemicals 
that can be harmful to inhale. Glues with two or more components that
chemically react instead of just drying can create stronger bonds. Both the adhesive and cohesive bonds 
of glue are strong, but the drying process 
makes them irreversible. This is why, if a glued surface 
is broken after it dries, it can’t be reattached without new glue. By contrast, 
when tape is applied to a surface, it forms weaker, reversible bonds, so you can peel a piece of tape off 
a surface and use it again. These weak bonds, 
called Van der Waals forces, can occur between any two materials, but only if they’re 
extremely close together, closer than the naked eye can see. Tape usually consists of a backing coated 
with a combination of a rubber or rubber-like "stretchy" component, and a compound called a tackifier. That’s the "sticky" component. A tape’s stickiness is determined by the proportion of elastic component 
and tackifier, the thickness of adhesive spread 
onto the backing, and the type of backing material. No chemical reaction occurs 
when tape is pressed onto a surface. Instead, the soft adhesive flows into 
the cracks and grooves of the surface. This ability to slide into cracks and then
stay in place is called viscoelasticity. Once the viscoelastic adhesive fills 
these microscopic crevices, it is close enough to form 
Van der Waals forces. So what’s the world’s strongest adhesive? Well, there’s no one answer. In terms of absolute strength 
of adhesive bonds, glue is stronger than tape, but no single adhesive
works well in all circumstances. Of the glues, cyanoacrylates, 
or super glues, may form the strongest bonds, but two-component epoxy glues have much
higher resistance to heat and shearing, and are compatible 
with a wider range of surfaces. So, if you wanted 
to dangle an anvil in the air, super glue might be your best bet. But if you’re doing so 
over an active volcano, you’d want an epoxy instead. And in order to work at all, glues need enough real estate 
where surfaces touch. If for some reason you wanted 
to make a chain of bowling balls, duct tape would be better. Engineers weigh similar, 
if less absurd, factors all the time. Choosing the right glue to withstand 
the heat inside an engine is a matter of life and death. And though the strength 
of duct tape’s adhesive bonds can’t compete with those of epoxy glues, tape does have the advantage of 
instantaneous stickiness in an emergency. Glue may be necessary 
to get a rocket to space, but when it comes 
to extraterrestrial repairs, stick to duct tape: 
liquid glues don’t work in zero gravity.

**Transcript**:
Touchscreens are everywhere. Not just in smartphones, but in supermarkets,
ATMs, and even airplane seats. And you may have noticed that not all touchscreens
are the same. The old-school touchscreens can be pretty
tough to use -- sometimes it feels more like a push-really-hard-screen instead of a touchscreen. On the other hand, certain smartphones and
computer monitors are really responsive to many different touch patterns. There are lots of different technologies out
there, but they’re all trying to achieve the same goal: sending precise electrical
signals from specific locations on the screen. One of the most widely used types is the resistive
touchscreen, where you have to physically push and bend the screen to make it work. Resistive touchscreens are made of two separate
layers: The top layer is made from a flexible and
transparent material, such as polyethylene, which is a common plastic used to make things
like soda bottles. And the bottom layer is made of something
more rigid, like a sheet of glass. To make the screen work, both of these layers
are thinly coated with some sort of metal compound that conducts electricity, like indium
tin oxide -- which is commonly used because it’s transparent. These layers are also separated by tiny insulating
dots, which /don’t/ conduct electricity, called spacers. They keep the screens apart to make sure there
aren’t any false touch signals. When the screen is on, a small voltage is
applied across the screen in both the horizontal and vertical directions. As soon as you push down on the flexible screen
with anything, like your finger or a stylus, it connects the two layers together. This changes the voltage, and a small processor
connected to the screen can calculate exactly where you pressed in X and Y coordinates. These resistive touchscreens are pretty affordable
and durable. So, they’re useful for things like credit
card readers in grocery stores, where you need to capture touch data of a messy signature
-- over and over again. But they can be a little frustrating to use
if you don’t push hard enough. Plus, they normally can’t understand multiple-touches
at the same time – so they’re no good for two-finger zoom or more complex tasks. That’s why these days, most smartphones
rely on capacitive touchscreens, where your finger becomes a key part of the electronics. There are different kinds of capacitive touchscreens,
and they can vary from device to device. But one basic design is a sheet of glass containing
a grid of hair-thin lines of a conductive metal, like indium tin oxide. The grid lines in one direction are called
the driving lines, which provide a constant electric current. And the lines in the other direction are called
the sensing lines, which detect this electric current. At every point where the sensing lines and
the driving lines cross, there will be a specific electrostatic field, which is registered as
neutral by the processor in your smartphone or computer. But that all changes when something conductive
comes along and touches it -- like your finger. See, the human body has a natural capacitance,
which means our bodies can conduct electric current, and can store electric charge. So when your finger touches the screen, the
charge in the screen is drawn around that point, distorting that electrostatic field. The electricity doesn’t actually /flow/
through your finger. Basically, the electrostatic field feels the
effects of your electric charge and redistributes itself accordingly. Even really small changes are detected by
the processor, which can then interpret the patterns you’re making – whether it’s
a tap or a slide. Because the lines of the grid are so thin,
capacitive touchscreens are super accurate, and some versions can process multiple touches
at a time. But they won’t work if you have gloves on
-- because the cloth isn’t conductive, unless your gloves have those special fingertips
with metal fibers inside. Plus, something like sweat can affect how
electricity is conducted across the screen, because it’s full of salts. It’s all about the materials that can affect
the electrostatic field generated inside your screen. So next time you’re texting on a smartphone
or scrolling through internet forums on a tablet, just remember: you’re actually a
part of the electronics making it work. Thank you for watching this episode of SciShow,

at the same time – so they’re no good for two-finger zoom or more complex tasks. That’s why these days, most smartphones
rely on capacitive touchscreens, where your finger becomes a key part of the electronics. There are different kinds of capacitive touchscreens,
and they can vary from device to device. But one basic design is a sheet of glass containing
a grid of hair-thin lines of a conductive metal, like indium tin oxide. The grid lines in one direction are called
the driving lines, which provide a constant electric current. And the lines in the other direction are called
the sensing lines, which detect this electric current. At every point where the sensing lines and
the driving lines cross, there will be a specific electrostatic field, which is registered as
neutral by the processor in your smartphone or computer. But that all changes when something conductive
comes along and touches it -- like your finger. See, the human body has a natural capacitance,
which means our bodies can conduct electric current, and can store electric charge. So when your finger touches the screen, the
charge in the screen is drawn around that point, distorting that electrostatic field. The electricity doesn’t actually /flow/
through your finger. Basically, the electrostatic field feels the
effects of your electric charge and redistributes itself accordingly. Even really small changes are detected by
the processor, which can then interpret the patterns you’re making – whether it’s
a tap or a slide. Because the lines of the grid are so thin,
capacitive touchscreens are super accurate, and some versions can process multiple touches
at a time. But they won’t work if you have gloves on
-- because the cloth isn’t conductive, unless your gloves have those special fingertips
with metal fibers inside. Plus, something like sweat can affect how
electricity is conducted across the screen, because it’s full of salts. It’s all about the materials that can affect
the electrostatic field generated inside your screen. So next time you’re texting on a smartphone
or scrolling through internet forums on a tablet, just remember: you’re actually a
part of the electronics making it work. Thank you for watching this episode of SciShow,

**Transcript**:
On a beautiful day, just a few years ago my wife and I entered a hospital near our home in Oakland, California for the birth of our first daughter, Maya. We had responsibly toured
the birthing center in advance and yet we were somehow
still startled to find ourselves in the place where we would experience one of the most significant
moments of our lives. We were stuck in a windowless room with no hint of the bright
and sunny day that we had left. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, the paint on the walls was beige and machines beeped inexplicably as a wall clock indicated
day turning to night. That clock was placed above a door in direct line of sight to where my wife lay as her contractions
increased hour after hour. Now, I've never given birth -- (Laughter) but she assured me that the last thing
that a birthing woman would ever want is to watch the seconds tick by. (Laughter) An architect by training,
I've always been fascinated watching people experience design
in the world around them. I believe design functions
like the soundtrack that we're not even
fully aware is playing. It sends us subconscious messages
about how to feel and what to expect. That room that we were in
seemed completely misaligned with the moment
that we were experiencing -- welcoming a human being, our daughter, into this world. At one point a nurse, without any prompt, turned to us and said, "I always think to myself, 'I wish I had become an architect, because I could have designed
rooms like this better.'" I said to her, "An architect did design this room." (Laughter) Despite the immense joy
of our daughter's birth, the messages of that hospital room
stick with she and I to this day. Those messages are, "You are not at home, you are in a foreign place." "You are not in control of anything. Not even the lighting." "Your comfort, simply, is secondary." At best, a hospital room like this might just be described
or dismissed as uninspiring. At worst, it is undignifying. And I use it to point out that none of us, anywhere in the world, are immune from bad design. I went into architecture
because I believed it was about creating spaces for people
to live their best lives. And yet what I found
is a profession largely disconnected from the people most directly
impacted by its work. I believe this is because
architecture remains a white, male, elitist profession -- seemingly unconcerned with some of the greatest
needs in the world or even the relatively simple needs
of an expectant mother. Students are trained in school using highly theoretical projects, rarely interacting with real people
or actual communities. Graduates are funneled
through a long, narrow unforgiving path to licensure. Meanwhile, the profession
holds up a select few through relentless award programs focused almost exclusively
on the aesthetics of buildings, rather than the societal impact
or contributions of them. It only goes to reinforce a warped view of professional responsibility and success and yet this isn't
why so many young, hopeful people go into architecture. It's not why I did. I believed then, though I didn't
have a language for it, and I know now, that design
has a unique ability to dignify. It can make people feel valued, respected, honored and seen. Now I'd like for you to just think
about some of the spaces that you inhabit. And I'd like to have you think
about how they make you feel. Now, there are places
that make us feel unhappy, unhealthy or uninspiring. They may be the places that you work or where you heal or even where you live. And I ask, how might these places
be better designed with you in mind? It's a really simple question and it can somehow, sometimes
be very difficult to answer. Because we are conditioned
to feel like we don't have much agency over the spaces and places
that we live, work and play. And in many cases we don't. But we all should. Now, here's a potentially dumb question
for any women watching: Have you ever stood in a disproportionately long
bathroom line? (Laughter) Did you ever think to yourself,
"What is wrong with this picture?" Well, what if the real question is, "What is wrong with the men
that designed these bathrooms?" (Applause) It may seem like a small thing, but it's representative
of a much more serious issue. The contemporary world
was literally built by men who have rarely
taken the time to understand how people unlike them experience their designs. A long bathroom line
might seem like a minor indignity. But the opposite can also be true. Thoughtful design
can make people feel respected and seen. I've come to believe
that dignity is to design what justice is to law and health is to medicine. In the simplest of terms, it's about having the spaces you inhabit
reflect back your value. Over the past two years I had the opportunity to interview
over 100 people from all walks of life about their experience of design. I wanted to test my hunch that dignity and design
are uniquely related. I listened to Gregory, a resident of this cottage community designed specifically for the 50 most chronically
homeless people in Dallas. Gregory had been living on the streets, drifting from town to town
for over 30 years. A broad coalition of social service agencies, funders and designers, created this place. Each 400 square foot cottage
is designed beautifully as a permanent home. Gregory now has a key to a door to his own house. He describes the sense
of security that it brings him. Something he had lived without
for three decades. When he arrived with little more
than the clothes on his back, he found everything: from a toaster, Crock-Pot and stove to a toothbrush and toothpaste
awaiting for him. He describes it simply as heaven. On the other side of the world, I listened to Antoinette, the director of this
training and community center for women in rural Rwanda. Hundreds of women
come to this place daily -- to learn new skills, be in community, and continue rebuilding their lives following the country's civil war. These women literally pressed the 500,000 bricks that make up the 17
classroom pavilions like this one. Antoinette told me, "Everyone is so proud of it." And then back here in the US I listened to Monika, the director of a free clinic primarily serving
the uninsured in Arkansas. Monika loves telling me that the doctors, who volunteer at her free clinic routinely tell her that they've never worked
in such a beautiful, light-filled place. Monika believes that even people experiencing poverty deserve quality health care. And what's more, she believes they deserve
to receive that care in a dignified setting. People like these are invaluable
ambassadors for design and yet they are roundly absent
from architectural discourse. Similarly, the people who can
most benefit from good design often have the least access to it. Your cousin, a homeless veteran; your grandma or grandpa who live in a house with a kitchen
that's no longer accessible to them; your wheelchair-bound sister in a suburban area
planned without sidewalks. If good design
is only for a privileged few, what good is it? It's time designers change this by dedicating their practices
to the public good in the model of firms like Orkidstudio, Studio Gang and MASS Design Group. Their clients are orphaned children in Kenya, foster children in Chicago and pregnant women in Malawi. Their practices are premised on the belief that everyone deserves good design. Dedicating more practices
to the public good will not only create
more design that is dignifying, but it will also
dignify the practice of design. It will not only diversify
the client base of design, but it will also create new,
more diverse forms of design for the world. Now, in order to do this, my architecture and design friends,
especially my fellow white guys, we must simultaneously
and significantly diversify our ranks. If we want the public to believe
that design is for them and for everyone. Today, barely 15 percent of registered architects
in the United States are women. And a far smaller percentage
are persons of color. Other professions, like law and medicine had made far greater strides
in these crucial areas. How might our shared built environment -- our homes, our hospitals,
our schools, our public spaces -- be shaped differently if women and people of color were behind half
of the proverbial blueprints? It is not a question of whether, but to what extent our buildings, our landscapes, our cities and our rural communities are less beautiful, less functional, less equitable and less dignifying because women and people of color
are less likely to be creating them. As Winston Churchill
famously noted in 1943 when he called for the rebuilding of London's war-damaged
parliamentary chambers, "We shape our buildings,
and afterward, they shape us." The good news is
that we can change how we build and who we build for. Be that a health worker in rural Rwanda, or a birthing mother and nervous
new father in the United States. We can do this
by recommitting architecture to the health, safety
and welfare of the public. This will pay dividends. Because once you see what design can do, you can't unsee it. And once you experience dignity, you can't accept anything less. Both become part of your possible. One of my favorite conversation partners
is my 90-year-old grandmother, Audrey Gorwitz, from Oshkosh, Wisconsin. After one of our
conversations about design, she wrote me a letter. She said, "Dear Johnny, I thought the other day,
as I sat in my doctor's office, how depressing it was, from the color on the wall,
to the carpet on the floor. (Laughter) Now I will have to call to see who is responsible
for the drabness in that place." (Laughter) In the same letter, mind you, she said, "I did call, and I got the man in charge, and he said he appreciated
someone calling him. My doctor's office
is now on the list for an upgrade." (Laughter) She signed it by saying, "It is always good
to express one's opinion if done in a proper manner." (Laughter) (Applause) I love my grandma. (Laughter) Like my grandma Audrey, you deserve good design. Because well-designed spaces are not just a matter of taste
or a questions of aesthetics. They literally shape our ideas
about who we are in the world and what we deserve. That is the essence of dignity. And both the opportunity
and the responsibility of design for good and for all. Thank you. (Applause)

and smaller numbers gives you bigger and bigger answers. Ten divided by two is five, by one is ten, by one-millionth is 10 million, and so on. So it seems like if you divide by numbers that keep shrinking 
all the way down to zero, the answer will grow 
to the largest thing possible. Then, isn’t the answer to 10 
divided by zero actually infinity? That may sound plausible. But all we really know is 
that if we divide 10 by a number that tends towards zero, the answer tends towards infinity. And that’s not the same thing as
saying that 10 divided by zero is equal to infinity. Why not? Well, let’s take a closer look 
at what division really means. Ten divided by two could mean, "How many times must 
we add two together to make 10,” or, “two times what equals 10?” Dividing by a number is essentially 
the reverse of multiplying by it, in the following way: if we multiply any number 
by a given number x, we can ask if there’s a new number 
we can multiply by afterwards to get back to where we started. If there is, the new number is called 
the multiplicative inverse of x. For example, if you multiply 
three by two to get six, you can then multiply 
by one-half to get back to three. So the multiplicative inverse 
of two is one-half, and the multiplicative inverse 
of 10 is one-tenth. As you might notice, the product of any
number and its multiplicative inverse is always one. If we want to divide by zero, we need to find 
its multiplicative inverse, which should be one over zero. This would have to be such a number that
multiplying it by zero would give one. But because anything multiplied
by zero is still zero, such a number is impossible, so zero has no multiplicative inverse. Does that really settle things, though? After all, mathematicians 
have broken rules before. For example, for a long time, there was no such thing as taking 
the square root of negative numbers. But then mathematicians defined 
the square root of negative one as a new number called i, opening up a whole new
mathematical world of complex numbers. So if they can do that, couldn’t we just make up a new rule, say, that the symbol infinity 
means one over zero, and see what happens? Let's try it, imagining we don’t know 
anything about infinity already. Based on the definition 
of a multiplicative inverse, zero times infinity must be equal to one. That means zero times infinity plus
zero times infinity should equal two. Now, by the distributive property, the left side of the equation 
can be rearranged to zero plus zero times infinity. And since zero plus zero 
is definitely zero, that reduces down to zero times infinity. Unfortunately, we’ve already defined 
this as equal to one, while the other side of the equation 
is still telling us it’s equal to two. So, one equals two. Oddly enough, 
that's not necessarily wrong; it's just not true 
in our normal world of numbers. There’s still a way it could
be mathematically valid, if one, two, and every other number 
were equal to zero. But having infinity equal to zero is ultimately not all that useful 
to mathematicians, or anyone else. There actually is something called 
the Riemann sphere that involves dividing by zero 
by a different method, but that’s a story for another day. In the meantime, dividing by zero 
in the most obvious way doesn’t work out so great. But that shouldn’t stop us 
from living dangerously and experimenting 
with breaking mathematical rules to see if we can invent 
fun, new worlds to explore.

**Transcript**:
In the world of math, many strange results are possible 
when we change the rules. But there’s one rule that most of us 
have been warned not to break: don’t divide by zero. How can the simple combination 
of an everyday number and a basic operation 
cause such problems? Normally, dividing by smaller 
and smaller numbers gives you bigger and bigger answers. Ten divided by two is five, by one is ten, by one-millionth is 10 million, and so on. So it seems like if you divide by numbers that keep shrinking 
all the way down to zero, the answer will grow 
to the largest thing possible. Then, isn’t the answer to 10 
divided by zero actually infinity? That may sound plausible. But all we really know is 
that if we divide 10 by a number that tends towards zero, the answer tends towards infinity. And that’s not the same thing as
saying that 10 divided by zero is equal to infinity. Why not? Well, let’s take a closer look 
at what division really means. Ten divided by two could mean, "How many times must 
we add two together to make 10,” or, “two times what equals 10?” Dividing by a number is essentially 
the reverse of multiplying by it, in the following way: if we multiply any number 
by a given number x, we can ask if there’s a new number 
we can multiply by afterwards to get back to where we started. If there is, the new number is called 
the multiplicative inverse of x. For example, if you multiply 
three by two to get six, you can then multiply 
by one-half to get back to three. So the multiplicative inverse 
of two is one-half, and the multiplicative inverse 
of 10 is one-tenth. As you might notice, the product of any
number and its multiplicative inverse is always one. If we want to divide by zero, we need to find 
its multiplicative inverse, which should be one over zero. This would have to be such a number that
multiplying it by zero would give one. But because anything multiplied
by zero is still zero, such a number is impossible, so zero has no multiplicative inverse. Does that really settle things, though? After all, mathematicians 
have broken rules before. For example, for a long time, there was no such thing as taking 
the square root of negative numbers. But then mathematicians defined 
the square root of negative one as a new number called i, opening up a whole new
mathematical world of complex numbers. So if they can do that, couldn’t we just make up a new rule, say, that the symbol infinity 
means one over zero, and see what happens? Let's try it, imagining we don’t know 
anything about infinity already. Based on the definition 
of a multiplicative inverse, zero times infinity must be equal to one. That means zero times infinity plus
zero times infinity should equal two. Now, by the distributive property, the left side of the equation 
can be rearranged to zero plus zero times infinity. And since zero plus zero 
is definitely zero, that reduces down to zero times infinity. Unfortunately, we’ve already defined 
this as equal to one, while the other side of the equation 
is still telling us it’s equal to two. So, one equals two. Oddly enough, 
that's not necessarily wrong; it's just not true 
in our normal world of numbers. There’s still a way it could
be mathematically valid, if one, two, and every other number 
were equal to zero. But having infinity equal to zero is ultimately not all that useful 
to mathematicians, or anyone else. There actually is something called 
the Riemann sphere that involves dividing by zero 
by a different method, but that’s a story for another day. In the meantime, dividing by zero 
in the most obvious way doesn’t work out so great. But that shouldn’t stop us 
from living dangerously and experimenting

**Transcript**:
Never before in history, have there been so many people on Earth as right now. Our numbers have skyrocketed, from 1 billion in 1800, to 2.3 billion in 1940, 3.7 billion in 1970, and 7.4 billion in 2016. The world population increased fourfold in the last century, so what can we expect for the next century? And what does population growth mean for our future? Will there be mass-migration? Overcrowded slums and megacities covering continents? Diseases and pollution? Chaos and violence over energy, water, and food? And a human species focused only on sustaining itself? Will population growth destroy our way of life? Or is this prophecy just ungrounded panic? In the 1960s population growth reached an unprecedented rate. Which lead to apocalyptic prophecies. The poor would pro-create endlessly and overrun the developed world. The legend of overpopulation was born. But it turns out high birth rates and the population explosion are not permanent features of some cultures or countries, But rather a part of a four step process the whole world is going through, The demographic transition. Most developed countries have already made the transition, while other countries are doing it right now. Let's go back to the 18th century, when the entire world, including Europe, was in the first stage of the demographic transition. By today's standards, Europe was worse off, than a developing region, suffering from poor sanitation, poor diets, and poor medicine. A lot of people were born, but lots of them died just as fast, so the population hardly grew. Women had between 4 and 6 children, but only 2 of them would reach adulthood. Then the industrial revolution happened in the UK and bought the greatest change in human living conditions since the agricultural revolution. People went from being peasants to workers. Manufactured goods were mass produced and became widely available. The sciences flourished and advanced transportation, communication, and medicine. The role of women in society shifted and created the conditions for their emancipation. Slowly this economic progress not only formed a middle class, but also raised standards of living and health care for the poor working population. The second transition stage started. Better food supplies, hygiene and medicine, meant people stopped dying all the time, especially so, at a very young age. The result was a population explosion. Doubling the UK's population between 1750 and 1850. The main reasons families used to have lots of children was that only a few of them were likely to survive. Now that had changed, so the third stage of transition was set in motion. Fewer babies were conceived, and population growth slowed down. Eventually a balance emerged, fewer people were dying and fewer children were born, so the death rate and birth rate became stable. Britain had reached the fourth stage of the demographic transition. This didn't only happen in the UK, more and more countries went through the four stages. First, many births and many deaths due to bad living conditions. Second, better living conditions leading to fewer deaths and a population explosion. Third, fewer deaths resulting in fewer births, and population growth came to an end. But if birth rates have dropped so much, why is the population still growing so fast? Well, the children born in the population explosion of the 70s and 80s are having kids themselves now. Leading to a noticeable spike in overall population. But they are having far fewer children on average than their parents. The average today is 2.5, it was 5, 40 years ago. So as this generation gets older, and fertility declines further, the rate of population growth will keep on slowing. This is true for every country. In the west, we tend to overlook progress in other regions of the world. But actually most of the world's countries have made it to the fourth stage. Just look at Bangladesh. In 1971, the average woman had 7 kids, but 25% of them would die before the age of 5. In 2015, the mortality rate was down to 3.8% and women had only 2.2 kids on average. This is the rule, not an exception, we're not special, we just had a head start. It took developed countries about 80 years to reduce fertility from more than 6 children, to less than 3. Others are catching up fast. Malaysia and South Africa did it in only 34 years; Bangladesh took just 20. Iran managed it in 10 years. All these countries that are catching up didn't have to start from scratch and the more support they get, the faster they catch up. This is why programs that help lower child mortality or help poor nations develop, are so important, No matter what your motivation is, whether you dream of a world where all people live in freedom and wealth, or you just want fewer refugees coming into your country, The simple truth is, that it's beneficial to you personally if people on the other side of the globe can live a good life. And we are getting there, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty has never been as low as today. So the future of global population growth is not an apocalyptic prophecy, it's a promise! Population growth will come to an end. The UN forecasts that the 12th billionth human will never be born at all. And as the development level of the world rises, the number of people a higher education will increase tenfold. Countries who used to be a need, will help advance development instead. More people is going to mean more people able to advance our species.

**Transcript**:
Human society is extremely
complex and fragile, built upon various pillars. One of them is the honey bee. One out of three meals eaten by humans
is made possible by honey bees. They are so important that if all the
honey bees were to die out, thousands of plants would follow, which could lead to millions of people
starving in the following years. On top of that, honey bees have
a huge economic impact. The dollar value of plants
pollinated by them each year is around $265 billion. Food we take for granted would just
stop existing without them, or there would be a massive
decrease in productivity. Food including apples, onions, pumpkins,
and also plants used for feeding livestock and thus extremely important
for our milk and meat. Einstein is often quoted as having said, “If honey bees die out, humans
will follow a few years later.” Actually, he probably didn’t say that, but there might be some
truth in the statement. It’s unsettling, but honey bees
have started to disappear. Millions of hives have died
in the last few years. Beekeepers all over the world have seen an
annual loss of 30–90% of their colonies. In the US alone, bees
are steadily declining. >From 5 million hives in 1988
to 2.5 million today. Since 2006, a phenomenon called
“colony collapse disorder” has affected honey bees in many countries. And we’re not entirely sure
what’s causing it. All we know is that it’s pretty serious. Over the last few decades bees have seen
an invasion of very dangerous foes. Parasites straight out of a horror movie,
like Acarapis woodi, microscopic mites that infect the tracheae
(that’s the breathing tubes) of bees. Here, they lay their eggs and feed from
the fluids of their victims, weakening them considerably and spending
their whole life inside the bees. Or Varroa destructor, a fitting name
because they can only reproduce in honey bee hives and are one of
the bees’ greatest enemies. The female mite enters a honey bee brood
cell and lays eggs on the bee larva before it’s about to pupate and before the hive bees cover the
cell with a wax capping. The eggs hatch and the young mites and
their mother feed on the developing bee in the safety of the capped cell. The bee is not normally killed
at this stage, just weakened, so it still has enough strength to chew
its way through the wax capping and release itself from the cell. As it does, it releases the mother mite
and her new offspring from the cell, and these are free to
spread across the hive, starting the process over again
in a cycle of about 10 days. Their numbers grow exponentially,
and after a few months, this can lead to the collapse
of the entire bee hive. Once outside of the cell, adult mites
also suck the bodily fludis of bees and weaken them considerably. To make things worse, they also transmit
viruses that harm the bees even more and can lead to birth defects
like useless wings. But there are other threats too,
such as viruses and fungi. Under normal circumstances, these
phenomena should be manageable and are not enough to explain the horrendous amount of
dying going on in bees. Over recent years new insecticides
have been introduced that are deadly to bees. Neonicotinoids, a chemical family
similar to nicotine, was approved in the early 1990s
as an alternative to chemicals like DDT. They attack insects by harming
their nervous systems. Today, they are the most widely
used insecticides in the world. Globally, they saw sales
of €1.5 billion in 2008, representing 24% of the global
market for insecticides. In 2013, neonicotinoids were used in the
US on about 95% of corn and canola crops, and also on the vast majority
of fruit and vegetables, like apples, cherries, peaches, oranges,
berries, leafy greens, tomatoes, potatoes, cereal grains, rice, nuts,
grapes, and many more. Bees come into contact with the toxin while collecting pollen or
via contaminated water, often bringing material into the hive, where it can accumulate and
slowly kill the whole colony. The toxins harm bees in a
variety of horrible ways. In high enough doses, it quickly leads
to convulsions, paralysis, and death. But even in small doses, it can be fatal. It may lead to bees forgetting
how to navigate the world, so bees fly into the wild, get lost, and
die alone, separated from their hives. If this happens often enough, a hive
can lose its ability to sustain itself. We know that neonicotinoids
are harmful to bees and that we urgently need
an alternative to it, but there are billions of dollars
to be made in delaying this. Studies sponsored by the chemical
industry magically appear to prove a much lower toxicity to bees, compared to
those produced by independent scientists. There are even more factors
contributing to the demise of bees, like too much genetic uniformity,
crop monocultures, poor nutrition due to overcrowding,
stress because of human activities, and other pesticides. Each of those factors on its own is
a major problem for bees, but together, they probably account
for colony collapse disorder. With parasites upping their
game in recent decades, the honey bees are now
fighting for survival. It would be a catastrophe
if they lost this fight. This is a conundrum we have to solve
if we want to continue living with a relative abundance
and diversity of food. Humanity is deeply interconnected with
Earth and the other lifeforms on it, even if we pretend that we’re not. We have to take better care
of our surroundings, if not to preserve the beauty of nature,
then at least to ensure our own survival. This video is supported by the

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Human society is extremely
complex and fragile, built upon various pillars. One of them is the honey bee. One out of three meals eaten by humans
is made possible by honey bees. They are so important that if all the
honey bees were to die out, thousands of plants would follow, which could lead to millions of people
starving in the following years. On top of that, honey bees have
a huge economic impact. The dollar value of plants
pollinated by them each year is around $265 billion. Food we take for granted would just
stop existing without them, or there would be a massive
decrease in productivity. Food including apples, onions, pumpkins,
and also plants used for feeding livestock and thus extremely important
for our milk and meat. Einstein is often quoted as having said, “If honey bees die out, humans
will follow a few years later.” Actually, he probably didn’t say that, but there might be some
truth in the statement. It’s unsettling, but honey bees
have started to disappear. Millions of hives have died
in the last few years. Beekeepers all over the world have seen an
annual loss of 30–90% of their colonies. In the US alone, bees
are steadily declining. >From 5 million hives in 1988
to 2.5 million today. Since 2006, a phenomenon called
“colony collapse disorder” has affected honey bees in many countries. And we’re not entirely sure
what’s causing it. All we know is that it’s pretty serious. Over the last few decades bees have seen
an invasion of very dangerous foes. Parasites straight out of a horror movie,
like Acarapis woodi, microscopic mites that infect the tracheae
(that’s the breathing tubes) of bees. Here, they lay their eggs and feed from
the fluids of their victims, weakening them considerably and spending
their whole life inside the bees. Or Varroa destructor, a fitting name
because they can only reproduce in honey bee hives and are one of
the bees’ greatest enemies. The female mite enters a honey bee brood
cell and lays eggs on the bee larva before it’s about to pupate and before the hive bees cover the
cell with a wax capping. The eggs hatch and the young mites and
their mother feed on the developing bee in the safety of the capped cell. The bee is not normally killed
at this stage, just weakened, so it still has enough strength to chew
its way through the wax capping and release itself from the cell. As it does, it releases the mother mite
and her new offspring from the cell, and these are free to
spread across the hive, starting the process over again
in a cycle of about 10 days. Their numbers grow exponentially,
and after a few months, this can lead to the collapse
of the entire bee hive. Once outside of the cell, adult mites
also suck the bodily fludis of bees and weaken them considerably. To make things worse, they also transmit
viruses that harm the bees even more and can lead to birth defects
like useless wings. But there are other threats too,
such as viruses and fungi. Under normal circumstances, these
phenomena should be manageable and are not enough to explain the horrendous amount of
dying going on in bees. Over recent years new insecticides
have been introduced that are deadly to bees. Neonicotinoids, a chemical family
similar to nicotine, was approved in the early 1990s
as an alternative to chemicals like DDT. They attack insects by harming
their nervous systems. Today, they are the most widely
used insecticides in the world. Globally, they saw sales
of €1.5 billion in 2008, representing 24% of the global
market for insecticides. In 2013, neonicotinoids were used in the
US on about 95% of corn and canola crops, and also on the vast majority
of fruit and vegetables, like apples, cherries, peaches, oranges,
berries, leafy greens, tomatoes, potatoes, cereal grains, rice, nuts,
grapes, and many more. Bees come into contact with the toxin while collecting pollen or
via contaminated water, often bringing material into the hive, where it can accumulate and
slowly kill the whole colony. The toxins harm bees in a
variety of horrible ways. In high enough doses, it quickly leads
to convulsions, paralysis, and death. But even in small doses, it can be fatal. It may lead to bees forgetting
how to navigate the world, so bees fly into the wild, get lost, and
die alone, separated from their hives. If this happens often enough, a hive
can lose its ability to sustain itself. We know that neonicotinoids
are harmful to bees and that we urgently need
an alternative to it, but there are billions of dollars
to be made in delaying this. Studies sponsored by the chemical

Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. You won't believe your eyes. You've heard this before right? It's usually like a click bait title to get you to watch an internet video or read a stupid article. But are there cases when you actually can't believe your eyes? Make this video as large as you can on the screen that you're watching and we're gonna do an experiment. Put your head at a set distance from the screen and look at this photo. It's a lighthouse on top of an island but I've inverted the colors. I want you to focus your eyes right on the tip of that lighthouse and don't move them. I'm gonna be quiet now and I'm gonna let you transport your mind to this island off the coast of Tasmania. [ seagulls ] OK I'm about to invert the picture back but I want you to stay focused on that lighthouse. Are you ready? Here we go. Out of the corner of your eye you should see a pale blue sky and a deep royal blue sea with little light green grass spots on the island. Now, take your eyes and move it to the edge of the island. You see that? There is no color in this picture. It's a black and white image. Your brain just made up color that wasn't there. Can you believe your eyes? By the way, just in case you're curious this is what the original image looked like. OK, so I just showed you a black and white image and for some reason your brain saw something like this. What is happening? Is that something going on with your eye? Or is that your brain? For all we know it might be the optic nerve connecting the two. Let's investigate a little bit further. A couple of years ago I saw this video on the internet and at first it just looks like a neat little light toy. But my mind saw something way different. I realized for the first time that I literally could not believe my eyes. Not that I didn't understand what was happening, but I knew that what I was seeing didn't actually exist. As soon as I saw this video it was very clear to me that the dude that made this was a genius. The bad news is though, he lives hundreds of miles away in the desert. So I'm in a kind of a sleazy hotel and uh, I don't want to say sleazy. Have you ever seen somebody do something really cool on the internet and you wanted to meet them? Well that's kinda what happened here. This is Greg. - Hello - And Greg has a pretty interesting gadget that you made? Is that what we're gonna call it? - That's what we're gonna call it. The device. - Did you design this PCB? - I did. - Did you populate it? - I did. That's a lot of small chips on there, but.. - You're a geek man. - Yeah I know. [laughs] It gets easier. - How long did it take to populate the board? - It takes about an hour and a half. - You did that whole thing in an hour and a half? - Yeah. - Yeah but can you change a water pump on a 1990 Chevrolet pickup? - [laughs] - So those are LEDs right? - Yeah they're red green blue RGB LEDs. - That's pretty cool. Now how are you controlling that? - So these LEDs are mounted on a circuit board that's mounted on a DC motor. And if I apply power to the DC motor, it spins. And if I time it just right, I can essentially light up any LED anywhere on the circle that I want, as we can see here. - So you just created these bitmaps and then uploaded them through some software that you wrote? - Yep, so this is a 63 by 63 pixel bitmap, and essentially I take that and there's actually an infrared sensor on the display that can receive data. - Oh look at that. Smarter Every Day. Little homage. So how did you do that? Did you upload that, or.. You did that today didn't you. - Yes actually I just created that image right before driving out to meet you. - This is pretty amazing. So ok, here's the deal. I asked you about this because I wanted to do this. I wanted to use this high speed camera to look at what you've got here. This is a Phantom Miro that we're using here. This is a Miro 320S, and we're gonna setup.. What's your update rate on the microcontroller? - Um it's pretty fast. It's spinning at about 25 revolutions every second. - Ahuh. - And within those it updates 256 times. So we're looking at about a 200 microsecond rate that the LEDs get updated. - OK so a thousand frames per second is not fast enough, is what you're telling me. - No. - OK. Alright, well let's figure out what frame rate we need to hit in order to understand what's going on here. - Alright. - What do we call these? Are these pixels? Cause it's not really like a square thing like cartesians, it's kinda like an arc.. - Right, it's kind of like an arc pixel. - OK, so what do you call that? - An arxel. - Arxel.. like it. We're gonna go with that. How far does the LED bar travel for each individual arxel as you call it? - It's about one and a half degrees. - If it's only going one to two degrees, then why is my brain still seeing that light the whole time it's around? Because it's only one 360th of the sweep, but the rest of it's dark. According to the high speed camera, which I had to crank up to 5500 frames per second, this is what's actually happening. Check it out. Those's dots, or the arxels as Greg likes to call them are kind of flipping around all over the place. Most of the image is dead space. So why is your brain making that image? To understand why the brain sees something that's not there I found a guy that studies this sort of thing that's published over 130 different papers on similar topics. OK I'm on a pretty bad Skype connection with Dr Stuart Anstis who is a genius at the University of California San Diego and what do you study Dr Anstis? - [british accent] I study visual perception, in particular visual illusions which tell us about the normal processes of vision, how the eyes send information to the brain. - That's fantastic. And obviously your accent makes it very clear that you know exactly what you're talking about because I would expect nothing less from a person who studies visual perception. So I want to understand why my eyeball is seeing something where I know there is not light. Why am I seeing that? - It's because of persistence of vision, which means the eye averages what it sees over a short period of time. It's analogous to a camera where you have a long exposure time, and this will give you more light coming in, greater sensitivity, but you have a more sluggish response. So anything moving gets blurred out. - What is the difference in time from the moment the LED is illuminated until my eye registers that the light is there? There has to be a delay time there. What is that? - That delay time varies enormously, over a ten-fold range, anything from 10 to 100 milliseconds. - According to Dr Anstis there's two things going on, and let's look at it. Let's pretend that we have a flashing LED and we want to look at the brain's response to that LED. First of all he said there's a delay, so when the LED first comes on, our brain's not going to immediately see vision, it's gonna take some finite amount of time later. Secondly he said that the eye averages what it sees over a short period of time. Think about that. If we have a moving average, that means that our vision has some sort of inertia to it. It works like this. As the average comes along and is exposed to that LED flash, it starts to ramp up. As the light goes away, that moving average starts to ramp back down. As the light comes back that average starts to go up again, and instead of having gaps that are complete darkness, we have this nice trough in the bottom. Therefore we have a persistence of vision even though there is no light to see at that point in time. Let's look back at that slo mo image from before with all the blinking LEDs. Now, let's add this time average of light and see what the image looks like. Check it out. How cool is that? It looks just like what our eyes see. At what rate would you expect that I would quit seeing a uniform image but I would start to see like a tail dragging across the screen? - Well if the average time is less than one revolution then you're going to see a gap. But supposing as you say, the propellor goes around in 1/25th of a second, that's 40 milliseconds. - I get it now. Do you understand? Think about it. Greg's wheel is rotating at 25 frames per second, and that has to do with the moving time average of the human eye. That's why this video is at least 25, it's actually 30 frames per second. If it wasn't, you would see flickering of the image. So what seems like an imperfection in our eye is actually what smooths things out and makes the world work smoothly for us. That's pretty awesome. If the people watching this video were students in your class what would you want them to know about Greg's wheel and the persistence of vision? - [laughs] Well I would say every system has got a limited time resolution The eye has an engineering problem of trading time resolution against sensitivity to light. And in fact it's got sort of knobs inside which can change that trade-off relationship automatically. The eye is in many ways much cleverer than the camera. It's a beautiful piece of engineering. - Well thank you very much sir, I really appreciate your time. - Thank you. I hope you enjoyed this, feel free to subscribe, if not, no big deal. Hope you're getting Smarter Every Day Have a good one. OK is there any truth to the rumor that you actually proposed using one of these? - There is some truth. [laughs] As I was finishing up the project I thought to myself, Hey it'd be pretty cool if I could like write messages on here so I decided that's how I wanted to propose.

It's a lighthouse on top of an island but I've inverted the colors. I want you to focus your eyes right on the tip of that lighthouse and don't move them. I'm gonna be quiet now and I'm gonna let you transport your mind to this island off the coast of Tasmania. [ seagulls ] OK I'm about to invert the picture back but I want you to stay focused on that lighthouse. Are you ready? Here we go. Out of the corner of your eye you should see a pale blue sky and a deep royal blue sea with little light green grass spots on the island. Now, take your eyes and move it to the edge of the island. You see that? There is no color in this picture. It's a black and white image. Your brain just made up color that wasn't there. Can you believe your eyes? By the way, just in case you're curious this is what the original image looked like. OK, so I just showed you a black and white image and for some reason your brain saw something like this. What is happening? Is that something going on with your eye? Or is that your brain? For all we know it might be the optic nerve connecting the two. Let's investigate a little bit further. A couple of years ago I saw this video on the internet and at first it just looks like a neat little light toy. But my mind saw something way different. I realized for the first time that I literally could not believe my eyes. Not that I didn't understand what was happening, but I knew that what I was seeing didn't actually exist. As soon as I saw this video it was very clear to me that the dude that made this was a genius. The bad news is though, he lives hundreds of miles away in the desert. So I'm in a kind of a sleazy hotel and uh, I don't want to say sleazy. Have you ever seen somebody do something really cool on the internet and you wanted to meet them? Well that's kinda what happened here. This is Greg. - Hello - And Greg has a pretty interesting gadget that you made? Is that what we're gonna call it? - That's what we're gonna call it. The device. - Did you design this PCB? - I did. - Did you populate it? - I did. That's a lot of small chips on there, but.. - You're a geek man. - Yeah I know. [laughs] It gets easier. - How long did it take to populate the board? - It takes about an hour and a half. - You did that whole thing in an hour and a half? - Yeah. - Yeah but can you change a water pump on a 1990 Chevrolet pickup? - [laughs] - So those are LEDs right? - Yeah they're red green blue RGB LEDs. - That's pretty cool. Now how are you controlling that? - So these LEDs are mounted on a circuit board that's mounted on a DC motor. And if I apply power to the DC motor, it spins. And if I time it just right, I can essentially light up any LED anywhere on the circle that I want, as we can see here. - So you just created these bitmaps and then uploaded them through some software that you wrote? - Yep, so this is a 63 by 63 pixel bitmap, and essentially I take that and there's actually an infrared sensor on the display that can receive data. - Oh look at that. Smarter Every Day. Little homage. So how did you do that? Did you upload that, or.. You did that today didn't you. - Yes actually I just created that image right before driving out to meet you. - This is pretty amazing. So ok, here's the deal. I asked you about this because I wanted to do this. I wanted to use this high speed camera to look at what you've got here. This is a Phantom Miro that we're using here. This is a Miro 320S, and we're gonna setup.. What's your update rate on the microcontroller? - Um it's pretty fast. It's spinning at about 25 revolutions every second. - Ahuh. - And within those it updates 256 times. So we're looking at about a 200 microsecond rate that the LEDs get updated. - OK so a thousand frames per second is not fast enough, is what you're telling me. - No. - OK. Alright, well let's figure out what frame rate we need to hit in order to understand what's going on here. - Alright. - What do we call these? Are these pixels? Cause it's not really like a square thing like cartesians, it's kinda like an arc.. - Right, it's kind of like an arc pixel. - OK, so what do you call that? - An arxel. - Arxel.. like it. We're gonna go with that. How far does the LED bar travel for each individual arxel as you call it? - It's about one and a half degrees. - If it's only going one to two degrees, then why is my brain still seeing that light the whole time it's around? Because it's only one 360th of the sweep, but the rest of it's dark. According to the high speed camera, which I had to crank up to 5500 frames per second, this is what's actually happening. Check it out. Those's dots, or the arxels as Greg likes to call them are kind of flipping around all over the place. Most of the image is dead space. So why is your brain making that image? To understand why the brain sees something that's not there I found a guy that studies this sort of thing that's published over 130 different papers on similar topics. OK I'm on a pretty bad Skype connection with Dr Stuart Anstis who is a genius at the University of California San Diego and what do you study Dr Anstis? - [british accent] I study visual perception, in particular visual illusions which tell us about the normal processes of vision, how the eyes send information to the brain. - That's fantastic. And obviously your accent makes it very clear that you know exactly what you're talking about because I would expect nothing less from a person who studies visual perception. So I want to understand why my eyeball is seeing something where I know there is not light. Why am I seeing that? - It's because of persistence of vision, which means the eye averages what it sees over a short period of time. It's analogous to a camera where you have a long exposure time, and this will give you more light coming in, greater sensitivity, but you have a more sluggish response. So anything moving gets blurred out. - What is the difference in time from the moment the LED is illuminated until my eye registers that the light is there? There has to be a delay time there. What is that? - That delay time varies enormously, over a ten-fold range, anything from 10 to 100 milliseconds. - According to Dr Anstis there's two things going on, and let's look at it. Let's pretend that we have a flashing LED and we want to look at the brain's response to that LED. First of all he said there's a delay, so when the LED first comes on, our brain's not going to immediately see vision, it's gonna take some finite amount of time later. Secondly he said that the eye averages what it sees over a short period of time. Think about that. If we have a moving average, that means that our vision has some sort of inertia to it. It works like this. As the average comes along and is exposed to that LED flash, it starts to ramp up. As the light goes away, that moving average starts to ramp back down. As the light comes back that average starts to go up again, and instead of having gaps that are complete darkness, we have this nice trough in the bottom. Therefore we have a persistence of vision even though there is no light to see at that point in time. Let's look back at that slo mo image from before with all the blinking LEDs. Now, let's add this time average of light and see what the image looks like. Check it out. How cool is that? It looks just like what our eyes see. At what rate would you expect that I would quit seeing a uniform image but I would start to see like a tail dragging across the screen? - Well if the average time is less than one revolution then you're going to see a gap. But supposing as you say, the propellor goes around in 1/25th of a second, that's 40 milliseconds. - I get it now. Do you understand? Think about it. Greg's wheel is rotating at 25 frames per second, and that has to do with the moving time average of the human eye. That's why this video is at least 25, it's actually 30 frames per second. If it wasn't, you would see flickering of the image. So what seems like an imperfection in our eye is actually what smooths things out and makes the world work smoothly for us. That's pretty awesome. If the people watching this video were students in your class what would you want them to know about Greg's wheel and the persistence of vision? - [laughs] Well I would say every system has got a limited time resolution The eye has an engineering problem of trading time resolution against sensitivity to light. And in fact it's got sort of knobs inside which can change that trade-off relationship automatically. The eye is in many ways much cleverer than the camera. It's a beautiful piece of engineering. - Well thank you very much sir, I really appreciate your time. - Thank you. I hope you enjoyed this, feel free to subscribe, if not, no big deal. Hope you're getting Smarter Every Day Have a good one. OK is there any truth to the rumor that you actually proposed using one of these? - There is some truth. [laughs] As I was finishing up the project I thought to myself, Hey it'd be pretty cool if I could like write messages on here so I decided that's how I wanted to propose.

**Transcript**:
In tropical seas, flying fish leap out of the water, gliding for up to 200 meters 
using wing-like fins, before dipping back into the sea. In the Indo-Pacific, a hunting sailfish can reach speeds 
of 110 kilometers per hour. That’s 11 times faster than Olympic 
swimming champion Michael Phelps. It can then stick up its spiny dorsal fin 
like a brake, grinding to a dead halt, mid-swim. Each of these physical feats is made 
possible by a fish’s form, which in most species is a smooth, 
elongated body, fins, and a tail. These features are shared across thousands
of fish species, each introducing its own variations on
the theme to survive in unique habitats. What makes these features so
commonplace in fish, and what does it reveal about the more 
than 33,000 fish species that inhabit earth’s rivers, 
lakes, and seas? Fish can be split into two main groups, according to the type 
of motion they favor. The first is body 
and caudal fin driven motion, and most fish species, about 85%, 
fall into this group. Here, the body and tail 
are the primary propelling forces, with fins mainly playing 
a stabilizing and steering role. This configuration suits 
many open-water species, which need speed, thrust and control for
constant, efficient swimming. Eels lie at one extreme of this group. Known as anguilliform swimmers, their entire bodies undulate to generate 
a wave-like motion. Compared to anguilliform fish, species like salmon and trout, 
known as subcarangiforms, use about two-thirds of their body mass
to generate motion, while carangiform swimmers, 
such as mackerel, only use about a third. Typically, the less of its mass a fish 
uses to generate motion, the more streamlined its shape. At the other end of the spectrum from eels
are ostraciiform species like boxfish, and thunniform swimmers like tuna. In these fish, the tails, 
also known as caudal fins, do the work. A tuna’s tail is attached by tendons 
to multiple muscles in its body. It powers the body like an engine, forcefully catapulting
the bullet-like fish to speeds up to 69 kilometers per hour. The second major fish group relies 
on median and paired fin motion, meaning they’re propelled through the 
water predominantly by their fins. Fins allow fine-tuned movement 
at slow speeds, so this propulsion 
is typically found in fish that have to navigate complex habitats. Bottom-dwelling fishes, like rays,
fall into this group; using their huge pectoral fins, they can
lift themselves swiftly off the sea floor. That conveniently allows them 
to inhabit shallow seas without being buffeted about by waves. Similarly, shallow-water flatfish 
use their entire bodies as one big fin to hoist 
themselves up off the sand. Ocean sunfish lack tails, so they move around slowly by beating 
their wing-like median fins instead. Similar movements are shared 
by many reef species, like the queen angelfish, surgeonfish, and wrasse. Their focus on fins has taken 
the demand off their bodies, many of which have consequently 
evolved into unusual and inventive shapes. There are fishes within both groups 
that seem to be outliers. But if you look closer, you’ll notice that these 
common traits are disguised. Seahorses, for instance, don’t appear 
fish-shaped in any conventional way, yet they use their flexible 
dorsal fins as makeshift tails. A pufferfish may occasionally 
look more like a lethal balloon, but if it needs to swim rapidly,
it’ll retract its spines. Handfish look like they have legs, but really these limb-like 
structures are fins, modified to help them 
amble across the sea floor. For fish, motion underpins survival, so it’s become a huge evolutionary 
driver of form. The widespread features of fish 
have been maintained across tens of thousands of fish species, not to mention other 
ocean-dwelling animals, like penguins, dolphins, sea slugs, and squids. And that’s precisely because 
they’ve proven so successful.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 17, Ground Truth Question 4, Matched Generated Question 7
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In tropical seas, flying fish leap out of the water, gliding for up to 200 meters 
using wing-like fins, before dipping back into the sea. In the Indo-Pacific, a hunting sailfish can reach speeds 
of 110 kilometers per hour. That’s 11 times faster than Olympic 
swimming champion Michael Phelps. It can then stick up its spiny dorsal fin 
like a brake, grinding to a dead halt, mid-swim. Each of these physical feats is made 
possible by a fish’s form, which in most species is a smooth, 
elongated body, fins, and a tail. These features are shared across thousands
of fish species, each introducing its own variations on
the theme to survive in unique habitats. What makes these features so
commonplace in fish, and what does it reveal about the more 
than 33,000 fish species that inhabit earth’s rivers, 
lakes, and seas? Fish can be split into two main groups, according to the type 
of motion they favor. The first is body 
and caudal fin driven motion, and most fish species, about 85%, 
fall into this group. Here, the body and tail 
are the primary propelling forces, with fins mainly playing 
a stabilizing and steering role. This configuration suits 
many open-water species, which need speed, thrust and control for
constant, efficient swimming. Eels lie at one extreme of this group. Known as anguilliform swimmers, their entire bodies undulate to generate 
a wave-like motion. Compared to anguilliform fish, species like salmon and trout, 
known as subcarangiforms, use about two-thirds of their body mass
to generate motion, while carangiform swimmers, 
such as mackerel, only use about a third. Typically, the less of its mass a fish 
uses to generate motion, the more streamlined its shape. At the other end of the spectrum from eels
are ostraciiform species like boxfish, and thunniform swimmers like tuna. In these fish, the tails, 
also known as caudal fins, do the work. A tuna’s tail is attached by tendons 
to multiple muscles in its body. It powers the body like an engine, forcefully catapulting
the bullet-like fish to speeds up to 69 kilometers per hour. The second major fish group relies 
on median and paired fin motion, meaning they’re propelled through the 
water predominantly by their fins. Fins allow fine-tuned movement 
at slow speeds, so this propulsion 
is typically found in fish that have to navigate complex habitats. Bottom-dwelling fishes, like rays,
fall into this group; using their huge pectoral fins, they can
lift themselves swiftly off the sea floor. That conveniently allows them 
to inhabit shallow seas without being buffeted about by waves. Similarly, shallow-water flatfish 
use their entire bodies as one big fin to hoist 
themselves up off the sand. Ocean sunfish lack tails, so they move around slowly by beating 
their wing-like median fins instead. Similar movements are shared 
by many reef species, like the queen angelfish, surgeonfish, and wrasse. Their focus on fins has taken 
the demand off their bodies, many of which have consequently 
evolved into unusual and inventive shapes. There are fishes within both groups 
that seem to be outliers. But if you look closer, you’ll notice that these 
common traits are disguised. Seahorses, for instance, don’t appear 
fish-shaped in any conventional way, yet they use their flexible 
dorsal fins as makeshift tails. A pufferfish may occasionally 
look more like a lethal balloon, but if it needs to swim rapidly,
it’ll retract its spines. Handfish look like they have legs, but really these limb-like 
structures are fins, modified to help them 
amble across the sea floor. For fish, motion underpins survival, so it’s become a huge evolutionary 
driver of form. The widespread features of fish 
have been maintained across tens of thousands of fish species, not to mention other 
ocean-dwelling animals, like penguins, dolphins, sea slugs, and squids. And that’s precisely because 
they’ve proven so successful.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine you’re being attacked 
by a ferocious predator. With no chance of escape, you do what any courageous, 
self-respecting possum would do: curl into an immobile 
state called catatonia, stick out your tongue, drool, and ooze some foul-smelling 
liquid from your anal glands. Disgusted, your assailant 
loosens its grip, decides you’re not the dinner 
it was looking for, and departs. After 10 minutes, 
you resurrect and merrily saunter on. From lemurs to lizards, ants to amphibians, sharks to chickens, hundreds of animals
"play dead" as a survival tactic. Nicknamed "playing possum" 
after its star performer, feigning death is also called thanatosis. That’s from Thanatos, 
the ancient Greek deity of death. But most scientists call it 
tonic immobility, or TI. How and why TI occurs depends 
on the species and situation. Spewing stench and adopting odd postures
are common and often play important roles. Other animals sacrifice their neighbors: quail chicks that freeze 
while their kin run amok have a better chance of survival 
when pursued by a cat. Speaking of cats, feline mothers can pinch
the napes of their kittens’ necks and induce another kind of 
immobility called clipnosis. This keeps their kittens quiet 
and easy to transport. Most of the physiological mechanisms 
underlying these theatrics originate in 
the parasympathetic nervous system, better known for controlling cycles 
of resting and digesting. In possums, the parasympathetic nervous system causes
their heart rates to drop by nearly half, respiration by a third, and body temperatures by more than half a
degree Celsius for up to an hour. The neurotransmitter dopamine 
also plays a part. Flour beetles with low dopamine levels 
play dead more frequently than those with high levels, and anything blocking dopamine receptor 
sites can lengthen catatonia. But maintaining a death ruse isn’t easy. The performers are constantly 
gauging their surroundings for cues on when it’s safe to rise. Chickens, for instance, can sense
when a predator’s eyes are upon them. Researchers know this because when they
used a stuffed hawk in an experiment, their chicken subjects came out of their
catatonia quicker when the hawk’s eyes were averted. Other animals use TI for purposes 
other than defense. When the sleeper cichlid feels peckish, it sinks to the lake floor 
and lies motionless, its splotchy coloration making it 
seem like a rotting carcass. If a small scavenger investigates, 
this undead trickster strikes. Some animals even feign death 
as a sexual ploy. Male nursery spiders offer gifts of
silk-wrapped insects in hopes of wooing females. But those females are known 
to eat love-seeking males. By playing dead while the female 
eagerly devours her snack, these males can cautiously revive and improve their chances 
of successfully mating. So TI can work to an animal’s advantage,
unless someone else knows its secret. California orcas can flip over 
young great white sharks, inducing TI for so long 
the immobilized sharks, who must move to respire, 
essentially suffocate. Humans can also flip sharks into TI. By stroking a shark’s 
electrically-sensitive snout and gently turning it over, researchers can induce TI 
that lasts up to 15 minutes. That’s enough time to insert tags, remove hooks, and even perform surgeries. There are risks however: TI can hamper respiration and induce
hyperglycemia, a sign of stress. So this technique should only 
be used when necessary. Humans can also experience TI when they
freeze with fear during violent assaults. Recognizing this ancient, involuntary
form of self-defense has significant implications 
when trying to understand why some victims don’t flee 
or fight in the face of danger. So, studying TI in non-human animals not only helps us better understand some
odd behaviors, it can also help us better 
understand our own, sometimes counterintuitive, responses to violence.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine you’re being attacked 
by a ferocious predator. With no chance of escape, you do what any courageous, 
self-respecting possum would do: curl into an immobile 
state called catatonia, stick out your tongue, drool, and ooze some foul-smelling 
liquid from your anal glands. Disgusted, your assailant 
loosens its grip, decides you’re not the dinner 
it was looking for, and departs. After 10 minutes, 
you resurrect and merrily saunter on. From lemurs to lizards, ants to amphibians, sharks to chickens, hundreds of animals
"play dead" as a survival tactic. Nicknamed "playing possum" 
after its star performer, feigning death is also called thanatosis. That’s from Thanatos, 
the ancient Greek deity of death. But most scientists call it 
tonic immobility, or TI. How and why TI occurs depends 
on the species and situation. Spewing stench and adopting odd postures
are common and often play important roles. Other animals sacrifice their neighbors: quail chicks that freeze 
while their kin run amok have a better chance of survival 
when pursued by a cat. Speaking of cats, feline mothers can pinch
the napes of their kittens’ necks and induce another kind of 
immobility called clipnosis. This keeps their kittens quiet 
and easy to transport. Most of the physiological mechanisms 
underlying these theatrics originate in 
the parasympathetic nervous system, better known for controlling cycles 
of resting and digesting. In possums, the parasympathetic nervous system causes
their heart rates to drop by nearly half, respiration by a third, and body temperatures by more than half a
degree Celsius for up to an hour. The neurotransmitter dopamine 
also plays a part. Flour beetles with low dopamine levels

**Transcript**:
In ancient Greece, headaches were
considered powerful afflictions. Victims prayed for relief from Asclepius,
the god of medicine. And if pain continued, a medical practitioner would perform 
the best-known remedy— drilling a small hole in the
skull to drain supposedly infected blood. This dire technique, called trepanation, often replaced the headache 
with a more permanent condition. Fortunately, doctors today don’t resort 
to power tools to cure headaches. But we still have a lot
to learn about this ancient ailment. Today, we’ve classified headaches 
into two camps— primary headaches and secondary headaches. The former are not symptomatic of an
underlying disease, injury, or condition; they are the condition. But we’ll come back to them in a minute because while primary headaches 
account for 50% of reported cases, we actually know much more 
about secondary headaches. These are caused by other health problems, with triggers ranging 
from dehydration and caffeine withdrawal to head and neck injury, and heart disease. Doctors have classified 
over 150 diagnosable types, all with different potential causes, 
symptoms, and treatments. But we’ll take just one common case 
—a sinus infection—as an example. The sinuses are a system of cavities that spread behind 
our foreheads, noses, and upper cheeks. When our sinuses are infected, our immune response heats up the area, roasting the bacteria and inflaming 
the cavities well past their usual size. The engorged sinuses put pressure 
on the cranial arteries and veins, as well as muscles in the neck and head. Their pain receptors, called nociceptors,
trigger in response, cueing the brain to release a flood 
of neuropeptides that inflame the cranial blood
vessels, swelling and heating up the head. This discomfort, 
paired with hyper-sensitive head muscles, creates the sore, 
throbbing pain of a headache. Not all headache pain comes from swelling. Tense muscles and inflamed, 
sensitive nerves cause varying degrees 
of discomfort in each headache. But all cases are reactions 
to some cranial irritant. While the cause is clear 
in secondary headaches, the origins of primary headaches 
remain unknown. Scientists are still investigating 
potential triggers for the three types of primary headaches: recurring, long-lasting migraines; intensely painful, 
rapid-fire cluster headaches; and, most common of all, 
the tension headache. As the name suggests, tension headaches are known for creating 
the sensation of a tight band squeezed around the head. These headaches increase the tenderness of
the pericranial muscles, which then painfully pulse 
with blood and oxygen. Patients report stress, dehydration, 
and hormone changes as triggers, but these don’t fit 
the symptoms quite right. For example, in dehydration headaches, the frontal lobe actually 
shrinks away from the skull, creating forehead swelling that doesn’t match the location 
of the pain in tension headaches. Scientists have theories 
for what the actual cause is, ranging from spasming blood vessels to overly sensitive nociceptors, but no one knows for sure. Meanwhile, most headache research is
focused on more severe primary headaches. Migraines are recurring headaches, which 
create a vise-like sensation on the skull that can last from four hours 
to three days. In 20% of cases, these attacks are
intense enough to overload the brain 
with electrical energy, which hyper-excites sensory nerve endings. This produces hallucinations called auras, which can include seeing flashing lights and geometric patterns 
and experiencing tingling sensations. Cluster headaches, 
another primary headache type, cause burning, stabbing bursts
of pain behind one eye, leading to a red eye, constricted pupil, 
and drooping eyelid. What can be done about these conditions, which dramatically affect 
many people’s quality of life? Tension headaches and most secondary cases can be treated with 
over-the-counter pain medications, such as anti-inflammatory drugs 
that reduce cranial swelling. And many secondary headache triggers, like dehydration, eye strain, and stress, can be proactively avoided. Migraines and cluster headaches 
are more complicated, and we haven’t yet discovered reliable 
treatments that work for everyone. But thankfully, pharmacologists 
and neurologists are hard at work cracking these pressing mysteries 
that weigh so heavily on our minds.

underlying disease, injury, or condition; they are the condition. But we’ll come back to them in a minute because while primary headaches 
account for 50% of reported cases, we actually know much more 
about secondary headaches. These are caused by other health problems, with triggers ranging 
from dehydration and caffeine withdrawal to head and neck injury, and heart disease. Doctors have classified 
over 150 diagnosable types, all with different potential causes, 
symptoms, and treatments. But we’ll take just one common case 
—a sinus infection—as an example. The sinuses are a system of cavities that spread behind 
our foreheads, noses, and upper cheeks. When our sinuses are infected, our immune response heats up the area, roasting the bacteria and inflaming 
the cavities well past their usual size. The engorged sinuses put pressure 
on the cranial arteries and veins, as well as muscles in the neck and head. Their pain receptors, called nociceptors,
trigger in response, cueing the brain to release a flood 
of neuropeptides that inflame the cranial blood
vessels, swelling and heating up the head. This discomfort, 
paired with hyper-sensitive head muscles, creates the sore, 
throbbing pain of a headache. Not all headache pain comes from swelling. Tense muscles and inflamed, 
sensitive nerves cause varying degrees 
of discomfort in each headache. But all cases are reactions 
to some cranial irritant. While the cause is clear 
in secondary headaches, the origins of primary headaches 
remain unknown. Scientists are still investigating 
potential triggers for the three types of primary headaches: recurring, long-lasting migraines; intensely painful, 
rapid-fire cluster headaches; and, most common of all, 
the tension headache. As the name suggests, tension headaches are known for creating 
the sensation of a tight band squeezed around the head. These headaches increase the tenderness of
the pericranial muscles, which then painfully pulse 
with blood and oxygen. Patients report stress, dehydration, 
and hormone changes as triggers, but these don’t fit 
the symptoms quite right. For example, in dehydration headaches, the frontal lobe actually 
shrinks away from the skull, creating forehead swelling that doesn’t match the location 
of the pain in tension headaches. Scientists have theories 
for what the actual cause is, ranging from spasming blood vessels to overly sensitive nociceptors, but no one knows for sure. Meanwhile, most headache research is
focused on more severe primary headaches. Migraines are recurring headaches, which 
create a vise-like sensation on the skull that can last from four hours 
to three days. In 20% of cases, these attacks are
intense enough to overload the brain 
with electrical energy, which hyper-excites sensory nerve endings. This produces hallucinations called auras, which can include seeing flashing lights and geometric patterns 
and experiencing tingling sensations. Cluster headaches, 
another primary headache type, cause burning, stabbing bursts
of pain behind one eye, leading to a red eye, constricted pupil, 
and drooping eyelid. What can be done about these conditions, which dramatically affect 
many people’s quality of life? Tension headaches and most secondary cases can be treated with 
over-the-counter pain medications, such as anti-inflammatory drugs 
that reduce cranial swelling. And many secondary headache triggers, like dehydration, eye strain, and stress, can be proactively avoided. Migraines and cluster headaches 
are more complicated, and we haven’t yet discovered reliable 
treatments that work for everyone. But thankfully, pharmacologists 
and neurologists are hard at work cracking these pressing mysteries 
that weigh so heavily on our minds.

**Transcript**:
In ancient Greece, headaches were
considered powerful afflictions. Victims prayed for relief from Asclepius,
the god of medicine. And if pain continued, a medical practitioner would perform 
the best-known remedy— drilling a small hole in the
skull to drain supposedly infected blood. This dire technique, called trepanation, often replaced the headache 
with a more permanent condition. Fortunately, doctors today don’t resort 
to power tools to cure headaches. But we still have a lot
to learn about this ancient ailment. Today, we’ve classified headaches 
into two camps— primary headaches and secondary headaches. The former are not symptomatic of an

**Transcript**:
The decision whether one should stay or leave is one of the most consequential
and painful any of us ever has to make. On any given day, many millions of people worldwide will be secretly turning the issue over in their minds
as they go about their daily lives. Their partners beside them, possibly having little clue as to the momentous decision weighing upon them. The choice is perhaps more common now than it ever was We expect to be deeply happy in love, and, therefore, spend a good deal of time wondering whether our relationships are essentially normal in their sexual and psychological frustrations or are beset by unusually pathological patterns which will impel us to get out as soon as we can. What films or novels we've been exposed to, the state of our friends' relationships, the degree of noise surrounding new sexually driven dating apps, not to mention how much sleep we've had can all play humblingly large roles in influencing us one way or another. Awkwardly, it seems that no one else actually really minds what we end up doing which gives the decision a degree of existential loneliness it might not always have possessed Historically, the choice was, in a sense, a good deal easier because there were simply so many stern external sanctions around not leaving: religions would insist that god blessed unions and would be furious that they're being torn asunder, society strongly disapproved of breakups and cast separating parties into decades of ignominy and shame, and psychologists would explain that children would be deeply and permanently scarred by any termination in their parents' relationship But, one by one, these objections to quitting have fallen away; religions no longer terrify us into staying society doesn't care, and psychologists now routinely tell us that children would prefer a broken family to an unhappy one The burden of choice therefore falls squarely on us. The only thing determining whether to stay or leave is how we feel which can be pretty hard matter indeed to work out for ourselves, our feelings having a dispirited habit of shifting and evading any efforts of rational qualification. In the circumstances, it might help to have a set of questions, devil's advocate in nature, to fall back upon - a kind of checklist to dialogue within one's mind in the silent hours of the morning, from the chill vantage point of the spare room couch. How much of our unhappiness can be tightly attributed to this particular partner, and how much might it, as we would risk discovering five years and multiple upheavals later, turn out to be simply and inherent feature of any attempt to live in close proximity to another human? Though it is, of course, always essentially their fault, what tiny proportion of the difficulties might we, nevertheless, be contributing to the discord? In what modest way might we be a little hard to be around? Consider the annoying traits in all previous partners we've had and people we've known that our current partners happen not to have what do we manage not to fight about? Start to probe at any new infatuations or crushes, largely by getting to know them better Observe closely how many sexually available and intelligent people the single types around us, especially those hooked up to those new dating apps actually manage to encounter day-to-day. Try to have another converstaion with your partner in which you don't accuse them of mendacity, and instead simply explain, quite calmly, how you actually feel and how sad you are at quite a few things. Reflect on how'd you really feel as a child. If henceforth, you were to have two tiny bedrooms, two new step-parents, and possibly a few more new half-siblings. Compare with the scratchy reality of the current set up. Question how normal it is for any couple to have great sex after twenty-two months. Ask yourself if you're ready to face the risk of perhaps achieving no more than exchanging a familiar kind of unhappiness for a new and more complex variety of unhappiness. Wonder whether you really want to choose hope over experience Then, if you still have the impulse to leave, the chances of subsiquent regret lessened to at least a touch, a heavy heart, and a cautious mind, leave.

Welcome to the United Kingdom
(and a Whole Lot More)
explained by me, C. G. P. Grey. United Kingdom?
England?
Great Britain? Are these three the same place?
Are they different places? Do British people secretly laugh those
who use the terms incorrectly?
Who knows the answers to these questions? I do, and I'm going to tell you right now. For the lost — this is the world, this is the European continent, and this is the place we have to untangle. The area shown in purple is the United Kingdom. Part of the confusion is that the United Kingdom is not a single country, but is instead is a country of countries. It contains, inside of it —
four, co-equal, and sovereign nations. The first of these is England, shown here in red. England is often confused with the United Kingdom,
as a whole, because it's the largest and most populous of the nations,
and contains the de facto capital city, London. To the north is Scotland, shown in blue,
and to the west is Wales, shown in white, and — often forgotten even
by those who live in the United Kingdom —
is Northern Ireland, shown in orange. Each country has a local term for the population. While you can call them all 'British,'
it's not recommended;
as the four countries generally don't like each other. The Northern Irish, Scottish, and Welsh
regard the English as slave-driving, colonial masters (no matter that all three have their own, devolved, Parliaments; and are allowed to vote on English laws despite the reverse not being true), and the English generally regard the rest as rural, yokels who spend too much time with their sheep. However, as the four constituent countries
don't have their own passports, they're all British citizens, like it or not.
They are British citizens of the United Kingdom, whose full name, by the way, is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. So where's Great Britain hiding? Right here, the area covered in black is Great Britain. Unlike England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Great Britain is a geographical —
rather than a political — term. Great Britain is the largest island
among the British Isles. Within the United Kingdom,
the term 'Great Britain' is often used to refer to —
England, Scotland, and Wales alone — with the intentional exclusion of Northern Ireland. This is mostly, but not completely, true, as all three constituent countries have islands
that are not part of Great Britain: such as the Isle of Wight (part of England),
the Welsh Isle of Anglesey, the Scottish Hebrides, the Shetland Islands,
the Orkney Islands, and the Islands of the Clyde. The second biggest island in the British Isles is Ireland. It's worth noting, at this point,
that Ireland is not a country; like Great Britain,
it's a geographical — not political — term. The Island of Ireland contains, on it, two countries: Northern Ireland, which we have already discussed,
and the Republic of Ireland. When people say they are 'Irish,'
they're referring to the Republic of Ireland (which is a separate country from the United Kingdom). However, both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom are members of the European Union — even though England, in particular, likes to
pretend that it's an island in the mid-Atlantic, rather than 50 kilometers off the coast of France —
but that's a story for another time. To review: the two largest islands in the British Isles
are Ireland and Great Britain. Ireland has, on it, two countries —
the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland; while Great Britain, mostly, contains three:
England, Scotland and Wales. These last three, when combined with Northern Ireland, form the United Kingdom. There are still many unanswered questions:
such as, why, when you travel to Canada, is there British royalty on the money? To answer this, we need to talk about empire. You can't have gone to school, in the English-speaking world, without having learned that the British Empire once spanned 1/4th the world's land
and governed nearly 1/4th the world's people. While it's easy to remember the parts of the
British Empire that broke away violently, we often forget how many nations gained independence through diplomacy, not bloodshed. These want-to-be nations struck a deal with the Empire: where they continued to recognize the Monarchy as the Head of State, in exchange
for a local, autonomous parliament. To understand how they are connected,
we need to talk about the Crown. Not the physical crown — that sits behind glass in the Tower of London, and earns millions of tourist pounds for the UK — but the Crown as a complicated, legal entity, best thought of as a one-man corporation. Who created this corporation? God did. According to British tradition, all power is vested in God and the Monarch is crowned in a Christian ceremony. God, however, not wanting to be bothered with micromanagement, conveniently delegates his power his power to an entity called the Crown. While this used to be the physical
crown in the Tower of London, it evolved, over time, into a legal corporation; sole able to be controlled only by the ruling monarch. It's a useful reminder that the United Kingdom is still, technically, a theocracy: with the reigning monarch acting as both the Head of State and the Supreme Governor of the official state religion: Anglicanism. Such are the oddities that arise when dealing with a thousand year-old Monarchy. Back to Canada and the rest. The former colonies that gained their independence through diplomacy, and continue to recognize
the authority of the Crown, are known as the Commonwealth Realm.
They are, in decreasing order of population: Canada, Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Jamaica, the Solomon Islands, Belize, the Bahamas, Barbados, Saint Lucia, 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Tuvalu. All are independent nations, but still recognize the Monarchy as the Head of State (even though it has little
 real power within their borders). There are three further entities that belong to the Crown, and these are the Crown Dependencies:
the Isle of Man, Jersey, and Guernsey. Unlike the Commonwealth Realm, they are not considered independent nations, but are granted local autonomy by the Crown, and a British Citizenship by the United Kingdom (though, the UK does reserve the right to over-rule 
the laws of their local assemblies). Are we all done 𝘯𝘰𝘸?
Almost, but not quite; there are still a couple of loose threads,
such as this place: the tiny city of Gibraltar on the southern coast of Spain. Famous for its rock, 
its monkeys, and for causing diplomatic
tension between the United Kingdom and Spain. But what about the Falkland Islands:
which caused so much tension between the United Kingdom and Argentina, that they went to war over them. These places belong in the last group of Crown properties known as: British Overseas Territories, but their former name,
'Crown Colonies,' gives away their origin. They are the last vestiges of the British Empire.
Unlike the Commonwealth Realm, they have not become independent nations and continue to rely on the United Kingdom for military and, sometimes, economic assistance. Like the Crown Dependencies, everyone born within their borders is a British citizen. The Crown Colonies are,
in decreasing order of population: Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Gibraltar, the British Virgin Islands, 
Akrotiri and Dhekelia, Anguilla, Saint Helena, the Ascension Islands, Tristan da Cunha, Montserrat, the British Indian Ocean Territory,
the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, the Falkland Islands, the British Antarctic Territory,
and the Pitcairn Islands. For our final Venn diagram: the United Kingdom is a country situated
on the British Isles and is part of the Crown,
which is controlled by the Monarchy. Also part of the Crown and the British Isles are the Crown Dependencies. The independent nations of the former Empire that still recognize the Crown are the Commonwealth Realm, and the non-independent remnants of the former Empire and are the British Overseas Territories.

**Transcript**:
Welcome to the United Kingdom
(and a Whole Lot More)
explained by me, C. G. P. Grey. United Kingdom?
England?
Great Britain? Are these three the same place?
Are they different places? Do British people secretly laugh those
who use the terms incorrectly?
Who knows the answers to these questions? I do, and I'm going to tell you right now. For the lost — this is the world, this is the European continent, and this is the place we have to untangle. The area shown in purple is the United Kingdom. Part of the confusion is that the United Kingdom is not a single country, but is instead is a country of countries. It contains, inside of it —
four, co-equal, and sovereign nations. The first of these is England, shown here in red. England is often confused with the United Kingdom,
as a whole, because it's the largest and most populous of the nations,
and contains the de facto capital city, London. To the north is Scotland, shown in blue,
and to the west is Wales, shown in white, and — often forgotten even
by those who live in the United Kingdom —
is Northern Ireland, shown in orange. Each country has a local term for the population. While you can call them all 'British,'
it's not recommended;
as the four countries generally don't like each other. The Northern Irish, Scottish, and Welsh
regard the English as slave-driving, colonial masters (no matter that all three have their own, devolved, Parliaments; and are allowed to vote on English laws despite the reverse not being true), and the English generally regard the rest as rural, yokels who spend too much time with their sheep. However, as the four constituent countries
don't have their own passports, they're all British citizens, like it or not.
They are British citizens of the United Kingdom, whose full name, by the way, is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. So where's Great Britain hiding? Right here, the area covered in black is Great Britain. Unlike England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Great Britain is a geographical —
rather than a political — term. Great Britain is the largest island
among the British Isles. Within the United Kingdom,
the term 'Great Britain' is often used to refer to —
England, Scotland, and Wales alone — with the intentional exclusion of Northern Ireland. This is mostly, but not completely, true, as all three constituent countries have islands
that are not part of Great Britain: such as the Isle of Wight (part of England),
the Welsh Isle of Anglesey, the Scottish Hebrides, the Shetland Islands,
the Orkney Islands, and the Islands of the Clyde. The second biggest island in the British Isles is Ireland. It's worth noting, at this point,
that Ireland is not a country; like Great Britain,
it's a geographical — not political — term. The Island of Ireland contains, on it, two countries: Northern Ireland, which we have already discussed,
and the Republic of Ireland. When people say they are 'Irish,'
they're referring to the Republic of Ireland (which is a separate country from the United Kingdom). However, both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom are members of the European Union — even though England, in particular, likes to
pretend that it's an island in the mid-Atlantic, rather than 50 kilometers off the coast of France —
but that's a story for another time. To review: the two largest islands in the British Isles
are Ireland and Great Britain. Ireland has, on it, two countries —
the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland; while Great Britain, mostly, contains three:
England, Scotland and Wales. These last three, when combined with Northern Ireland, form the United Kingdom. There are still many unanswered questions:
such as, why, when you travel to Canada, is there British royalty on the money? To answer this, we need to talk about empire. You can't have gone to school, in the English-speaking world, without having learned that the British Empire once spanned 1/4th the world's land
and governed nearly 1/4th the world's people. While it's easy to remember the parts of the
British Empire that broke away violently, we often forget how many nations gained independence through diplomacy, not bloodshed. These want-to-be nations struck a deal with the Empire: where they continued to recognize the Monarchy as the Head of State, in exchange
for a local, autonomous parliament. To understand how they are connected,
we need to talk about the Crown. Not the physical crown — that sits behind glass in the Tower of London, and earns millions of tourist pounds for the UK — but the Crown as a complicated, legal entity, best thought of as a one-man corporation. Who created this corporation? God did. According to British tradition, all power is vested in God and the Monarch is crowned in a Christian ceremony. God, however, not wanting to be bothered with micromanagement, conveniently delegates his power his power to an entity called the Crown. While this used to be the physical
crown in the Tower of London, it evolved, over time, into a legal corporation; sole able to be controlled only by the ruling monarch.

**Transcript**:
A whip-like straw. Powerful, crushing blades. A pointed, piercing tube. There are nearly a million 
known insect species in the world, but most have one of just 
five common types of mouthparts. And that’s extremely useful to scientists because when they encounter 
an unfamiliar insect in the wild, they can learn a lot about it 
just by examining how it eats. Scientific classification, or taxonomy, is used to organize all 
living things into seven levels: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. The features of an insect’s mouthparts can
help identify which order it belongs to, while also providing clues about how 
it evolved and what it feeds on. The chewing mouthpart is the most common. It’s also the most primitive— all other mouthparts are thought to have 
started out looking like this one before evolving into something different. It features a pair 
of jaws called mandibles with toothed inner edges that cut up 
and crush solid foods, like leaves or other insects. You can find this mouthpart 
on ants from the Hymenoptera order, grasshoppers and crickets 
of the Orthoptera order, dragonflies of the Odonata order, and beetles of the Coleoptera order. The piercing-sucking mouthpart consists of
a long, tube-like structure called a beak. This beak can pierce plant 
or animal tissue to suck up liquids like sap or blood. It can also secrete saliva 
with digestive enzymes that liquefy food for easier sucking. Insects in the Hemiptera order 
have piercing-sucking mouthparts and include bed bugs, cicadas, aphids, and leafhoppers. The siphoning mouthpart, a friendlier version 
of the piercing and sucking beak, also consists of a long, tube-like 
structure called a proboscis that works like a straw 
to suck up nectar from flowers. Insects of the Lepidoptera order— butterflies and moths— keep their proboscises rolled
up tightly beneath their heads when they’re not feeding and unfurl them when 
they come across some sweet nectar. With the sponging mouthpart,
there’s yet another tube, this time ending in two spongy lobes that contain many finer 
tubes called pseudotracheae. The pseudotracheae secrete 
enzyme-filled saliva and soak up fluids 
and dissolved foods by capillary action. House flies, fruit flies, and the other non-biting 
members of the Diptera order are the only insects 
that use this technique. But, there’s a catch. Biting flies within Diptera, like mosquitoes, horse flies, and deer flies, have a piercing-sucking mouthpart 
instead of the sponging mouthpart. And finally, the chewing-lapping mouthpart
is a combination of mandibles and a proboscis with a tongue-like 
structure at its tip for lapping up nectar. On this type of mouthpart, the mandibles themselves 
are not actually used for eating. For bees and wasps,
members of the Hymenoptera order, they serve instead as tools 
for pollen-collecting and wax-molding. Of course, in nature, there are always 
exceptions to the rules. The juvenile stages of some insects, 
for example, have completely different kinds 
of mouths than their adult versions, like caterpillars, which use chewing 
mouthparts to devour leaves before metamorphosing into
butterflies and moths with siphoning mouthparts. Still, mouthpart identification can, 
for the most part, help scientists—and you
—categorize insects. So why not break out a magnifying lens and learn a little more about
who’s nibbling your vegetable garden, biting your arm, or just flying by your ear.

of the piercing and sucking beak, also consists of a long, tube-like 
structure called a proboscis that works like a straw 
to suck up nectar from flowers. Insects of the Lepidoptera order— butterflies and moths— keep their proboscises rolled
up tightly beneath their heads when they’re not feeding and unfurl them when 
they come across some sweet nectar. With the sponging mouthpart,
there’s yet another tube, this time ending in two spongy lobes that contain many finer 
tubes called pseudotracheae. The pseudotracheae secrete 
enzyme-filled saliva and soak up fluids 
and dissolved foods by capillary action. House flies, fruit flies, and the other non-biting 
members of the Diptera order are the only insects 
that use this technique. But, there’s a catch. Biting flies within Diptera, like mosquitoes, horse flies, and deer flies, have a piercing-sucking mouthpart 
instead of the sponging mouthpart. And finally, the chewing-lapping mouthpart
is a combination of mandibles and a proboscis with a tongue-like 
structure at its tip for lapping up nectar. On this type of mouthpart, the mandibles themselves 
are not actually used for eating. For bees and wasps,
members of the Hymenoptera order, they serve instead as tools 
for pollen-collecting and wax-molding. Of course, in nature, there are always 
exceptions to the rules. The juvenile stages of some insects, 
for example, have completely different kinds 
of mouths than their adult versions, like caterpillars, which use chewing 
mouthparts to devour leaves before metamorphosing into
butterflies and moths with siphoning mouthparts. Still, mouthpart identification can, 
for the most part, help scientists—and you
—categorize insects. So why not break out a magnifying lens and learn a little more about
who’s nibbling your vegetable garden, biting your arm, or just flying by your ear.

**Transcript**:
A whip-like straw. Powerful, crushing blades. A pointed, piercing tube. There are nearly a million 
known insect species in the world, but most have one of just 
five common types of mouthparts. And that’s extremely useful to scientists because when they encounter 
an unfamiliar insect in the wild, they can learn a lot about it 
just by examining how it eats. Scientific classification, or taxonomy, is used to organize all 
living things into seven levels: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. The features of an insect’s mouthparts can
help identify which order it belongs to, while also providing clues about how 
it evolved and what it feeds on. The chewing mouthpart is the most common. It’s also the most primitive— all other mouthparts are thought to have 
started out looking like this one before evolving into something different. It features a pair 
of jaws called mandibles with toothed inner edges that cut up 
and crush solid foods, like leaves or other insects. You can find this mouthpart 
on ants from the Hymenoptera order, grasshoppers and crickets 
of the Orthoptera order, dragonflies of the Odonata order, and beetles of the Coleoptera order. The piercing-sucking mouthpart consists of
a long, tube-like structure called a beak. This beak can pierce plant 
or animal tissue to suck up liquids like sap or blood. It can also secrete saliva 
with digestive enzymes that liquefy food for easier sucking. Insects in the Hemiptera order 
have piercing-sucking mouthparts and include bed bugs, cicadas, aphids, and leafhoppers. The siphoning mouthpart, a friendlier version

**Transcript**:
There have been two central traditions in European gardening. Each one associated with a great European nation. The first originated in 17th century France, and became known as the "Jardin à la française" or "formal French garden". The most sublime example of this school of gardening is to be found in the chateau of Vaux-le-Vicomte which is about 50 kilometers southeast of Paris. It was laid out in the late 1650s by André le Nôtre the most important figure in the history of the French Garden. And the son of the gardener of Louis XIII. The idea was to arrange everything
around symmetry, flattening the existing natural landscape so as to create
perfect arrangements of borders, flower beds and reflecting pools. A grand perspective, a thousand five hundred meters long extended from the foot of the chateau to the end point: a statue of Hercules. The alleyways were decorated at
regular intervals by statues, basins fountains and carefully sculpted
topiaries. It was in an extremely logical precise
unyielding way perfect . Another masterpiece of French
gardening was then constructed at Versailles also by André Le Nôtreto. Here to there was
astonishing symmetry and a will to bend the unruliness of nature to the designs
of man. The French gardening tradition achieved
enormous popularity and was widely copied in far more modest homes across
Europe for a century at least. But the dominance eventually gave way to a new theory of gardening that developed in England in the 18th century. And was known as the "Jardin à l'anglaise" or "English Garden". The central figure in
this tradition was Capability Brown, a gardener of genius responsible for a
170 gardens up and down the United Kingdom, including Petworth in West Sussex, Chatsworth and Darbyshire Bowood in Wilshire and Blenheim Palace  in Oxfordshire. The Jardin à l'anglaise couldn't have been more different from the Jardin à la française. In the English tradition everything was about working with rather
than flattening natural features . Wildness of nature wasn't the enemy. It was the starting point which the
skilled English gardener would enhance and work with. A good English garden
relish the raw impulses of nature it was about accommodating and
delighting in nature even though this was nature that was
tampered with in order to get it to look just that bit more natural. The English garden usually included a
lake, sweeps of gently rolling lawns and groves of trees. The English tradition reign supreme for
a century at least. These are two historical traditions of gardening but
they are also along the way two modes of being. The French style is about a
confident rationalism and willpower. This is how we might feel when we want
to change the world through thought and planning. The English tradition is about
accommodating ourselves to what already exists, bending with what is there, trying to
make the most out of what we've been given and to see its beauty and its charm. It looks like a battle but ideally we
need the two attitudes, the French and the English in our lives in order to
call upon them in diverse situations. Each of us is probably a bit biased
towards one or the other and could benefit from seeking out the distinctive
wisdom of either the French or the English style. The opposition of the to
gardening styles is stark but in truth we need integration, the Jardin à la française and the Jardin à l'anglaise, rational willpower and acceptance of
nature. There are in fact a few places that do
show the two integrated like Sissinghurst Garden in Kent which
borrows from both traditions. This shows us the model of how an ideal
individual might be, someone with a French and an English garden sight to
their nature. Ready to call upon either faculty depending on the occasion. That would be interesting gardening and
wise psychology.

The year is 15 CE
and the Roman Empire is prospering. Most of the credit will go to the emperor, but this success wouldn’t 
have been possible without loyal soldiers like Servius Felix. Servius enlisted as a legionary 
eight years ago at age 18, the son of a poor farmer
with few prospects. Unlike the majority of legionaries,
he doesn’t gamble, so he’s been able to save 
most of his wages. He’s even kept his viaticum, the three gold coins he received 
when he enlisted. If he survives until retirement, 
he’ll receive several acres of land. And he’s grown rather fond 
of a girl back home whom he intends to marry. But he’ll have to wait until he completes 
his 25 years of service before that can happen. And the life of a legionary 
is dangerous and grueling. Today, Servius’s legion, 
along with three others, has undertaken a “great march” 
of 30,000 Roman paces, the equivalent of nearly 36 kilometers. Servius’s armor and weapons, including his gladius, scutum, and two pila, weigh over 20 kilograms. And that’s not counting his backpack, 
or sarcina, which contains food and all the tools
he needs to help build the camp – spade, saw, pickaxe, and basket. Although Servius is exhausted, 
he won’t sleep much tonight. He’s been assigned the first watch, which means looking after 
the baggage animals and keeping alert
against a possible ambush. After he’s done, he lies awake, 
dreading the day ahead, which will force him 
to recall his worst nightmare. At dawn, Servius eats breakfast 
with his seven tent companions. They’re like a family, all bearing scars 
from the battles they’ve fought together. Servius is from Italia, but his fellow soldiers hail 
from all over the empire, which stretches from Syria to Spain. So they’re all far from home 
in the northern land of Germania. Servius’s legion 
and three others with him today are under the command of
Emperor Tiberius’s nephew Germanicus, named for his father’s military successes
against the Germanic tribes. Each legion has close to 5,000 men, divided into cohorts of about 500, further subdivided into centuries 
of around 80-100 men. Each century is commanded by a centurion. An aquilifer, or eagle-bearer, marches at
the head of each legion carrying its eagle standard. The centurions march beside 
the legionaries belting out orders, “Dex, sin, dex, sin," “Right, left, right, left," starting with the right foot as the left 
is considered unlucky or sinister. Despite the strict discipline, 
there’s tension in the air. Last year, some legions 
in the area revolted, demanding better pay 
and a cut in the length of service. Only their general’s charisma
and negotiating skills prevented wholesale mutiny. Today is a “just march,” 
only 30 kilometers. As the marshes and forests of Germania 
lie beyond the empire’s road system the men must build causeways
and bridges to make headway— something they’ve recently spent 
more time doing than fighting. Finally, they arrive at their destination,
a place Servius knows too well. It’s a clearing on the outskirts 
of the Teutoburg Forest, where six years ago, during the
reign of the Emperor Augustus, Germanic tribes under 
their chieftain Arminius ambushed and destroyed three legions. Proceeding along a narrow path, the legions were attacked from 
forest cover under torrential rain with their escape blocked. It was one of the worst defeats 
the Romans ever suffered and Augustus never lived it down. Servius was one of the few survivors. Servius still has nightmares of 
his comrades lying where they fell. But now the army is back to bury 
the dead with full military honors. As he helps in the task, he can’t help wondering whether the bones
he handles belonged to someone he knew. Several times he wants to weep aloud, 
but he pushes on with the task. The glory of the Empire 
can go to the crows. All he craves is to retire 
on a small farm with his wife-to-be, if the gods should spare his life 
for 17 more years.

of the Teutoburg Forest, where six years ago, during the
reign of the Emperor Augustus, Germanic tribes under 
their chieftain Arminius ambushed and destroyed three legions. Proceeding along a narrow path, the legions were attacked from 
forest cover under torrential rain with their escape blocked. It was one of the worst defeats 
the Romans ever suffered and Augustus never lived it down. Servius was one of the few survivors. Servius still has nightmares of 
his comrades lying where they fell. But now the army is back to bury 
the dead with full military honors. As he helps in the task, he can’t help wondering whether the bones
he handles belonged to someone he knew. Several times he wants to weep aloud, 
but he pushes on with the task. The glory of the Empire 
can go to the crows. All he craves is to retire 
on a small farm with his wife-to-be, if the gods should spare his life 
for 17 more years.
