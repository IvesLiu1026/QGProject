Hi, I'm Adam Cole. This week we've got a question from Lulu Miller, 
the host of NPR's Invisibilia podcast: How old are our bodies actually? Because if you think about how
we're constantly being regenerated our physical matter is being shed and replenished ... what actually remains? Good question, Lulu! Well, your hair obviously doesn't remain
the same and I'm not just talking about the style each hair on your head is replaced every
2 to 7 years A hundred hairs fall out every day
and new ones grow back in their place And look at your fingernails - 
they're completely new every six months or so it turns out it's just a matter of time
before almost every part of your body refreshes itself in a similar way The lining of your stomach and intestines gets pretty beat up -- it's constantly
exposed to acid and bile and so those cells get replaced every few days Every few weeks, your outer layer of 
skin is completely renewed Every four months you have
a fresh army of red blood cells A hundred million new cells are born every minute and a hundred million old cells are destroyed It's actually the breakdown products of these red blood cells that turn your bruises and urine yellow Every 10 years, you've got a new skeleton a special team of cells breaks down old bone and another builds new bone Every 15 years your muscles are refreshed You might think you gain and lose fat cells
when you gain and lose weight but the actually just get bigger and smaller Over the course of 25 years though,
most of them turn over But there are a few things that
stick around for your entire life About half of your heart stays with you
from birth to death because those cells are replaced very slowly Certain parts of your brain add a few new
neurons over the course of your life but the vast majority of your neurons
developed before you were born It's the connections between those neurons
-- the circuits that store memories -- that are constantly changing And there's one more
part of you that lasts your whole life Months before you were born, a little cluster of cells stretched and
filled themselves with transparent protein As you grew, even after birth, more and more fibers were added, but that center endured This is your lens the window through
which you are watching this video right now and its core has remained the same
since the moment you first opened your eyes So how old is your body really? Some of it is brand-new and some of it
is as old as you are To learn how scientists figured all this out,
check out our post at skunkbear.tumblr.com And listen to Invisibilia -- the latest episode is about whether or not personality persists throughout your entire life If you have science questions send them our way and please subscribe to our channel!

**Transcript**:
Fu Manchu was one of the most
notorious escape artists at the Omaha Zoo in the 1960s. But he wasn't a performer, he was an orangutan. The keepers who locked 
his enclosure every night were baffled to find him outside
the next day hanging out with friends in a tree, or sunning on the roof. Only after installing cameras 
did they realize Fu Manchu had been picking the lock with a metal wire that he kept hidden
under his cheek pouch. The keepers shouldn't have been
surprised at Fu Manchu's cunningness. Along with our other great ape cousins, the gorillas, chimps, and bonobos, they belong to our Hominidae
family tree, which stretches back 14 million years. But it's not just their striking red hair that makes orangutans unique 
among our cousins. As the only great apes from Asia, orangutans have adapted to a life
high in the rain forest canopies. Many of the skills they learn
are transmitted through the special bond they have with their mothers, the most extended in the animal kingdom
next to humans. Orangutan mothers usually give birth
to one baby at a time, waiting up to eight years before
having another. This gives the young, who begin as fully dependent infants, plenty of time to learn how to climb and distinguish the hundreds of plants
and fruits that make up their diet. Female orangutans even stay with
their mothers into their teen years to learn child-rearing. As they grow up, orangutans also develop
a complex set of cooperative social skills by interacting with their peers
and siblings. Much like ourselves, young orangutans involuntarily mimic
the facial expressions and emotions of their playmates, with behaviors that closely parallel
human smiling and laughter. Once they finally venture out 
on their own, orangutans continue to develop
their resourcefulness, putting the skills they've learned 
into practice. Adults build a new nest each night
by carefully weaving twigs together, topping them with soft leaves,
pillows, and blankets. This process requires dexterity,
coordination, and an eye for design. Orangutans also use a variety of tools
to make their lives in the jungle easier. They turn branches into fly swatters
and back scratchers, construct umbrellas when it rains, make gloves from leafy pads, and even use leaves as bandages
to dress their wounds. But orangutan intelligence goes far
beyond jungle survival. Research in controlled environments
has shown that orangutans are self-aware, being one of the few species to recognize
their own reflections. They also display remarkable foresight,
planning, and cognition. In one experiment, researchers taught
an orangutan to use a straw to extract his favorite fruit soup
from a box. That orangutan was later given the choice
between the straw or a grape that could be 
eaten right away, and he chose the straw just in case
he was given another box of soup. In another experiment, orangutans figured
out how to reach peanuts at the bottom of long tubes
by spitting water into them. While orangutans are able to pass
cognitive tests with flying colors, there are certain problems that they
need our help to solve. Indonesia has the world's highest rate
of deforestation, and millions of acres of rain forest 
are burned annually to support the logging 
and palm oil industries. Deforestation exposes the 30,000
orangutans remaining in the wild to poachers. They kill mothers so that baby orangutans
can be sold as exotic pets. But fortunately, the story often
doesn't end here. Orphans can be confiscated
and given a second chance. At special forest schools, they recover
from emotional trauma and continue to develop 
essential life skills. Against all odds, these orphans 
demonstrate incredible resilience and readiness to learn. In Malay, the word orangutan translates
literally to "the person of the forest," a reminder of our common lineage. And despite orangutans being some
of the smartest animals on Earth, outsmarting their extinction requires
the creativity, empathy, and foresight that our species share.

out how to reach peanuts at the bottom of long tubes
by spitting water into them. While orangutans are able to pass
cognitive tests with flying colors, there are certain problems that they
need our help to solve. Indonesia has the world's highest rate
of deforestation, and millions of acres of rain forest 
are burned annually to support the logging 
and palm oil industries. Deforestation exposes the 30,000
orangutans remaining in the wild to poachers. They kill mothers so that baby orangutans
can be sold as exotic pets. But fortunately, the story often
doesn't end here. Orphans can be confiscated
and given a second chance. At special forest schools, they recover
from emotional trauma and continue to develop 
essential life skills. Against all odds, these orphans 
demonstrate incredible resilience and readiness to learn. In Malay, the word orangutan translates
literally to "the person of the forest," a reminder of our common lineage. And despite orangutans being some
of the smartest animals on Earth, outsmarting their extinction requires
the creativity, empathy, and foresight that our species share.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the content and options, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about an example of orangutan tool use that is NOT true. The generated MCQs do not have an exact match for this question. However, Question 4 mentions that young orangutans develop cooperative social skills and other abilities, but it does not specifically ask about tool use.

A more relevant generated MCQ could be created based on the content of the transcript. For example, a generated MCQ could ask: "What is an example of a tool used by orangutans?" with options that include making nests, using leaves to dress wounds, constructing umbrellas, and starting fires. However, this is not among the provided generated MCQs.

Given the available options, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match, but it is not a direct match. If I had to choose an index, I would say:

Index: 4 (with the caveat that it's not a direct match)

Please note that the generated MCQs do not have an exact match for the ground truth MCQ, and a more relevant generated MCQ could be created based on the content of the transcript.

**Transcript**:
Fu Manchu was one of the most
notorious escape artists at the Omaha Zoo in the 1960s. But he wasn't a performer, he was an orangutan. The keepers who locked 
his enclosure every night were baffled to find him outside
the next day hanging out with friends in a tree, or sunning on the roof. Only after installing cameras 
did they realize Fu Manchu had been picking the lock with a metal wire that he kept hidden
under his cheek pouch. The keepers shouldn't have been
surprised at Fu Manchu's cunningness. Along with our other great ape cousins, the gorillas, chimps, and bonobos, they belong to our Hominidae
family tree, which stretches back 14 million years. But it's not just their striking red hair that makes orangutans unique 
among our cousins. As the only great apes from Asia, orangutans have adapted to a life
high in the rain forest canopies. Many of the skills they learn
are transmitted through the special bond they have with their mothers, the most extended in the animal kingdom
next to humans. Orangutan mothers usually give birth
to one baby at a time, waiting up to eight years before
having another. This gives the young, who begin as fully dependent infants, plenty of time to learn how to climb and distinguish the hundreds of plants
and fruits that make up their diet. Female orangutans even stay with
their mothers into their teen years to learn child-rearing. As they grow up, orangutans also develop
a complex set of cooperative social skills by interacting with their peers
and siblings. Much like ourselves, young orangutans involuntarily mimic
the facial expressions and emotions of their playmates, with behaviors that closely parallel
human smiling and laughter. Once they finally venture out 
on their own, orangutans continue to develop
their resourcefulness, putting the skills they've learned 
into practice. Adults build a new nest each night
by carefully weaving twigs together, topping them with soft leaves,
pillows, and blankets. This process requires dexterity,
coordination, and an eye for design. Orangutans also use a variety of tools
to make their lives in the jungle easier. They turn branches into fly swatters
and back scratchers, construct umbrellas when it rains, make gloves from leafy pads, and even use leaves as bandages
to dress their wounds. But orangutan intelligence goes far
beyond jungle survival. Research in controlled environments
has shown that orangutans are self-aware, being one of the few species to recognize
their own reflections. They also display remarkable foresight,
planning, and cognition. In one experiment, researchers taught
an orangutan to use a straw to extract his favorite fruit soup
from a box. That orangutan was later given the choice
between the straw or a grape that could be 
eaten right away, and he chose the straw just in case
he was given another box of soup. In another experiment, orangutans figured
out how to reach peanuts at the bottom of long tubes
by spitting water into them. While orangutans are able to pass
cognitive tests with flying colors, there are certain problems that they
need our help to solve. Indonesia has the world's highest rate

are burned annually to support the logging

**Transcript**:
have you ever wondered why countries can't just print more money to pay off their debts or to feed the homeless or to fix unemployment or any other issue for that matter now this may seem like a rather silly question but I think it's one of those questions that people may be too embarrassed to ask but there's no shortage of people wondering the short answer can be summed up in one word inflation inflation is defamed as a persistent substantial rise in the general level of prices related to an increase in the volume of money resulting in a loss of value of currency but I'll get to that first though we need to establish exactly what money is now this may seem obvious but something that you need to understand is that money has absolutely no intrinsic value what that means that money in itself has no actual value is only considered valuable because it can buy things but if you were stranded on a desert island money would be totally useless money only has value because we believe it has value this is called the Tinkerbell effect something I learned about from Vsauce the Tinkerbell effect is used to describe something that only exists because we believe it exists and this is the case with money hypothetically speaking if he were suddenly started to believe that money had no value it wouldn't have value of course it wasn't always this way money has been around for millennia and when it was first used it was in the form of commodity money things were treated that had actual value and uses like salt spaces horses and weapons as well as precious metals such as gold and silver which technically don't have any intrinsic value either but due to the rarity they're almost universally accepted as currency then we have representative money since carrying around everything you own can be difficult representative money makes more sense basically you get your goal to a bank and they keep it safe for you and then return they give you a piece of paper acknowledging that you own that gold these pieces of paper can therefore be used as money as anyone can go and redeem the gold at any time but today almost every country in the world uses fiat money fiat money requires faith and Trust and the government that their money will have value if we use a relatively young country as an example the United States has gone through all three monetary systems within 200 years in 1790 when the United States stopped using European money a Claims Act of 1972 brought the inception of the US dollar the US dollar was originally informed commodity money in the form of gold silver and copper coins the coins were actually made from real gold silver and copper and the value of the metal that made the coins were exactly equal to their faith value the country then moved on to a mixture of commodity and representative money with the 1900 gold standard act the government issued dollar bells which could be exchanged for gold ane tame gold standard is a type of representative money that many countries used at the time this was an effective way to accurately calculate the exchange rate between countries for example if one gram of gold costs one pound in Britain and one dollar 50 in America that you can easily deduce that one pen must equal one dollar 50 gold coins were discontinued and the silver was removed from other coins effectively aimed at commodity money in the United States in 1971 Richard Nixon officially abandoned the gold standard on the US moved on to fiat money so today money isn't backed by gold or anything else of value for that matter survived to the question at hand basic economics tells us that an increase in supply it results in foreign demand and therefore foreign praise so the more money and the economy the lower the value of each dollar meaning other countries can purchase more dollars and Asians for their currency the second supply and demand graph shows why life leads to a rise in prices more money and the economy causes a shift in and demand curve for goods and services but since this isn't matched by an increase in economic output prices much rise look at it this way if the government printed a million dollars and posted it to everyone in the country causing everyone to go out and buy a sports car but there's only a finite number of sports cars in the country so the logical thing to do is to increase the price of a sports car if we use an analogies to demonstrate this imagine there's four people on a desert island they each have ten pieces of fruit all fruits are considered equal and value now imagine they discover a whole forest of apple trees the nominal value of apples has increased because there's more of them but the actual value of an apple has gone down due to an increase in supply therefore in their costs ten apples for one banana since demand for apples is low but high for bananas just a clarify in this analogy the people represent different country's the fruit their respective currency and the apple trees the printed money but it's not just because of economic theory that we know printing too much money is a bad idea there's several examples throughout recent history the most recent example is Zimbabwe who in 2008 suffered extremely high inflation due to printing money this was the result of some awful decisions by president with Gabi when the economy took a turn for the worst when Gabi printed more money to pay government expenditure this caused inflation to skyrocket and in mid November 2008 the Babli's inflation peaked at actually wait hold on things first I need to provide some context inflation eliminated states is around 2% economists generally agree that inflation levels of 1 to 3% are optimum first world countries inflation rates today it range from 0 to 5 percent a country is said to enter hyperinflation when their inflation levels exceed 50 percent so with that in mind Zimbabwe's inflation at its peak reached 6 point 5 secs tell Ian percent or to put it another way that number has 22 digits it got so bad that prices doubled every 24 hours the government tried to solve the problem by printing more and more money with higher and higher denominations they also kept knocking zeros off the end by revaluing the Zimbabwean dollar three times going through four different currencies with four different ISO codes for the final redenomination they were printing 100 trillion dollar bills people were literally using wheelbarrows full of cash to buy a loaf of bread the government even made inflation illegal at one point and people were actually arrested for raising prices in 2009 ISM Bob Wian dollar was abandoned and to this day they still have no national currency their people use currencies such as a US dollar the pen sterling and the euro before the hyperinflation the first in-between dollar was worth about 125 US dollars if that 100 trillion dollar bill was worth that exchange rate that single bill would be worth more money than there s and the entire world twice but as ridiculous as this was this is only considered to be the second worst inflation in history after Hungary in 1940 sex although Zimbabwe's inflation peaked in mid November of 2008 their overall highest monthly inflation was seventy nine point six billion percent whereas Hungary's highest monthly inflation which took place in July 1946 with 41 point 9 quadrillion percent with prices doubling every 15 hours suppose i an't perspective a country with a healthy inflation rate of around 3% precious double every 23 years the currency was called the pengal and as inflation rose the bell pangos introduced short for billion pengal which is actually one trillion Pengo on the short scale as well as the record for the highest monthly inflation hungry also holds the record for the highest denomination bank nor ever issued the 100 million bell penguin note IE 100 million billion which is 100 Quintilian Pengo on the short scale when nel our Bell penguin notes were printed but never issued in 1941 the exchange rate was about 5 pengal to 1 US dollar in 1946 when the currency was discontinued things had gotten so out of hand that if you took every single banknote in the entire country they would have a total value of one tenth of a u.s. pay me hungry then switched to the forint where one formed equals 400 OCH telegin Pengo that number has 29 zeros so that's why governments can just print money to pay off their debt it does not end well it's also important to understand exactly what national dares national debt is much more complicated than personal debt it isn't simply a case of you owe people money take the country with a highest national debt the United States that currently has around 17 trillion dollars a day and you're probably aware the country that holds most US debt as China although that is true it's somewhat misleading of the total debt China only has about 8 percent most of the day is actually owned by the United States government itself by organizations such as Social Security or the Federal Reserve on top of this a further 30 percent is owned by US citizens and even though 8 percent of 17 trillion is still a lot China can't just knock on the door of the White House and demand 1.2 trillion dollars it doesn't work like that basically the US Department of the Treasury issued Treasury bonds you can buy these bonds and the government or pay you interest on that bond every year then once the bonds have matured they'll buy the Treasury bond back from you now if a country gets into financial trouble it may have to default on its debt which basically means you won't get your money back but the u.s. is generally considered an extremely risk-free investment because the US dollar is the most widely used and the most trustworthy currency in the world it's even written into the Constitution that United States cannot default on its debt I'll leave you with this thing of thought and what I think is possibly the best way to sum up why governments can't just print off unlimited amounts of money if money grew on trees it would be as valuable as leaves thanks for watching [Music]

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3: What is fiat money?**

Although the options in Question 3 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ, the question intent and content are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the basis of most major world currencies, and the correct answer is fiat money. Question 3 asks about the definition of fiat money, which is closely related to the concept of currencies being based on fiat money.

However, a more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the basis of most major world currencies, with options similar to the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, such a generated MCQ is not available.

If I had to choose from the available generated MCQs, I would select **Question 3** as the most similar, but with the caveat that it's not an exact match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: **3**

**Transcript**:
have you ever wondered why countries can't just print more money to pay off their debts or to feed the homeless or to fix unemployment or any other issue for that matter now this may seem like a rather silly question but I think it's one of those questions that people may be too embarrassed to ask but there's no shortage of people wondering the short answer can be summed up in one word inflation inflation is defamed as a persistent substantial rise in the general level of prices related to an increase in the volume of money resulting in a loss of value of currency but I'll get to that first though we need to establish exactly what money is now this may seem obvious but something that you need to understand is that money has absolutely no intrinsic value what that means that money in itself has no actual value is only considered valuable because it can buy things but if you were stranded on a desert island money would be totally useless money only has value because we believe it has value this is called the Tinkerbell effect something I learned about from Vsauce the Tinkerbell effect is used to describe something that only exists because we believe it exists and this is the case with money hypothetically speaking if he were suddenly started to believe that money had no value it wouldn't have value of course it wasn't always this way money has been around for millennia and when it was first used it was in the form of commodity money things were treated that had actual value and uses like salt spaces horses and weapons as well as precious metals such as gold and silver which technically don't have any intrinsic value either but due to the rarity they're almost universally accepted as currency then we have representative money since carrying around everything you own can be difficult representative money makes more sense basically you get your goal to a bank and they keep it safe for you and then return they give you a piece of paper acknowledging that you own that gold these pieces of paper can therefore be used as money as anyone can go and redeem the gold at any time but today almost every country in the world uses fiat money fiat money requires faith and Trust and the government that their money will have value if we use a relatively young country as an example the United States has gone through all three monetary systems within 200 years in 1790 when the United States stopped using European money a Claims Act of 1972 brought the inception of the US dollar the US dollar was originally informed commodity money in the form of gold silver and copper coins the coins were actually made from real gold silver and copper and the value of the metal that made the coins were exactly equal to their faith value the country then moved on to a mixture of commodity and representative money with the 1900 gold standard act the government issued dollar bells which could be exchanged for gold ane tame gold standard is a type of representative money that many countries used at the time this was an effective way to accurately calculate the exchange rate between countries for example if one gram of gold costs one pound in Britain and one dollar 50 in America that you can easily deduce that one pen must equal one dollar 50 gold coins were discontinued and the silver was removed from other coins effectively aimed at commodity money in the United States in 1971 Richard Nixon officially abandoned the gold standard on the US moved on to fiat money so today money isn't backed by gold or anything else of value for that matter survived to the question at hand basic economics tells us that an increase in supply it results in foreign demand and therefore foreign praise so the more money and the economy the lower the value of each dollar meaning other countries can purchase more dollars and Asians for their currency the second supply and demand graph shows why life leads to a rise in prices more money and the economy causes a shift in and demand curve for goods and services but since this isn't matched by an increase in economic output prices much rise look at it this way if the government printed a million dollars and posted it to everyone in the country causing everyone to go out and buy a sports car but there's only a finite number of sports cars in the country so the logical thing to do is to increase the price of a sports car if we use an analogies to demonstrate this imagine there's four people on a desert island they each have ten pieces of fruit all fruits are considered equal and value now imagine they discover a whole forest of apple trees the nominal value of apples has increased because there's more of them but the actual value of an apple has gone down due to an increase in supply therefore in their costs ten apples for one banana since demand for apples is low but high for bananas just a clarify in this analogy the people represent different country's the fruit their respective currency and the apple trees the printed money but it's not just because of economic theory that we know printing too much money is a bad idea there's several examples throughout recent history the most recent example is Zimbabwe who in 2008 suffered extremely high inflation due to printing money this was the result of some awful decisions by president with Gabi when the economy took a turn for the worst when Gabi printed more money to pay government expenditure this caused inflation to skyrocket and in mid November 2008 the Babli's inflation peaked at actually wait hold on things first I need to provide some context inflation eliminated states is around 2% economists generally agree that inflation levels of 1 to 3% are optimum first world countries inflation rates today it range from 0 to 5 percent a country is said to enter hyperinflation when their inflation levels exceed 50 percent so with that in mind Zimbabwe's inflation at its peak reached 6 point 5 secs tell Ian percent or to put it another way that number has 22 digits it got so bad that prices doubled every 24 hours the government tried to solve the problem by printing more and more money with higher and higher denominations they also kept knocking zeros off the end by revaluing the Zimbabwean dollar three times going through four different currencies with four different ISO codes for the final redenomination they were printing 100 trillion dollar bills people were literally using wheelbarrows full of cash to buy a loaf of bread the government even made inflation illegal at one point and people were actually arrested for raising prices in 2009 ISM Bob Wian dollar was abandoned and to this day they still have no national currency their people use currencies such as a US dollar the pen sterling and the euro before the hyperinflation the first in-between dollar was worth about 125 US dollars if that 100 trillion dollar bill was worth that exchange rate that single bill would be worth more money than there s and the entire world twice but as ridiculous as this was this is only considered to be the second worst inflation in history after Hungary in 1940 sex although Zimbabwe's inflation peaked in mid November of 2008 their overall highest monthly inflation was seventy nine point six billion percent whereas Hungary's highest monthly inflation which took place in July 1946 with 41 point 9 quadrillion percent with prices doubling every 15 hours suppose i an't perspective a country with a healthy inflation rate of around 3% precious double every 23 years the currency was called the pengal and as inflation rose the bell pangos introduced short for billion pengal which is actually one trillion Pengo on the short scale as well as the record for the highest monthly inflation hungry also holds the record for the highest denomination bank nor ever issued the 100 million bell penguin note IE 100 million billion which is 100 Quintilian Pengo on the short scale when nel our Bell penguin notes were printed but never issued in 1941 the exchange rate was about 5 pengal to 1 US dollar in 1946 when the currency was discontinued things had gotten so out of hand that if you took every single banknote in the entire country they would have a total value of one tenth of a u.s. pay me hungry then switched to the forint where one formed equals 400 OCH telegin Pengo that number has 29 zeros so that's why governments can just print money to pay off their debt it does not end well it's also important to understand exactly what national dares national debt is much more complicated than personal debt it isn't simply a case of you owe people money take the country with a highest national debt the United States that currently has around 17 trillion dollars a day and you're probably aware the country that holds most US debt as China although that is true it's somewhat misleading of the total debt China only has about 8 percent most of the day is actually owned by the United States government itself by organizations such as Social Security or the Federal Reserve on top of this a further 30 percent is owned by US citizens and even though 8 percent of 17 trillion is still a lot China can't just knock on the door of the White House and demand 1.2 trillion dollars it doesn't work like that basically the US Department of the Treasury issued Treasury bonds you can buy these bonds and the government or pay you interest on that bond every year then once the bonds have matured they'll buy the Treasury bond back from you now if a country gets into financial trouble it may have to default on its debt which basically means you won't get your money back but the u.s. is generally considered an extremely risk-free investment because the US dollar is the most widely used and the most trustworthy currency in the world it's even written into the Constitution that United States cannot default on its debt I'll leave you with this thing of thought and what I think is possibly the best way to sum up why governments can't just print off unlimited amounts of money if money grew on trees it would be as valuable as leaves thanks for watching [Music]

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of inflation.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the optimum level of inflation a country should experience. While none of the generated MCQs directly address this question, Question 5 mentions a specific instance of hyperinflation in Zimbabwe, and Question 6 mentions another instance of hyperinflation in Hungary. However, these questions do not provide options that match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of inflation, I would suggest Question 4, which asks why printing too much money leads to inflation. However, the options provided in this question do not match the ground truth MCQ.

Since none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide an index of a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of inflation, but with a note that it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index: 4 (with a note that it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ)

Please note that the generated MCQs do not provide a direct match for the ground truth MCQ, and a new MCQ that directly addresses the optimum level of inflation would be more suitable.

then moved on to a mixture of commodity and representative money with the 1900 gold standard act the government issued dollar bells which could be exchanged for gold ane tame gold standard is a type of representative money that many countries used at the time this was an effective way to accurately calculate the exchange rate between countries for example if one gram of gold costs one pound in Britain and one dollar 50 in America that you can easily deduce that one pen must equal one dollar 50 gold coins were discontinued and the silver was removed from other coins effectively aimed at commodity money in the United States in 1971 Richard Nixon officially abandoned the gold standard on the US moved on to fiat money so today money isn't backed by gold or anything else of value for that matter survived to the question at hand basic economics tells us that an increase in supply it results in foreign demand and therefore foreign praise so the more money and the economy the lower the value of each dollar meaning other countries can purchase more dollars and Asians for their currency the second supply and demand graph shows why life leads to a rise in prices more money and the economy causes a shift in and demand curve for goods and services but since this isn't matched by an increase in economic output prices much rise look at it this way if the government printed a million dollars and posted it to everyone in the country causing everyone to go out and buy a sports car but there's only a finite number of sports cars in the country so the logical thing to do is to increase the price of a sports car if we use an analogies to demonstrate this imagine there's four people on a desert island they each have ten pieces of fruit all fruits are considered equal and value now imagine they discover a whole forest of apple trees the nominal value of apples has increased because there's more of them but the actual value of an apple has gone down due to an increase in supply therefore in their costs ten apples for one banana since demand for apples is low but high for bananas just a clarify in this analogy the people represent different country's the fruit their respective currency and the apple trees the printed money but it's not just because of economic theory that we know printing too much money is a bad idea there's several examples throughout recent history the most recent example is Zimbabwe who in 2008 suffered extremely high inflation due to printing money this was the result of some awful decisions by president with Gabi when the economy took a turn for the worst when Gabi printed more money to pay government expenditure this caused inflation to skyrocket and in mid November 2008 the Babli's inflation peaked at actually wait hold on things first I need to provide some context inflation eliminated states is around 2% economists generally agree that inflation levels of 1 to 3% are optimum first world countries inflation rates today it range from 0 to 5 percent a country is said to enter hyperinflation when their inflation levels exceed 50 percent so with that in mind Zimbabwe's inflation at its peak reached 6 point 5 secs tell Ian percent or to put it another way that number has 22 digits it got so bad that prices doubled every 24 hours the government tried to solve the problem by printing more and more money with higher and higher denominations they also kept knocking zeros off the end by revaluing the Zimbabwean dollar three times going through four different currencies with four different ISO codes for the final redenomination they were printing 100 trillion dollar bills people were literally using wheelbarrows full of cash to buy a loaf of bread the government even made inflation illegal at one point and people were actually arrested for raising prices in 2009 ISM Bob Wian dollar was abandoned and to this day they still have no national currency their people use currencies such as a US dollar the pen sterling and the euro before the hyperinflation the first in-between dollar was worth about 125 US dollars if that 100 trillion dollar bill was worth that exchange rate that single bill would be worth more money than there s and the entire world twice but as ridiculous as this was this is only considered to be the second worst inflation in history after Hungary in 1940 sex although Zimbabwe's inflation peaked in mid November of 2008 their overall highest monthly inflation was seventy nine point six billion percent whereas Hungary's highest monthly inflation which took place in July 1946 with 41 point 9 quadrillion percent with prices doubling every 15 hours suppose i an't perspective a country with a healthy inflation rate of around 3% precious double every 23 years the currency was called the pengal and as inflation rose the bell pangos introduced short for billion pengal which is actually one trillion Pengo on the short scale as well as the record for the highest monthly inflation hungry also holds the record for the highest denomination bank nor ever issued the 100 million bell penguin note IE 100 million billion which is 100 Quintilian Pengo on the short scale when nel our Bell penguin notes were printed but never issued in 1941 the exchange rate was about 5 pengal to 1 US dollar in 1946 when the currency was discontinued things had gotten so out of hand that if you took every single banknote in the entire country they would have a total value of one tenth of a u.s. pay me hungry then switched to the forint where one formed equals 400 OCH telegin Pengo that number has 29 zeros so that's why governments can just print money to pay off their debt it does not end well it's also important to understand exactly what national dares national debt is much more complicated than personal debt it isn't simply a case of you owe people money take the country with a highest national debt the United States that currently has around 17 trillion dollars a day and you're probably aware the country that holds most US debt as China although that is true it's somewhat misleading of the total debt China only has about 8 percent most of the day is actually owned by the United States government itself by organizations such as Social Security or the Federal Reserve on top of this a further 30 percent is owned by US citizens and even though 8 percent of 17 trillion is still a lot China can't just knock on the door of the White House and demand 1.2 trillion dollars it doesn't work like that basically the US Department of the Treasury issued Treasury bonds you can buy these bonds and the government or pay you interest on that bond every year then once the bonds have matured they'll buy the Treasury bond back from you now if a country gets into financial trouble it may have to default on its debt which basically means you won't get your money back but the u.s. is generally considered an extremely risk-free investment because the US dollar is the most widely used and the most trustworthy currency in the world it's even written into the Constitution that United States cannot default on its debt I'll leave you with this thing of thought and what I think is possibly the best way to sum up why governments can't just print off unlimited amounts of money if money grew on trees it would be as valuable as leaves thanks for watching [Music]

**Transcript**:
In 2010, $30 billion worth
of fruits and vegetables were wasted by American retailers
and shoppers in part because of cosmetic problems
and perceived spoilage. That's a poor use of about 30%
of the produce on the market, not to mention the water and energy
required to grow and transport it, and the landfill space getting used up
by rotting fruit. So what are those cosmetic problems? You've probably passed over
a spotty apple in the grocery store, or accidentally sunk your thumb
into a mushy patch on a tomato. These blemishes can doom produce
to the trash can. But what are they anyway, and are they actually bad for you? Those spots are evidence of an epic battle
between plants and microbes. Like humans, plants coexist with billions
of fungi and bacteria. Some of these microbes are beneficial
to the plant, suppressing disease and helping it
extract nutrients. Others are pathogens,
attacking the produce, still alive as it sits in a store display
or your refrigerator and siphoning off molecules
they can use themselves. The good news is 
they're almost never bad for you. These fungi and bacteria have spent
millions of years developing strategies to overcome
a plant's immune system. But healthy human immune systems
are different enough that those strategies 
just don't work on us. So in a plant,
what does this process look like? Microbes can reach plants 
in a number of ways, like getting splashed onto it
during watering or fertilization. Under the right conditions, the microbes grow 
into large enough colonies to attack the waxy outer layer 
of fruit or leaves. Their target: the delicious sugars
and nutrients inside. This type of pathogen often makes
spots like this. A clump of bacteria drains the nutrients
and color from the fruit's cells making that yellow halo. It then moves outward, leaving a black spot of dead cells
in its wake. Each spot, which could contain
hundreds of thousands of microbes is actually caused by a combination
of microbial attack and the host defending itself. For example, this is the bacterial
pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Once on a tomato, 
it enters the fruit and leaves, multiplies in the space between the cells, and produces toxins and proteins that allow it to disrupt 
the plant's immune response. One toxin coronatine makes plants'
stomata open up, allowing bacteria to enter 
more freely. Coronatine also activates pathways
leading to chlorophyll degradation, which you can see as yellow spots. As the bacteria continue to feed
and multiply, they start to kill off the plant cells. That explains spots,
but what about mushy blemishes? Those are usually caused when the fruit
is attacked by microbes after it's detached from the plant. If the plant is wounded during transport, necrotic fungi can infiltrate 
through the wound, kill the cells, absorb their nutrients, and leave your food 
looking mushy or brown. Those spots in particular 
can taste pretty bad. You're eating dead 
and decomposing tissue, after all. But you can usually salvage the rest
of the fruit. The non-mushy spots, like the ones
you typically see on apples or tomatoes, are just on the surface 
and don't usually affect flavor. Of course, microbes that do make us sick,
like E. coli and salmonella, can hitch a ride on vegetables, too. But because they're not plant pathogens,
they don't typically cause spots. They just hang out 
invisibly on the surface. So it's washing fruit and veggies,
not avoiding the spotty ones, that will help you avoid getting sick. So the next time 
you're at the grocery store, don't be afraid 
to pick up funky-looking fruit. Some stores will even give you a discount. Wash them well and store them properly, as some produce like apples and cabbages
will keep in the fridge for weeks. The spotty ones may not be eye candy,
but they're safe and just as delicious.

**Transcript**:
In 2010, $30 billion worth
of fruits and vegetables were wasted by American retailers
and shoppers in part because of cosmetic problems
and perceived spoilage. That's a poor use of about 30%
of the produce on the market, not to mention the water and energy
required to grow and transport it, and the landfill space getting used up
by rotting fruit. So what are those cosmetic problems? You've probably passed over
a spotty apple in the grocery store, or accidentally sunk your thumb
into a mushy patch on a tomato. These blemishes can doom produce
to the trash can. But what are they anyway, and are they actually bad for you? Those spots are evidence of an epic battle
between plants and microbes. Like humans, plants coexist with billions
of fungi and bacteria. Some of these microbes are beneficial
to the plant, suppressing disease and helping it
extract nutrients. Others are pathogens,
attacking the produce, still alive as it sits in a store display
or your refrigerator and siphoning off molecules
they can use themselves. The good news is 
they're almost never bad for you. These fungi and bacteria have spent
millions of years developing strategies to overcome
a plant's immune system. But healthy human immune systems
are different enough that those strategies 
just don't work on us. So in a plant,
what does this process look like? Microbes can reach plants 
in a number of ways, like getting splashed onto it
during watering or fertilization. Under the right conditions, the microbes grow 
into large enough colonies to attack the waxy outer layer 
of fruit or leaves. Their target: the delicious sugars
and nutrients inside. This type of pathogen often makes
spots like this. A clump of bacteria drains the nutrients
and color from the fruit's cells making that yellow halo. It then moves outward, leaving a black spot of dead cells
in its wake. Each spot, which could contain
hundreds of thousands of microbes is actually caused by a combination
of microbial attack and the host defending itself. For example, this is the bacterial
pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Once on a tomato, 
it enters the fruit and leaves, multiplies in the space between the cells, and produces toxins and proteins that allow it to disrupt 
the plant's immune response. One toxin coronatine makes plants'
stomata open up, allowing bacteria to enter 
more freely. Coronatine also activates pathways
leading to chlorophyll degradation, which you can see as yellow spots. As the bacteria continue to feed
and multiply, they start to kill off the plant cells. That explains spots,
but what about mushy blemishes? Those are usually caused when the fruit
is attacked by microbes after it's detached from the plant. If the plant is wounded during transport, necrotic fungi can infiltrate 
through the wound, kill the cells, absorb their nutrients, and leave your food 
looking mushy or brown. Those spots in particular 
can taste pretty bad. You're eating dead 
and decomposing tissue, after all. But you can usually salvage the rest
of the fruit. The non-mushy spots, like the ones
you typically see on apples or tomatoes, are just on the surface 
and don't usually affect flavor. Of course, microbes that do make us sick,
like E. coli and salmonella, can hitch a ride on vegetables, too. But because they're not plant pathogens,
they don't typically cause spots. They just hang out 
invisibly on the surface. So it's washing fruit and veggies,
not avoiding the spotty ones, that will help you avoid getting sick. So the next time 
you're at the grocery store, don't be afraid 
to pick up funky-looking fruit. Some stores will even give you a discount. Wash them well and store them properly, as some produce like apples and cabbages
will keep in the fridge for weeks. The spotty ones may not be eye candy,
but they're safe and just as delicious.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. However, the correct option is not an exact match. 

A more suitable match is Question 8, as it mentions the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, which is related to coronatine, and option D mentions "to produce toxins and proteins that allow it to disrupt the plant's immune response", which is similar to the ground truth MCQ's correct option C "Allow the bacteria to enter the plant leaf". 

However, an even better match is not present among the generated MCQs. But among the given options, Question 8 is the closest match.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 8.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the problems caused by food waste, including the resources required to grow, transport, and sell food. While none of the generated MCQs directly address these issues, Question 1 mentions the percentage of fruits and vegetables wasted due to cosmetic problems and perceived spoilage, which is related to the topic of food waste.

However, a closer match can be found in the transcript, where it is mentioned that the water and energy required to grow and transport produce are wasted when it is discarded due to cosmetic problems. This information is not directly used in any of the generated MCQs.

Considering the available options, I would suggest that Question 1 is the most similar generated MCQ, although it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 1

Please note that this is a partial match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly addresses the issues mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The elephant is a creature
of epic proportions, and yet it owes its enormity to more
than 1,000 trillion microscopic cells, and on the epically small end of things, there are likely millions 
of unicellular species, yet there are very few we can see
with the naked eye. Why is that? Why don't we get unicellular elephants, or blue whales, or brown bears? To find out, we have to peer into
a cell's guts. This is where most 
of the cell's functions occur, enclosed by a cellular membrane that acts as the doorway into 
and out of the cell. Any resources the cell needs to consume, or waste products it needs to expel, first have to pass through this membrane. But there's a biological quirk 
in this set up. A cell's surface and volume increase
at different rates. Cells come in many shapes, but imagining them as cubes will make
the math easy to calculate. A cube has six faces. These represent the cell membrane,
and make up its surface area. A cube measuring one micrometer
on each side, that's one millionth of a meter, would have a total surface area
of six square micrometers. And its volume would be 
one cubic micrometer. This would give us six units 
of surface area for every single unit of volume, a six to one ratio. But things change dramatically
if we make the cube ten times bigger, measuring ten micrometers on each side. This cell would have a surface area
of 600 square micrometers and a volume of one thousand
cubic micrometers, a ratio of only .6 to one. That's less than one unit of surface area
to service each unit of volume. As the cube grows, its volume increases
much faster than its surface area. The interior would overtake the membrane, leaving too little surface area for things
to quickly move in and out of the cell. A huge cell would back up with waste
and eventually die and disintegrate. There's another plus to having multitudes
of smaller cells, too. It's hardly a tragedy if one gets 
punctured, infected, or destroyed. Now, there are some 
exceptionally large cells that have adapted to cheat the system, like the body's longest cell, a neuron that stretches from the base
of the spine to the foot. To compensate for its length,
it's really thin, just a few micrometers in diameter. Another example can be found
in your small intestine, where structures called villi
fold up into little fingers. Each villus is made of cells with highly
folded membranes that have tiny bumps called microvilli
to increase their surface area. But what about single-celled organisms? Caulerpa taxifolia, a green algae
that can reach 30 centimeters long, is believed to be the largest 
single-celled organism in the world thanks to its unique biological hacks. Its surface area is enhanced with
a frond-like structure. It uses photosynthesis to assemble
its own food molecules and it's coenocytic. That means it's a single cell
with multiple nuclei, making it like a multicellular organism
but without the divisions between cells. Yet even the biggest unicellular organisms
have limits, and none grows nearly as large
as the elephant, whale, or bear. But within every big creature
are trillions of minuscule cells perfectly suited in all their tininess to keeping the Earth's giants 
lumbering along.

and make up its surface area. A cube measuring one micrometer
on each side, that's one millionth of a meter, would have a total surface area
of six square micrometers. And its volume would be 
one cubic micrometer. This would give us six units 
of surface area for every single unit of volume, a six to one ratio. But things change dramatically
if we make the cube ten times bigger, measuring ten micrometers on each side. This cell would have a surface area
of 600 square micrometers and a volume of one thousand
cubic micrometers, a ratio of only .6 to one. That's less than one unit of surface area
to service each unit of volume. As the cube grows, its volume increases
much faster than its surface area. The interior would overtake the membrane, leaving too little surface area for things
to quickly move in and out of the cell. A huge cell would back up with waste
and eventually die and disintegrate. There's another plus to having multitudes
of smaller cells, too. It's hardly a tragedy if one gets 
punctured, infected, or destroyed. Now, there are some 
exceptionally large cells that have adapted to cheat the system, like the body's longest cell, a neuron that stretches from the base
of the spine to the foot. To compensate for its length,
it's really thin, just a few micrometers in diameter. Another example can be found
in your small intestine, where structures called villi
fold up into little fingers. Each villus is made of cells with highly
folded membranes that have tiny bumps called microvilli
to increase their surface area. But what about single-celled organisms? Caulerpa taxifolia, a green algae
that can reach 30 centimeters long, is believed to be the largest 
single-celled organism in the world thanks to its unique biological hacks. Its surface area is enhanced with
a frond-like structure. It uses photosynthesis to assemble
its own food molecules and it's coenocytic. That means it's a single cell
with multiple nuclei, making it like a multicellular organism
but without the divisions between cells. Yet even the biggest unicellular organisms
have limits, and none grows nearly as large
as the elephant, whale, or bear. But within every big creature
are trillions of minuscule cells perfectly suited in all their tininess to keeping the Earth's giants 
lumbering along.

The elephant is a creature
of epic proportions, and yet it owes its enormity to more
than 1,000 trillion microscopic cells, and on the epically small end of things, there are likely millions 
of unicellular species, yet there are very few we can see
with the naked eye. Why is that? Why don't we get unicellular elephants, or blue whales, or brown bears? To find out, we have to peer into
a cell's guts. This is where most 
of the cell's functions occur, enclosed by a cellular membrane that acts as the doorway into 
and out of the cell. Any resources the cell needs to consume, or waste products it needs to expel, first have to pass through this membrane. But there's a biological quirk 
in this set up. A cell's surface and volume increase

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the list.

However, Question 4 is somewhat related to the concept of cell membrane mentioned in the ground truth MCQ. It talks about why cells need to have a certain ratio of surface area to volume, which is related to the cell membrane's role in exchanging resources and waste products.

So, while not a perfect match, I would say that Question 4 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about ways that cells can increase the amount of surface area per unit of volume. The most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 7: "What is unique about the biological structure of Caulerpa taxifolia?" mentions that Caulerpa taxifolia is coenocytic, which is one of the ways to increase surface area per unit of volume mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, a closer match is found in a combination of Question 5 and Question 7, as they both mention adaptations that increase the surface area per unit of volume (being long and skinny, and being coenocytic). Another related question is Question 2, which mentions the ratio of surface area to volume.

But if I had to choose one question that is the most similar, I would choose Question 7, as it is the only question that mentions one of the specific ways to increase surface area per unit of volume mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

Hello Internet. Thoughts compete for space in your brain:
cat photos, news stories, beliefs structures, funny GIFs, educational videos, not-so-educational
videos and your thinking inventory is limited. A thought without a brain to think it, dies. Now we can treat thoughts as though they're
alive. Specifically alive like germs. That might sound weird but stick with me. Take jokes. Jokes are thought germs that live
in your brain -- and when you tell the joke to another brain, you help it reproduce. Just like when you have the flu and sneeze
to help it reproduce. This germ gets into its host by snot through the mouth and this
one by words through the ear but it's reproduction either way. Logging on to your social media then, is exposing
yourself to everyone's mental sneezes. Each post a glob of snot with an thought germ trying
to get in your brain -- if not for permanent residence then at least long enough to get
you to press the share button and sneeze it with everyone you know. In this analogy then, a funny cat photo with
a perfect caption is a super-flu. Now just as germs exploit weak points in your
immune system, so do thought germs exploit weak points in your brain. A.K.A. emotions. Once inside, thought germs that press emotional
buttons get their hosts to spread them more -- measurably more. Well, except sadness,
sad thought germs don't get very far. Awe is pretty good which is why websites that
construct thought germs like biological weapons arm them with them titles like "7 whatevers
that will blow your mind" or "The Shocking Secret behind... this thing" But anger is the ultimate edge for a thought
germ. Anger, bypasses your mental immune system, and compels you to share it. Being aware of your brain's weak spots is
necessary for good mental hygiene -- like knowing how to wash your hands. Because even
without intentional construction, any thought germ on the Internet can, on its own, grow
more infections as it spreads. To talk about why, lets forget anger for a moment and go
back to that cat photo. Every photo ever taken is a thought germ,
and most die a quick death like the bazillion cat photos (or baby photos) posted on The
Internet that are never shared. But a mildly funny cat photo can grow into so much more,
because just as transatlantic flights were the best thing to happen to germ germs, so
the Internet is the best thing to happen to thought germs. For once on-board, that cat photo is a thought
germ that can leap into other brains. And those brains might share it, and here's the
key point, occasionally, change it -- a Photoshop here, a tweaked caption there. Most changes are terrible, but some make the
thought germ even funnier, getting brains to share it more. Which results in more changes
and a shot at super-stardom. A thus a lowly cat photo can achieve global brain domination.
At least for a few hours. The Internet, with its unparalleled ability
to share and randomly change thought germs can't help but help make them stronger. With jokes, that's awesome -- but with angry
germs not always so awesome. No. Angry germs, the more they're shared undergo
the same process, changing and distorting to be more aggravating. These have a better
chance of spreading than their more accurate but more boring rivals. But like plagues, thought germs can burn though
a population too quickly. Just watch your favorite meme generating machine for a week
and you'll see the life-cycle fly by. However some thought germs have found a way
around burnout. Now, I must warn you, depending on which thought germs live in your head and
which you fight for, the next section might sound *horrifying*. So please keep in mind,
we're going to talk about what makes some thought germs, particularly angry ones, successful
and not how good or bad they are. OK? Deep breath: calm. Though germs can burn out because once everyone
agrees, it's hard to keep talking and thus thinking about them. But if there's an opposing thought germ, an
argument, then the thinking never stops. Disagrement doesn't have to be angry, but again, angry
helps. The more visible an argument gets the more bystanders it draws in which makes it
more visible is why every group from the most innocuous internet forum to The National Conversation
can turn into a double rage storm across the sky in no time. Wait, these though germs aren't competing,
they're co-operating. Working together they reach more brains and hold their thoughts
longer than they could alone. Thought germs on opposite sides of an argument can be symbiotic. One tool symbiotic anger germs in particular
can employ is your-with-us-or-against-us. Whatever thought germ just leaped to the front
of your brain, push it back. This video isn't about that. We're just talking about the tool,
and this one makes it hard, for neutral brains to resist and its diviciveness also grows
its symbiotic partner. This explains why, in some arguments gaining
more allies also gains more enemies. Because though the participants think they're involved
in a firey battle to the death from the anger germs perspective one side is a field of flowers
and the other a flock of butterflies. *Of course* planting more flowers will get you
more butterflies and getting more butterflies will pollinate more flowers. If there is some argument that splits the
population and lasts forever that even the most neutral people find difficult to avoid,
you just might be looking at a super successful pair of symbiotic anger germs that have reached
ecological stability Now, one final depressing though. Uhhhh…
I mean one more Awe inspiring point, that will reveal the secrets of, ahhh -- actually
no it's just depressing. When opposing groups get big they don't really
argue with each other, they *mostly* argue with themselves about how angry the *other*
group makes them. We can actually graph fights on the Internet to see this in action. Each
becomes its own quasi isolated internet, sharing thoughts about the other. You see where this is going, right? Each group becomes a breeding ground for thought
germs *about* the other -- and as before the most enraging -- but not necessarily the most
accurate -- spread fastest. A group almost can't help but construct a totem of the other
so enraging they talk about it all the time -- which, now that you know how though germs
grow, is exactly what make the totem always perfectly maddening. Now, all this isn't to say that there's no
point in arguing. (That's a different video). Or that the Internet isn't amazing, or that
there aren't things worth trying to change peoples' minds about. And thought germs of
all kinds come and go. But it's useful to be aware of how thought
can use our emotions to spread and how the more rapidly a thought is able to spread the
more chances it has to become *even better* at spreading through random changes made to
it. Sometimes that's great, sometimes it's terrible. But if you want to maintain a healthy brain
it pays to be cautious of thoughts that have passed through a lot of other brains and that
poke you where you are weakest. It's your brain -- be hygienic with it.

**Transcript**:
Hello Internet. Thoughts compete for space in your brain:
cat photos, news stories, beliefs structures, funny GIFs, educational videos, not-so-educational
videos and your thinking inventory is limited. A thought without a brain to think it, dies. Now we can treat thoughts as though they're
alive. Specifically alive like germs. That might sound weird but stick with me. Take jokes. Jokes are thought germs that live
in your brain -- and when you tell the joke to another brain, you help it reproduce. Just like when you have the flu and sneeze
to help it reproduce. This germ gets into its host by snot through the mouth and this
one by words through the ear but it's reproduction either way. Logging on to your social media then, is exposing
yourself to everyone's mental sneezes. Each post a glob of snot with an thought germ trying
to get in your brain -- if not for permanent residence then at least long enough to get
you to press the share button and sneeze it with everyone you know. In this analogy then, a funny cat photo with
a perfect caption is a super-flu. Now just as germs exploit weak points in your
immune system, so do thought germs exploit weak points in your brain. A.K.A. emotions. Once inside, thought germs that press emotional
buttons get their hosts to spread them more -- measurably more. Well, except sadness,
sad thought germs don't get very far. Awe is pretty good which is why websites that
construct thought germs like biological weapons arm them with them titles like "7 whatevers
that will blow your mind" or "The Shocking Secret behind... this thing" But anger is the ultimate edge for a thought
germ. Anger, bypasses your mental immune system, and compels you to share it. Being aware of your brain's weak spots is
necessary for good mental hygiene -- like knowing how to wash your hands. Because even
without intentional construction, any thought germ on the Internet can, on its own, grow
more infections as it spreads. To talk about why, lets forget anger for a moment and go
back to that cat photo. Every photo ever taken is a thought germ,
and most die a quick death like the bazillion cat photos (or baby photos) posted on The
Internet that are never shared. But a mildly funny cat photo can grow into so much more,
because just as transatlantic flights were the best thing to happen to germ germs, so
the Internet is the best thing to happen to thought germs. For once on-board, that cat photo is a thought
germ that can leap into other brains. And those brains might share it, and here's the
key point, occasionally, change it -- a Photoshop here, a tweaked caption there. Most changes are terrible, but some make the
thought germ even funnier, getting brains to share it more. Which results in more changes
and a shot at super-stardom. A thus a lowly cat photo can achieve global brain domination.

What does it mean to be one in a million? Not in the greeting card sense, in the scientific sense, where one part per million
is a unit of measurement. Parts per million counts the number
of units of one substance per one million units of another. It can measure concentrations when
a small amount makes a big difference. For example, a concentration of just
35 ppm of carbon monoxide in the air is poisonous to us. We encounter measurements like this
pretty often, but because it's hard to conceptualize
really large numbers, it's difficult to wrap our brain around
what one part per million really means. So here are nine helpful ways
to visualize it. If you had 11,363 pianos-worth 
of piano keys, one of those keys would be about
one part per million. So would a single granule of sugar
among 273 sugar cubes, one second in eleven and a half days, or four dots in the painting, "A Sunday Afternoon on 
the Island of La Grande Jatte." Your bath tub's capacity 
is about 60 gallons, so seven drops of ink would be
one part per million. The English version of the Harry Potter
series has 1,084,170 words, which makes "hippogriff" on page 221
of "The Prisoner of Azkaban" a little less than one part per million. A million kernels of corn 
is about 1,250 ears, so one kernel in that truckload
would be one part per million. There are 10 million bricks in
the Empire State Building, so one part per million 
would be a pile of just ten. And finally, 100 people worked together
to animate this video. Collectively, they have about 10 million
hairs on their heads. Pluck ten of those hairs,
and you have one in a million.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Parts per million, or ppm, is used to measure:

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the one that most closely matches it.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the definition of parts per million (ppm) and its usage. Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 is the closest match, as it asks about the scientific definition of "one in a million," which is related to the concept of ppm.

Although Question 1 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the most similar one in terms of question intent and content. The other generated MCQs are more specific and focus on examples or illustrations of the concept of ppm, rather than its definition.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

1

Please note that the correct option for Question 1 is not specified, and the options provided do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, the question itself is the closest match among the generated MCQs.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of conceptual relevance.

The ground truth MCQ asks about why it is hard for humans to understand large numbers. The closest generated MCQ in terms of conceptual relevance is not available, as none of the generated MCQs address this topic directly.

However, if I had to choose one that is tangentially related, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match, but Question 1 is the least bad option, as it at least deals with the concept of large numbers, albeit in a different context.

Therefore, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is not available, but if I had to choose, it would be Question 1, with the caveat that it is not a good match.

Index: Not Available (or 1, with the aforementioned caveat)

**Transcript**:
What does it mean to be one in a million? Not in the greeting card sense, in the scientific sense, where one part per million
is a unit of measurement. Parts per million counts the number
of units of one substance per one million units of another. It can measure concentrations when
a small amount makes a big difference. For example, a concentration of just
35 ppm of carbon monoxide in the air is poisonous to us. We encounter measurements like this
pretty often, but because it's hard to conceptualize
really large numbers, it's difficult to wrap our brain around
what one part per million really means. So here are nine helpful ways
to visualize it. If you had 11,363 pianos-worth 
of piano keys, one of those keys would be about
one part per million. So would a single granule of sugar
among 273 sugar cubes, one second in eleven and a half days, or four dots in the painting, "A Sunday Afternoon on 
the Island of La Grande Jatte." Your bath tub's capacity 
is about 60 gallons, so seven drops of ink would be
one part per million. The English version of the Harry Potter
series has 1,084,170 words, which makes "hippogriff" on page 221
of "The Prisoner of Azkaban" a little less than one part per million. A million kernels of corn 
is about 1,250 ears, so one kernel in that truckload
would be one part per million. There are 10 million bricks in
the Empire State Building, so one part per million 
would be a pile of just ten. And finally, 100 people worked together
to animate this video. Collectively, they have about 10 million
hairs on their heads. Pluck ten of those hairs,
and you have one in a million.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of the concept of scaling or proportion.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about scaling up the number of fingers to represent a million people. Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is talking about scaling up the number of ears of corn to represent a million kernels of corn. While it's not directly related to fingers or people, it's the closest in terms of the concept of scaling or proportion.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 7

Please note that this is a weak match, and the generated MCQs do not closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of the concept being tested.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the representation of 5 parts per million in terms of hands. However, none of the generated MCQs ask about hands or 5 parts per million. 

But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 9 is the closest in terms of the concept being tested. It asks about the representation of one part per million in terms of hairs, which is similar to the concept of parts per million being asked in the ground truth MCQ.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ would be 9. However, please note that this is a very loose match and the generated MCQs do not accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. When you call customer service and hear this "to ensure quality service your call may be monitored or recorded",
they're not kidding. Over the last year the Marchex Institute
analysed more than 600,000 recorded phone conversations Americans made to businesses in the United States. Turns out, people from Ohio were the most likely to use curse words - the 'A' word, 
the 'F' word and the 'S' word. Washington state residents were
the least likely to use bad words. But what makes a word bad? Oh, be careful because etymologically speaking even the word 'bad' can be considered a bad word. It began in old English as a derogatory term for an effeminate man.
Eighty percent of swear words overheard in public in 1986, 1997 and 2006 were essentially the same.
One third of all counts included the top two - the 'F' word and the 'S' word. Slate's brilliant Lexicon Valley podcast purported that these 10 words makeup about 0.7% of the average English speakers daily vocabulary, which means socially unacceptable words are used almost as often as socially descriptive words.
First person plural pronouns account for about 1% of the words we say everyday. When a bad word is bleeped, it is covered with a 1 kilohertz sine wave, which sounds like this. Son of a ... By the way, the symbols and
squiggles that are used to represent a bad word have a name.
They're called grawlixes. They were named by Mort Walker in his seminal "The Lexicon of Comicana." 
He names a lot of things but most of them show stuff, they don't hide stuff. Why the need to hide bad words, especially if we all pretty much know what's being said?
Well, there is no one single reason bad words are bad. Steven Pinker in his excellent lecture
on the topic delineates five types of swearing.
First of all, some words are bad on purpose.
They are created and/or used with the intent to hurt others.
He calls this "abusive swearing." Using words to insult, humiliate, objectify or marginalise disfavoured people. Now, if that this disfavoured person is God, we're talking about supernatural swearing, which was particularly taboo in Victorian times. It was believed that casually or vainly referring to God would physically injure God himself, literally. So, at the time people were
forced to come up with euphemisms, like "Zounds!" and "Gadzooks!", which  originally meant "God's Wounds!" and "God's Hooks!", referring to the nails driven through the hands of Jesus. Historically, swear words often
came from things we were afraid of, things we perceived as dangerous, stronger than us and mercurial. Such as death, disease and infirmity, sex and sexually transmitted diseases,
as well as body fluids, germy, gross effluvia. Words for those gross things became gross
and bad in and of themselves, uncouth to speak. But not all words for gross things are socially unacceptable, which brings us to Pinker's second type of swearing - emphatic swearing. Emphatic swearing is where the
taboo-ness of bad words becomes quite practical.
You wouldn't usually use those words but when you really want to convey that your current
emotions matter more to you than proper social conduct, you can use them. Dysphemism. A euphemism is kind, acceptable word
that allows you to talk about something unpleasant while simultaneously letting everyone know you totally get that it's unpleasant and want to respect that. For instance, if you want to be
professional, you wouldn't say s***. You might say 'defecate'. If, on the other hand,
you really want to drive home just how unpleasant the experience was, dysphemisms can help out a lot. It wasn't a bag of canine defecation you found on your front porch, it was a s*** bag of hot dog s***.
Both of these words refer to pretty much the same thing but they have different levels of
social acceptability and that's very helpful. It means word choice allows us to not only refer to things in the real world but also to how we feel about them. If both these words had the same level
of social acceptance we might even have to find new, badder
words so as not to lose the power language currently has to express emotion, repulsion and disgust. But when it comes to two words
referring to the same thing, but with different levels of social acceptance,
who decides which one's good and which one's bad?
Well, historically, many of the bad words we use today are the result of class differences. In medieval England, the lower-class Saxons spoke a Germanic tongue while the upper-class Normans spoke a language related to French and Latin. English, as we know it today,
contains many consequences of their differences. 
The lower class worked with animals and from them we get animal names. The upper class only ate the animals, which is where
the names of the meat come from. Today's swear words are similar.
Defecation stems from fancy pants Latin, whereas the less classy s*** is Germanic. There's also idiomatic swearing, where nothing is being emphasized. No dysphemism is meant;
instead, it's an easygoing type of swearing that shows an atmosphere is casual. Bad words can be used,
we're all close here. It's okay to swear, we're all cool. Cathartic swearing is a bit different. It gives us "lalochezia," the medical term for the relief swearing provides when you're in pain. In the brain, swearing seems to involve different regions
than regular language, which may explain why people with
aphasia caused by brain damage struggle to comprehend or construct spoken words but yet are fluent at swearing. Or why people with coprolalia control normal language just fine, but involuntarily utter profanity, an obscene words. It turns out swearing may be centralized in the limbic system, along with the motions.
Many animals make automatic noises when in pain or threat to startle or intimidate attackers, or to let others know what's going on. In humans, bad words are great for this purpose. Their taboo-ness makes them special.
People wouldn't use them otherwise, so they are great alarms. Swearing is changing.
Some bad words are being used more and more frequently. Of the seven words, George
Carlin said you could never say on television. Today, every second 22 of them are sent out on Twitter. So, what will swearing look like in the future? It probably won't go away altogether, it's too useful. But the words we don't like will likely change. History has shown that as disease
becomes less scary and sex and the supernatural more personal, words related to them 
become less taboo and more common; 
whereas words that were common in the past are increasingly unpleasant. Perhaps, in the future, spurt not by runaway political correctness but by wider knowledge, words like "schizo", "mental", "aspy", or even "depressed" will take the square stage. Or as John McWhorter ventured,
words centered around class and the gap between opportunity and disadvantage will become more taboo. Salt of the Earth, trash, chav, pikey, urban as a pejorative. When McKay Hatch started a "No Cussing Club" at his school, his campaign became the
target of so many online jokes and insults for being lame or anti-free speech. On his book, he literally subtitled his own name "the most cyberbullied kid in the world." People care about this stuff.
Is it censorship to tell us what we can and cannot say or is it a safety seal, ensuring certain
dysphemisms don't get worn down to a quotidian bluntness like every other word? Or is that badness of bad words a boundary, a moving boundary of we reject - sometimes arbitrary, sometimes irrational, but always moving
in the direction of acceptance moving forward? Crime and inequality have existed ever since they could. But when N.W.A released a
reaction, in the form of a song with bad word in the title, "F*** the Police",
the Federal Bureau of Investigations released a statement against the song.
It was the only time, up until then and since,
the FBI has ever issued an official statement about a work of art. Bad words have power. If you wanna push for change you'll need something to push. If everything's fine, nothing's cool. So, bad words are the precipitate of a larger reaction - the process of us slowly becoming what we want to become. That's some deep s***. And as always,  thanks for watching.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of swear words and their frequency.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 2: What is the name of the podcast that explored the frequency and types of swear words? Options: A. Lexicon Valley, B. The Daily, C. The Conversation, D. Word Watch

Although this question does not ask about the percentage of swear words in daily conversation, it does mention the podcast "Lexicon Valley" which is mentioned in the transcript as the source of the information about the top ten swear words making up 0.7% of the average English speaker's daily vocabulary.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest that a new question should be generated that directly asks about the percentage of swear words in daily conversation.

But if I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that none of them are a good match, but Question 2 is the closest.

Eighty percent of swear words overheard in public in 1986, 1997 and 2006 were essentially the same.
One third of all counts included the top two - the 'F' word and the 'S' word. Slate's brilliant Lexicon Valley podcast purported that these 10 words makeup about 0.7% of the average English speakers daily vocabulary, which means socially unacceptable words are used almost as often as socially descriptive words.
First person plural pronouns account for about 1% of the words we say everyday. When a bad word is bleeped, it is covered with a 1 kilohertz sine wave, which sounds like this. Son of a ... By the way, the symbols and
squiggles that are used to represent a bad word have a name.
They're called grawlixes. They were named by Mort Walker in his seminal "The Lexicon of Comicana." 
He names a lot of things but most of them show stuff, they don't hide stuff. Why the need to hide bad words, especially if we all pretty much know what's being said?
Well, there is no one single reason bad words are bad. Steven Pinker in his excellent lecture
on the topic delineates five types of swearing.
First of all, some words are bad on purpose.
They are created and/or used with the intent to hurt others.
He calls this "abusive swearing." Using words to insult, humiliate, objectify or marginalise disfavoured people. Now, if that this disfavoured person is God, we're talking about supernatural swearing, which was particularly taboo in Victorian times. It was believed that casually or vainly referring to God would physically injure God himself, literally. So, at the time people were
forced to come up with euphemisms, like "Zounds!" and "Gadzooks!", which  originally meant "God's Wounds!" and "God's Hooks!", referring to the nails driven through the hands of Jesus. Historically, swear words often
came from things we were afraid of, things we perceived as dangerous, stronger than us and mercurial. Such as death, disease and infirmity, sex and sexually transmitted diseases,
as well as body fluids, germy, gross effluvia. Words for those gross things became gross
and bad in and of themselves, uncouth to speak. But not all words for gross things are socially unacceptable, which brings us to Pinker's second type of swearing - emphatic swearing. Emphatic swearing is where the
taboo-ness of bad words becomes quite practical.
You wouldn't usually use those words but when you really want to convey that your current
emotions matter more to you than proper social conduct, you can use them. Dysphemism. A euphemism is kind, acceptable word
that allows you to talk about something unpleasant while simultaneously letting everyone know you totally get that it's unpleasant and want to respect that. For instance, if you want to be
professional, you wouldn't say s***. You might say 'defecate'. If, on the other hand,
you really want to drive home just how unpleasant the experience was, dysphemisms can help out a lot. It wasn't a bag of canine defecation you found on your front porch, it was a s*** bag of hot dog s***.
Both of these words refer to pretty much the same thing but they have different levels of
social acceptability and that's very helpful. It means word choice allows us to not only refer to things in the real world but also to how we feel about them. If both these words had the same level
of social acceptance we might even have to find new, badder
words so as not to lose the power language currently has to express emotion, repulsion and disgust. But when it comes to two words
referring to the same thing, but with different levels of social acceptance,
who decides which one's good and which one's bad?
Well, historically, many of the bad words we use today are the result of class differences. In medieval England, the lower-class Saxons spoke a Germanic tongue while the upper-class Normans spoke a language related to French and Latin. English, as we know it today,
contains many consequences of their differences. 
The lower class worked with animals and from them we get animal names. The upper class only ate the animals, which is where
the names of the meat come from. Today's swear words are similar.
Defecation stems from fancy pants Latin, whereas the less classy s*** is Germanic. There's also idiomatic swearing, where nothing is being emphasized. No dysphemism is meant;
instead, it's an easygoing type of swearing that shows an atmosphere is casual. Bad words can be used,
we're all close here. It's okay to swear, we're all cool. Cathartic swearing is a bit different. It gives us "lalochezia," the medical term for the relief swearing provides when you're in pain. In the brain, swearing seems to involve different regions
than regular language, which may explain why people with
aphasia caused by brain damage struggle to comprehend or construct spoken words but yet are fluent at swearing. Or why people with coprolalia control normal language just fine, but involuntarily utter profanity, an obscene words. It turns out swearing may be centralized in the limbic system, along with the motions.
Many animals make automatic noises when in pain or threat to startle or intimidate attackers, or to let others know what's going on. In humans, bad words are great for this purpose. Their taboo-ness makes them special.
People wouldn't use them otherwise, so they are great alarms. Swearing is changing.
Some bad words are being used more and more frequently. Of the seven words, George
Carlin said you could never say on television. Today, every second 22 of them are sent out on Twitter. So, what will swearing look like in the future? It probably won't go away altogether, it's too useful. But the words we don't like will likely change. History has shown that as disease
becomes less scary and sex and the supernatural more personal, words related to them 
become less taboo and more common; 
whereas words that were common in the past are increasingly unpleasant. Perhaps, in the future, spurt not by runaway political correctness but by wider knowledge, words like "schizo", "mental", "aspy", or even "depressed" will take the square stage. Or as John McWhorter ventured,
words centered around class and the gap between opportunity and disadvantage will become more taboo. Salt of the Earth, trash, chav, pikey, urban as a pejorative. When McKay Hatch started a "No Cussing Club" at his school, his campaign became the
target of so many online jokes and insults for being lame or anti-free speech. On his book, he literally subtitled his own name "the most cyberbullied kid in the world." People care about this stuff.
Is it censorship to tell us what we can and cannot say or is it a safety seal, ensuring certain
dysphemisms don't get worn down to a quotidian bluntness like every other word? Or is that badness of bad words a boundary, a moving boundary of we reject - sometimes arbitrary, sometimes irrational, but always moving
in the direction of acceptance moving forward? Crime and inequality have existed ever since they could. But when N.W.A released a
reaction, in the form of a song with bad word in the title, "F*** the Police",
the Federal Bureau of Investigations released a statement against the song.
It was the only time, up until then and since,
the FBI has ever issued an official statement about a work of art. Bad words have power. If you wanna push for change you'll need something to push. If everything's fine, nothing's cool. So, bad words are the precipitate of a larger reaction - the process of us slowly becoming what we want to become. That's some deep s***. And as always,  thanks for watching.

**Transcript**:
There's an organism 
that changed the world. It caused both the first mass extinction
in Earth's history and also paved the way for complex life. How? By sending the first free oxygen
molecules into our atmosphere, and they did all this
as single-celled life forms. They're cyanobacteria, and the story of these simple organisms that don't even have nuclei 
or any other organelles is a pivotal chapter 
in the story of life on Earth. Earth's atmosphere wasn't always 
the oxygen-rich mixture we breathe today. 3.5 billion years ago, the atmosphere
was mostly nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. Almost all oxygen was locked up 
in molecules like water, not floating around in the air. The oceans were populated by
anaerobic microbes. Those are simple, unicellular life forms
that thrive without oxygen and get energy by scavenging
what molecules they find. But somewhere between 
2.5 and 3.5 billion years ago, one of these microbial species, probably floating 
on the surface of the ocean, evolved a new ability: photosynthesis. Structures in their cell membrane
could harness the energy from sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water
into oxygen gas and sugars, which they could use for energy. Those organisms were the ancestors
of what we now call cyanobacteria. Their bluish color comes from 
the blue-green pigments that capture the sunlight they need. Photosynthesis gave those ancient bacteria
a huge advantage over other species. They could now produce their own energy from an almost endless supply 
of raw ingredients, so their populations exploded and they started polluting the atmosphere
with a new waste product: oxygen. At first, the trickle of extra oxygen was
soaked up by chemical reactions with iron or decomposing cells, but after a few hundred million years, the cyanobacteria were producing oxygen
faster than it could be absorbed, and the gas started building up
in the atmosphere. That was a big problem for the rest
of Earth's inhabitants. Oxygen-rich air 
was actually toxic to them. The result? About 2.5 billion years ago was a mass
extinction of virtually all life on Earth, which barely spared the cyanobacteria. Geologists call this
the Great Oxygenation Event, or even the Oxygen Catastrophe. That wasn't the only problem. Methane had been acting as a potent
greenhouse gas that kept the Earth warm, but now, the extra oxygen reacted with
methane to form carbon dioxide and water, which don't trap as much heat. The thinner atmospheric blanket caused Earth's first, 
and possibly longest, ice age, the Huronian Glaciation. The planet was basically 
one giant snowball for several hundred million years. Eventually, life adjusted. Aerobic organisms, 
which can use oxygen for energy, started sopping up some of the excess
gas in the atmosphere. The oxygen concentration rose and fell until eventually it reached 
the approximate 21% we have today. And being able to use 
the chemical energy in oxygen gave organisms the boost they needed
to diversify and evolve more complex forms. Cyanobacteria had a part 
to play in that story, too. Hundreds of millions of years ago, some other prehistoric microbe
swallowed a cyanobacterium whole in a process called endosymbiosis. In doing so, that microbe acquired
its own internal photosynthesis factory. This was the ancestor of plant cells. And cyanobacteria became chloroplasts, the organelles that carry out 
photosynthesis today. Cyanobacteria are still around
in almost every environment on Earth: oceans, fresh water, soil, antarctic rocks, sloth fur. They still pump oxygen
into the atmosphere, and they also pull nitrogen out to
fertilize the plants they helped create. We wouldn't recognize life on Earth
without them. But also thanks to them, we almost didn't have 
life on Earth at all.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the time period when cyanobacteria evolved as the first oxygen-producing photosynthesizers. The closest generated MCQ would be one that mentions cyanobacteria and their evolution or characteristics.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 mentions cyanobacteria, but it asks about the type of organisms that sent the first free oxygen molecules into the Earth's atmosphere, which is not directly related to the evolution of cyanobacteria.

However, since Question 1 is the only one that mentions cyanobacteria as an option, I would say that it is the closest match, although it is still not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
There's an organism 
that changed the world. It caused both the first mass extinction
in Earth's history and also paved the way for complex life. How? By sending the first free oxygen
molecules into our atmosphere, and they did all this
as single-celled life forms. They're cyanobacteria, and the story of these simple organisms that don't even have nuclei 
or any other organelles is a pivotal chapter 
in the story of life on Earth. Earth's atmosphere wasn't always 
the oxygen-rich mixture we breathe today. 3.5 billion years ago, the atmosphere
was mostly nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. Almost all oxygen was locked up 
in molecules like water, not floating around in the air. The oceans were populated by
anaerobic microbes. Those are simple, unicellular life forms
that thrive without oxygen and get energy by scavenging
what molecules they find. But somewhere between 
2.5 and 3.5 billion years ago, one of these microbial species, probably floating 
on the surface of the ocean, evolved a new ability: photosynthesis. Structures in their cell membrane
could harness the energy from sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water
into oxygen gas and sugars, which they could use for energy. Those organisms were the ancestors
of what we now call cyanobacteria. Their bluish color comes from 
the blue-green pigments that capture the sunlight they need. Photosynthesis gave those ancient bacteria
a huge advantage over other species. They could now produce their own energy from an almost endless supply 
of raw ingredients, so their populations exploded and they started polluting the atmosphere
with a new waste product: oxygen. At first, the trickle of extra oxygen was
soaked up by chemical reactions with iron or decomposing cells, but after a few hundred million years, the cyanobacteria were producing oxygen
faster than it could be absorbed, and the gas started building up
in the atmosphere. That was a big problem for the rest
of Earth's inhabitants. Oxygen-rich air 
was actually toxic to them. The result? About 2.5 billion years ago was a mass
extinction of virtually all life on Earth, which barely spared the cyanobacteria. Geologists call this
the Great Oxygenation Event, or even the Oxygen Catastrophe. That wasn't the only problem. Methane had been acting as a potent
greenhouse gas that kept the Earth warm, but now, the extra oxygen reacted with
methane to form carbon dioxide and water, which don't trap as much heat. The thinner atmospheric blanket caused Earth's first, 
and possibly longest, ice age, the Huronian Glaciation. The planet was basically 
one giant snowball for several hundred million years. Eventually, life adjusted. Aerobic organisms, 
which can use oxygen for energy, started sopping up some of the excess
gas in the atmosphere. The oxygen concentration rose and fell until eventually it reached 
the approximate 21% we have today. And being able to use 
the chemical energy in oxygen gave organisms the boost they needed
to diversify and evolve more complex forms. Cyanobacteria had a part 
to play in that story, too. Hundreds of millions of years ago, some other prehistoric microbe
swallowed a cyanobacterium whole in a process called endosymbiosis. In doing so, that microbe acquired
its own internal photosynthesis factory. This was the ancestor of plant cells. And cyanobacteria became chloroplasts, the organelles that carry out 
photosynthesis today. Cyanobacteria are still around
in almost every environment on Earth: oceans, fresh water, soil, antarctic rocks, sloth fur. They still pump oxygen
into the atmosphere, and they also pull nitrogen out to
fertilize the plants they helped create. We wouldn't recognize life on Earth
without them. But also thanks to them, we almost didn't have 
life on Earth at all.

**Transcript**:
Today, I'm gonna show you how to make this really cool magnetic slime. It's fun to play with, and to watch what happens when you introduce a magnet. Start, by taking a bottle of Elmer's Glue. You might find other PVA glue also works. Take the top off, and empty it out into a bowl. Fill the bottle halfway with water. Screw the lid back on and give it a good shake, to clean the inside of the bottle. Then empty it in to the bowl as well. Next, we need a packet of Borax powder. Take a tablespoonful. And stir it into a small jug of water until it dissolves. If you haven't got any Borax powder, you could try using a laundry detergent like Tide or a bottle of liquid starch. You can check the ingredients to see if they contain Borax. And carefully use some of that instead of the solution i'm making now. Next, we need to mix the PVA, and slowly pour in a small amount of the Borax solution. You don't need a lot, you can always add more later. Keep mixing it with your spoon and you should find very quickly it starts to clump together and looks slimy. Keep on mixing it and after a while, you can use your hands to mold it all together. Keep ongoing and you should end up with a nice ball of slime like this. Pretty cool, huh? It strechy and slimy and really fun to play with. You can put it on the table, and carefully watch it melt into a blob. To make it magnetic, we're going to add some iron filings. Pour some on to the slime. And work it into the mixture. I'm adding a little bit more, and really folding it in. You need to make sure, theres no pockets of filings, like this which haven't been mixed in. So keep ongoing. And when it's ready, you should have a light grey slime. Now if we take a magnet, and hold it close by, you can see how it reacts. The slime's attracted to the magnet and you can make it move. You've got to be quick or it'll stick to the magnet. These neodymium magnets are really powerful. And you can watch what happens, when they get stuck into the slime. Pretty cool, huh? I have speeded up some of the footage, so it's quicker to watch. It can be difficult to get the slime and the iron filings back off the magnet. You can stack magnets, to make them stronger. And carefully watch what happens as the slime jumps up. And wraps itself around. It's great fun to play around with. And watch it all move. If you try to keep this slime, to use again on a later day, you'll probably find the iron filings have gotten rusty and turned it all brown and disgusting. So I wouldn't try keeping it. I hope you've enjoyed watching this video. If you want to see more, then click on the links on the right hand side. Or take a look at my youtube channel page. Stay safe, have fun and as always, thanks for watching! Doo Doo Doo Doo music.

[MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: So you've
heard of Andy Warhol and you know he did the
soup cans and the portraits. But today, I want to tell
you why his work really is interesting and worth
your consideration. Here's the case for Andy Warhol. You know him to look like this. But Andrew Warhola
was born in Pittsburgh to Slovakian immigrant
parents and started out looking like this. He grew up sickly and
spend a lot of time at home drawing with his mom. But he eventually
escaped to New York, after graduating from
Carnegie Tech in 1949. He changed his name and
quickly became a success as a commercial illustrator. He developed a
signature technique that allowed him to trace
and copy images and create a delicate blotted line. It was an early instance of
his affinity for automation or finding other people
or processes that do the work for and with him. He was determined to make it in
the field of so-called fine art and started shopping
for a way in. Instead of making art
for advertisements, he started making
advertisements as art, choosing subject matter
that would find traction with the emerging
field of pop art. He made paintings of Coca
Cola; S&H green stamps; and, of course,
Campbell's soup cans. He saw these things
as a common language, saying what's great about this
country is that America started the tradition where the richest
consumers by essentially the same things as the poorest. And it wasn't about the
individual things so much as the sheer
abundance of things, which reflected the spread of
mass manufacturing and growing postwar American
consumer culture. Warhol started out
using rubber stamps and stencils to make
these paintings. But soon landed
on silk screening as a way to speed things up. He created his
well-known factory and set to work with
assistants, rolling out product after product, displaying them
in warehouse-like arrangements. He was also interested in
products of the human variety and started making
paintings of celebrities, reproducing images from
publicity stills, newspapers, and magazines, making shrew
commentary on the celebrity as commodity. There are number of subjects
that recur Warhol's work, shoes, products, money,
celebrities, rich people, disaster, death, himself; shoes,
products, money, celebrities, rich people, disaster,
death, himself. But these weren't just
Warhol's obsessions. They are deeply reflective
of the culture of the time. If you ascribed to the theory
that the 20th century was the American century,
then Warhol's work takes on even more importance. His work charts the
development of our obsession with fame and questions the
growing commercialization and uniformity of most
areas of American life. Warhol was an extremely
astute businessperson, who formed his first
corporate entity, Andy Warhol Enterprises, in 1957. And he never really
stopped working for hire. He made thousands of
commissioned portraits, the first of which was this one
of art collector Ethel Scull, based on photos taken
by a machine or rather a photo booth. By the 1970s,
commissioned portraits were a solid chunk
of Warhol's income. Anyone could have their
portrait made for $25,000, with additional canvases
available at discounted rates. Along with his services,
Warhol was also keen to trade on his
own image, creating numerous self-portraits
throughout his career and offering himself
up for endorsements. And, of course,
Warhol was not just an artist, but also a
filmmaker, band manager, magazine publisher,
and TV producer, who fearlessly explored
and embraced new media. From the 1950s until his
untimely death in 1987, Warhol was a shape shifter,
always open to the new, always innovating, and
always reflecting the time. Like Jay Z, but far
earlier, he understood that to be an artist
in a market economy meant not being a businessman,
but being a business, man. And he turned himself into
a globally recognized brand. People debate whether
Warhol defined an ad-driven, factory-made
culture or was defined by it. But his work remains important
because what mattered to Warhol proved prophetic. People called him a sellout. But by laying bare the
relationship between commerce and art, Warhol nullified
the very idea of a sellout. And in the process
made possible the work Jeff Koons, Shepard Fairey, and
so many contemporary artists. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about Warhol's interest in exploring the topic of commodification through his work. While there isn't a direct match, I found that Question 9 is somewhat related, as it mentions specific products that Warhol made paintings of, which is connected to the idea of commodification.

However, a closer match would be a question that explicitly mentions the idea of commerce, consumer culture, or the relationship between art and commerce, which is the core of the ground truth MCQ.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs explicitly address this topic. Therefore, I must conclude that there isn't a direct match.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related, I would suggest Question 9, but with a note that it's not a direct match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 9 (with a note that it's not a direct match)

Please note that the generated MCQs seem to focus more on factual information about Warhol's life, work, and techniques, rather than exploring the themes and ideas behind his art, which is the focus of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: So you've
heard of Andy Warhol and you know he did the
soup cans and the portraits. But today, I want to tell
you why his work really is interesting and worth
your consideration. Here's the case for Andy Warhol. You know him to look like this. But Andrew Warhola
was born in Pittsburgh to Slovakian immigrant
parents and started out looking like this. He grew up sickly and
spend a lot of time at home drawing with his mom. But he eventually
escaped to New York, after graduating from
Carnegie Tech in 1949. He changed his name and
quickly became a success as a commercial illustrator. He developed a
signature technique that allowed him to trace
and copy images and create a delicate blotted line. It was an early instance of
his affinity for automation or finding other people
or processes that do the work for and with him. He was determined to make it in
the field of so-called fine art and started shopping
for a way in. Instead of making art
for advertisements, he started making
advertisements as art, choosing subject matter
that would find traction with the emerging
field of pop art. He made paintings of Coca
Cola; S&H green stamps; and, of course,
Campbell's soup cans. He saw these things
as a common language, saying what's great about this
country is that America started the tradition where the richest
consumers by essentially the same things as the poorest. And it wasn't about the
individual things so much as the sheer
abundance of things, which reflected the spread of
mass manufacturing and growing postwar American
consumer culture. Warhol started out
using rubber stamps and stencils to make
these paintings. But soon landed
on silk screening as a way to speed things up. He created his
well-known factory and set to work with
assistants, rolling out product after product, displaying them
in warehouse-like arrangements. He was also interested in
products of the human variety and started making
paintings of celebrities, reproducing images from
publicity stills, newspapers, and magazines, making shrew
commentary on the celebrity as commodity. There are number of subjects
that recur Warhol's work, shoes, products, money,
celebrities, rich people, disaster, death, himself; shoes,
products, money, celebrities, rich people, disaster,
death, himself. But these weren't just
Warhol's obsessions. They are deeply reflective
of the culture of the time. If you ascribed to the theory
that the 20th century was the American century,
then Warhol's work takes on even more importance. His work charts the
development of our obsession with fame and questions the
growing commercialization and uniformity of most
areas of American life. Warhol was an extremely
astute businessperson, who formed his first
corporate entity, Andy Warhol Enterprises, in 1957. And he never really
stopped working for hire. He made thousands of
commissioned portraits, the first of which was this one
of art collector Ethel Scull, based on photos taken
by a machine or rather a photo booth. By the 1970s,
commissioned portraits were a solid chunk
of Warhol's income. Anyone could have their
portrait made for $25,000, with additional canvases
available at discounted rates. Along with his services,
Warhol was also keen to trade on his
own image, creating numerous self-portraits
throughout his career and offering himself
up for endorsements. And, of course,
Warhol was not just an artist, but also a
filmmaker, band manager, magazine publisher,
and TV producer, who fearlessly explored
and embraced new media. From the 1950s until his
untimely death in 1987, Warhol was a shape shifter,
always open to the new, always innovating, and
always reflecting the time. Like Jay Z, but far
earlier, he understood that to be an artist
in a market economy meant not being a businessman,
but being a business, man. And he turned himself into
a globally recognized brand. People debate whether
Warhol defined an ad-driven, factory-made
culture or was defined by it. But his work remains important
because what mattered to Warhol proved prophetic. People called him a sellout. But by laying bare the
relationship between commerce and art, Warhol nullified
the very idea of a sellout. And in the process
made possible the work Jeff Koons, Shepard Fairey, and
so many contemporary artists. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about where Warhol began his career when he moved to New York. The correct answer is "in advertising." 

Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 mentions Warhol's technique that allowed him to create a delicate blotted line, which he developed as a commercial illustrator. Although this question does not directly ask about where Warhol began his career, it is related to his work in advertising.

However, a more relevant question is not available among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, as it asks about Warhol's first corporate entity, Andy Warhol Enterprises, which he formed in 1957. This question is related to Warhol's business and commercial activities, but it does not directly ask about where he began his career.

Therefore, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3, but with a low confidence level.

**Transcript**:
While touring the remains of
ancient Alexandria, Egypt, there are a few things that
present-day explorers should look for. First, as you travel along 
the Great Harbor, keep your eyes open 
for large columns and statues. Across the bay to your left is the island
where the Great Lighthouse once stood. And as you make your way through
the palaces of the Royal Quarter and reach the area where
the Library of Alexandria once stood, keep your eyes open for sharks. Because if you visit this section
of Alexandria, you'll be fifteen feet deep
in the Mediterranean Sea. Though people are most familiar
with Plato's fictional Atlantis, many real underwater cities 
actually exist. Places like Alexandria, Port Royal, Jamaica, and Pavlopetri, Greece. Sunken cities are studied by scientists to help us understand the lives
of our ancestors, the dynamic nature of our planet, and the impact of each on the other. Water is essential for life,
food sources, and transport, so many cities have been built
along coast lines and river banks. However, these benefits also come
with risks because natural forces that can sink
a city are at their doorstep. Take, for instance, an earthquake. June 7, 1692 seemed like a normal morning
in Port Royal, Jamaica, then one of the richest ports 
in the world, but when a massive earthquake struck, two-thirds of Port Royal immediately
sank to its rooftops. Today, many buildings 
and elements of everyday life remain surprisingly intact 
on the sea floor, frozen in time. That includes a 300-year-old pocket watch
that stopped at 11:43, the moment Port Royal slipped
beneath the Carribean. And during the winter of 373 BCE, the Greek city of Helike was struck
by an earthquake so strong that it liquefied the sandy ground
upon which the city was built. Minutes later, a tsunami struck the city, and Helike and its inhabitants
sunk downwards into the Mediterranean Sea. Centuries later, Roman tourists would sail
on the lagoon that formed and peer down at the city's remains. Earthquakes are sudden, 
unpredictable disasters that have drowned cities in an instant. Luckily, however, throughout history, the majority of sunken cities were not
submerged by a single cataclysmic event, but by a combination 
of more gradual processes. For instance, Pavlopetri,
the oldest known sunken city, was built on the southern coastline
of Greece 5,000 years ago. It's an example of a city
that was submerged due to what is called 
isostatic sea level change. 18,000 years ago when the Ice Age ended, glaciers began melting and the sea level
rose globally until about 5,000 years ago. Isostatic sea level change isn't caused
by that melt water, but rather the Earth's crust slowly
springing back from the released weight of the glaciers, making some places rise,
and others sink. The ground around Pavlopetri
is still sinking at an average rate 
of a millimeter per year. But the ancient inhabitants were able
to move gradually inland over several generations before they finally abandoned the city
about 3,000 years ago. Today, divers swim over the streets
of Pavlopetri and peer through ancient door jams into the foundations of houses 
and community buildings. They learn about the people who lived
there by observing what they left behind. Natural geological events,
such as earthquakes and tsunamis, will continue to shape our continents, just as they have for millions of years. As increased global warming melts
our polar ice caps at accelerated rates and sea levels rise, we will be forced to adapt, like Pavlopetri's inhabitants. Undoubtedly, over the coming centuries, some of the coastal areas 
that we live in today will eventually be claimed 
by the water, too - cities like Venice, New Orleans, Amsterdam, Miami, and Tokyo. Imagine what future civilizations
will learn about us as they swim around the ancient ruins
of the cities that we live in today.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Here's why:

- Question intent: Both the ground truth MCQ and Question 8 aim to assess the understanding of isostatic sea level change. The ground truth MCQ asks about the areas affected by isostatic sea level change, while Question 8 asks about the nature of the process itself.

- Options: Although the options in Question 8 do not exactly match those in the ground truth MCQ, they do relate to the concept of isostatic sea level change. Option B in Question 8, which states that isostatic sea level change is a gradual and slow process, aligns with the explanation provided in the transcript for the ground truth MCQ's correct answer (A. Localized areas).

- Content: Both questions deal with the concept of isostatic sea level change, which is discussed in the transcript as a gradual process that affects localized areas.

While there isn't a perfect match among the generated MCQs, Question 8 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
While touring the remains of
ancient Alexandria, Egypt, there are a few things that
present-day explorers should look for. First, as you travel along 
the Great Harbor, keep your eyes open 
for large columns and statues. Across the bay to your left is the island
where the Great Lighthouse once stood. And as you make your way through
the palaces of the Royal Quarter and reach the area where
the Library of Alexandria once stood, keep your eyes open for sharks. Because if you visit this section
of Alexandria, you'll be fifteen feet deep
in the Mediterranean Sea. Though people are most familiar
with Plato's fictional Atlantis, many real underwater cities 
actually exist. Places like Alexandria, Port Royal, Jamaica, and Pavlopetri, Greece. Sunken cities are studied by scientists to help us understand the lives
of our ancestors, the dynamic nature of our planet, and the impact of each on the other. Water is essential for life,
food sources, and transport, so many cities have been built
along coast lines and river banks. However, these benefits also come
with risks because natural forces that can sink
a city are at their doorstep. Take, for instance, an earthquake. June 7, 1692 seemed like a normal morning
in Port Royal, Jamaica, then one of the richest ports 
in the world, but when a massive earthquake struck, two-thirds of Port Royal immediately
sank to its rooftops. Today, many buildings 
and elements of everyday life remain surprisingly intact 
on the sea floor, frozen in time. That includes a 300-year-old pocket watch
that stopped at 11:43, the moment Port Royal slipped
beneath the Carribean. And during the winter of 373 BCE, the Greek city of Helike was struck
by an earthquake so strong that it liquefied the sandy ground
upon which the city was built. Minutes later, a tsunami struck the city, and Helike and its inhabitants
sunk downwards into the Mediterranean Sea. Centuries later, Roman tourists would sail
on the lagoon that formed and peer down at the city's remains. Earthquakes are sudden, 
unpredictable disasters that have drowned cities in an instant. Luckily, however, throughout history, the majority of sunken cities were not
submerged by a single cataclysmic event, but by a combination 
of more gradual processes. For instance, Pavlopetri,
the oldest known sunken city, was built on the southern coastline
of Greece 5,000 years ago. It's an example of a city
that was submerged due to what is called 
isostatic sea level change. 18,000 years ago when the Ice Age ended, glaciers began melting and the sea level
rose globally until about 5,000 years ago. Isostatic sea level change isn't caused
by that melt water, but rather the Earth's crust slowly
springing back from the released weight of the glaciers, making some places rise,
and others sink. The ground around Pavlopetri
is still sinking at an average rate 
of a millimeter per year. But the ancient inhabitants were able
to move gradually inland over several generations before they finally abandoned the city
about 3,000 years ago. Today, divers swim over the streets
of Pavlopetri and peer through ancient door jams into the foundations of houses 
and community buildings. They learn about the people who lived
there by observing what they left behind. Natural geological events,
such as earthquakes and tsunamis, will continue to shape our continents, just as they have for millions of years. As increased global warming melts
our polar ice caps at accelerated rates and sea levels rise, we will be forced to adapt, like Pavlopetri's inhabitants. Undoubtedly, over the coming centuries, some of the coastal areas 
that we live in today will eventually be claimed 
by the water, too - cities like Venice, New Orleans, Amsterdam, Miami, and Tokyo. Imagine what future civilizations
will learn about us as they swim around the ancient ruins
of the cities that we live in today.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the natural phenomena that can contribute to sinking a city. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 4, which is an analytical question. Although it does not directly ask about the natural phenomena, it discusses the characteristics of earthquakes, which is one of the options in the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must note that Question 4 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only discusses earthquakes and does not mention other natural phenomena like liquefaction, sea level change, or tsunamis.

If I had to choose an index, I would suggest Question 4, but with the caveat that it is not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
We have historical records that allow us
to know how the ancient Greeks dressed, how they lived, how they fought ... but how did they think? One natural idea is that the deepest
aspects of human thought -- our ability to imagine, to be conscious, to dream -- have always been the same. Another possibility is that the social transformations
that have shaped our culture may have also changed
the structural columns of human thought. We may all have different
opinions about this. Actually, it's a long-standing
philosophical debate. But is this question
even amenable to science? Here I'd like to propose that in the same way we can reconstruct
how the ancient Greek cities looked just based on a few bricks, that the writings of a culture
are the archaeological records, the fossils, of human thought. And in fact, doing some form of psychological analysis of some of the most ancient
books of human culture, Julian Jaynes came up in the '70s
with a very wild and radical hypothesis: that only 3,000 years ago, humans were what today
we would call schizophrenics. And he made this claim based on the fact that the first
humans described in these books behaved consistently, in different traditions
and in different places of the world, as if they were hearing and obeying voices that they perceived
as coming from the Gods, or from the muses ... what today we would call hallucinations. And only then, as time went on, they began to recognize
that they were the creators, the owners of these inner voices. And with this, they gained introspection: the ability to think
about their own thoughts. So Jaynes's theory is that consciousness, at least in the way we perceive it today, where we feel that we are the pilots
of our own existence -- is a quite recent cultural development. And this theory is quite spectacular, but it has an obvious problem which is that it's built on just a few
and very specific examples. So the question is whether the theory that introspection built up in human
history only about 3,000 years ago can be examined in a quantitative
and objective manner. And the problem of how
to go about this is quite obvious. It's not like Plato woke up one day
and then he wrote, "Hello, I'm Plato, and as of today, I have
a fully introspective consciousness." (Laughter) And this tells us actually
what is the essence of the problem. We need to find the emergence
of a concept that's never said. The word introspection
does not appear a single time in the books we want to analyze. So our way to solve this
is to build the space of words. This is a huge space
that contains all words in such a way that the distance
between any two of them is indicative of how
closely related they are. So for instance, you want the words "dog" and "cat"
to be very close together, but the words "grapefruit" and "logarithm"
to be very far away. And this has to be true
for any two words within the space. And there are different ways
that we can construct the space of words. One is just asking the experts, a bit like we do with dictionaries. Another possibility is following the simple assumption
that when two words are related, they tend to appear in the same sentences, in the same paragraphs, in the same documents, more often than would be expected
just by pure chance. And this simple hypothesis, this simple method, with some computational tricks that have to do with the fact that this is a very complex
and high-dimensional space, turns out to be quite effective. And just to give you a flavor
of how well this works, this is the result we get when
we analyze this for some familiar words. And you can see first that words automatically organize
into semantic neighborhoods. So you get the fruits, the body parts, the computer parts,
the scientific terms and so on. The algorithm also identifies
that we organize concepts in a hierarchy. So for instance, you can see that the scientific terms
break down into two subcategories of the astronomic and the physics terms. And then there are very fine things. For instance, the word astronomy, which seems a bit bizarre where it is, is actually exactly where it should be, between what it is, an actual science, and between what it describes, the astronomical terms. And we could go on and on with this. Actually, if you stare
at this for a while, and you just build random trajectories, you will see that it actually feels
a bit like doing poetry. And this is because, in a way, walking in this space
is like walking in the mind. And the last thing is that this algorithm also identifies
what are our intuitions, of which words should lead
in the neighborhood of introspection. So for instance, words such as "self," "guilt,"
"reason," "emotion," are very close to "introspection," but other words, such as "red," "football,"
"candle," "banana," are just very far away. And so once we've built the space, the question of the history
of introspection, or of the history of any concept which before could seem abstract
and somehow vague, becomes concrete -- becomes amenable to quantitative science. All that we have to do is take the books, we digitize them, and we take this stream
of words as a trajectory and project them into the space, and then we ask whether this trajectory
spends significant time circling closely to the concept
of introspection. And with this, we could analyze
the history of introspection in the ancient Greek tradition, for which we have the best
available written record. So what we did is we took all the books -- we just ordered them by time -- for each book we take the words and we project them to the space, and then we ask for each word
how close it is to introspection, and we just average that. And then we ask whether,
as time goes on and on, these books get closer,
and closer and closer to the concept of introspection. And this is exactly what happens
in the ancient Greek tradition. So you can see that for the oldest books
in the Homeric tradition, there is a small increase with books
getting closer to introspection. But about four centuries before Christ, this starts ramping up very rapidly
to an almost five-fold increase of books getting closer,
and closer and closer to the concept of introspection. And one of the nice things about this is that now we can ask whether this is also true
in a different, independent tradition. So we just ran this same analysis
on the Judeo-Christian tradition, and we got virtually the same pattern. Again, you see a small increase
for the oldest books in the Old Testament, and then it increases much more rapidly in the new books of the New Testament. And then we get the peak of introspection in "The Confessions of Saint Augustine," about four centuries after Christ. And this was very important, because Saint Augustine
had been recognized by scholars, philologists, historians, as one of the founders of introspection. Actually, some believe him to be
the father of modern psychology. So our algorithm, which has the virtue
of being quantitative, of being objective, and of course of being extremely fast -- it just runs in a fraction of a second -- can capture some of the most
important conclusions of this long tradition of investigation. And this is in a way
one of the beauties of science, which is that now this idea
can be translated and generalized to a whole lot
of different domains. So in the same way that we asked
about the past of human consciousness, maybe the most challenging question
we can pose to ourselves is whether this can tell us something
about the future of our own consciousness. To put it more precisely, whether the words we say today can tell us something
of where our minds will be in a few days, in a few months or a few years from now. And in the same way many of us
are now wearing sensors that detect our heart rate, our respiration, our genes, on the hopes that this may
help us prevent diseases, we can ask whether monitoring
and analyzing the words we speak, we tweet, we email, we write, can tell us ahead of time whether
something may go wrong with our minds. And with Guillermo Cecchi, who has been my brother in this adventure, we took on this task. And we did so by analyzing
the recorded speech of 34 young people who were at a high risk
of developing schizophrenia. And so what we did is,
we measured speech at day one, and then we asked whether the properties
of the speech could predict, within a window of almost three years, the future development of psychosis. But despite our hopes, we got failure after failure. There was just not enough
information in semantics to predict the future
organization of the mind. It was good enough to distinguish between a group
of schizophrenics and a control group, a bit like we had done
for the ancient texts, but not to predict the future
onset of psychosis. But then we realized that maybe the most important thing
was not so much what they were saying, but how they were saying it. More specifically, it was not in which semantic
neighborhoods the words were, but how far and fast they jumped from one semantic neighborhood
to the other one. And so we came up with this measure, which we termed semantic coherence, which essentially measures the persistence
of speech within one semantic topic, within one semantic category. And it turned out to be
that for this group of 34 people, the algorithm based on semantic
coherence could predict, with 100 percent accuracy, who developed psychosis and who will not. And this was something
that could not be achieved -- not even close -- with all the other
existing clinical measures. And I remember vividly,
while I was working on this, I was sitting at my computer and I saw a bunch of tweets by Polo -- Polo had been my first student
back in Buenos Aires, and at the time
he was living in New York. And there was something in this tweets -- I could not tell exactly what
because nothing was said explicitly -- but I got this strong hunch, this strong intuition,
that something was going wrong. So I picked up the phone,
and I called Polo, and in fact he was not feeling well. And this simple fact, that reading in between the lines, I could sense,

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Mariano Sigman's belief regarding the fossils of human thought. The closest generated MCQ is Question 3, which asks about the space of words and how it is constructed. Although it does not directly ask about the fossils of human thought, it is related to the idea of analyzing words and their relationships, which is mentioned in the transcript as a way to understand human thought.

However, a more relevant question can be found by looking at the content of the transcript. The transcript mentions that "the writings of a culture are the archaeological records, the fossils, of human thought." This idea is not directly asked about in any of the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose one of the generated MCQs, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, but it is still not a good match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3

Please note that the generated MCQs do not accurately represent the content of the transcript, and a new set of MCQs should be generated to better match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
We have historical records that allow us
to know how the ancient Greeks dressed, how they lived, how they fought ... but how did they think? One natural idea is that the deepest
aspects of human thought -- our ability to imagine, to be conscious, to dream -- have always been the same. Another possibility is that the social transformations
that have shaped our culture may have also changed
the structural columns of human thought. We may all have different
opinions about this. Actually, it's a long-standing
philosophical debate. But is this question
even amenable to science? Here I'd like to propose that in the same way we can reconstruct
how the ancient Greek cities looked just based on a few bricks, that the writings of a culture
are the archaeological records, the fossils, of human thought. And in fact, doing some form of psychological analysis of some of the most ancient
books of human culture, Julian Jaynes came up in the '70s
with a very wild and radical hypothesis: that only 3,000 years ago, humans were what today
we would call schizophrenics. And he made this claim based on the fact that the first
humans described in these books behaved consistently, in different traditions
and in different places of the world, as if they were hearing and obeying voices that they perceived
as coming from the Gods, or from the muses ... what today we would call hallucinations. And only then, as time went on, they began to recognize
that they were the creators, the owners of these inner voices. And with this, they gained introspection: the ability to think
about their own thoughts. So Jaynes's theory is that consciousness, at least in the way we perceive it today, where we feel that we are the pilots
of our own existence -- is a quite recent cultural development. And this theory is quite spectacular, but it has an obvious problem which is that it's built on just a few
and very specific examples. So the question is whether the theory that introspection built up in human
history only about 3,000 years ago can be examined in a quantitative
and objective manner. And the problem of how
to go about this is quite obvious. It's not like Plato woke up one day
and then he wrote, "Hello, I'm Plato, and as of today, I have
a fully introspective consciousness." (Laughter) And this tells us actually
what is the essence of the problem. We need to find the emergence
of a concept that's never said. The word introspection
does not appear a single time in the books we want to analyze. So our way to solve this
is to build the space of words. This is a huge space
that contains all words in such a way that the distance
between any two of them is indicative of how
closely related they are. So for instance, you want the words "dog" and "cat"
to be very close together, but the words "grapefruit" and "logarithm"
to be very far away. And this has to be true
for any two words within the space. And there are different ways
that we can construct the space of words. One is just asking the experts, a bit like we do with dictionaries. Another possibility is following the simple assumption
that when two words are related, they tend to appear in the same sentences, in the same paragraphs, in the same documents, more often than would be expected
just by pure chance. And this simple hypothesis, this simple method, with some computational tricks that have to do with the fact that this is a very complex
and high-dimensional space, turns out to be quite effective. And just to give you a flavor
of how well this works, this is the result we get when
we analyze this for some familiar words. And you can see first that words automatically organize
into semantic neighborhoods. So you get the fruits, the body parts, the computer parts,
the scientific terms and so on. The algorithm also identifies
that we organize concepts in a hierarchy. So for instance, you can see that the scientific terms
break down into two subcategories of the astronomic and the physics terms. And then there are very fine things. For instance, the word astronomy, which seems a bit bizarre where it is, is actually exactly where it should be, between what it is, an actual science, and between what it describes, the astronomical terms. And we could go on and on with this. Actually, if you stare
at this for a while, and you just build random trajectories, you will see that it actually feels
a bit like doing poetry. And this is because, in a way, walking in this space
is like walking in the mind. And the last thing is that this algorithm also identifies
what are our intuitions, of which words should lead
in the neighborhood of introspection. So for instance, words such as "self," "guilt,"
"reason," "emotion," are very close to "introspection," but other words, such as "red," "football,"
"candle," "banana," are just very far away. And so once we've built the space, the question of the history
of introspection, or of the history of any concept which before could seem abstract
and somehow vague, becomes concrete -- becomes amenable to quantitative science. All that we have to do is take the books, we digitize them, and we take this stream
of words as a trajectory and project them into the space, and then we ask whether this trajectory
spends significant time circling closely to the concept
of introspection. And with this, we could analyze
the history of introspection in the ancient Greek tradition, for which we have the best
available written record. So what we did is we took all the books -- we just ordered them by time -- for each book we take the words and we project them to the space, and then we ask for each word
how close it is to introspection, and we just average that. And then we ask whether,
as time goes on and on, these books get closer,
and closer and closer to the concept of introspection. And this is exactly what happens
in the ancient Greek tradition. So you can see that for the oldest books
in the Homeric tradition, there is a small increase with books
getting closer to introspection. But about four centuries before Christ, this starts ramping up very rapidly
to an almost five-fold increase of books getting closer,
and closer and closer to the concept of introspection. And one of the nice things about this is that now we can ask whether this is also true
in a different, independent tradition. So we just ran this same analysis
on the Judeo-Christian tradition, and we got virtually the same pattern. Again, you see a small increase
for the oldest books in the Old Testament, and then it increases much more rapidly in the new books of the New Testament. And then we get the peak of introspection in "The Confessions of Saint Augustine," about four centuries after Christ. And this was very important, because Saint Augustine
had been recognized by scholars, philologists, historians, as one of the founders of introspection. Actually, some believe him to be
the father of modern psychology. So our algorithm, which has the virtue
of being quantitative, of being objective, and of course of being extremely fast -- it just runs in a fraction of a second -- can capture some of the most
important conclusions of this long tradition of investigation. And this is in a way
one of the beauties of science, which is that now this idea
can be translated and generalized to a whole lot
of different domains. So in the same way that we asked
about the past of human consciousness, maybe the most challenging question
we can pose to ourselves is whether this can tell us something
about the future of our own consciousness. To put it more precisely, whether the words we say today can tell us something
of where our minds will be in a few days, in a few months or a few years from now. And in the same way many of us
are now wearing sensors that detect our heart rate, our respiration, our genes, on the hopes that this may
help us prevent diseases, we can ask whether monitoring
and analyzing the words we speak, we tweet, we email, we write, can tell us ahead of time whether
something may go wrong with our minds. And with Guillermo Cecchi, who has been my brother in this adventure, we took on this task. And we did so by analyzing
the recorded speech of 34 young people who were at a high risk
of developing schizophrenia. And so what we did is,
we measured speech at day one, and then we asked whether the properties
of the speech could predict, within a window of almost three years, the future development of psychosis. But despite our hopes, we got failure after failure. There was just not enough
information in semantics to predict the future
organization of the mind. It was good enough to distinguish between a group
of schizophrenics and a control group, a bit like we had done
for the ancient texts, but not to predict the future
onset of psychosis. But then we realized that maybe the most important thing
was not so much what they were saying, but how they were saying it. More specifically, it was not in which semantic
neighborhoods the words were, but how far and fast they jumped from one semantic neighborhood
to the other one. And so we came up with this measure, which we termed semantic coherence, which essentially measures the persistence
of speech within one semantic topic, within one semantic category. And it turned out to be
that for this group of 34 people, the algorithm based on semantic
coherence could predict, with 100 percent accuracy, who developed psychosis and who will not. And this was something
that could not be achieved -- not even close -- with all the other
existing clinical measures. And I remember vividly,
while I was working on this, I was sitting at my computer and I saw a bunch of tweets by Polo -- Polo had been my first student
back in Buenos Aires, and at the time
he was living in New York. And there was something in this tweets -- I could not tell exactly what
because nothing was said explicitly -- but I got this strong hunch, this strong intuition,
that something was going wrong. So I picked up the phone,
and I called Polo, and in fact he was not feeling well. And this simple fact, that reading in between the lines, I could sense,
through words, his feelings, was a simple, but very
effective way to help. What I tell you today is that we're getting
close to understanding how we can convert this intuition
that we all have, that we all share, into an algorithm. And in doing so, we may be seeing in the future
a very different form of mental health, based on objective, quantitative
and automated analysis of the words we write, of the words we say. Gracias. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
On valentine's day 2013, a Thai couple broke
the world record for longest kiss, when they sucked face for over 58 hours. 58 hours! Wo-how?! You could drive across the entire United States
in less time! These lovebirds couldn't even sit down that
whole time, and had to pee while kissing. The logistics of which I don't want to think
about. Still, got me thinking, when the first two
humans brushed lips, could they ever have imagined it would end with chapped lips and
a cash prize, and where did kissing get it's start anyway? The earliest reference to kissing is out of
a Sanskrit text from India, dating back to 1500 BC. Now that doesn't mean that folks weren't snogging
before then, that's just the first record we have. Some believe that Alexander the Great's army
spread kissing from India to the Middle East. From there, it caught on in Ancient Greece
and Rome, perhaps more as a display of deference than romance. Slaves kissed the hands of their masters as
a sign of submission. Men of standing kissed each other on the cheek
in greeting, and even today it's important to note that there are lots of different types
of, and reasons for, kissing, from ritual to friendship to comfort to passion. To a Guinness book title, apparently. By the middle ages, people all over Europe
were swapping spit, and by the 19th century we actually gave the study of kissing the
decidedly un-sexy title of Philematology. Rrrr. So, why do we kiss? Well, there are two theories about it's origins,
one maintains that it's instinctual, the other believes that its a learned behavior. Folks in the instinctual camp point out that
Bonobos and some other animals seem to display kissing type behavior as an expression of
comfort, expression and bonding, but critics of this theory like to point out that ten
percent of human cultures don't even kiss, or at least haven't until fairly recently. Various tribes in Africa and some Australian
Aborigines and Tahitians are among groups that don't seem to kiss, they probably just
think that we're super weird. So some believe that kissing is a learned
behavior that evolved from regurgitation. Oh yeah. Hot stuff. No, I do not mean barfing. I mean mothers chewing solid food and feeding
it to their babies, mouth to mouth, like birds, wolves and lots of other animals do. This type of feeding not only helped pre-digest
food, but also established bonding and intimacy. And it isn't really a stretch to picture it
shifting to kisses as a sign of affection. From there, presumably, people just realized
that sucking face felt like all good and tingly, which is a compelling reason to do a lot of
things. Our lips and tongues are jam-packed with sensitive
nerve endings that light up our brains pleasure receptors like a Coney Island rollercoaster. If it's a really good, passionate kiss, our
cheeks flush as blood vessels expand, our pupils dilate, we get all dreamy eyed, and
our heart rates increase, pumping more oxygen into the brain. Suddenly, we're riding a wave of feel-good
hormones like dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and adrenaline. That is the chemical cocktail that makes you
feel like a family of bees just moved into your belly. Interesting, a males testosterone can pass
into a females mouth from kissing, making her more receptive to sex, baby-making, and
the passing along of genes, which is, of course, evolution's ultimate goal. And smooching doesn't just feel good to most
people, it's also good for you, in several different ways. It burns calories of course, reduces stress
and it might just help you select the right kind of mate. Gettin' all up in someone's grill gives you
great access to a nose full of pheromones, those subtle chemical signals that allow us
to sniff out optimal mates. And as we explained in a previous episode
about sex appeal, people tend to be attracted to mates with different immune system make-up
than their own, and swapping spit is a great way to get a snoot full of pheromones to see
if your potential mate is a good fit. All that history and biology aside, kissing
is probably one of those things that its best not to really over-think. Personally, I'd rather just remember that
nervous, sweaty magic of my first kiss than picture a mouthful of pre-chewed meat coming
at me. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

**Transcript**:
On valentine's day 2013, a Thai couple broke
the world record for longest kiss, when they sucked face for over 58 hours. 58 hours! Wo-how?! You could drive across the entire United States
in less time! These lovebirds couldn't even sit down that
whole time, and had to pee while kissing. The logistics of which I don't want to think
about. Still, got me thinking, when the first two
humans brushed lips, could they ever have imagined it would end with chapped lips and
a cash prize, and where did kissing get it's start anyway? The earliest reference to kissing is out of
a Sanskrit text from India, dating back to 1500 BC. Now that doesn't mean that folks weren't snogging
before then, that's just the first record we have. Some believe that Alexander the Great's army
spread kissing from India to the Middle East. From there, it caught on in Ancient Greece
and Rome, perhaps more as a display of deference than romance. Slaves kissed the hands of their masters as
a sign of submission. Men of standing kissed each other on the cheek
in greeting, and even today it's important to note that there are lots of different types
of, and reasons for, kissing, from ritual to friendship to comfort to passion. To a Guinness book title, apparently. By the middle ages, people all over Europe
were swapping spit, and by the 19th century we actually gave the study of kissing the
decidedly un-sexy title of Philematology. Rrrr. So, why do we kiss? Well, there are two theories about it's origins,
one maintains that it's instinctual, the other believes that its a learned behavior. Folks in the instinctual camp point out that
Bonobos and some other animals seem to display kissing type behavior as an expression of
comfort, expression and bonding, but critics of this theory like to point out that ten
percent of human cultures don't even kiss, or at least haven't until fairly recently. Various tribes in Africa and some Australian
Aborigines and Tahitians are among groups that don't seem to kiss, they probably just
think that we're super weird. So some believe that kissing is a learned
behavior that evolved from regurgitation. Oh yeah. Hot stuff. No, I do not mean barfing. I mean mothers chewing solid food and feeding
it to their babies, mouth to mouth, like birds, wolves and lots of other animals do. This type of feeding not only helped pre-digest
food, but also established bonding and intimacy. And it isn't really a stretch to picture it
shifting to kisses as a sign of affection. From there, presumably, people just realized
that sucking face felt like all good and tingly, which is a compelling reason to do a lot of
things. Our lips and tongues are jam-packed with sensitive
nerve endings that light up our brains pleasure receptors like a Coney Island rollercoaster. If it's a really good, passionate kiss, our
cheeks flush as blood vessels expand, our pupils dilate, we get all dreamy eyed, and
our heart rates increase, pumping more oxygen into the brain. Suddenly, we're riding a wave of feel-good
hormones like dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and adrenaline. That is the chemical cocktail that makes you
feel like a family of bees just moved into your belly. Interesting, a males testosterone can pass
into a females mouth from kissing, making her more receptive to sex, baby-making, and
the passing along of genes, which is, of course, evolution's ultimate goal. And smooching doesn't just feel good to most

**Transcript**:
Sunscreen comes in many forms, each with its own impacts on your body
and the environment. With so many options, how do you choose which sunscreen
is best for you? To answer that question, we first have to understand
how sunscreens work. Sunlight is composed
of electromagnetic waves and is our primary source
of ultraviolet radiation, which has a shorter wavelength than
visible light and carries more energy. UVA, UVB, and UVC are classified according
to their wavelengths. Short wavelength UVC
never reaches the Earth's surface, but UVB and UVA do. Medium wavelength UVB rays
can enter the skin's superficial layers and long length UVA rays
can penetrate into the deeper layers. UVB in small amounts actually helps
us make vitamin D, which enables our bodies to build
and maintain strong bones. However, prolonged exposure to UVA
and UVB can damage DNA, age your skin, and promote the development
of potentially deadly skin cancer. Sunscreen protects your skin
either physically by deflecting UV rays with an inorganic blocker 
like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, or chemically by using carbon-based
compounds to absorb UV photons that are then harmlessly 
dissipated as heat. So, what differentiates one sunscreen
from another? When we choose a sunscreen, we can compare application method, the SPF, and the active ingredients. Sprays can be convenient to put on,
especially when you're wet, but a recent study found that most people
don't apply a thick enough layer to get full protection. And the possible health risks of inhaling 
sunscreen compounds from a spray cloud might make you consider reaching
for that bottle of lotion instead. Opt for a sunscreen with an SPF
of at least 15, although 30 is better. SPF is a nonlinear scale of how much
UVB radiation is needed to give protected skin a sunburn. SPF 15 does a pretty good job by blocking
93% of UVB rays. You get a slight increase as SPF goes up, with SPF 30 blocking 97%, and 50 blocking 98%. SPF is based on the quantity
of solar exposure. So how much time you have before
you start to burn really depends on a long list of factors, including your genetics, and when, where, and how
you spend your time in the sun. Even though US marketed sunscreens
have been deemed safe by the FDA, scientists are still researching
the effects of many active ingredients on the human body. So if you're worried 
about potential irritants, look for mineral-based formulas
with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. Even though they may go on 
a bit thick at first, they're less irritating than carbon-based
chemical sunscreens. These mineral-based sunscreens
are preferential for the environment, too. If you plan on catching rays
while splashing in a river or the ocean, keep in mind that carbon-based
chemical sunscreens can harm marine life. Take coral reefs, for example. Although they cover less than 1%
of the Earth's underwater surface, they're home to nearly 25% of all
fish species, making them the most diverse
and productive marine ecosystems. Research shows that carbon-based
chemical sunscreen ingredients, like oxybenzone, butylparaben, 
octinoxate, and 4MBC contribute to a stress condition called
coral bleaching in corals, which are living creatures. Exposure to these organic compounds results in the death 
of the coral's symbiotic algae. In addition to providing 
a reliable food source, these algae give coral their brilliant
rainbow of colors. Without them, corals turn a bleached white and are susceptible to disease
and possibly death. And once the coral dies, the entire reef ecosystem 
is not far behind. So you're now ready to make an informed
choice when picking out your next sunscreen. SPF is clearly labeled on the front. On the back under "active ingredients," you can find whether zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and those coral-harming components
are present. Taking a bit more time to check
can be well worth it for both you and the environment.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Sunscreen comes in many forms, each with its own impacts on your body
and the environment. With so many options, how do you choose which sunscreen
is best for you? To answer that question, we first have to understand
how sunscreens work. Sunlight is composed
of electromagnetic waves and is our primary source
of ultraviolet radiation, which has a shorter wavelength than
visible light and carries more energy. UVA, UVB, and UVC are classified according
to their wavelengths. Short wavelength UVC
never reaches the Earth's surface, but UVB and UVA do. Medium wavelength UVB rays
can enter the skin's superficial layers and long length UVA rays
can penetrate into the deeper layers. UVB in small amounts actually helps
us make vitamin D, which enables our bodies to build
and maintain strong bones. However, prolonged exposure to UVA
and UVB can damage DNA, age your skin, and promote the development
of potentially deadly skin cancer. Sunscreen protects your skin
either physically by deflecting UV rays with an inorganic blocker 
like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, or chemically by using carbon-based
compounds to absorb UV photons that are then harmlessly 
dissipated as heat. So, what differentiates one sunscreen
from another? When we choose a sunscreen, we can compare application method, the SPF, and the active ingredients. Sprays can be convenient to put on,
especially when you're wet, but a recent study found that most people
don't apply a thick enough layer to get full protection. And the possible health risks of inhaling 
sunscreen compounds from a spray cloud might make you consider reaching
for that bottle of lotion instead. Opt for a sunscreen with an SPF
of at least 15, although 30 is better. SPF is a nonlinear scale of how much
UVB radiation is needed to give protected skin a sunburn. SPF 15 does a pretty good job by blocking
93% of UVB rays. You get a slight increase as SPF goes up, with SPF 30 blocking 97%, and 50 blocking 98%. SPF is based on the quantity
of solar exposure. So how much time you have before
you start to burn really depends on a long list of factors, including your genetics, and when, where, and how
you spend your time in the sun. Even though US marketed sunscreens
have been deemed safe by the FDA, scientists are still researching
the effects of many active ingredients on the human body. So if you're worried 
about potential irritants, look for mineral-based formulas
with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. Even though they may go on 
a bit thick at first, they're less irritating than carbon-based
chemical sunscreens. These mineral-based sunscreens
are preferential for the environment, too. If you plan on catching rays
while splashing in a river or the ocean, keep in mind that carbon-based
chemical sunscreens can harm marine life. Take coral reefs, for example. Although they cover less than 1%
of the Earth's underwater surface, they're home to nearly 25% of all
fish species, making them the most diverse
and productive marine ecosystems. Research shows that carbon-based
chemical sunscreen ingredients, like oxybenzone, butylparaben, 
octinoxate, and 4MBC contribute to a stress condition called
coral bleaching in corals, which are living creatures. Exposure to these organic compounds results in the death 
of the coral's symbiotic algae. In addition to providing 
a reliable food source, these algae give coral their brilliant
rainbow of colors. Without them, corals turn a bleached white and are susceptible to disease
and possibly death. And once the coral dies, the entire reef ecosystem 
is not far behind. So you're now ready to make an informed
choice when picking out your next sunscreen. SPF is clearly labeled on the front. On the back under "active ingredients," you can find whether zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and those coral-harming components
are present. Taking a bit more time to check
can be well worth it for both you and the environment.

**Transcript**:
Charles Osborne began to hiccup
in 1922 after a hog fell on top of him. He wasn't cured until 68 years later and is now listed by Guinness as
the world record holder for hiccup longevity. Meanwhile, Florida teen Jennifer Mee may hold the record 
for the most frequent hiccups, 50 times per minute 
for more than four weeks in 2007. So what causes hiccups? Doctors point out that a round
of hiccups often follows from stimuli that stretch the stomach, like swallowing air or too rapid eating or drinking. Others associate hiccups 
with intense emotions or a response to them: laughing, sobbing, anxiety, and excitement. Let's look at what happens when we hiccup. It begins with an involuntary spasm
or sudden contraction of the diaphragm, the large dome-shaped muscle
below our lungs that we use to inhale air. This is followed almost immediately
by the sudden closure of the vocal chords and the opening between them, which is called the glottis. The movement of the diaphragm
initiates a sudden intake of air, but the closure of the vocal chords
stops it from entering the wind pipe and reaching the lungs. It also creates the characteristic sound:
"hic." To date, there is no known function
for hiccups. They don't seem to provide any medical
or physiological advantage. Why begin to inhale air only to suddenly
stop it from actually entering the lungs? Anatomical structures, or physiological mechanisms, 
with no apparent purpose present challenges 
to evolutionary biologists. Do such structures serve some hidden
function that hasn't yet been discovered? Or are they relics 
of our evolutionary past, having once served some important purpose only to persist into the present 
as vestigial remnants? One idea is that hiccups began many millions of years
before the appearance of humans. The lung is thought to have evolved
as a structure to allow early fish, many of which lived in warm, stagnant
water with little oxygen, to take advantage of the abundant oxygen
in the air overhead. When descendants of these animals
later moved onto land, they moved from gill-based ventilation
to air-breathing with lungs. That's similar to the much more rapid
changes faced by frogs today as they transition 
from tadpoles with gills to adults with lungs. This hypothesis suggests that the hiccup
is a relic of the ancient transition from water to land. An inhalation that could 
move water over gills followed by a rapid closure of the glottis
preventing water from entering the lungs. That's supported by evidence which suggests that the neural patterning
involved in generating a hiccup is almost identical to that responsible
for respiration in amphibians. Another group of scientists believe
that the reflex is retained in us today because it actually provides
an important advantage. They point out that true hiccups
are found only in mammals and that they're not retained in birds,
lizards, turtles, or any other exclusively 
air-breathing animals. Further, hiccups appear in human babies
long before birth and are far more common in infants
that adults. Their explanation for this involves the uniquely mammalian 
activity of nursing. The ancient hiccup reflex may have been
adapted by mammals to help remove air from the stomach
as a sort of glorified burp. The sudden expansion of the diaphragm
would raise air from the stomach, while a closure of the glottis would
prevent milk from entering the lungs. Sometimes, a bout of hiccups will go
on and on, and we try home remedies: sipping continuously 
from a glass of cold water, holding one's breath, a mouthful of honey or peanut butter, breathing into a paper bag, or being suddenly frightened. Unfortunately, scientists have yet
to verify that any one cure works better or more consistently
than others. However, we do know one thing
that definitely doesn't work.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, which is about the frequency of hiccups in different age groups, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar generated MCQ. 

Although Question 2 does not directly ask about the frequency of hiccups in different age groups, it does mention Jennifer Mee, who is stated in the transcript to have had the most frequent hiccups, and it is also mentioned in the transcript that hiccups are more common in infants than adults. 

However, it would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ. 

If I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar.

**Transcript**:
Charles Osborne began to hiccup
in 1922 after a hog fell on top of him. He wasn't cured until 68 years later and is now listed by Guinness as
the world record holder for hiccup longevity. Meanwhile, Florida teen Jennifer Mee may hold the record 
for the most frequent hiccups, 50 times per minute 
for more than four weeks in 2007. So what causes hiccups? Doctors point out that a round
of hiccups often follows from stimuli that stretch the stomach, like swallowing air or too rapid eating or drinking. Others associate hiccups 
with intense emotions or a response to them: laughing, sobbing, anxiety, and excitement. Let's look at what happens when we hiccup. It begins with an involuntary spasm
or sudden contraction of the diaphragm, the large dome-shaped muscle
below our lungs that we use to inhale air. This is followed almost immediately
by the sudden closure of the vocal chords and the opening between them, which is called the glottis. The movement of the diaphragm
initiates a sudden intake of air, but the closure of the vocal chords
stops it from entering the wind pipe and reaching the lungs. It also creates the characteristic sound:
"hic." To date, there is no known function
for hiccups. They don't seem to provide any medical
or physiological advantage. Why begin to inhale air only to suddenly
stop it from actually entering the lungs? Anatomical structures, or physiological mechanisms, 
with no apparent purpose present challenges 
to evolutionary biologists. Do such structures serve some hidden
function that hasn't yet been discovered? Or are they relics 
of our evolutionary past, having once served some important purpose only to persist into the present 
as vestigial remnants? One idea is that hiccups began many millions of years
before the appearance of humans. The lung is thought to have evolved
as a structure to allow early fish, many of which lived in warm, stagnant
water with little oxygen, to take advantage of the abundant oxygen
in the air overhead. When descendants of these animals
later moved onto land, they moved from gill-based ventilation
to air-breathing with lungs. That's similar to the much more rapid
changes faced by frogs today as they transition 
from tadpoles with gills to adults with lungs. This hypothesis suggests that the hiccup
is a relic of the ancient transition from water to land. An inhalation that could 
move water over gills followed by a rapid closure of the glottis
preventing water from entering the lungs. That's supported by evidence which suggests that the neural patterning
involved in generating a hiccup is almost identical to that responsible
for respiration in amphibians. Another group of scientists believe
that the reflex is retained in us today because it actually provides
an important advantage. They point out that true hiccups
are found only in mammals and that they're not retained in birds,
lizards, turtles, or any other exclusively 
air-breathing animals. Further, hiccups appear in human babies
long before birth and are far more common in infants
that adults. Their explanation for this involves the uniquely mammalian 
activity of nursing. The ancient hiccup reflex may have been
adapted by mammals to help remove air from the stomach
as a sort of glorified burp. The sudden expansion of the diaphragm
would raise air from the stomach, while a closure of the glottis would
prevent milk from entering the lungs. Sometimes, a bout of hiccups will go
on and on, and we try home remedies: sipping continuously 
from a glass of cold water, holding one's breath, a mouthful of honey or peanut butter, breathing into a paper bag, or being suddenly frightened. Unfortunately, scientists have yet
to verify that any one cure works better or more consistently
than others. However, we do know one thing
that definitely doesn't work.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What happens when we hiccup? 

However, the options provided in Question 4 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. 

But if we were to choose the most similar one based on the content and the mention of the diaphragm, it would be Question 4.

However, since the options provided in Question 4 do not match the ground truth MCQ, it would be more accurate to say that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose, I would say Question 4 is the closest, but with the caveat that the options do not match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I can suggest a match.

The ground truth MCQ asks about which vertebrate animals that breathe air experience hiccups. The correct answer is "None of the above," which implies that the options listed (birds, turtles, and alligators) do not experience hiccups.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is the closest match in terms of content and intent. It discusses the origin of hiccups and mentions that they began many millions of years before the appearance of humans. However, it does not explicitly ask about which animals experience hiccups.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about which animals experience hiccups, but such a question is not present in the provided options.

If I had to choose from the provided options, I would say that Question 7 is the closest match, but it is not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Charles Osborne began to hiccup
in 1922 after a hog fell on top of him. He wasn't cured until 68 years later and is now listed by Guinness as
the world record holder for hiccup longevity. Meanwhile, Florida teen Jennifer Mee may hold the record 
for the most frequent hiccups, 50 times per minute 
for more than four weeks in 2007. So what causes hiccups? Doctors point out that a round
of hiccups often follows from stimuli that stretch the stomach, like swallowing air or too rapid eating or drinking. Others associate hiccups 
with intense emotions or a response to them: laughing, sobbing, anxiety, and excitement. Let's look at what happens when we hiccup. It begins with an involuntary spasm
or sudden contraction of the diaphragm, the large dome-shaped muscle
below our lungs that we use to inhale air. This is followed almost immediately
by the sudden closure of the vocal chords and the opening between them, which is called the glottis. The movement of the diaphragm
initiates a sudden intake of air, but the closure of the vocal chords
stops it from entering the wind pipe and reaching the lungs. It also creates the characteristic sound:
"hic." To date, there is no known function
for hiccups. They don't seem to provide any medical
or physiological advantage. Why begin to inhale air only to suddenly
stop it from actually entering the lungs? Anatomical structures, or physiological mechanisms, 
with no apparent purpose present challenges 
to evolutionary biologists. Do such structures serve some hidden
function that hasn't yet been discovered? Or are they relics 
of our evolutionary past, having once served some important purpose only to persist into the present 
as vestigial remnants? One idea is that hiccups began many millions of years
before the appearance of humans. The lung is thought to have evolved
as a structure to allow early fish, many of which lived in warm, stagnant
water with little oxygen, to take advantage of the abundant oxygen

is a relic of the ancient transition from water to land. An inhalation that could 
move water over gills followed by a rapid closure of the glottis
preventing water from entering the lungs. That's supported by evidence which suggests that the neural patterning
involved in generating a hiccup is almost identical to that responsible
for respiration in amphibians. Another group of scientists believe
that the reflex is retained in us today because it actually provides
an important advantage. They point out that true hiccups
are found only in mammals and that they're not retained in birds,
lizards, turtles, or any other exclusively 
air-breathing animals. Further, hiccups appear in human babies
long before birth and are far more common in infants
that adults. Their explanation for this involves the uniquely mammalian 
activity of nursing. The ancient hiccup reflex may have been
adapted by mammals to help remove air from the stomach
as a sort of glorified burp. The sudden expansion of the diaphragm
would raise air from the stomach, while a closure of the glottis would
prevent milk from entering the lungs. Sometimes, a bout of hiccups will go
on and on, and we try home remedies: sipping continuously 
from a glass of cold water, holding one's breath, a mouthful of honey or peanut butter, breathing into a paper bag, or being suddenly frightened. Unfortunately, scientists have yet
to verify that any one cure works better or more consistently
than others. However, we do know one thing
that definitely doesn't work.

**Transcript**:
What does the French Revolution have to do with the time NASA accidentally
crashed a $200 million orbiter into the surface of Mars? Actually, everything. That crash happened due to an error in converting between 
two measurement systems, U.S. customary units and their S.I, or metric, equivalence. So what's the connection to
the French Revolution? Let's explain. For the majority of recorded 
human history, units like the weight of a grain
or the length of a hand weren't exact and varied from place to place. And different regions didn't just use
varying measurements. They had completely different 
number systems as well. By the late Middle Ages,
the Hindu-Arabic decimal system mostly replaced Roman numerals 
and fractions in Europe, but efforts by scholars like John Wilkins
to promote standard decimal-based measures were less successful. With a quarter million different units
in France alone, any widespread change would require
massive disruption. And in 1789, that disruption came. The leaders of the French Revolution
didn't just overthrow the monarchy. They sought to completely 
transform society according to the rational principles
of the Enlightenment. When the new government took power, the Academy of Sciences convened
to reform the system of measurements. Old standards based on arbitrary authority
or local traditions were replaced with mathematical
and natural relationships. For example, the meter,
from the Greek word for measure, was defined as 1/10,000,000
between the Equator and North Pole. And the new metric system was,
in the words of the Marquis de Condorcet, "For all people, for all time." Standardizing measurements
had political advantages for the Revolutionaries as well. Nobles could no longer manipulate local
units to extract more rent from commoners, while the government could collect
taxes more efficiently. And switching to a new Republican Calendar
with ten-day weeks reduced church power 
by eliminating Sundays. Adoption of this new system wasn't easy. In fact, it was a bit of a mess. At first, people used new units
alongside old ones, and the Republican Calendar 
was eventually abandoned. When Napoléon Bonaparte took power, he allowed small businesses 
to use traditional measurements redefined in metric terms. But the metric system remained standard
for formal use, and it spread across the continent,
along with France's borders. While Napoléon's empire 
lasted eight years, its legacy endured far longer. Some European countries reverted
to old measurements upon independence. Others realized the value 
of standardization in an age of international trade. After Portugal and the Netherlands
switched to metric voluntarily, other nations followed, with colonial empires spreading the system
around the world. As France's main rival, Britain had resisted revolutionary ideas
and retained its traditional units. But over the next two centuries,
the British Empire slowly transitioned, first approving the metric system
as an optional alternative before gradually making it offical. However, this switch came too late
for thirteen former colonies that had already gained independence. The United States of America stuck with
the English units of its colonial past and today remains one 
of only three countries which haven't fully embraced 
the metric system. Despite constant initiatives 
for metrication, many Americans consider units like feet
and pounds more intuitive. And ironically, some regard the once
revolutionary metric system as a symbol of global conformity. Nevertheless, the metric system is almost
universally used in science and medicine, and it continues to evolve according
to its original principles. For a long time, standard units were actually defined by 
carefully maintained physical prototypes. But thanks to improving technology
and precision, these objects with limited access
and unreliable longevity are now being replaced with standards
based on universal constants, like the speed of light. Consistent measurements are such
an integral part of our daily lives that it's hard to appreciate what a major
accomplishment for humanity they've been. And just as it arose

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the earliest advocate for a uniform measuring system, and the correct answer is John Wilkins.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 8 has some relevance to the topic, but it does not ask about a specific person. However, I noticed that Question 8 mentions the French Revolution's adoption of the metric system as a symbol of rational principles, which is related to the context of the ground truth MCQ.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about John Wilkins or any other person as the earliest advocate for a uniform measuring system. Therefore, I must conclude that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that has some connection to the topic, I would suggest Question 8, but with a clear understanding that it does not match the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the metric system.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the definition of the standard for one meter. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 8 mentions the French Revolution's adoption of the metric system, which is related to the definition of the meter.

However, a more relevant question is not available among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 8 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

If I really had to choose an index, I would say: 8

However, I would like to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. A new generated MCQ that directly asks about the definition of the standard for one meter would be a better match.

**Transcript**:
What does the French Revolution have to do with the time NASA accidentally
crashed a $200 million orbiter into the surface of Mars? Actually, everything. That crash happened due to an error in converting between 
two measurement systems, U.S. customary units and their S.I, or metric, equivalence. So what's the connection to
the French Revolution? Let's explain. For the majority of recorded 
human history, units like the weight of a grain
or the length of a hand weren't exact and varied from place to place. And different regions didn't just use
varying measurements. They had completely different 
number systems as well. By the late Middle Ages,
the Hindu-Arabic decimal system mostly replaced Roman numerals 
and fractions in Europe, but efforts by scholars like John Wilkins
to promote standard decimal-based measures were less successful. With a quarter million different units
in France alone, any widespread change would require
massive disruption. And in 1789, that disruption came. The leaders of the French Revolution
didn't just overthrow the monarchy. They sought to completely 
transform society according to the rational principles
of the Enlightenment. When the new government took power, the Academy of Sciences convened
to reform the system of measurements. Old standards based on arbitrary authority
or local traditions were replaced with mathematical
and natural relationships. For example, the meter,
from the Greek word for measure, was defined as 1/10,000,000
between the Equator and North Pole. And the new metric system was,
in the words of the Marquis de Condorcet, "For all people, for all time." Standardizing measurements
had political advantages for the Revolutionaries as well. Nobles could no longer manipulate local
units to extract more rent from commoners, while the government could collect
taxes more efficiently. And switching to a new Republican Calendar
with ten-day weeks reduced church power 
by eliminating Sundays. Adoption of this new system wasn't easy. In fact, it was a bit of a mess. At first, people used new units
alongside old ones, and the Republican Calendar 
was eventually abandoned. When Napoléon Bonaparte took power, he allowed small businesses 
to use traditional measurements redefined in metric terms. But the metric system remained standard
for formal use, and it spread across the continent,
along with France's borders. While Napoléon's empire 
lasted eight years, its legacy endured far longer. Some European countries reverted
to old measurements upon independence. Others realized the value 
of standardization in an age of international trade. After Portugal and the Netherlands
switched to metric voluntarily, other nations followed, with colonial empires spreading the system
around the world. As France's main rival, Britain had resisted revolutionary ideas
and retained its traditional units. But over the next two centuries,
the British Empire slowly transitioned, first approving the metric system
as an optional alternative before gradually making it offical. However, this switch came too late
for thirteen former colonies that had already gained independence. The United States of America stuck with
the English units of its colonial past and today remains one 
of only three countries which haven't fully embraced 
the metric system. Despite constant initiatives 
for metrication, many Americans consider units like feet
and pounds more intuitive. And ironically, some regard the once
revolutionary metric system as a symbol of global conformity. Nevertheless, the metric system is almost
universally used in science and medicine, and it continues to evolve according
to its original principles. For a long time, standard units were actually defined by 
carefully maintained physical prototypes. But thanks to improving technology

from a political revolution, the metric system remains crucial

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3. However, the options in Question 3 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

A closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest.

But, since the options in Question 3 do not match the ground truth MCQ, I will also consider other questions. Question 6 has an option that says "It is widely accepted and used internationally," which is similar to option B in the ground truth MCQ. However, the question intent is different.

Considering the question intent, options, and content, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not a perfect match, but if I had to choose one, I would say it is Question 6, but only because of the similarity in one of the options.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, and the most similar one is not a perfect match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 6 (with reservations)

Hi, I'm Adam Cole. This week we've got a question from Lulu Miller, 
the host of NPR's Invisibilia podcast: How old are our bodies actually? Because if you think about how
we're constantly being regenerated our physical matter is being shed and replenished ... what actually remains? Good question, Lulu! Well, your hair obviously doesn't remain
the same and I'm not just talking about the style each hair on your head is replaced every
2 to 7 years A hundred hairs fall out every day
and new ones grow back in their place And look at your fingernails - 
they're completely new every six months or so it turns out it's just a matter of time
before almost every part of your body refreshes itself in a similar way The lining of your stomach and intestines gets pretty beat up -- it's constantly
exposed to acid and bile and so those cells get replaced every few days Every few weeks, your outer layer of 
skin is completely renewed Every four months you have
a fresh army of red blood cells A hundred million new cells are born every minute and a hundred million old cells are destroyed It's actually the breakdown products of these red blood cells that turn your bruises and urine yellow Every 10 years, you've got a new skeleton a special team of cells breaks down old bone and another builds new bone Every 15 years your muscles are refreshed You might think you gain and lose fat cells
when you gain and lose weight but the actually just get bigger and smaller Over the course of 25 years though,
most of them turn over But there are a few things that
stick around for your entire life About half of your heart stays with you
from birth to death because those cells are replaced very slowly Certain parts of your brain add a few new
neurons over the course of your life but the vast majority of your neurons
developed before you were born It's the connections between those neurons
-- the circuits that store memories -- that are constantly changing And there's one more
part of you that lasts your whole life Months before you were born, a little cluster of cells stretched and
filled themselves with transparent protein As you grew, even after birth, more and more fibers were added, but that center endured This is your lens the window through
which you are watching this video right now and its core has remained the same
since the moment you first opened your eyes So how old is your body really? Some of it is brand-new and some of it
is as old as you are To learn how scientists figured all this out,

**Transcript**:
Fu Manchu was one of the most
notorious escape artists at the Omaha Zoo in the 1960s. But he wasn't a performer, he was an orangutan. The keepers who locked 
his enclosure every night were baffled to find him outside
the next day hanging out with friends in a tree, or sunning on the roof. Only after installing cameras 
did they realize Fu Manchu had been picking the lock with a metal wire that he kept hidden
under his cheek pouch. The keepers shouldn't have been
surprised at Fu Manchu's cunningness. Along with our other great ape cousins, the gorillas, chimps, and bonobos, they belong to our Hominidae
family tree, which stretches back 14 million years. But it's not just their striking red hair that makes orangutans unique 
among our cousins. As the only great apes from Asia, orangutans have adapted to a life
high in the rain forest canopies. Many of the skills they learn
are transmitted through the special bond they have with their mothers, the most extended in the animal kingdom
next to humans. Orangutan mothers usually give birth
to one baby at a time, waiting up to eight years before
having another. This gives the young, who begin as fully dependent infants, plenty of time to learn how to climb and distinguish the hundreds of plants
and fruits that make up their diet. Female orangutans even stay with
their mothers into their teen years to learn child-rearing. As they grow up, orangutans also develop
a complex set of cooperative social skills by interacting with their peers
and siblings. Much like ourselves, young orangutans involuntarily mimic
the facial expressions and emotions of their playmates, with behaviors that closely parallel
human smiling and laughter. Once they finally venture out 
on their own, orangutans continue to develop
their resourcefulness, putting the skills they've learned 
into practice. Adults build a new nest each night
by carefully weaving twigs together, topping them with soft leaves,
pillows, and blankets. This process requires dexterity,
coordination, and an eye for design. Orangutans also use a variety of tools
to make their lives in the jungle easier. They turn branches into fly swatters
and back scratchers, construct umbrellas when it rains, make gloves from leafy pads, and even use leaves as bandages
to dress their wounds. But orangutan intelligence goes far
beyond jungle survival. Research in controlled environments
has shown that orangutans are self-aware, being one of the few species to recognize
their own reflections. They also display remarkable foresight,
planning, and cognition. In one experiment, researchers taught
an orangutan to use a straw to extract his favorite fruit soup
from a box. That orangutan was later given the choice
between the straw or a grape that could be 
eaten right away, and he chose the straw just in case
he was given another box of soup. In another experiment, orangutans figured
out how to reach peanuts at the bottom of long tubes
by spitting water into them. While orangutans are able to pass
cognitive tests with flying colors, there are certain problems that they
need our help to solve. Indonesia has the world's highest rate
of deforestation, and millions of acres of rain forest 
are burned annually to support the logging 
and palm oil industries. Deforestation exposes the 30,000
orangutans remaining in the wild to poachers. They kill mothers so that baby orangutans
can be sold as exotic pets. But fortunately, the story often
doesn't end here. Orphans can be confiscated
and given a second chance. At special forest schools, they recover
from emotional trauma and continue to develop 
essential life skills. Against all odds, these orphans 
demonstrate incredible resilience and readiness to learn. In Malay, the word orangutan translates
literally to "the person of the forest," a reminder of our common lineage. And despite orangutans being some
of the smartest animals on Earth, outsmarting their extinction requires
the creativity, empathy, and foresight that our species share.

**Transcript**:
Fu Manchu was one of the most
notorious escape artists at the Omaha Zoo in the 1960s. But he wasn't a performer, he was an orangutan. The keepers who locked 
his enclosure every night were baffled to find him outside
the next day hanging out with friends in a tree, or sunning on the roof. Only after installing cameras 
did they realize Fu Manchu had been picking the lock with a metal wire that he kept hidden
under his cheek pouch. The keepers shouldn't have been
surprised at Fu Manchu's cunningness. Along with our other great ape cousins, the gorillas, chimps, and bonobos, they belong to our Hominidae
family tree, which stretches back 14 million years. But it's not just their striking red hair that makes orangutans unique 
among our cousins. As the only great apes from Asia, orangutans have adapted to a life
high in the rain forest canopies. Many of the skills they learn
are transmitted through the special bond they have with their mothers, the most extended in the animal kingdom
next to humans. Orangutan mothers usually give birth
to one baby at a time, waiting up to eight years before
having another. This gives the young, who begin as fully dependent infants, plenty of time to learn how to climb and distinguish the hundreds of plants
and fruits that make up their diet. Female orangutans even stay with
their mothers into their teen years to learn child-rearing. As they grow up, orangutans also develop
a complex set of cooperative social skills by interacting with their peers
and siblings. Much like ourselves, young orangutans involuntarily mimic
the facial expressions and emotions of their playmates, with behaviors that closely parallel
human smiling and laughter. Once they finally venture out 
on their own, orangutans continue to develop
their resourcefulness, putting the skills they've learned 
into practice. Adults build a new nest each night
by carefully weaving twigs together, topping them with soft leaves,
pillows, and blankets. This process requires dexterity,
coordination, and an eye for design. Orangutans also use a variety of tools
to make their lives in the jungle easier. They turn branches into fly swatters
and back scratchers, construct umbrellas when it rains, make gloves from leafy pads, and even use leaves as bandages
to dress their wounds. But orangutan intelligence goes far
beyond jungle survival. Research in controlled environments
has shown that orangutans are self-aware, being one of the few species to recognize
their own reflections. They also display remarkable foresight,
planning, and cognition. In one experiment, researchers taught
an orangutan to use a straw to extract his favorite fruit soup
from a box. That orangutan was later given the choice
between the straw or a grape that could be 
eaten right away, and he chose the straw just in case
he was given another box of soup. In another experiment, orangutans figured
out how to reach peanuts at the bottom of long tubes
by spitting water into them. While orangutans are able to pass
cognitive tests with flying colors, there are certain problems that they
need our help to solve. Indonesia has the world's highest rate
of deforestation, and millions of acres of rain forest 
are burned annually to support the logging 
and palm oil industries. Deforestation exposes the 30,000
orangutans remaining in the wild to poachers. They kill mothers so that baby orangutans
can be sold as exotic pets. But fortunately, the story often
doesn't end here. Orphans can be confiscated
and given a second chance. At special forest schools, they recover
from emotional trauma and continue to develop 
essential life skills. Against all odds, these orphans 
demonstrate incredible resilience and readiness to learn. In Malay, the word orangutan translates
literally to "the person of the forest," a reminder of our common lineage. And despite orangutans being some
of the smartest animals on Earth, outsmarting their extinction requires
the creativity, empathy, and foresight that our species share.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
have you ever wondered why countries can't just print more money to pay off their debts or to feed the homeless or to fix unemployment or any other issue for that matter now this may seem like a rather silly question but I think it's one of those questions that people may be too embarrassed to ask but there's no shortage of people wondering the short answer can be summed up in one word inflation inflation is defamed as a persistent substantial rise in the general level of prices related to an increase in the volume of money resulting in a loss of value of currency but I'll get to that first though we need to establish exactly what money is now this may seem obvious but something that you need to understand is that money has absolutely no intrinsic value what that means that money in itself has no actual value is only considered valuable because it can buy things but if you were stranded on a desert island money would be totally useless money only has value because we believe it has value this is called the Tinkerbell effect something I learned about from Vsauce the Tinkerbell effect is used to describe something that only exists because we believe it exists and this is the case with money hypothetically speaking if he were suddenly started to believe that money had no value it wouldn't have value of course it wasn't always this way money has been around for millennia and when it was first used it was in the form of commodity money things were treated that had actual value and uses like salt spaces horses and weapons as well as precious metals such as gold and silver which technically don't have any intrinsic value either but due to the rarity they're almost universally accepted as currency then we have representative money since carrying around everything you own can be difficult representative money makes more sense basically you get your goal to a bank and they keep it safe for you and then return they give you a piece of paper acknowledging that you own that gold these pieces of paper can therefore be used as money as anyone can go and redeem the gold at any time but today almost every country in the world uses fiat money fiat money requires faith and Trust and the government that their money will have value if we use a relatively young country as an example the United States has gone through all three monetary systems within 200 years in 1790 when the United States stopped using European money a Claims Act of 1972 brought the inception of the US dollar the US dollar was originally informed commodity money in the form of gold silver and copper coins the coins were actually made from real gold silver and copper and the value of the metal that made the coins were exactly equal to their faith value the country

**Transcript**:
have you ever wondered why countries can't just print more money to pay off their debts or to feed the homeless or to fix unemployment or any other issue for that matter now this may seem like a rather silly question but I think it's one of those questions that people may be too embarrassed to ask but there's no shortage of people wondering the short answer can be summed up in one word inflation inflation is defamed as a persistent substantial rise in the general level of prices related to an increase in the volume of money resulting in a loss of value of currency but I'll get to that first though we need to establish exactly what money is now this may seem obvious but something that you need to understand is that money has absolutely no intrinsic value what that means that money in itself has no actual value is only considered valuable because it can buy things but if you were stranded on a desert island money would be totally useless money only has value because we believe it has value this is called the Tinkerbell effect something I learned about from Vsauce the Tinkerbell effect is used to describe something that only exists because we believe it exists and this is the case with money hypothetically speaking if he were suddenly started to believe that money had no value it wouldn't have value of course it wasn't always this way money has been around for millennia and when it was first used it was in the form of commodity money things were treated that had actual value and uses like salt spaces horses and weapons as well as precious metals such as gold and silver which technically don't have any intrinsic value either but due to the rarity they're almost universally accepted as currency then we have representative money since carrying around everything you own can be difficult representative money makes more sense basically you get your goal to a bank and they keep it safe for you and then return they give you a piece of paper acknowledging that you own that gold these pieces of paper can therefore be used as money as anyone can go and redeem the gold at any time but today almost every country in the world uses fiat money fiat money requires faith and Trust and the government that their money will have value if we use a relatively young country as an example the United States has gone through all three monetary systems within 200 years in 1790 when the United States stopped using European money a Claims Act of 1972 brought the inception of the US dollar the US dollar was originally informed commodity money in the form of gold silver and copper coins the coins were actually made from real gold silver and copper and the value of the metal that made the coins were exactly equal to their faith value the country then moved on to a mixture of commodity and representative money with the 1900 gold standard act the government issued dollar bells which could be exchanged for gold ane tame gold standard is a type of representative money that many countries used at the time this was an effective way to accurately calculate the exchange rate between countries for example if one gram of gold costs one pound in

**Transcript**:
have you ever wondered why countries can't just print more money to pay off their debts or to feed the homeless or to fix unemployment or any other issue for that matter now this may seem like a rather silly question but I think it's one of those questions that people may be too embarrassed to ask but there's no shortage of people wondering the short answer can be summed up in one word inflation inflation is defamed as a persistent substantial rise in the general level of prices related to an increase in the volume of money resulting in a loss of value of currency but I'll get to that first though we need to establish exactly what money is now this may seem obvious but something that you need to understand is that money has absolutely no intrinsic value what that means that money in itself has no actual value is only considered valuable because it can buy things but if you were stranded on a desert island money would be totally useless money only has value because we believe it has value this is called the Tinkerbell effect something I learned about from Vsauce the Tinkerbell effect is used to describe something that only exists because we believe it exists and this is the case with money hypothetically speaking if he were suddenly started to believe that money had no value it wouldn't have value of course it wasn't always this way money has been around for millennia and when it was first used it was in the form of commodity money things were treated that had actual value and uses like salt spaces horses and weapons as well as precious metals such as gold and silver which technically don't have any intrinsic value either but due to the rarity they're almost universally accepted as currency then we have representative money since carrying around everything you own can be difficult representative money makes more sense basically you get your goal to a bank and they keep it safe for you and then return they give you a piece of paper acknowledging that you own that gold these pieces of paper can therefore be used as money as anyone can go and redeem the gold at any time but today almost every country in the world uses fiat money fiat money requires faith and Trust and the government that their money will have value if we use a relatively young country as an example the United States has gone through all three monetary systems within 200 years in 1790 when the United States stopped using European money a Claims Act of 1972 brought the inception of the US dollar the US dollar was originally informed commodity money in the form of gold silver and copper coins the coins were actually made from real gold silver and copper and the value of the metal that made the coins were exactly equal to their faith value the country then moved on to a mixture of commodity and representative money with the 1900 gold standard act the government issued dollar bells which could be exchanged for gold ane tame gold standard is a type of representative money that many countries used at the time this was an effective way to accurately calculate the exchange rate between countries for example if one gram of gold costs one pound in Britain and one dollar 50 in America that you can easily deduce that one pen must equal one dollar 50 gold coins were discontinued and the silver was removed from other coins effectively aimed at commodity money in the United States in 1971 Richard Nixon officially abandoned the gold standard on the US moved on to fiat money so today money isn't backed by gold or anything else of value for that matter survived to the question at hand basic economics tells us that an increase in supply it results in foreign demand and therefore foreign praise so the more money and the economy the lower the value of each dollar meaning other countries can purchase more dollars and Asians for their currency the second supply and demand graph shows why life leads to a rise in prices more money and the economy causes a shift in and demand curve for goods and services but since this isn't matched by an increase in economic output prices much rise look at it this way if the government printed a million dollars and posted it to everyone in the country causing everyone to go out and buy a sports car but there's only a finite number of sports cars in the country so the logical thing to do is to increase the price of a sports car if we use an analogies to demonstrate this imagine there's four people on a desert island they each have ten pieces of fruit all fruits are considered equal and value now imagine they discover a whole forest of apple trees the nominal value of apples has increased because there's more of them but the actual value of an apple has gone down due to an increase in supply therefore in their costs ten apples for one banana since demand for apples is low but high for bananas just a clarify in this analogy the people represent different country's the fruit their respective currency and the apple trees the printed money but it's not just because of economic theory that we know printing too much money is a bad idea there's several examples throughout recent history the most recent example is Zimbabwe who in 2008 suffered extremely high inflation due to printing money this was the result of some awful decisions by president with Gabi when the economy took a turn for the worst when Gabi printed more money to pay government expenditure this caused inflation to skyrocket and in mid November 2008 the Babli's inflation peaked at actually wait hold on things first I need to provide some context inflation eliminated states is around 2% economists generally agree that inflation levels of 1 to 3% are optimum first world countries inflation rates today it range from 0 to 5 percent a country is said to enter hyperinflation when their inflation levels exceed 50 percent so with that in mind Zimbabwe's inflation at its peak reached 6 point 5 secs tell Ian percent or to put it another way that number has 22 digits it got so bad that prices doubled every 24 hours the government tried to solve the problem by printing more and more money with higher and higher denominations they also kept knocking zeros off the end by revaluing the Zimbabwean dollar three times going through four different currencies with four different ISO codes for the final redenomination they were printing 100 trillion dollar bills people were literally using wheelbarrows full of cash to buy a loaf of bread the government even made inflation illegal at one point and people were actually arrested for raising prices in 2009 ISM Bob Wian dollar was abandoned and to this day they still have no national currency their people use currencies such as a US dollar the pen sterling and the euro before the hyperinflation the first in-between dollar was worth about 125 US dollars if that 100 trillion dollar bill was worth that exchange rate that single bill would be worth more money than there s and the entire world twice but as ridiculous as this was this is only considered to be the second worst inflation in history after Hungary in 1940 sex although Zimbabwe's inflation peaked in mid November of 2008 their overall highest monthly inflation was seventy nine point six billion percent whereas Hungary's highest monthly inflation which took place in July 1946 with 41 point 9 quadrillion percent with prices doubling every 15 hours suppose i an't perspective a country with a healthy inflation rate of around 3% precious double every 23 years the currency was called the pengal and as inflation rose the bell pangos introduced short for billion pengal which is actually one trillion Pengo on the short scale as well as the record for the highest monthly inflation hungry also holds the record for the highest denomination bank nor ever issued the 100 million bell penguin note IE 100 million billion which is 100 Quintilian Pengo on the short scale when nel our Bell penguin notes were printed but never issued in 1941 the exchange rate was about 5 pengal to 1 US dollar in 1946 when the currency was discontinued things had gotten so out of hand that if you took every single banknote in the entire country they would have a total value of one tenth of a u.s. pay me hungry then switched to the forint where one formed equals 400 OCH telegin Pengo that number has 29 zeros so that's why governments can just print money to pay off their debt it does not end well it's also important to understand exactly what national dares national debt is much more complicated than personal debt it isn't simply a case of you owe people money take the country with a highest national debt the United States that currently has around 17 trillion dollars a day and you're probably aware the country that holds most US debt as China although that is true it's somewhat misleading of the total debt China only has about 8 percent most of the day is actually owned by the United States government itself by organizations such as Social Security or the Federal Reserve on top of this a further 30 percent is owned by US citizens and even though 8 percent of 17 trillion is still a lot China can't just knock on the door of the White House and demand 1.2 trillion dollars it doesn't work like that basically the US Department of the Treasury issued Treasury bonds you can buy these bonds and the government or pay you interest on that bond every year then once the bonds have matured they'll buy the Treasury bond back from you now if a country gets into financial trouble it may have to default on its debt which basically means you won't get your money back but the u.s. is generally considered an extremely risk-free investment because the US dollar is the most widely used and the most trustworthy currency in the world it's even written into the Constitution that United States cannot default on its debt I'll leave you with this thing of thought and what I think is possibly the best way to sum up why governments can't just print off unlimited amounts of money if money grew on trees it would be as valuable as leaves thanks for watching [Music]

**Transcript**:
In 2010, $30 billion worth
of fruits and vegetables were wasted by American retailers
and shoppers in part because of cosmetic problems
and perceived spoilage. That's a poor use of about 30%
of the produce on the market, not to mention the water and energy
required to grow and transport it, and the landfill space getting used up
by rotting fruit. So what are those cosmetic problems? You've probably passed over
a spotty apple in the grocery store, or accidentally sunk your thumb
into a mushy patch on a tomato. These blemishes can doom produce
to the trash can. But what are they anyway, and are they actually bad for you? Those spots are evidence of an epic battle
between plants and microbes. Like humans, plants coexist with billions
of fungi and bacteria. Some of these microbes are beneficial
to the plant, suppressing disease and helping it
extract nutrients. Others are pathogens,
attacking the produce, still alive as it sits in a store display
or your refrigerator and siphoning off molecules
they can use themselves. The good news is 
they're almost never bad for you. These fungi and bacteria have spent
millions of years developing strategies to overcome
a plant's immune system. But healthy human immune systems
are different enough that those strategies 
just don't work on us. So in a plant,
what does this process look like? Microbes can reach plants 
in a number of ways, like getting splashed onto it
during watering or fertilization. Under the right conditions, the microbes grow 
into large enough colonies to attack the waxy outer layer 
of fruit or leaves. Their target: the delicious sugars
and nutrients inside. This type of pathogen often makes
spots like this. A clump of bacteria drains the nutrients
and color from the fruit's cells making that yellow halo. It then moves outward, leaving a black spot of dead cells
in its wake. Each spot, which could contain
hundreds of thousands of microbes is actually caused by a combination
of microbial attack and the host defending itself. For example, this is the bacterial
pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Once on a tomato, 
it enters the fruit and leaves, multiplies in the space between the cells, and produces toxins and proteins that allow it to disrupt 
the plant's immune response. One toxin coronatine makes plants'
stomata open up, allowing bacteria to enter 
more freely. Coronatine also activates pathways
leading to chlorophyll degradation, which you can see as yellow spots. As the bacteria continue to feed
and multiply, they start to kill off the plant cells. That explains spots,
but what about mushy blemishes? Those are usually caused when the fruit
is attacked by microbes after it's detached from the plant. If the plant is wounded during transport, necrotic fungi can infiltrate 
through the wound, kill the cells, absorb their nutrients, and leave your food 
looking mushy or brown. Those spots in particular 
can taste pretty bad. You're eating dead 
and decomposing tissue, after all. But you can usually salvage the rest
of the fruit. The non-mushy spots, like the ones
you typically see on apples or tomatoes, are just on the surface 
and don't usually affect flavor. Of course, microbes that do make us sick,
like E. coli and salmonella, can hitch a ride on vegetables, too. But because they're not plant pathogens,
they don't typically cause spots. They just hang out 
invisibly on the surface. So it's washing fruit and veggies,
not avoiding the spotty ones, that will help you avoid getting sick. So the next time 
you're at the grocery store, don't be afraid 
to pick up funky-looking fruit. Some stores will even give you a discount. Wash them well and store them properly, as some produce like apples and cabbages
will keep in the fridge for weeks. The spotty ones may not be eye candy,
but they're safe and just as delicious.

**Transcript**:
In 2010, $30 billion worth
of fruits and vegetables were wasted by American retailers
and shoppers in part because of cosmetic problems
and perceived spoilage. That's a poor use of about 30%
of the produce on the market, not to mention the water and energy
required to grow and transport it, and the landfill space getting used up
by rotting fruit. So what are those cosmetic problems? You've probably passed over
a spotty apple in the grocery store, or accidentally sunk your thumb
into a mushy patch on a tomato. These blemishes can doom produce
to the trash can. But what are they anyway, and are they actually bad for you? Those spots are evidence of an epic battle
between plants and microbes. Like humans, plants coexist with billions
of fungi and bacteria. Some of these microbes are beneficial
to the plant, suppressing disease and helping it
extract nutrients. Others are pathogens,
attacking the produce, still alive as it sits in a store display
or your refrigerator and siphoning off molecules
they can use themselves. The good news is 
they're almost never bad for you. These fungi and bacteria have spent
millions of years developing strategies to overcome
a plant's immune system. But healthy human immune systems
are different enough that those strategies 
just don't work on us. So in a plant,
what does this process look like? Microbes can reach plants 
in a number of ways, like getting splashed onto it
during watering or fertilization. Under the right conditions, the microbes grow 
into large enough colonies to attack the waxy outer layer 
of fruit or leaves. Their target: the delicious sugars
and nutrients inside. This type of pathogen often makes
spots like this. A clump of bacteria drains the nutrients
and color from the fruit's cells making that yellow halo. It then moves outward, leaving a black spot of dead cells
in its wake. Each spot, which could contain
hundreds of thousands of microbes is actually caused by a combination
of microbial attack and the host defending itself. For example, this is the bacterial
pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Once on a tomato, 
it enters the fruit and leaves, multiplies in the space between the cells, and produces toxins and proteins that allow it to disrupt 
the plant's immune response. One toxin coronatine makes plants'
stomata open up, allowing bacteria to enter 
more freely. Coronatine also activates pathways
leading to chlorophyll degradation, which you can see as yellow spots. As the bacteria continue to feed
and multiply, they start to kill off the plant cells. That explains spots,
but what about mushy blemishes? Those are usually caused when the fruit
is attacked by microbes after it's detached from the plant. If the plant is wounded during transport, necrotic fungi can infiltrate 
through the wound, kill the cells, absorb their nutrients, and leave your food 
looking mushy or brown. Those spots in particular 
can taste pretty bad. You're eating dead 
and decomposing tissue, after all. But you can usually salvage the rest
of the fruit. The non-mushy spots, like the ones
you typically see on apples or tomatoes, are just on the surface 
and don't usually affect flavor. Of course, microbes that do make us sick,
like E. coli and salmonella, can hitch a ride on vegetables, too. But because they're not plant pathogens,
they don't typically cause spots. They just hang out 
invisibly on the surface. So it's washing fruit and veggies,
not avoiding the spotty ones, that will help you avoid getting sick. So the next time 
you're at the grocery store, don't be afraid 
to pick up funky-looking fruit. Some stores will even give you a discount. Wash them well and store them properly, as some produce like apples and cabbages
will keep in the fridge for weeks. The spotty ones may not be eye candy,
but they're safe and just as delicious.

**Transcript**:
The elephant is a creature
of epic proportions, and yet it owes its enormity to more
than 1,000 trillion microscopic cells, and on the epically small end of things, there are likely millions 
of unicellular species, yet there are very few we can see
with the naked eye. Why is that? Why don't we get unicellular elephants, or blue whales, or brown bears? To find out, we have to peer into
a cell's guts. This is where most 
of the cell's functions occur, enclosed by a cellular membrane that acts as the doorway into 
and out of the cell. Any resources the cell needs to consume, or waste products it needs to expel, first have to pass through this membrane. But there's a biological quirk 
in this set up. A cell's surface and volume increase
at different rates. Cells come in many shapes, but imagining them as cubes will make
the math easy to calculate. A cube has six faces. These represent the cell membrane,
and make up its surface area. A cube measuring one micrometer
on each side, that's one millionth of a meter, would have a total surface area
of six square micrometers. And its volume would be 
one cubic micrometer. This would give us six units 
of surface area for every single unit of volume, a six to one ratio. But things change dramatically
if we make the cube ten times bigger, measuring ten micrometers on each side. This cell would have a surface area
of 600 square micrometers and a volume of one thousand
cubic micrometers, a ratio of only .6 to one. That's less than one unit of surface area
to service each unit of volume. As the cube grows, its volume increases
much faster than its surface area. The interior would overtake the membrane, leaving too little surface area for things
to quickly move in and out of the cell. A huge cell would back up with waste
and eventually die and disintegrate. There's another plus to having multitudes
of smaller cells, too. It's hardly a tragedy if one gets 
punctured, infected, or destroyed. Now, there are some 
exceptionally large cells that have adapted to cheat the system, like the body's longest cell, a neuron that stretches from the base
of the spine to the foot. To compensate for its length,
it's really thin, just a few micrometers in diameter. Another example can be found
in your small intestine, where structures called villi
fold up into little fingers. Each villus is made of cells with highly
folded membranes that have tiny bumps called microvilli
to increase their surface area. But what about single-celled organisms? Caulerpa taxifolia, a green algae
that can reach 30 centimeters long, is believed to be the largest 
single-celled organism in the world thanks to its unique biological hacks. Its surface area is enhanced with
a frond-like structure. It uses photosynthesis to assemble
its own food molecules and it's coenocytic. That means it's a single cell
with multiple nuclei, making it like a multicellular organism
but without the divisions between cells. Yet even the biggest unicellular organisms
have limits, and none grows nearly as large
as the elephant, whale, or bear. But within every big creature
are trillions of minuscule cells perfectly suited in all their tininess to keeping the Earth's giants 
lumbering along.

**Transcript**:
The elephant is a creature
of epic proportions, and yet it owes its enormity to more
than 1,000 trillion microscopic cells, and on the epically small end of things, there are likely millions 
of unicellular species, yet there are very few we can see
with the naked eye. Why is that? Why don't we get unicellular elephants, or blue whales, or brown bears? To find out, we have to peer into
a cell's guts. This is where most 
of the cell's functions occur, enclosed by a cellular membrane that acts as the doorway into 
and out of the cell. Any resources the cell needs to consume, or waste products it needs to expel, first have to pass through this membrane. But there's a biological quirk 
in this set up. A cell's surface and volume increase
at different rates. Cells come in many shapes, but imagining them as cubes will make
the math easy to calculate. A cube has six faces. These represent the cell membrane,
and make up its surface area. A cube measuring one micrometer
on each side, that's one millionth of a meter, would have a total surface area
of six square micrometers. And its volume would be 
one cubic micrometer. This would give us six units 
of surface area for every single unit of volume, a six to one ratio. But things change dramatically
if we make the cube ten times bigger, measuring ten micrometers on each side. This cell would have a surface area
of 600 square micrometers and a volume of one thousand
cubic micrometers, a ratio of only .6 to one. That's less than one unit of surface area
to service each unit of volume. As the cube grows, its volume increases
much faster than its surface area. The interior would overtake the membrane, leaving too little surface area for things
to quickly move in and out of the cell. A huge cell would back up with waste
and eventually die and disintegrate. There's another plus to having multitudes
of smaller cells, too. It's hardly a tragedy if one gets 
punctured, infected, or destroyed. Now, there are some 
exceptionally large cells that have adapted to cheat the system, like the body's longest cell, a neuron that stretches from the base
of the spine to the foot. To compensate for its length,
it's really thin, just a few micrometers in diameter. Another example can be found
in your small intestine, where structures called villi
fold up into little fingers. Each villus is made of cells with highly
folded membranes that have tiny bumps called microvilli
to increase their surface area. But what about single-celled organisms? Caulerpa taxifolia, a green algae
that can reach 30 centimeters long, is believed to be the largest 
single-celled organism in the world thanks to its unique biological hacks. Its surface area is enhanced with
a frond-like structure. It uses photosynthesis to assemble
its own food molecules and it's coenocytic. That means it's a single cell
with multiple nuclei, making it like a multicellular organism
but without the divisions between cells. Yet even the biggest unicellular organisms
have limits, and none grows nearly as large
as the elephant, whale, or bear. But within every big creature
are trillions of minuscule cells perfectly suited in all their tininess to keeping the Earth's giants

**Transcript**:
Hello Internet. Thoughts compete for space in your brain:
cat photos, news stories, beliefs structures, funny GIFs, educational videos, not-so-educational
videos and your thinking inventory is limited. A thought without a brain to think it, dies. Now we can treat thoughts as though they're
alive. Specifically alive like germs. That might sound weird but stick with me. Take jokes. Jokes are thought germs that live
in your brain -- and when you tell the joke to another brain, you help it reproduce. Just like when you have the flu and sneeze
to help it reproduce. This germ gets into its host by snot through the mouth and this
one by words through the ear but it's reproduction either way. Logging on to your social media then, is exposing
yourself to everyone's mental sneezes. Each post a glob of snot with an thought germ trying
to get in your brain -- if not for permanent residence then at least long enough to get
you to press the share button and sneeze it with everyone you know. In this analogy then, a funny cat photo with
a perfect caption is a super-flu. Now just as germs exploit weak points in your
immune system, so do thought germs exploit weak points in your brain. A.K.A. emotions. Once inside, thought germs that press emotional
buttons get their hosts to spread them more -- measurably more. Well, except sadness,
sad thought germs don't get very far. Awe is pretty good which is why websites that
construct thought germs like biological weapons arm them with them titles like "7 whatevers
that will blow your mind" or "The Shocking Secret behind... this thing" But anger is the ultimate edge for a thought
germ. Anger, bypasses your mental immune system, and compels you to share it. Being aware of your brain's weak spots is
necessary for good mental hygiene -- like knowing how to wash your hands. Because even
without intentional construction, any thought germ on the Internet can, on its own, grow
more infections as it spreads. To talk about why, lets forget anger for a moment and go
back to that cat photo. Every photo ever taken is a thought germ,
and most die a quick death like the bazillion cat photos (or baby photos) posted on The
Internet that are never shared. But a mildly funny cat photo can grow into so much more,
because just as transatlantic flights were the best thing to happen to germ germs, so
the Internet is the best thing to happen to thought germs. For once on-board, that cat photo is a thought
germ that can leap into other brains. And those brains might share it, and here's the
key point, occasionally, change it -- a Photoshop here, a tweaked caption there. Most changes are terrible, but some make the
thought germ even funnier, getting brains to share it more. Which results in more changes
and a shot at super-stardom. A thus a lowly cat photo can achieve global brain domination.
At least for a few hours. The Internet, with its unparalleled ability
to share and randomly change thought germs can't help but help make them stronger. With jokes, that's awesome -- but with angry
germs not always so awesome. No. Angry germs, the more they're shared undergo
the same process, changing and distorting to be more aggravating. These have a better
chance of spreading than their more accurate but more boring rivals. But like plagues, thought germs can burn though
a population too quickly. Just watch your favorite meme generating machine for a week
and you'll see the life-cycle fly by. However some thought germs have found a way
around burnout. Now, I must warn you, depending on which thought germs live in your head and
which you fight for, the next section might sound *horrifying*. So please keep in mind,
we're going to talk about what makes some thought germs, particularly angry ones, successful
and not how good or bad they are. OK? Deep breath: calm. Though germs can burn out because once everyone
agrees, it's hard to keep talking and thus thinking about them. But if there's an opposing thought germ, an
argument, then the thinking never stops. Disagrement doesn't have to be angry, but again, angry
helps. The more visible an argument gets the more bystanders it draws in which makes it
more visible is why every group from the most innocuous internet forum to The National Conversation
can turn into a double rage storm across the sky in no time. Wait, these though germs aren't competing,
they're co-operating. Working together they reach more brains and hold their thoughts
longer than they could alone. Thought germs on opposite sides of an argument can be symbiotic. One tool symbiotic anger germs in particular
can employ is your-with-us-or-against-us. Whatever thought germ just leaped to the front
of your brain, push it back. This video isn't about that. We're just talking about the tool,
and this one makes it hard, for neutral brains to resist and its diviciveness also grows
its symbiotic partner. This explains why, in some arguments gaining
more allies also gains more enemies. Because though the participants think they're involved
in a firey battle to the death from the anger germs perspective one side is a field of flowers
and the other a flock of butterflies. *Of course* planting more flowers will get you
more butterflies and getting more butterflies will pollinate more flowers. If there is some argument that splits the
population and lasts forever that even the most neutral people find difficult to avoid,
you just might be looking at a super successful pair of symbiotic anger germs that have reached
ecological stability Now, one final depressing though. Uhhhh…
I mean one more Awe inspiring point, that will reveal the secrets of, ahhh -- actually
no it's just depressing. When opposing groups get big they don't really
argue with each other, they *mostly* argue with themselves about how angry the *other*
group makes them. We can actually graph fights on the Internet to see this in action. Each
becomes its own quasi isolated internet, sharing thoughts about the other. You see where this is going, right? Each group becomes a breeding ground for thought
germs *about* the other -- and as before the most enraging -- but not necessarily the most
accurate -- spread fastest. A group almost can't help but construct a totem of the other
so enraging they talk about it all the time -- which, now that you know how though germs
grow, is exactly what make the totem always perfectly maddening. Now, all this isn't to say that there's no
point in arguing. (That's a different video). Or that the Internet isn't amazing, or that
there aren't things worth trying to change peoples' minds about. And thought germs of
all kinds come and go. But it's useful to be aware of how thought
can use our emotions to spread and how the more rapidly a thought is able to spread the
more chances it has to become *even better* at spreading through random changes made to
it. Sometimes that's great, sometimes it's terrible. But if you want to maintain a healthy brain
it pays to be cautious of thoughts that have passed through a lot of other brains and that
poke you where you are weakest. It's your brain -- be hygienic with it.

in a firey battle to the death from the anger germs perspective one side is a field of flowers
and the other a flock of butterflies. *Of course* planting more flowers will get you
more butterflies and getting more butterflies will pollinate more flowers. If there is some argument that splits the
population and lasts forever that even the most neutral people find difficult to avoid,
you just might be looking at a super successful pair of symbiotic anger germs that have reached
ecological stability Now, one final depressing though. Uhhhh…
I mean one more Awe inspiring point, that will reveal the secrets of, ahhh -- actually
no it's just depressing. When opposing groups get big they don't really
argue with each other, they *mostly* argue with themselves about how angry the *other*
group makes them. We can actually graph fights on the Internet to see this in action. Each
becomes its own quasi isolated internet, sharing thoughts about the other. You see where this is going, right? Each group becomes a breeding ground for thought
germs *about* the other -- and as before the most enraging -- but not necessarily the most
accurate -- spread fastest. A group almost can't help but construct a totem of the other
so enraging they talk about it all the time -- which, now that you know how though germs
grow, is exactly what make the totem always perfectly maddening. Now, all this isn't to say that there's no
point in arguing. (That's a different video). Or that the Internet isn't amazing, or that
there aren't things worth trying to change peoples' minds about. And thought germs of
all kinds come and go. But it's useful to be aware of how thought
can use our emotions to spread and how the more rapidly a thought is able to spread the
more chances it has to become *even better* at spreading through random changes made to
it. Sometimes that's great, sometimes it's terrible. But if you want to maintain a healthy brain
it pays to be cautious of thoughts that have passed through a lot of other brains and that
poke you where you are weakest. It's your brain -- be hygienic with it.

**Transcript**:
What does it mean to be one in a million? Not in the greeting card sense, in the scientific sense, where one part per million
is a unit of measurement. Parts per million counts the number
of units of one substance per one million units of another. It can measure concentrations when
a small amount makes a big difference. For example, a concentration of just
35 ppm of carbon monoxide in the air is poisonous to us. We encounter measurements like this
pretty often, but because it's hard to conceptualize
really large numbers, it's difficult to wrap our brain around
what one part per million really means. So here are nine helpful ways
to visualize it. If you had 11,363 pianos-worth 
of piano keys, one of those keys would be about
one part per million. So would a single granule of sugar
among 273 sugar cubes, one second in eleven and a half days, or four dots in the painting, "A Sunday Afternoon on 
the Island of La Grande Jatte." Your bath tub's capacity 
is about 60 gallons, so seven drops of ink would be
one part per million. The English version of the Harry Potter
series has 1,084,170 words, which makes "hippogriff" on page 221
of "The Prisoner of Azkaban" a little less than one part per million. A million kernels of corn 
is about 1,250 ears, so one kernel in that truckload
would be one part per million. There are 10 million bricks in
the Empire State Building, so one part per million 
would be a pile of just ten. And finally, 100 people worked together
to animate this video. Collectively, they have about 10 million
hairs on their heads. Pluck ten of those hairs,
and you have one in a million.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. When you call customer service and hear this "to ensure quality service your call may be monitored or recorded",
they're not kidding. Over the last year the Marchex Institute
analysed more than 600,000 recorded phone conversations Americans made to businesses in the United States. Turns out, people from Ohio were the most likely to use curse words - the 'A' word, 
the 'F' word and the 'S' word. Washington state residents were
the least likely to use bad words. But what makes a word bad? Oh, be careful because etymologically speaking even the word 'bad' can be considered a bad word. It began in old English as a derogatory term for an effeminate man.
Eighty percent of swear words overheard in public in 1986, 1997 and 2006 were essentially the same.
One third of all counts included the top two - the 'F' word and the 'S' word. Slate's brilliant Lexicon Valley podcast purported that these 10 words makeup about 0.7% of the average English speakers daily vocabulary, which means socially unacceptable words are used almost as often as socially descriptive words.
First person plural pronouns account for about 1% of the words we say everyday. When a bad word is bleeped, it is covered with a 1 kilohertz sine wave, which sounds like this. Son of a ... By the way, the symbols and
squiggles that are used to represent a bad word have a name.
They're called grawlixes. They were named by Mort Walker in his seminal "The Lexicon of Comicana." 
He names a lot of things but most of them show stuff, they don't hide stuff. Why the need to hide bad words, especially if we all pretty much know what's being said?
Well, there is no one single reason bad words are bad. Steven Pinker in his excellent lecture
on the topic delineates five types of swearing.
First of all, some words are bad on purpose.
They are created and/or used with the intent to hurt others.
He calls this "abusive swearing." Using words to insult, humiliate, objectify or marginalise disfavoured people. Now, if that this disfavoured person is God, we're talking about supernatural swearing, which was particularly taboo in Victorian times. It was believed that casually or vainly referring to God would physically injure God himself, literally. So, at the time people were
forced to come up with euphemisms, like "Zounds!" and "Gadzooks!", which  originally meant "God's Wounds!" and "God's Hooks!", referring to the nails driven through the hands of Jesus. Historically, swear words often
came from things we were afraid of, things we perceived as dangerous, stronger than us and mercurial. Such as death, disease and infirmity, sex and sexually transmitted diseases,
as well as body fluids, germy, gross effluvia. Words for those gross things became gross
and bad in and of themselves, uncouth to speak. But not all words for gross things are socially unacceptable, which brings us to Pinker's second type of swearing - emphatic swearing. Emphatic swearing is where the
taboo-ness of bad words becomes quite practical.
You wouldn't usually use those words but when you really want to convey that your current
emotions matter more to you than proper social conduct, you can use them. Dysphemism. A euphemism is kind, acceptable word
that allows you to talk about something unpleasant while simultaneously letting everyone know you totally get that it's unpleasant and want to respect that. For instance, if you want to be
professional, you wouldn't say s***. You might say 'defecate'. If, on the other hand,
you really want to drive home just how unpleasant the experience was, dysphemisms can help out a lot. It wasn't a bag of canine defecation you found on your front porch, it was a s*** bag of hot dog s***.
Both of these words refer to pretty much the same thing but they have different levels of
social acceptability and that's very helpful. It means word choice allows us to not only refer to things in the real world but also to how we feel about them. If both these words had the same level
of social acceptance we might even have to find new, badder
words so as not to lose the power language currently has to express emotion, repulsion and disgust. But when it comes to two words
referring to the same thing, but with different levels of social acceptance,
who decides which one's good and which one's bad?
Well, historically, many of the bad words we use today are the result of class differences. In medieval England, the lower-class Saxons spoke a Germanic tongue while the upper-class Normans spoke a language related to French and Latin. English, as we know it today,
contains many consequences of their differences. 
The lower class worked with animals and from them we get animal names. The upper class only ate the animals, which is where
the names of the meat come from. Today's swear words are similar.
Defecation stems from fancy pants Latin, whereas the less classy s*** is Germanic. There's also idiomatic swearing, where nothing is being emphasized. No dysphemism is meant;
instead, it's an easygoing type of swearing that shows an atmosphere is casual. Bad words can be used,
we're all close here. It's okay to swear, we're all cool. Cathartic swearing is a bit different. It gives us "lalochezia," the medical term for the relief swearing provides when you're in pain. In the brain, swearing seems to involve different regions
than regular language, which may explain why people with
aphasia caused by brain damage struggle to comprehend or construct spoken words but yet are fluent at swearing. Or why people with coprolalia control normal language just fine, but involuntarily utter profanity, an obscene words. It turns out swearing may be centralized in the limbic system, along with the motions.
Many animals make automatic noises when in pain or threat to startle or intimidate attackers, or to let others know what's going on. In humans, bad words are great for this purpose. Their taboo-ness makes them special.
People wouldn't use them otherwise, so they are great alarms. Swearing is changing.
Some bad words are being used more and more frequently. Of the seven words, George
Carlin said you could never say on television. Today, every second 22 of them are sent out on Twitter. So, what will swearing look like in the future? It probably won't go away altogether, it's too useful. But the words we don't like will likely change. History has shown that as disease
becomes less scary and sex and the supernatural more personal, words related to them 
become less taboo and more common; 
whereas words that were common in the past are increasingly unpleasant. Perhaps, in the future, spurt not by runaway political correctness but by wider knowledge, words like "schizo", "mental", "aspy", or even "depressed" will take the square stage. Or as John McWhorter ventured,
words centered around class and the gap between opportunity and disadvantage will become more taboo. Salt of the Earth, trash, chav, pikey, urban as a pejorative. When McKay Hatch started a "No Cussing Club" at his school, his campaign became the
target of so many online jokes and insults for being lame or anti-free speech. On his book, he literally subtitled his own name "the most cyberbullied kid in the world." People care about this stuff.
Is it censorship to tell us what we can and cannot say or is it a safety seal, ensuring certain
dysphemisms don't get worn down to a quotidian bluntness like every other word? Or is that badness of bad words a boundary, a moving boundary of we reject - sometimes arbitrary, sometimes irrational, but always moving
in the direction of acceptance moving forward? Crime and inequality have existed ever since they could. But when N.W.A released a
reaction, in the form of a song with bad word in the title, "F*** the Police",
the Federal Bureau of Investigations released a statement against the song.
It was the only time, up until then and since,
the FBI has ever issued an official statement about a work of art. Bad words have power. If you wanna push for change you'll need something to push. If everything's fine, nothing's cool. So, bad words are the precipitate of a larger reaction - the process of us slowly becoming what we want to become. That's some deep s***. And as always,  thanks for watching.

**Transcript**:
There's an organism 
that changed the world. It caused both the first mass extinction
in Earth's history and also paved the way for complex life. How? By sending the first free oxygen
molecules into our atmosphere, and they did all this
as single-celled life forms. They're cyanobacteria, and the story of these simple organisms that don't even have nuclei 
or any other organelles is a pivotal chapter 
in the story of life on Earth. Earth's atmosphere wasn't always 
the oxygen-rich mixture we breathe today. 3.5 billion years ago, the atmosphere
was mostly nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. Almost all oxygen was locked up 
in molecules like water, not floating around in the air. The oceans were populated by
anaerobic microbes. Those are simple, unicellular life forms
that thrive without oxygen and get energy by scavenging
what molecules they find. But somewhere between 
2.5 and 3.5 billion years ago, one of these microbial species, probably floating 
on the surface of the ocean, evolved a new ability: photosynthesis. Structures in their cell membrane
could harness the energy from sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water
into oxygen gas and sugars, which they could use for energy. Those organisms were the ancestors
of what we now call cyanobacteria. Their bluish color comes from 
the blue-green pigments that capture the sunlight they need. Photosynthesis gave those ancient bacteria
a huge advantage over other species. They could now produce their own energy from an almost endless supply 
of raw ingredients, so their populations exploded and they started polluting the atmosphere
with a new waste product: oxygen. At first, the trickle of extra oxygen was
soaked up by chemical reactions with iron or decomposing cells, but after a few hundred million years, the cyanobacteria were producing oxygen
faster than it could be absorbed, and the gas started building up
in the atmosphere. That was a big problem for the rest
of Earth's inhabitants. Oxygen-rich air 
was actually toxic to them. The result? About 2.5 billion years ago was a mass
extinction of virtually all life on Earth, which barely spared the cyanobacteria. Geologists call this
the Great Oxygenation Event, or even the Oxygen Catastrophe. That wasn't the only problem. Methane had been acting as a potent
greenhouse gas that kept the Earth warm, but now, the extra oxygen reacted with
methane to form carbon dioxide and water, which don't trap as much heat. The thinner atmospheric blanket caused Earth's first, 
and possibly longest, ice age, the Huronian Glaciation. The planet was basically 
one giant snowball for several hundred million years. Eventually, life adjusted. Aerobic organisms, 
which can use oxygen for energy, started sopping up some of the excess
gas in the atmosphere. The oxygen concentration rose and fell until eventually it reached 
the approximate 21% we have today. And being able to use 
the chemical energy in oxygen gave organisms the boost they needed
to diversify and evolve more complex forms. Cyanobacteria had a part 
to play in that story, too. Hundreds of millions of years ago, some other prehistoric microbe
swallowed a cyanobacterium whole in a process called endosymbiosis. In doing so, that microbe acquired
its own internal photosynthesis factory. This was the ancestor of plant cells. And cyanobacteria became chloroplasts, the organelles that carry out 
photosynthesis today. Cyanobacteria are still around
in almost every environment on Earth: oceans, fresh water, soil, antarctic rocks, sloth fur. They still pump oxygen
into the atmosphere, and they also pull nitrogen out to
fertilize the plants they helped create. We wouldn't recognize life on Earth
without them. But also thanks to them, we almost didn't have 
life on Earth at all.

gas in the atmosphere. The oxygen concentration rose and fell until eventually it reached 
the approximate 21% we have today. And being able to use 
the chemical energy in oxygen gave organisms the boost they needed
to diversify and evolve more complex forms. Cyanobacteria had a part 
to play in that story, too. Hundreds of millions of years ago, some other prehistoric microbe
swallowed a cyanobacterium whole in a process called endosymbiosis. In doing so, that microbe acquired
its own internal photosynthesis factory. This was the ancestor of plant cells. And cyanobacteria became chloroplasts, the organelles that carry out 
photosynthesis today. Cyanobacteria are still around
in almost every environment on Earth: oceans, fresh water, soil, antarctic rocks, sloth fur. They still pump oxygen
into the atmosphere, and they also pull nitrogen out to
fertilize the plants they helped create. We wouldn't recognize life on Earth
without them. But also thanks to them, we almost didn't have 
life on Earth at all.

**Transcript**:
There's an organism 
that changed the world. It caused both the first mass extinction
in Earth's history and also paved the way for complex life. How? By sending the first free oxygen
molecules into our atmosphere, and they did all this
as single-celled life forms. They're cyanobacteria, and the story of these simple organisms that don't even have nuclei 
or any other organelles is a pivotal chapter 
in the story of life on Earth. Earth's atmosphere wasn't always 
the oxygen-rich mixture we breathe today. 3.5 billion years ago, the atmosphere
was mostly nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. Almost all oxygen was locked up 
in molecules like water, not floating around in the air. The oceans were populated by
anaerobic microbes. Those are simple, unicellular life forms
that thrive without oxygen and get energy by scavenging
what molecules they find. But somewhere between 
2.5 and 3.5 billion years ago, one of these microbial species, probably floating 
on the surface of the ocean, evolved a new ability: photosynthesis. Structures in their cell membrane
could harness the energy from sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water
into oxygen gas and sugars, which they could use for energy. Those organisms were the ancestors
of what we now call cyanobacteria. Their bluish color comes from 
the blue-green pigments that capture the sunlight they need. Photosynthesis gave those ancient bacteria
a huge advantage over other species. They could now produce their own energy from an almost endless supply 
of raw ingredients, so their populations exploded and they started polluting the atmosphere
with a new waste product: oxygen. At first, the trickle of extra oxygen was
soaked up by chemical reactions with iron or decomposing cells, but after a few hundred million years, the cyanobacteria were producing oxygen
faster than it could be absorbed, and the gas started building up
in the atmosphere. That was a big problem for the rest
of Earth's inhabitants. Oxygen-rich air 
was actually toxic to them. The result? About 2.5 billion years ago was a mass
extinction of virtually all life on Earth, which barely spared the cyanobacteria. Geologists call this
the Great Oxygenation Event, or even the Oxygen Catastrophe. That wasn't the only problem. Methane had been acting as a potent
greenhouse gas that kept the Earth warm, but now, the extra oxygen reacted with
methane to form carbon dioxide and water, which don't trap as much heat. The thinner atmospheric blanket caused Earth's first, 
and possibly longest, ice age, the Huronian Glaciation. The planet was basically 
one giant snowball for several hundred million years. Eventually, life adjusted. Aerobic organisms, 
which can use oxygen for energy, started sopping up some of the excess

**Transcript**:
Today, I'm gonna show you how to make this really cool magnetic slime. It's fun to play with, and to watch what happens when you introduce a magnet. Start, by taking a bottle of Elmer's Glue. You might find other PVA glue also works. Take the top off, and empty it out into a bowl. Fill the bottle halfway with water. Screw the lid back on and give it a good shake, to clean the inside of the bottle. Then empty it in to the bowl as well. Next, we need a packet of Borax powder. Take a tablespoonful. And stir it into a small jug of water until it dissolves. If you haven't got any Borax powder, you could try using a laundry detergent like Tide or a bottle of liquid starch. You can check the ingredients to see if they contain Borax. And carefully use some of that instead of the solution i'm making now. Next, we need to mix the PVA, and slowly pour in a small amount of the Borax solution. You don't need a lot, you can always add more later. Keep mixing it with your spoon and you should find very quickly it starts to clump together and looks slimy. Keep on mixing it and after a while, you can use your hands to mold it all together. Keep ongoing and you should end up with a nice ball of slime like this. Pretty cool, huh? It strechy and slimy and really fun to play with. You can put it on the table, and carefully watch it melt into a blob. To make it magnetic, we're going to add some iron filings. Pour some on to the slime. And work it into the mixture. I'm adding a little bit more, and really folding it in. You need to make sure, theres no pockets of filings, like this which haven't been mixed in. So keep ongoing. And when it's ready, you should have a light grey slime. Now if we take a magnet, and hold it close by, you can see how it reacts. The slime's attracted to the magnet and you can make it move. You've got to be quick or it'll stick to the magnet. These neodymium magnets are really powerful. And you can watch what happens, when they get stuck into the slime. Pretty cool, huh? I have speeded up some of the footage, so it's quicker to watch. It can be difficult to get the slime and the iron filings back off the magnet. You can stack magnets, to make them stronger. And carefully watch what happens as the slime jumps up. And wraps itself around. It's great fun to play around with. And watch it all move. If you try to keep this slime, to use again on a later day, you'll probably find the iron filings have gotten rusty and turned it all brown and disgusting. So I wouldn't try keeping it. I hope you've enjoyed watching this video. If you want to see more, then click on the links on the right hand side. Or take a look at my youtube channel page. Stay safe, have fun and as always, thanks for watching! Doo Doo Doo Doo music.

Keep ongoing and you should end up with a nice ball of slime like this. Pretty cool, huh? It strechy and slimy and really fun to play with. You can put it on the table, and carefully watch it melt into a blob. To make it magnetic, we're going to add some iron filings. Pour some on to the slime. And work it into the mixture. I'm adding a little bit more, and really folding it in. You need to make sure, theres no pockets of filings, like this which haven't been mixed in. So keep ongoing. And when it's ready, you should have a light grey slime. Now if we take a magnet, and hold it close by, you can see how it reacts. The slime's attracted to the magnet and you can make it move. You've got to be quick or it'll stick to the magnet. These neodymium magnets are really powerful. And you can watch what happens, when they get stuck into the slime. Pretty cool, huh? I have speeded up some of the footage, so it's quicker to watch. It can be difficult to get the slime and the iron filings back off the magnet. You can stack magnets, to make them stronger. And carefully watch what happens as the slime jumps up. And wraps itself around. It's great fun to play around with. And watch it all move. If you try to keep this slime, to use again on a later day, you'll probably find the iron filings have gotten rusty and turned it all brown and disgusting. So I wouldn't try keeping it. I hope you've enjoyed watching this video. If you want to see more, then click on the links on the right hand side. Or take a look at my youtube channel page. Stay safe, have fun and as always, thanks for watching! Doo Doo Doo Doo music.

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: So you've
heard of Andy Warhol and you know he did the
soup cans and the portraits. But today, I want to tell
you why his work really is interesting and worth
your consideration. Here's the case for Andy Warhol. You know him to look like this. But Andrew Warhola
was born in Pittsburgh to Slovakian immigrant
parents and started out looking like this. He grew up sickly and
spend a lot of time at home drawing with his mom. But he eventually
escaped to New York, after graduating from
Carnegie Tech in 1949. He changed his name and
quickly became a success as a commercial illustrator. He developed a
signature technique that allowed him to trace
and copy images and create a delicate blotted line. It was an early instance of
his affinity for automation or finding other people
or processes that do the work for and with him. He was determined to make it in
the field of so-called fine art and started shopping
for a way in. Instead of making art
for advertisements, he started making
advertisements as art, choosing subject matter
that would find traction with the emerging
field of pop art. He made paintings of Coca
Cola; S&H green stamps; and, of course,
Campbell's soup cans. He saw these things
as a common language, saying what's great about this
country is that America started the tradition where the richest
consumers by essentially the same things as the poorest. And it wasn't about the
individual things so much as the sheer
abundance of things, which reflected the spread of
mass manufacturing and growing postwar American
consumer culture. Warhol started out
using rubber stamps and stencils to make
these paintings. But soon landed
on silk screening as a way to speed things up. He created his
well-known factory and set to work with
assistants, rolling out product after product, displaying them
in warehouse-like arrangements. He was also interested in
products of the human variety and started making
paintings of celebrities, reproducing images from
publicity stills, newspapers, and magazines, making shrew
commentary on the celebrity as commodity. There are number of subjects
that recur Warhol's work, shoes, products, money,
celebrities, rich people, disaster, death, himself; shoes,
products, money, celebrities, rich people, disaster,
death, himself. But these weren't just
Warhol's obsessions. They are deeply reflective
of the culture of the time. If you ascribed to the theory
that the 20th century was the American century,
then Warhol's work takes on even more importance. His work charts the
development of our obsession with fame and questions the
growing commercialization and uniformity of most
areas of American life. Warhol was an extremely
astute businessperson, who formed his first
corporate entity, Andy Warhol Enterprises, in 1957. And he never really
stopped working for hire. He made thousands of
commissioned portraits, the first of which was this one
of art collector Ethel Scull, based on photos taken
by a machine or rather a photo booth. By the 1970s,
commissioned portraits were a solid chunk
of Warhol's income. Anyone could have their
portrait made for $25,000, with additional canvases
available at discounted rates. Along with his services,
Warhol was also keen to trade on his
own image, creating numerous self-portraits
throughout his career and offering himself
up for endorsements. And, of course,
Warhol was not just an artist, but also a
filmmaker, band manager, magazine publisher,
and TV producer, who fearlessly explored
and embraced new media. From the 1950s until his
untimely death in 1987, Warhol was a shape shifter,
always open to the new, always innovating, and
always reflecting the time. Like Jay Z, but far
earlier, he understood that to be an artist
in a market economy meant not being a businessman,
but being a business, man. And he turned himself into
a globally recognized brand. People debate whether
Warhol defined an ad-driven, factory-made
culture or was defined by it. But his work remains important
because what mattered to Warhol proved prophetic. People called him a sellout. But by laying bare the
relationship between commerce and art, Warhol nullified
the very idea of a sellout. And in the process
made possible the work Jeff Koons, Shepard Fairey, and
so many contemporary artists. [MUSIC PLAYING]

**Transcript**:
While touring the remains of
ancient Alexandria, Egypt, there are a few things that
present-day explorers should look for. First, as you travel along 
the Great Harbor, keep your eyes open 
for large columns and statues. Across the bay to your left is the island
where the Great Lighthouse once stood. And as you make your way through
the palaces of the Royal Quarter and reach the area where
the Library of Alexandria once stood, keep your eyes open for sharks. Because if you visit this section
of Alexandria, you'll be fifteen feet deep
in the Mediterranean Sea. Though people are most familiar
with Plato's fictional Atlantis, many real underwater cities 
actually exist. Places like Alexandria, Port Royal, Jamaica, and Pavlopetri, Greece. Sunken cities are studied by scientists to help us understand the lives
of our ancestors, the dynamic nature of our planet, and the impact of each on the other. Water is essential for life,
food sources, and transport, so many cities have been built
along coast lines and river banks. However, these benefits also come
with risks because natural forces that can sink
a city are at their doorstep. Take, for instance, an earthquake. June 7, 1692 seemed like a normal morning
in Port Royal, Jamaica, then one of the richest ports 
in the world, but when a massive earthquake struck, two-thirds of Port Royal immediately
sank to its rooftops. Today, many buildings 
and elements of everyday life remain surprisingly intact 
on the sea floor, frozen in time. That includes a 300-year-old pocket watch
that stopped at 11:43, the moment Port Royal slipped
beneath the Carribean. And during the winter of 373 BCE, the Greek city of Helike was struck
by an earthquake so strong that it liquefied the sandy ground
upon which the city was built. Minutes later, a tsunami struck the city, and Helike and its inhabitants
sunk downwards into the Mediterranean Sea. Centuries later, Roman tourists would sail
on the lagoon that formed and peer down at the city's remains. Earthquakes are sudden, 
unpredictable disasters that have drowned cities in an instant. Luckily, however, throughout history, the majority of sunken cities were not
submerged by a single cataclysmic event, but by a combination 
of more gradual processes. For instance, Pavlopetri,
the oldest known sunken city, was built on the southern coastline
of Greece 5,000 years ago. It's an example of a city
that was submerged due to what is called 
isostatic sea level change. 18,000 years ago when the Ice Age ended, glaciers began melting and the sea level
rose globally until about 5,000 years ago. Isostatic sea level change isn't caused
by that melt water, but rather the Earth's crust slowly
springing back from the released weight of the glaciers, making some places rise,
and others sink. The ground around Pavlopetri
is still sinking at an average rate 
of a millimeter per year. But the ancient inhabitants were able
to move gradually inland over several generations before they finally abandoned the city
about 3,000 years ago. Today, divers swim over the streets
of Pavlopetri and peer through ancient door jams into the foundations of houses 
and community buildings. They learn about the people who lived
there by observing what they left behind. Natural geological events,
such as earthquakes and tsunamis, will continue to shape our continents, just as they have for millions of years. As increased global warming melts
our polar ice caps at accelerated rates and sea levels rise, we will be forced to adapt, like Pavlopetri's inhabitants. Undoubtedly, over the coming centuries, some of the coastal areas 
that we live in today will eventually be claimed 
by the water, too - cities like Venice, New Orleans, Amsterdam, Miami, and Tokyo. Imagine what future civilizations
will learn about us as they swim around the ancient ruins
of the cities that we live in today.

Evaluation Prompt:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
While touring the remains of
ancient Alexandria, Egypt, there are a few things that
present-day explorers should look for. First, as you travel along 
the Great Harbor, keep your eyes open 
for large columns and statues. Across the bay to your left is the island
where the Great Lighthouse once stood. And as you make your way through
the palaces of the Royal Quarter and reach the area where
the Library of Alexandria once stood, keep your eyes open for sharks. Because if you visit this section
of Alexandria, you'll be fifteen feet deep
in the Mediterranean Sea. Though people are most familiar
with Plato's fictional Atlantis, many real underwater cities 
actually exist. Places like Alexandria, Port Royal, Jamaica, and Pavlopetri, Greece. Sunken cities are studied by scientists to help us understand the lives
of our ancestors, the dynamic nature of our planet, and the impact of each on the other. Water is essential for life,
food sources, and transport, so many cities have been built
along coast lines and river banks. However, these benefits also come
with risks because natural forces that can sink
a city are at their doorstep. Take, for instance, an earthquake. June 7, 1692 seemed like a normal morning
in Port Royal, Jamaica, then one of the richest ports 
in the world, but when a massive earthquake struck, two-thirds of Port Royal immediately
sank to its rooftops. Today, many buildings 
and elements of everyday life remain surprisingly intact 
on the sea floor, frozen in time. That includes a 300-year-old pocket watch
that stopped at 11:43, the moment Port Royal slipped
beneath the Carribean. And during the winter of 373 BCE, the Greek city of Helike was struck
by an earthquake so strong that it liquefied the sandy ground
upon which the city was built. Minutes later, a tsunami struck the city, and Helike and its inhabitants
sunk downwards into the Mediterranean Sea. Centuries later, Roman tourists would sail
on the lagoon that formed and peer down at the city's remains. Earthquakes are sudden, 
unpredictable disasters that have drowned cities in an instant. Luckily, however, throughout history, the majority of sunken cities were not
submerged by a single cataclysmic event, but by a combination 
of more gradual processes. For instance, Pavlopetri,
the oldest known sunken city, was built on the southern coastline
of Greece 5,000 years ago. It's an example of a city
that was submerged due to what is called 
isostatic sea level change. 18,000 years ago when the Ice Age ended, glaciers began melting and the sea level
rose globally until about 5,000 years ago. Isostatic sea level change isn't caused
by that melt water, but rather the Earth's crust slowly
springing back from the released weight of the glaciers, making some places rise,
and others sink. The ground around Pavlopetri
is still sinking at an average rate 
of a millimeter per year. But the ancient inhabitants were able
to move gradually inland over several generations before they finally abandoned the city
about 3,000 years ago. Today, divers swim over the streets
of Pavlopetri and peer through ancient door jams into the foundations of houses 
and community buildings. They learn about the people who lived
there by observing what they left behind. Natural geological events,
such as earthquakes and tsunamis, will continue to shape our continents, just as they have for millions of years. As increased global warming melts
our polar ice caps at accelerated rates and sea levels rise, we will be forced to adapt, like Pavlopetri's inhabitants. Undoubtedly, over the coming centuries, some of the coastal areas 
that we live in today will eventually be claimed 
by the water, too - cities like Venice, New Orleans, Amsterdam, Miami, and Tokyo. Imagine what future civilizations
will learn about us as they swim around the ancient ruins
of the cities that we live in today.

**Transcript**:
We have historical records that allow us
to know how the ancient Greeks dressed, how they lived, how they fought ... but how did they think? One natural idea is that the deepest
aspects of human thought -- our ability to imagine, to be conscious, to dream -- have always been the same. Another possibility is that the social transformations
that have shaped our culture may have also changed
the structural columns of human thought. We may all have different
opinions about this. Actually, it's a long-standing
philosophical debate. But is this question
even amenable to science? Here I'd like to propose that in the same way we can reconstruct
how the ancient Greek cities looked just based on a few bricks, that the writings of a culture
are the archaeological records, the fossils, of human thought. And in fact, doing some form of psychological analysis of some of the most ancient
books of human culture, Julian Jaynes came up in the '70s
with a very wild and radical hypothesis: that only 3,000 years ago, humans were what today
we would call schizophrenics. And he made this claim based on the fact that the first
humans described in these books behaved consistently, in different traditions
and in different places of the world, as if they were hearing and obeying voices that they perceived
as coming from the Gods, or from the muses ... what today we would call hallucinations. And only then, as time went on, they began to recognize
that they were the creators, the owners of these inner voices. And with this, they gained introspection: the ability to think
about their own thoughts. So Jaynes's theory is that consciousness, at least in the way we perceive it today, where we feel that we are the pilots
of our own existence -- is a quite recent cultural development. And this theory is quite spectacular, but it has an obvious problem which is that it's built on just a few
and very specific examples. So the question is whether the theory that introspection built up in human
history only about 3,000 years ago can be examined in a quantitative
and objective manner. And the problem of how
to go about this is quite obvious. It's not like Plato woke up one day
and then he wrote, "Hello, I'm Plato, and as of today, I have
a fully introspective consciousness." (Laughter) And this tells us actually
what is the essence of the problem. We need to find the emergence
of a concept that's never said. The word introspection
does not appear a single time in the books we want to analyze. So our way to solve this
is to build the space of words. This is a huge space
that contains all words in such a way that the distance
between any two of them is indicative of how
closely related they are. So for instance, you want the words "dog" and "cat"
to be very close together, but the words "grapefruit" and "logarithm"
to be very far away. And this has to be true
for any two words within the space. And there are different ways
that we can construct the space of words. One is just asking the experts, a bit like we do with dictionaries. Another possibility is following the simple assumption
that when two words are related, they tend to appear in the same sentences, in the same paragraphs, in the same documents, more often than would be expected
just by pure chance. And this simple hypothesis, this simple method, with some computational tricks that have to do with the fact that this is a very complex
and high-dimensional space, turns out to be quite effective. And just to give you a flavor
of how well this works, this is the result we get when
we analyze this for some familiar words. And you can see first that words automatically organize
into semantic neighborhoods. So you get the fruits, the body parts, the computer parts,
the scientific terms and so on. The algorithm also identifies
that we organize concepts in a hierarchy. So for instance, you can see that the scientific terms
break down into two subcategories of the astronomic and the physics terms. And then there are very fine things. For instance, the word astronomy, which seems a bit bizarre where it is, is actually exactly where it should be, between what it is, an actual science, and between what it describes, the astronomical terms. And we could go on and on with this. Actually, if you stare
at this for a while, and you just build random trajectories, you will see that it actually feels
a bit like doing poetry. And this is because, in a way, walking in this space
is like walking in the mind. And the last thing is that this algorithm also identifies
what are our intuitions, of which words should lead
in the neighborhood of introspection. So for instance, words such as "self," "guilt,"
"reason," "emotion," are very close to "introspection," but other words, such as "red," "football,"
"candle," "banana," are just very far away. And so once we've built the space, the question of the history
of introspection, or of the history of any concept which before could seem abstract
and somehow vague, becomes concrete -- becomes amenable to quantitative science. All that we have to do is take the books, we digitize them, and we take this stream
of words as a trajectory and project them into the space, and then we ask whether this trajectory
spends significant time circling closely to the concept
of introspection. And with this, we could analyze
the history of introspection in the ancient Greek tradition, for which we have the best
available written record. So what we did is we took all the books -- we just ordered them by time -- for each book we take the words and we project them to the space, and then we ask for each word
how close it is to introspection, and we just average that. And then we ask whether,
as time goes on and on, these books get closer,
and closer and closer to the concept of introspection. And this is exactly what happens
in the ancient Greek tradition. So you can see that for the oldest books
in the Homeric tradition, there is a small increase with books
getting closer to introspection. But about four centuries before Christ, this starts ramping up very rapidly
to an almost five-fold increase of books getting closer,
and closer and closer to the concept of introspection. And one of the nice things about this is that now we can ask whether this is also true
in a different, independent tradition. So we just ran this same analysis
on the Judeo-Christian tradition, and we got virtually the same pattern. Again, you see a small increase
for the oldest books in the Old Testament, and then it increases much more rapidly in the new books of the New Testament. And then we get the peak of introspection in "The Confessions of Saint Augustine," about four centuries after Christ. And this was very important, because Saint Augustine
had been recognized by scholars, philologists, historians, as one of the founders of introspection. Actually, some believe him to be
the father of modern psychology. So our algorithm, which has the virtue
of being quantitative, of being objective, and of course of being extremely fast -- it just runs in a fraction of a second -- can capture some of the most
important conclusions of this long tradition of investigation. And this is in a way
one of the beauties of science, which is that now this idea
can be translated and generalized to a whole lot
of different domains. So in the same way that we asked
about the past of human consciousness, maybe the most challenging question
we can pose to ourselves is whether this can tell us something
about the future of our own consciousness. To put it more precisely, whether the words we say today can tell us something
of where our minds will be in a few days, in a few months or a few years from now. And in the same way many of us
are now wearing sensors that detect our heart rate, our respiration, our genes, on the hopes that this may
help us prevent diseases, we can ask whether monitoring
and analyzing the words we speak, we tweet, we email, we write, can tell us ahead of time whether
something may go wrong with our minds. And with Guillermo Cecchi, who has been my brother in this adventure, we took on this task. And we did so by analyzing
the recorded speech of 34 young people who were at a high risk
of developing schizophrenia. And so what we did is,
we measured speech at day one, and then we asked whether the properties
of the speech could predict, within a window of almost three years, the future development of psychosis. But despite our hopes, we got failure after failure. There was just not enough
information in semantics to predict the future
organization of the mind. It was good enough to distinguish between a group
of schizophrenics and a control group, a bit like we had done
for the ancient texts, but not to predict the future
onset of psychosis. But then we realized that maybe the most important thing
was not so much what they were saying, but how they were saying it. More specifically, it was not in which semantic
neighborhoods the words were, but how far and fast they jumped from one semantic neighborhood
to the other one. And so we came up with this measure, which we termed semantic coherence, which essentially measures the persistence
of speech within one semantic topic, within one semantic category. And it turned out to be
that for this group of 34 people, the algorithm based on semantic
coherence could predict, with 100 percent accuracy, who developed psychosis and who will not. And this was something
that could not be achieved -- not even close -- with all the other
existing clinical measures. And I remember vividly,
while I was working on this, I was sitting at my computer and I saw a bunch of tweets by Polo -- Polo had been my first student
back in Buenos Aires, and at the time
he was living in New York. And there was something in this tweets -- I could not tell exactly what
because nothing was said explicitly -- but I got this strong hunch, this strong intuition,
that something was going wrong. So I picked up the phone,
and I called Polo, and in fact he was not feeling well. And this simple fact, that reading in between the lines, I could sense,
through words, his feelings, was a simple, but very
effective way to help. What I tell you today is that we're getting
close to understanding how we can convert this intuition
that we all have, that we all share, into an algorithm. And in doing so, we may be seeing in the future
a very different form of mental health, based on objective, quantitative
and automated analysis of the words we write, of the words we say. Gracias. (Applause)

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
We have historical records that allow us
to know how the ancient Greeks dressed, how they lived, how they fought ... but how did they think? One natural idea is that the deepest
aspects of human thought -- our ability to imagine, to be conscious, to dream -- have always been the same. Another possibility is that the social transformations
that have shaped our culture may have also changed
the structural columns of human thought. We may all have different
opinions about this. Actually, it's a long-standing
philosophical debate. But is this question
even amenable to science? Here I'd like to propose that in the same way we can reconstruct
how the ancient Greek cities looked just based on a few bricks, that the writings of a culture
are the archaeological records, the fossils, of human thought. And in fact, doing some form of psychological analysis of some of the most ancient
books of human culture, Julian Jaynes came up in the '70s
with a very wild and radical hypothesis: that only 3,000 years ago, humans were what today
we would call schizophrenics. And he made this claim based on the fact that the first
humans described in these books behaved consistently, in different traditions
and in different places of the world, as if they were hearing and obeying voices that they perceived
as coming from the Gods, or from the muses ... what today we would call hallucinations. And only then, as time went on, they began to recognize
that they were the creators, the owners of these inner voices. And with this, they gained introspection: the ability to think
about their own thoughts. So Jaynes's theory is that consciousness, at least in the way we perceive it today, where we feel that we are the pilots

**Transcript**:
On valentine's day 2013, a Thai couple broke
the world record for longest kiss, when they sucked face for over 58 hours. 58 hours! Wo-how?! You could drive across the entire United States
in less time! These lovebirds couldn't even sit down that
whole time, and had to pee while kissing. The logistics of which I don't want to think
about. Still, got me thinking, when the first two
humans brushed lips, could they ever have imagined it would end with chapped lips and
a cash prize, and where did kissing get it's start anyway? The earliest reference to kissing is out of
a Sanskrit text from India, dating back to 1500 BC. Now that doesn't mean that folks weren't snogging
before then, that's just the first record we have. Some believe that Alexander the Great's army
spread kissing from India to the Middle East. From there, it caught on in Ancient Greece
and Rome, perhaps more as a display of deference than romance. Slaves kissed the hands of their masters as
a sign of submission. Men of standing kissed each other on the cheek
in greeting, and even today it's important to note that there are lots of different types
of, and reasons for, kissing, from ritual to friendship to comfort to passion. To a Guinness book title, apparently. By the middle ages, people all over Europe
were swapping spit, and by the 19th century we actually gave the study of kissing the
decidedly un-sexy title of Philematology. Rrrr. So, why do we kiss? Well, there are two theories about it's origins,
one maintains that it's instinctual, the other believes that its a learned behavior. Folks in the instinctual camp point out that
Bonobos and some other animals seem to display kissing type behavior as an expression of
comfort, expression and bonding, but critics of this theory like to point out that ten
percent of human cultures don't even kiss, or at least haven't until fairly recently. Various tribes in Africa and some Australian
Aborigines and Tahitians are among groups that don't seem to kiss, they probably just
think that we're super weird. So some believe that kissing is a learned
behavior that evolved from regurgitation. Oh yeah. Hot stuff. No, I do not mean barfing. I mean mothers chewing solid food and feeding
it to their babies, mouth to mouth, like birds, wolves and lots of other animals do. This type of feeding not only helped pre-digest
food, but also established bonding and intimacy. And it isn't really a stretch to picture it
shifting to kisses as a sign of affection. From there, presumably, people just realized
that sucking face felt like all good and tingly, which is a compelling reason to do a lot of
things. Our lips and tongues are jam-packed with sensitive
nerve endings that light up our brains pleasure receptors like a Coney Island rollercoaster. If it's a really good, passionate kiss, our
cheeks flush as blood vessels expand, our pupils dilate, we get all dreamy eyed, and
our heart rates increase, pumping more oxygen into the brain. Suddenly, we're riding a wave of feel-good
hormones like dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and adrenaline. That is the chemical cocktail that makes you
feel like a family of bees just moved into your belly. Interesting, a males testosterone can pass
into a females mouth from kissing, making her more receptive to sex, baby-making, and
the passing along of genes, which is, of course, evolution's ultimate goal. And smooching doesn't just feel good to most
people, it's also good for you, in several different ways. It burns calories of course, reduces stress
and it might just help you select the right kind of mate. Gettin' all up in someone's grill gives you
great access to a nose full of pheromones, those subtle chemical signals that allow us
to sniff out optimal mates. And as we explained in a previous episode
about sex appeal, people tend to be attracted to mates with different immune system make-up
than their own, and swapping spit is a great way to get a snoot full of pheromones to see
if your potential mate is a good fit. All that history and biology aside, kissing
is probably one of those things that its best not to really over-think. Personally, I'd rather just remember that
nervous, sweaty magic of my first kiss than picture a mouthful of pre-chewed meat coming
at me. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

**Transcript**:
On valentine's day 2013, a Thai couple broke
the world record for longest kiss, when they sucked face for over 58 hours. 58 hours! Wo-how?! You could drive across the entire United States
in less time! These lovebirds couldn't even sit down that
whole time, and had to pee while kissing. The logistics of which I don't want to think
about. Still, got me thinking, when the first two
humans brushed lips, could they ever have imagined it would end with chapped lips and
a cash prize, and where did kissing get it's start anyway? The earliest reference to kissing is out of
a Sanskrit text from India, dating back to 1500 BC. Now that doesn't mean that folks weren't snogging
before then, that's just the first record we have. Some believe that Alexander the Great's army
spread kissing from India to the Middle East. From there, it caught on in Ancient Greece
and Rome, perhaps more as a display of deference than romance. Slaves kissed the hands of their masters as
a sign of submission. Men of standing kissed each other on the cheek
in greeting, and even today it's important to note that there are lots of different types
of, and reasons for, kissing, from ritual to friendship to comfort to passion. To a Guinness book title, apparently. By the middle ages, people all over Europe
were swapping spit, and by the 19th century we actually gave the study of kissing the
decidedly un-sexy title of Philematology. Rrrr. So, why do we kiss? Well, there are two theories about it's origins,
one maintains that it's instinctual, the other believes that its a learned behavior. Folks in the instinctual camp point out that
Bonobos and some other animals seem to display kissing type behavior as an expression of
comfort, expression and bonding, but critics of this theory like to point out that ten
percent of human cultures don't even kiss, or at least haven't until fairly recently. Various tribes in Africa and some Australian
Aborigines and Tahitians are among groups that don't seem to kiss, they probably just
think that we're super weird. So some believe that kissing is a learned
behavior that evolved from regurgitation. Oh yeah. Hot stuff. No, I do not mean barfing. I mean mothers chewing solid food and feeding
it to their babies, mouth to mouth, like birds, wolves and lots of other animals do. This type of feeding not only helped pre-digest
food, but also established bonding and intimacy. And it isn't really a stretch to picture it
shifting to kisses as a sign of affection. From there, presumably, people just realized
that sucking face felt like all good and tingly, which is a compelling reason to do a lot of
things. Our lips and tongues are jam-packed with sensitive
nerve endings that light up our brains pleasure receptors like a Coney Island rollercoaster. If it's a really good, passionate kiss, our
cheeks flush as blood vessels expand, our pupils dilate, we get all dreamy eyed, and
our heart rates increase, pumping more oxygen into the brain. Suddenly, we're riding a wave of feel-good
hormones like dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and adrenaline. That is the chemical cocktail that makes you
feel like a family of bees just moved into your belly. Interesting, a males testosterone can pass
into a females mouth from kissing, making her more receptive to sex, baby-making, and
the passing along of genes, which is, of course, evolution's ultimate goal. And smooching doesn't just feel good to most
people, it's also good for you, in several different ways. It burns calories of course, reduces stress
and it might just help you select the right kind of mate. Gettin' all up in someone's grill gives you
great access to a nose full of pheromones, those subtle chemical signals that allow us
to sniff out optimal mates. And as we explained in a previous episode
about sex appeal, people tend to be attracted to mates with different immune system make-up
than their own, and swapping spit is a great way to get a snoot full of pheromones to see
if your potential mate is a good fit. All that history and biology aside, kissing
is probably one of those things that its best not to really over-think. Personally, I'd rather just remember that
nervous, sweaty magic of my first kiss than picture a mouthful of pre-chewed meat coming
at me. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Sunscreen comes in many forms, each with its own impacts on your body
and the environment. With so many options, how do you choose which sunscreen
is best for you? To answer that question, we first have to understand
how sunscreens work. Sunlight is composed
of electromagnetic waves and is our primary source
of ultraviolet radiation, which has a shorter wavelength than
visible light and carries more energy. UVA, UVB, and UVC are classified according
to their wavelengths. Short wavelength UVC
never reaches the Earth's surface, but UVB and UVA do. Medium wavelength UVB rays
can enter the skin's superficial layers and long length UVA rays
can penetrate into the deeper layers. UVB in small amounts actually helps
us make vitamin D, which enables our bodies to build
and maintain strong bones. However, prolonged exposure to UVA
and UVB can damage DNA, age your skin, and promote the development
of potentially deadly skin cancer. Sunscreen protects your skin
either physically by deflecting UV rays with an inorganic blocker 
like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, or chemically by using carbon-based
compounds to absorb UV photons that are then harmlessly 
dissipated as heat. So, what differentiates one sunscreen
from another? When we choose a sunscreen, we can compare application method, the SPF, and the active ingredients. Sprays can be convenient to put on,
especially when you're wet, but a recent study found that most people
don't apply a thick enough layer to get full protection. And the possible health risks of inhaling 
sunscreen compounds from a spray cloud might make you consider reaching
for that bottle of lotion instead. Opt for a sunscreen with an SPF
of at least 15, although 30 is better. SPF is a nonlinear scale of how much
UVB radiation is needed to give protected skin a sunburn. SPF 15 does a pretty good job by blocking
93% of UVB rays. You get a slight increase as SPF goes up, with SPF 30 blocking 97%, and 50 blocking 98%. SPF is based on the quantity
of solar exposure. So how much time you have before
you start to burn really depends on a long list of factors, including your genetics, and when, where, and how
you spend your time in the sun. Even though US marketed sunscreens
have been deemed safe by the FDA, scientists are still researching
the effects of many active ingredients on the human body. So if you're worried 
about potential irritants, look for mineral-based formulas
with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. Even though they may go on 
a bit thick at first, they're less irritating than carbon-based
chemical sunscreens. These mineral-based sunscreens
are preferential for the environment, too. If you plan on catching rays
while splashing in a river or the ocean, keep in mind that carbon-based
chemical sunscreens can harm marine life. Take coral reefs, for example. Although they cover less than 1%
of the Earth's underwater surface, they're home to nearly 25% of all
fish species, making them the most diverse
and productive marine ecosystems. Research shows that carbon-based
chemical sunscreen ingredients, like oxybenzone, butylparaben, 
octinoxate, and 4MBC contribute to a stress condition called
coral bleaching in corals, which are living creatures. Exposure to these organic compounds results in the death 
of the coral's symbiotic algae. In addition to providing 
a reliable food source, these algae give coral their brilliant
rainbow of colors. Without them, corals turn a bleached white and are susceptible to disease
and possibly death. And once the coral dies, the entire reef ecosystem 
is not far behind. So you're now ready to make an informed
choice when picking out your next sunscreen. SPF is clearly labeled on the front. On the back under "active ingredients," you can find whether zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and those coral-harming components
are present. Taking a bit more time to check
can be well worth it for both you and the environment.

don't apply a thick enough layer to get full protection. And the possible health risks of inhaling 
sunscreen compounds from a spray cloud might make you consider reaching
for that bottle of lotion instead. Opt for a sunscreen with an SPF
of at least 15, although 30 is better. SPF is a nonlinear scale of how much
UVB radiation is needed to give protected skin a sunburn. SPF 15 does a pretty good job by blocking
93% of UVB rays. You get a slight increase as SPF goes up, with SPF 30 blocking 97%, and 50 blocking 98%. SPF is based on the quantity
of solar exposure. So how much time you have before
you start to burn really depends on a long list of factors, including your genetics, and when, where, and how
you spend your time in the sun. Even though US marketed sunscreens
have been deemed safe by the FDA, scientists are still researching
the effects of many active ingredients on the human body. So if you're worried 
about potential irritants, look for mineral-based formulas
with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. Even though they may go on 
a bit thick at first, they're less irritating than carbon-based
chemical sunscreens. These mineral-based sunscreens
are preferential for the environment, too. If you plan on catching rays
while splashing in a river or the ocean, keep in mind that carbon-based
chemical sunscreens can harm marine life. Take coral reefs, for example. Although they cover less than 1%
of the Earth's underwater surface, they're home to nearly 25% of all
fish species, making them the most diverse
and productive marine ecosystems. Research shows that carbon-based
chemical sunscreen ingredients, like oxybenzone, butylparaben, 
octinoxate, and 4MBC contribute to a stress condition called
coral bleaching in corals, which are living creatures. Exposure to these organic compounds results in the death 
of the coral's symbiotic algae. In addition to providing 
a reliable food source, these algae give coral their brilliant
rainbow of colors. Without them, corals turn a bleached white and are susceptible to disease
and possibly death. And once the coral dies, the entire reef ecosystem 
is not far behind. So you're now ready to make an informed
choice when picking out your next sunscreen. SPF is clearly labeled on the front. On the back under "active ingredients," you can find whether zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and those coral-harming components
are present. Taking a bit more time to check
can be well worth it for both you and the environment.

**Transcript**:
Sunscreen comes in many forms, each with its own impacts on your body
and the environment. With so many options, how do you choose which sunscreen
is best for you? To answer that question, we first have to understand
how sunscreens work. Sunlight is composed
of electromagnetic waves and is our primary source
of ultraviolet radiation, which has a shorter wavelength than
visible light and carries more energy. UVA, UVB, and UVC are classified according
to their wavelengths. Short wavelength UVC
never reaches the Earth's surface, but UVB and UVA do. Medium wavelength UVB rays
can enter the skin's superficial layers and long length UVA rays
can penetrate into the deeper layers. UVB in small amounts actually helps
us make vitamin D, which enables our bodies to build
and maintain strong bones. However, prolonged exposure to UVA
and UVB can damage DNA, age your skin, and promote the development
of potentially deadly skin cancer. Sunscreen protects your skin
either physically by deflecting UV rays with an inorganic blocker 
like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, or chemically by using carbon-based
compounds to absorb UV photons that are then harmlessly 
dissipated as heat. So, what differentiates one sunscreen
from another? When we choose a sunscreen, we can compare application method, the SPF, and the active ingredients. Sprays can be convenient to put on,
especially when you're wet, but a recent study found that most people
don't apply a thick enough layer to get full protection. And the possible health risks of inhaling

**Transcript**:
Charles Osborne began to hiccup
in 1922 after a hog fell on top of him. He wasn't cured until 68 years later and is now listed by Guinness as
the world record holder for hiccup longevity. Meanwhile, Florida teen Jennifer Mee may hold the record 
for the most frequent hiccups, 50 times per minute 
for more than four weeks in 2007. So what causes hiccups? Doctors point out that a round
of hiccups often follows from stimuli that stretch the stomach, like swallowing air or too rapid eating or drinking. Others associate hiccups 
with intense emotions or a response to them: laughing, sobbing, anxiety, and excitement. Let's look at what happens when we hiccup. It begins with an involuntary spasm
or sudden contraction of the diaphragm, the large dome-shaped muscle
below our lungs that we use to inhale air. This is followed almost immediately
by the sudden closure of the vocal chords and the opening between them, which is called the glottis. The movement of the diaphragm
initiates a sudden intake of air, but the closure of the vocal chords
stops it from entering the wind pipe and reaching the lungs. It also creates the characteristic sound:
"hic." To date, there is no known function
for hiccups. They don't seem to provide any medical
or physiological advantage. Why begin to inhale air only to suddenly
stop it from actually entering the lungs? Anatomical structures, or physiological mechanisms, 
with no apparent purpose present challenges 
to evolutionary biologists. Do such structures serve some hidden
function that hasn't yet been discovered? Or are they relics 
of our evolutionary past, having once served some important purpose only to persist into the present 
as vestigial remnants? One idea is that hiccups began many millions of years
before the appearance of humans. The lung is thought to have evolved
as a structure to allow early fish, many of which lived in warm, stagnant
water with little oxygen, to take advantage of the abundant oxygen
in the air overhead. When descendants of these animals
later moved onto land, they moved from gill-based ventilation
to air-breathing with lungs. That's similar to the much more rapid
changes faced by frogs today as they transition 
from tadpoles with gills to adults with lungs. This hypothesis suggests that the hiccup
is a relic of the ancient transition from water to land. An inhalation that could 
move water over gills followed by a rapid closure of the glottis
preventing water from entering the lungs. That's supported by evidence which suggests that the neural patterning
involved in generating a hiccup is almost identical to that responsible
for respiration in amphibians. Another group of scientists believe
that the reflex is retained in us today because it actually provides
an important advantage. They point out that true hiccups
are found only in mammals and that they're not retained in birds,
lizards, turtles, or any other exclusively 
air-breathing animals. Further, hiccups appear in human babies
long before birth and are far more common in infants
that adults. Their explanation for this involves the uniquely mammalian 
activity of nursing. The ancient hiccup reflex may have been
adapted by mammals to help remove air from the stomach
as a sort of glorified burp. The sudden expansion of the diaphragm
would raise air from the stomach, while a closure of the glottis would
prevent milk from entering the lungs. Sometimes, a bout of hiccups will go
on and on, and we try home remedies: sipping continuously 
from a glass of cold water, holding one's breath, a mouthful of honey or peanut butter, breathing into a paper bag, or being suddenly frightened. Unfortunately, scientists have yet
to verify that any one cure works better or more consistently
than others. However, we do know one thing
that definitely doesn't work.

**Transcript**:
Charles Osborne began to hiccup
in 1922 after a hog fell on top of him. He wasn't cured until 68 years later and is now listed by Guinness as
the world record holder for hiccup longevity. Meanwhile, Florida teen Jennifer Mee may hold the record 
for the most frequent hiccups, 50 times per minute 
for more than four weeks in 2007. So what causes hiccups? Doctors point out that a round
of hiccups often follows from stimuli that stretch the stomach, like swallowing air or too rapid eating or drinking. Others associate hiccups 
with intense emotions or a response to them: laughing, sobbing, anxiety, and excitement. Let's look at what happens when we hiccup. It begins with an involuntary spasm
or sudden contraction of the diaphragm, the large dome-shaped muscle
below our lungs that we use to inhale air. This is followed almost immediately
by the sudden closure of the vocal chords and the opening between them, which is called the glottis. The movement of the diaphragm
initiates a sudden intake of air, but the closure of the vocal chords
stops it from entering the wind pipe and reaching the lungs. It also creates the characteristic sound:
"hic." To date, there is no known function
for hiccups. They don't seem to provide any medical
or physiological advantage. Why begin to inhale air only to suddenly
stop it from actually entering the lungs? Anatomical structures, or physiological mechanisms, 
with no apparent purpose present challenges 
to evolutionary biologists. Do such structures serve some hidden
function that hasn't yet been discovered? Or are they relics 
of our evolutionary past, having once served some important purpose only to persist into the present 
as vestigial remnants? One idea is that hiccups began many millions of years
before the appearance of humans. The lung is thought to have evolved
as a structure to allow early fish, many of which lived in warm, stagnant
water with little oxygen, to take advantage of the abundant oxygen
in the air overhead. When descendants of these animals
later moved onto land, they moved from gill-based ventilation
to air-breathing with lungs. That's similar to the much more rapid
changes faced by frogs today as they transition 
from tadpoles with gills to adults with lungs. This hypothesis suggests that the hiccup
is a relic of the ancient transition from water to land. An inhalation that could 
move water over gills followed by a rapid closure of the glottis
preventing water from entering the lungs. That's supported by evidence which suggests that the neural patterning
involved in generating a hiccup is almost identical to that responsible
for respiration in amphibians. Another group of scientists believe
that the reflex is retained in us today because it actually provides
an important advantage. They point out that true hiccups
are found only in mammals and that they're not retained in birds,
lizards, turtles, or any other exclusively 
air-breathing animals. Further, hiccups appear in human babies
long before birth and are far more common in infants
that adults. Their explanation for this involves the uniquely mammalian 
activity of nursing. The ancient hiccup reflex may have been
adapted by mammals to help remove air from the stomach
as a sort of glorified burp. The sudden expansion of the diaphragm
would raise air from the stomach, while a closure of the glottis would
prevent milk from entering the lungs. Sometimes, a bout of hiccups will go
on and on, and we try home remedies: sipping continuously 
from a glass of cold water, holding one's breath, a mouthful of honey or peanut butter, breathing into a paper bag, or being suddenly frightened. Unfortunately, scientists have yet
to verify that any one cure works better or more consistently
than others. However, we do know one thing
that definitely doesn't work.

**Transcript**:
What does the French Revolution have to do with the time NASA accidentally
crashed a $200 million orbiter into the surface of Mars? Actually, everything. That crash happened due to an error in converting between 
two measurement systems, U.S. customary units and their S.I, or metric, equivalence. So what's the connection to
the French Revolution? Let's explain. For the majority of recorded 
human history, units like the weight of a grain
or the length of a hand weren't exact and varied from place to place. And different regions didn't just use
varying measurements. They had completely different 
number systems as well. By the late Middle Ages,
the Hindu-Arabic decimal system mostly replaced Roman numerals 
and fractions in Europe, but efforts by scholars like John Wilkins
to promote standard decimal-based measures were less successful. With a quarter million different units
in France alone, any widespread change would require
massive disruption. And in 1789, that disruption came. The leaders of the French Revolution
didn't just overthrow the monarchy. They sought to completely 
transform society according to the rational principles
of the Enlightenment. When the new government took power, the Academy of Sciences convened
to reform the system of measurements. Old standards based on arbitrary authority
or local traditions were replaced with mathematical
and natural relationships. For example, the meter,
from the Greek word for measure, was defined as 1/10,000,000
between the Equator and North Pole. And the new metric system was,
in the words of the Marquis de Condorcet, "For all people, for all time." Standardizing measurements
had political advantages for the Revolutionaries as well. Nobles could no longer manipulate local
units to extract more rent from commoners, while the government could collect
taxes more efficiently. And switching to a new Republican Calendar
with ten-day weeks reduced church power 
by eliminating Sundays. Adoption of this new system wasn't easy. In fact, it was a bit of a mess. At first, people used new units
alongside old ones, and the Republican Calendar 
was eventually abandoned. When Napoléon Bonaparte took power, he allowed small businesses 
to use traditional measurements redefined in metric terms. But the metric system remained standard
for formal use, and it spread across the continent,
along with France's borders. While Napoléon's empire 
lasted eight years, its legacy endured far longer. Some European countries reverted
to old measurements upon independence. Others realized the value 
of standardization in an age of international trade. After Portugal and the Netherlands
switched to metric voluntarily, other nations followed, with colonial empires spreading the system
around the world. As France's main rival, Britain had resisted revolutionary ideas
and retained its traditional units. But over the next two centuries,
the British Empire slowly transitioned, first approving the metric system
as an optional alternative before gradually making it offical. However, this switch came too late
for thirteen former colonies that had already gained independence. The United States of America stuck with
the English units of its colonial past and today remains one 
of only three countries which haven't fully embraced 
the metric system. Despite constant initiatives 
for metrication, many Americans consider units like feet
and pounds more intuitive. And ironically, some regard the once
revolutionary metric system as a symbol of global conformity. Nevertheless, the metric system is almost
universally used in science and medicine, and it continues to evolve according
to its original principles. For a long time, standard units were actually defined by 
carefully maintained physical prototypes. But thanks to improving technology
and precision, these objects with limited access
and unreliable longevity are now being replaced with standards
based on universal constants, like the speed of light. Consistent measurements are such
an integral part of our daily lives that it's hard to appreciate what a major
accomplishment for humanity they've been. And just as it arose 
from a political revolution, the metric system remains crucial
for the scientific revolutions to come.

**Transcript**:
What does the French Revolution have to do with the time NASA accidentally
crashed a $200 million orbiter into the surface of Mars? Actually, everything. That crash happened due to an error in converting between 
two measurement systems, U.S. customary units and their S.I, or metric, equivalence. So what's the connection to
the French Revolution? Let's explain. For the majority of recorded 
human history, units like the weight of a grain
or the length of a hand weren't exact and varied from place to place. And different regions didn't just use
varying measurements. They had completely different 
number systems as well. By the late Middle Ages,
the Hindu-Arabic decimal system mostly replaced Roman numerals 
and fractions in Europe, but efforts by scholars like John Wilkins
to promote standard decimal-based measures were less successful. With a quarter million different units
in France alone, any widespread change would require
massive disruption. And in 1789, that disruption came. The leaders of the French Revolution
didn't just overthrow the monarchy. They sought to completely 
transform society according to the rational principles
of the Enlightenment. When the new government took power, the Academy of Sciences convened
to reform the system of measurements. Old standards based on arbitrary authority
or local traditions were replaced with mathematical
and natural relationships. For example, the meter,
from the Greek word for measure, was defined as 1/10,000,000
between the Equator and North Pole. And the new metric system was,
in the words of the Marquis de Condorcet, "For all people, for all time." Standardizing measurements
had political advantages for the Revolutionaries as well. Nobles could no longer manipulate local
units to extract more rent from commoners, while the government could collect
taxes more efficiently. And switching to a new Republican Calendar
with ten-day weeks reduced church power 
by eliminating Sundays. Adoption of this new system wasn't easy. In fact, it was a bit of a mess. At first, people used new units
alongside old ones, and the Republican Calendar 
was eventually abandoned. When Napoléon Bonaparte took power, he allowed small businesses 
to use traditional measurements redefined in metric terms. But the metric system remained standard
for formal use, and it spread across the continent,
along with France's borders. While Napoléon's empire 
lasted eight years, its legacy endured far longer. Some European countries reverted
to old measurements upon independence. Others realized the value 
of standardization in an age of international trade. After Portugal and the Netherlands
switched to metric voluntarily, other nations followed, with colonial empires spreading the system
around the world. As France's main rival, Britain had resisted revolutionary ideas
and retained its traditional units. But over the next two centuries,
the British Empire slowly transitioned, first approving the metric system
as an optional alternative before gradually making it offical. However, this switch came too late
for thirteen former colonies that had already gained independence. The United States of America stuck with
the English units of its colonial past and today remains one 
of only three countries which haven't fully embraced 
the metric system. Despite constant initiatives 
for metrication, many Americans consider units like feet
and pounds more intuitive. And ironically, some regard the once
revolutionary metric system as a symbol of global conformity. Nevertheless, the metric system is almost
universally used in science and medicine, and it continues to evolve according
to its original principles. For a long time, standard units were actually defined by 
carefully maintained physical prototypes. But thanks to improving technology
and precision, these objects with limited access
and unreliable longevity are now being replaced with standards
based on universal constants, like the speed of light. Consistent measurements are such
an integral part of our daily lives that it's hard to appreciate what a major
accomplishment for humanity they've been. And just as it arose 
from a political revolution, the metric system remains crucial
for the scientific revolutions to come.
