**Transcript**:
French fries are delicious. French fries with ketchup are a little slice of heaven. The problem is it's basically impossible to pour the exactly right amount. We're so used to pouring ketchup that we don't realize how weird its behavior is. Imagine a ketchup bottle filled with a straight up solid like steel. No amount of shaking would ever get the steel out. Now imagine that same bottle full of a liquid like water. That would pour like a dream. Ketchup, though, can't seem to make up its mind. Is it is a solid? Or a liquid? The answer is, it depends. The world's most common fluids like water, oils and alcohols respond to force linearly. If you push on them twice as hard, they move twice as fast. Sir Isaac Newton, of apple fame, first proposed this relationship, and so those fluids are called Newtonian fluids. Ketchup, though, is part of a merry band of linear rule breakers called Non-Newtonian fluids. Mayonnaise, toothpaste, blood, paint, peanut butter and lots of other fluids respond to force non-linearly. That is, their apparent thickness changes depending on how hard you push, or how long, or how fast. And ketchup is actually Non-Newtonian in two different ways. Way number one: the harder you push, the thinner ketchup seems to get. Below a certain pushing force, ketchup basically behaves like a solid. But once you pass that breaking point, it switches gears and becomes a thousand times thinner than it was before. Sound familiar right? Way number two: if you push with a force below the threshold force eventually, the ketchup will start to flow. In this case, time, not force, is the key to releasing ketchup from its glassy prison. Alright, so, why does ketchup act all weird? Well, it's made from tomatoes, pulverized, smashed, thrashed, utterly destroyed tomatoes. See these tiny particles? This is what remains of tomatoes cells after they go through the ketchup treatment. And the liquid around those particles? That's mostly water and some vinegar, sugar, and spices. When ketchup is just sitting around, the tomato particles are evenly and randomly distributed. Now, let's say you apply a weak force very quickly. The particles bump into each other, but can't get out of each other's way, so the ketchup doesn't flow. Now, let's say you apply a strong force very quickly. That extra force is enough to squish the tomato particles, so maybe instead of little spheres, they get smushed into little ellipses, and boom! Now you have enough space for one group of particles to get passed others and the ketchup flows. Now let's say you apply a very weak force but for a very long time. Turns out, we're not exactly sure what happens in this scenario. One possibility is that the tomato particles near the walls of the container slowly get bumped towards the middle, leaving the soup they were dissolved in, which remember is basically water, near the edges. That water serves as a lubricant betwen the glass bottle and the center plug of ketchup, and so the ketchup flows. Another possibility is that the particles slowly rearrange themselves into lots of small groups, which then flow past each other. Scientists who study fluid flows are still actively researching how ketchup and its merry friends work. Ketchup basically gets thinner the harder you push, but other substances, like oobleck or some natural peanut butters, actually get thicker the harder you push. Others can climb up rotating rods, or continue to pour themselves out of a beeker, once you get them started. From a physics perspective, though, ketchup is one of the more complicated mixtures out there. And as if that weren't enough, the balance of ingredients and the presence of natural thickeners like xanthan gum, which is also found in many fruit drinks and milkshakes, can mean that two different ketchups can behave completely differently. But most will show two telltale properties: sudden thinning at a threshold force, and more gradual thinning after a small force is applied for a long time. And that means you could get ketchup out of the bottle in two ways: either give it a series of long, slow languid shakes making sure you don't ever stop applying force, or you could hit the bottle once very, very hard. What the real pros do is keep the lid on, give the bottle a few short, sharp shakes to wake up all those tomato particles, and then take the lid off and do a nice controlled pour onto their heavenly fries.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not directly ask about the relationship between force and the movement of fluids in Newtonian fluids, it does mention the scientist who first proposed this relationship, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ. However, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an answer that was most similar in intent, I would say that Question 10 is the closest match. Question 10 asks about the relationship between force and the apparent thickness of ketchup, which is a Non-Newtonian fluid. However, the ground truth MCQ asks about Newtonian fluids. So, while Question 10 is similar in intent, it is not a perfect match.

Therefore, I would say that there is no perfect match among the generated MCQs, but Question 2 is the closest match in terms of relevance, and Question 10 is the closest match in terms of intent.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not directly ask about pure water being Newtonian, it does mention the scientist (Sir Isaac Newton) who first proposed the relationship between force and the movement of fluids, which is relevant to the concept of Newtonian fluids. However, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an answer based on the closest relationship to Newtonian fluids, I would choose Question 2, but keep in mind that this is not a perfect match.

A better option would be to create a new generated MCQ that directly asks about pure water being Newtonian, such as:

Question: Is pure water an example of a Newtonian fluid?
Options: A. Yes, B. No, C. Scientists aren't sure yet

This new generated MCQ would be a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the content of the transcript, I can infer that Question 10 is the closest match.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the difference between ketchup and oobleck, specifically how they respond to force. Question 10 asks about the relationship between force and the apparent thickness of ketchup, which is related to the concept of non-Newtonian fluids and how ketchup behaves when force is applied.

Although Question 10 does not directly compare ketchup to oobleck, it does address the underlying concept of how ketchup responds to force, which is the key idea in the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

However, the options provided for Question 4 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that explicitly addresses the uncertainty surrounding the flow of ketchup under a weak force applied for a long time.

Since none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that comes closest in terms of content and intent.

A more suitable match is Question 6, but the correct answer for this question is not "Scientists aren't sure." 

However, Question 6 does address the behavior of ketchup under a weak force.

Upon closer inspection, I realize that I made an error in my previous responses. None of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I must provide an answer.

In this case, I will choose Question 6, but I want to emphasize that it is not a perfect match.

We're so used to pouring ketchup that we don't realize how weird its behavior is. Imagine a ketchup bottle filled with a straight up solid like steel. No amount of shaking would ever get the steel out. Now imagine that same bottle full of a liquid like water. That would pour like a dream. Ketchup, though, can't seem to make up its mind. Is it is a solid? Or a liquid? The answer is, it depends. The world's most common fluids like water, oils and alcohols respond to force linearly. If you push on them twice as hard, they move twice as fast. Sir Isaac Newton, of apple fame, first proposed this relationship, and so those fluids are called Newtonian fluids. Ketchup, though, is part of a merry band of linear rule breakers called Non-Newtonian fluids. Mayonnaise, toothpaste, blood, paint, peanut butter and lots of other fluids respond to force non-linearly. That is, their apparent thickness changes depending on how hard you push, or how long, or how fast. And ketchup is actually Non-Newtonian in two different ways. Way number one: the harder you push, the thinner ketchup seems to get. Below a certain pushing force, ketchup basically behaves like a solid. But once you pass that breaking point, it switches gears and becomes a thousand times thinner than it was before. Sound familiar right? Way number two: if you push with a force below the threshold force eventually, the ketchup will start to flow. In this case, time, not force, is the key to releasing ketchup from its glassy prison. Alright, so, why does ketchup act all weird? Well, it's made from tomatoes, pulverized, smashed, thrashed, utterly destroyed tomatoes. See these tiny particles? This is what remains of tomatoes cells after they go through the ketchup treatment. And the liquid around those particles? That's mostly water and some vinegar, sugar, and spices. When ketchup is just sitting around, the tomato particles are evenly and randomly distributed. Now, let's say you apply a weak force very quickly. The particles bump into each other, but can't get out of each other's way, so the ketchup doesn't flow. Now, let's say you apply a strong force very quickly. That extra force is enough to squish the tomato particles, so maybe instead of little spheres, they get smushed into little ellipses, and boom! Now you have enough space for one group of particles to get passed others and the ketchup flows. Now let's say you apply a very weak force but for a very long time. Turns out, we're not exactly sure what happens in this scenario. One possibility is that the tomato particles near the walls of the container slowly get bumped towards the middle, leaving the soup they were dissolved in, which remember is basically water, near the edges. That water serves as a lubricant betwen the glass bottle and the center plug of ketchup, and so the ketchup flows. Another possibility is that the particles slowly rearrange themselves into lots of small groups, which then flow past each other. Scientists who study fluid flows are still actively researching how ketchup and its merry friends work. Ketchup basically gets thinner the harder you push, but other substances, like oobleck or some natural peanut butters, actually get thicker the harder you push. Others can climb up rotating rods, or continue to pour themselves out of a beeker, once you get them started. From a physics perspective, though, ketchup is one of the more complicated mixtures out there. And as if that weren't enough, the balance of ingredients and the presence of natural thickeners like xanthan gum, which is also found in many fruit drinks and milkshakes, can mean that two different ketchups can behave completely differently. But most will show two telltale properties: sudden thinning at a threshold force, and more gradual thinning after a small force is applied for a long time. And that means you could get ketchup out of the bottle in two ways: either give it a series of long, slow languid shakes making sure you don't ever stop applying force, or you could hit the bottle once very, very hard. What the real pros do is keep the lid on, give the bottle a few short, sharp shakes to wake up all those tomato particles, and then take the lid off and do a nice controlled pour onto their heavenly fries.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar in terms of content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the name of Widder's single-person submersible. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 3 asks about the name of the optical lure used by the speaker, and Question 4 asks about the name of the camera system used to view the electronic jellyfish.

However, Question 3 mentions "Electronic jellyfish" as an option, which is not a submersible, but rather an optical lure. 

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the name of a submersible or a deep-sea exploration vehicle. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this description.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
so I want to take you on a trip to an alien world and it's not a trip that requires light-years of travel but it's to a place where it's defined by light so it's a little appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make life I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution but mostly I'm entranced by it since my first dive in a deep diving submersible when I went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays I've been a bioluminescence junky but I would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words and they were totally inadequate to the task I needed some way to share the experience directly and the first time I figured out that way was in this little single person submersible called deep Rover this next video clip you're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence and the first thing you're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across in front of the Sun a mesh screen will come into contact with the soft bodied creatures of the deep sea with the subs light switched off it is possible to see their bioluminescence the light produced when they collide with the mesh this is the first time that has ever been recorded so I recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible but just to try to prove that fact to you I brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration so if we get up the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible I have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it and you'll note there's no light coming from them right now either because they're dead or because I need to stir them up in some way for you to be able to see what bioluminescence really looks like Oh I spend most of my time working in the dark I'm used to that okay so that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate a single-celled alga so why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light well uses it to defend itself from its predators the flash is like a scream for help it's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and just like the alarm on your car or your house it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away it's a lot of animals that use this trick for example this black dragon fish it's got a light organ under its eye it's got a chin barbel it's got a lot of other light organs you can't see but you'll see them here in a minute so we'd have to chase this and the submersible for quite some time because the top speed of this fish is one not which was a top speed of the submersible but it was worth it because we caught in a symmetric capture device brought it up into the lab on the ship and then everything on this fish lights up it's unbelievable the light organs under the eyes are flashing that chin barbel is flashing it's got light organs on its belly that are flashing fin lights it's a scream for help it's meant to attract attention it's phenomenal and you normally don't get to see this because we've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets there's other ways you can defend yourself with light for example this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud this blinds or distracts the predator this little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this now it may look like a tasty morsel or a pig's head with wings but if it's attacked it puts out a barrage of light in fact a barrage of photon torpedoes I just barely got the lights out in time for you be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transept screen and then just glowing it's phenomenal so there's a lot of animals in the open ocean most of them that make light and we have a pretty good idea for most of them why they use it for finding food for attracting mates for defending against predators but when you get down at the bottom of the ocean that's where things get really strange and some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in Avatar but you don't have to travel to pandora to see them there are things like this this is a golden coral a bush it grows very slowly in fact it's thought that some of these are as much as 3,000 years old which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed the other reason is this amazing bush glows so if you brush up against it anyplace you brushed against it you get this twinkling Bluegreen light it's just breathtaking and you see things like this this looks like something out of a dr. Seuss book just all manner of creatures all over this thing and these are flight wrapping enemies now if you poke it it pulls in its tentacles but if you keep poking it it starts to produce light and it actually ends up looking like a galaxy it produces these strings of light presumably as some form of defense there are starfish that can make light and there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms this looks like a plant but it's actually an animal and it angers itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock so it can actually hold itself in very strong currents as you see here but if we collect it very gently and bring it up into the lab just squeeze it at the base of the stock it produces this light that propagates from the stem to the plume change in color as it goes from green to blue colorization and sound effects added for your viewing pleasure but we have no idea why it does that here's another one this is also a see pen it's got a brittle star hitching a ride it's a green saber of light and like the one you just saw it can produce these as bands of light so if I squeeze the bass the band's go from base to tip if I squeeze the tip they go from tip to base so what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle I'd be very interested in your theories about what that's about so there's a language of light in the deep ocean and we're just beginning to understand it and one way we're going about that is we're imitating a lot of these displays this is an optical lure that I've used we call it the electronic jellyfish it's just sixteen blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays and we view it with a camera system I developed called I in the sea that uses far red light that's invisible to most animals so it's unobtrusive so I just want to show you some of the responses that we've elicited from animals in the deep sea so the camera is black and white it's not high resolution and what you're seeing here is a bait box with a bunch of like the cockroaches of the ocean they're isopods all over it and right in the front is the electronic jellyfish and when it starts flashing it's just going to be one of the LEDs that's flashing very fast but as soon as it starts to flash and it's going to look big because it blooms on the camera I want you to look right here and it's something small there that responds we're talking to something it looks like a little string of pearls basically in fact three strings of pearls this was very consistent this is in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet we basically have a chat room going on here because once it gets started everybody's talking and I think this is actually a shrimp that's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water but the cool thing is we're talking to it we don't know what we're saying personally I think it's something sexy and then finally I want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world's first deep-sea webcam which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year we've only just begun to analyze all of this data this is going to be a glowing source first which is like bioluminescent bacteria and it is an optical cue that there's carrion on the bottom of the ocean so this scavenger comes in which is a giant sixgill shark and I can't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in because there's bait right there but if it had been following the odor plume it would have come in from the other direction and it does actually try to seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish that's a 12-foot long giant sixgill shark okay so this next one is from the webcam and it's going to be this pinwheel display and this is a burglar alarm and that was a Humboldt squid a juvenile Humboldt squid about three feet long this is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon but if it's a burglar alarm you wouldn't expect it to attack the jellyfish directly it's supposed to be attacking what's attacking the jellyfish but we did see a bunch of responses like this this guy's a little more contemplative hey wait a minute there's supposed to be something else there he's thinking about it but he's persistent he keeps coming back and then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more and thinks maybe if I come in from a different angle nope so we are starting to get a handle on this but only just the beginnings we need more eyes on the process so if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible by all means climb in and take the plunge this is something that should be on everybody's bucket list because we live on an ocean planet more than 90% 99% of the living space on our planet is ocean it's a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures alien life-forms that you don't have to travel to another planet to see but if you do take the plunge please remember to turn out the lights but I warn you it's addictive thank you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the age of the golden coral (a bush). Among the generated MCQs, none of them directly ask about the age of a specific coral or organism.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of marine life or organisms, I would suggest Question 2: What is the purpose of the bioluminescent "burglar alarm" in marine animals?

But since this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, options, or intent, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ.

If you would like, I can try to generate a new set of MCQs that might be more relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Carbon is a fantastically important element. There are probably, far more molecules that contain carbon, than any other element. The reason why you can get so many carbon compounds, is that carbon atoms, form chains very, very easily. Sometimes
millions of atoms long. If you just have atoms that will form one or two bonds
then you can't build up huge numbers of molecules. If there's no limit to the number of
bonds you can make, You can make things that are really long. It's like the difference between a
lorry; a truck which can pull if you're lucky, one trailer or perhaps two and a
train where you can put as many wagons or carriages as you want. So you can get
really long train, so it's just the same with carbon. So carbon it's around us everywhere.
We're all carbon,  there are lots of carbon in us, in all the hydrocarbons within
our body. Lots of that structures
inside us and many many of the materials that we use every day. In fact the majority of us use carbon in
the form of fuels every day to get to work or to go home. Without carbon we
couldn't exist. You're carbon, I'm carbon, We have bones
made that of calcium. But the important parts of our brains contain largely
carbon. They contain nitrogen and oxygen and hydrogen as well, but carbon is the key. Carbon is one of the very few elements;
that has given rise to a whole area of chemistry. Organic chemistry; the
chemistry of carbon compounds, is almost a separate discipline from some of the
areas of chemistry and most of the molecules that we use for plastics, for
pharmaceutical products, for our food are all carbon compounds. Carbon is an
extremely common element but it comes in a number of different allotropes, so
different forms and this one here; this is actually some charcoal, which is just
simple carbon. It's very, very similar and very very in fresh into it to graphite.
You can find lumps of carbon lying around. This is a piece here, that I found on a
beach, on the northeast of England; it's a piece of coal. Its not absolutely
pure carbon, but it has a very high proportion of carbon and compared to
other stones, of this sort of size, it's really quite light more recently
people have discovered diamonds, and of course graphite which is the black
material that you get in pencils. People call them lead pencils but they actually
contain the form of carbon called graphite so carbon comes graphite, as diamond, and also as as buckyballs or fullerenes so the carbon here which is a bit like the
graphite; it is very amorphous and it's very very free-flowing so I'm going
to pour a little bit of carbon out onto the paper so you can see
so you can see its a very light powder and you can see that it's a very very
nice, easily maneuverable and a really easy workable material. The thing that's really exciting is that
in the last 20 years people have discovered new forms of carbon; now this is extraordinary! People have
known of carbon for thousands of years, even longer,  and suddenly in the last 20
years the number of different types of carbon has grown enormously. I have a colleague who is a specialist
in these new forms of carbon and I went and asked him for a model and he gave me
a whole suitcase of models. Let me show you. ... So, what did we get? First of all, this is a model of graphite. The materials in the middle of pencils and it consists of layers of rings, hexagonal rings of carbon atoms. That six carbon atoms; and they're joined
together in layers. Can you see here? There are purple bonds in
between them. You can see they're not very strong; one is
even broken here. Very recently in the last 10 years its been discovered that
using a piece of sellotape, you can pull off these layers; and make single sheets
of these carbon atoms. It's called graphene. The 2-2010
Nobel Prize for physics, was given to two scientists for discovering graphene,
There's this structure here; where each carbon atom is joined to 4 others, in this
sort of tetrahedral pattern. Tetrahedron is this group one in the
middle with four rounded, and this–is diamond; it's really very strong. Whichever way you squash it, it's strong. You can't peel off layers of diamond with a piece of sellotape. Diamonds are colorless; and to understand why, you have to understand; what gives rise to
color, and the color of anything my tie, anything are caused by electrons
in the molecules or material and they absorb energy and go from one level to
another. In diamond, there are bonds between all the carbon
atoms that use all the electrons. The electrons are very tightly bound and
none of them can change their energy state, so you get no absorption. At least in the
visible region of the spectrum. On the other hand with graphite, the
electrons are less strongly bound. In fact it conducts electricity and it's
black because the electrons will absorb all wavelengths of visible light right
from the blue to the red so that it looks black because none of the light is
reflected from it. Inside here we have the famous molecule, C60 like a football (soccer ball US)
60 carbon atoms and Ray has put a little one inside here but forget that for a
moment. So you can have this molecule C60 first
discovered in the late 1980's. and only isolated in the early 1990's and there is a very similar molecule which looks a bit more squashed
which is C70. Now these are also colored, but their color is rather different. Have
a look here. I've got two samples one of C60 and one
of C70 both of them dissolved up in the solvent toluene. So if you look here C70 is a sort of
reddish brown color and C60 in the solvent has a beautiful color. I call it purple, other people call it
magenta. Back to the box (suitcase) ... and in here, we have the final form of
carbon which are called nanotubes these are whole tubes; made up of
hexagons. You have two sorts one which is closed at the end and this one here
which is open rather like a basket. you can put things inside it the final
model is graphene this material that you can peel off graphite with a seller tape
sticky tape and the reason that people get so excited is first of all this is a
very thin material it's only one atom thick and you can
react the carbon atoms on here with all sorts
of different molecules you can make very strong materials you
can start making electronics carbon computers things like that many people believe that graphene is one
of the materials of the future this is one of and raised exhibits he uses it in exhibitions to measure
electrical conductivity to see if you take a piece of metal like this coin and
you put the two electrodes on there you can see it conducts electricity all the
lights light up and the needle goes across so he's got different samples this one here is coal and this is graphite so there's a track of this is a photo
and this is a track of coal between two metal electrodes and you can see if we
put the electrodes on here the coal doesn't conduct electricity at all however if we take the graphite and do
the same it conducts electricity not very well
but you can see you do get some electricity going through on this other
sheet he's got a sample of C60 and here of
the carbon nanotubes and you can see the C60 doesn't conduct electricity either
the electrons can't jump between one molecule and the other but when you come
to the carbon nanotubes which are long molecules they conduct electricity
really well not quite as well as a metal but pretty close

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly stated in the options provided. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I can infer that the closest match would be a question that discusses the electrical conductivity of different carbon materials.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 10 is the closest match, as it discusses the electrical conductivity of carbon nanotubes. However, it does not explicitly compare the conductivity of different carbon materials.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 10 is the closest match, but it would require modification to match the ground truth MCQ more closely.

Index: 10 (with modification)

A more suitable generated MCQ would be:

Question: Which of the following carbon materials conducts electricity in the order from least to most conductive?
Options: A. C60 < Graphite < Nanotube, B. Nanotube < Graphite < C60, C. Graphite < Nanotube < C60

This question is not present in the generated MCQs, but it would be a closer match to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Carbon is a fantastically important element. There are probably, far more molecules that contain carbon, than any other element. The reason why you can get so many carbon compounds, is that carbon atoms, form chains very, very easily. Sometimes
millions of atoms long. If you just have atoms that will form one or two bonds
then you can't build up huge numbers of molecules. If there's no limit to the number of
bonds you can make, You can make things that are really long. It's like the difference between a
lorry; a truck which can pull if you're lucky, one trailer or perhaps two and a
train where you can put as many wagons or carriages as you want. So you can get
really long train, so it's just the same with carbon. So carbon it's around us everywhere.
We're all carbon,  there are lots of carbon in us, in all the hydrocarbons within
our body. Lots of that structures
inside us and many many of the materials that we use every day. In fact the majority of us use carbon in
the form of fuels every day to get to work or to go home. Without carbon we
couldn't exist. You're carbon, I'm carbon, We have bones
made that of calcium. But the important parts of our brains contain largely
carbon. They contain nitrogen and oxygen and hydrogen as well, but carbon is the key. Carbon is one of the very few elements;
that has given rise to a whole area of chemistry. Organic chemistry; the
chemistry of carbon compounds, is almost a separate discipline from some of the
areas of chemistry and most of the molecules that we use for plastics, for
pharmaceutical products, for our food are all carbon compounds. Carbon is an
extremely common element but it comes in a number of different allotropes, so
different forms and this one here; this is actually some charcoal, which is just
simple carbon. It's very, very similar and very very in fresh into it to graphite.
You can find lumps of carbon lying around. This is a piece here, that I found on a
beach, on the northeast of England; it's a piece of coal. Its not absolutely
pure carbon, but it has a very high proportion of carbon and compared to
other stones, of this sort of size, it's really quite light more recently
people have discovered diamonds, and of course graphite which is the black
material that you get in pencils. People call them lead pencils but they actually
contain the form of carbon called graphite so carbon comes graphite, as diamond, and also as as buckyballs or fullerenes so the carbon here which is a bit like the
graphite; it is very amorphous and it's very very free-flowing so I'm going
to pour a little bit of carbon out onto the paper so you can see
so you can see its a very light powder and you can see that it's a very very
nice, easily maneuverable and a really easy workable material. The thing that's really exciting is that
in the last 20 years people have discovered new forms of carbon; now this is extraordinary! People have
known of carbon for thousands of years, even longer,  and suddenly in the last 20
years the number of different types of carbon has grown enormously. I have a colleague who is a specialist
in these new forms of carbon and I went and asked him for a model and he gave me
a whole suitcase of models. Let me show you. ... So, what did we get? First of all, this is a model of graphite. The materials in the middle of pencils and it consists of layers of rings, hexagonal rings of carbon atoms. That six carbon atoms; and they're joined
together in layers. Can you see here? There are purple bonds in
between them. You can see they're not very strong; one is
even broken here. Very recently in the last 10 years its been discovered that
using a piece of sellotape, you can pull off these layers; and make single sheets
of these carbon atoms. It's called graphene. The 2-2010
Nobel Prize for physics, was given to two scientists for discovering graphene,
There's this structure here; where each carbon atom is joined to 4 others, in this
sort of tetrahedral pattern. Tetrahedron is this group one in the
middle with four rounded, and this–is diamond; it's really very strong. Whichever way you squash it, it's strong. You can't peel off layers of diamond with a piece of sellotape. Diamonds are colorless; and to understand why, you have to understand; what gives rise to
color, and the color of anything my tie, anything are caused by electrons
in the molecules or material and they absorb energy and go from one level to
another. In diamond, there are bonds between all the carbon
atoms that use all the electrons. The electrons are very tightly bound and
none of them can change their energy state, so you get no absorption. At least in the
visible region of the spectrum. On the other hand with graphite, the
electrons are less strongly bound. In fact it conducts electricity and it's
black because the electrons will absorb all wavelengths of visible light right
from the blue to the red so that it looks black because none of the light is
reflected from it. Inside here we have the famous molecule, C60 like a football (soccer ball US)
60 carbon atoms and Ray has put a little one inside here but forget that for a
moment. So you can have this molecule C60 first
discovered in the late 1980's. and only isolated in the early 1990's and there is a very similar molecule which looks a bit more squashed
which is C70. Now these are also colored, but their color is rather different. Have
a look here. I've got two samples one of C60 and one
of C70 both of them dissolved up in the solvent toluene. So if you look here C70 is a sort of
reddish brown color and C60 in the solvent has a beautiful color. I call it purple, other people call it
magenta. Back to the box (suitcase) ... and in here, we have the final form of
carbon which are called nanotubes these are whole tubes; made up of
hexagons. You have two sorts one which is closed at the end and this one here
which is open rather like a basket. you can put things inside it the final
model is graphene this material that you can peel off graphite with a seller tape
sticky tape and the reason that people get so excited is first of all this is a
very thin material it's only one atom thick and you can
react the carbon atoms on here with all sorts
of different molecules you can make very strong materials you
can start making electronics carbon computers things like that many people believe that graphene is one
of the materials of the future this is one of and raised exhibits he uses it in exhibitions to measure
electrical conductivity to see if you take a piece of metal like this coin and
you put the two electrodes on there you can see it conducts electricity all the
lights light up and the needle goes across so he's got different samples this one here is coal and this is graphite so there's a track of this is a photo
and this is a track of coal between two metal electrodes and you can see if we
put the electrodes on here the coal doesn't conduct electricity at all however if we take the graphite and do
the same it conducts electricity not very well
but you can see you do get some electricity going through on this other
sheet he's got a sample of C60 and here of
the carbon nanotubes and you can see the C60 doesn't conduct electricity either
the electrons can't jump between one molecule and the other but when you come
to the carbon nanotubes which are long molecules they conduct electricity
really well not quite as well as a metal but pretty close

And you can see that the phosphorus has oxidized
in the air and it’s taken some of the paper with it to generate a nice ‘P’ for phosphorus. So this is a sample of my favourite element,
this is phosphorus. Phosphorus is a very, very reactive element, especially this type
of phosphorus which is white phosphorus. Phosphorus itself, elemental phosphorus, exists as a
number of different allotropes, so a bit like carbon with diamond and graphite, and here
we have one of these allotropes; it’s white phosphorus. It exists as discrete molecules
of four phosphorus atoms connected like a pyramid, and those four phosphorus atoms are
really strained, really reactive and they want to really react with oxygen as quick
as they can. This is the sort that is used in phosphorus
bombs. It burns very easily and gives a very intense white light out of it. So instantaneously you can see that fantastic
oxidation reaction as the phosphorus reacts with the molecular oxygen in the gas inside
the flask. You can put it out quite easily by putting
water on it, provided that it hasn’t got too hot and the water will just evaporate. Very reactive form the other allotropes, black
and red phosphorus, are not as reactive and are much, much easier for us to handle. Then there’s red phosphorus which is very
much less reactive which is what is used in matches. It is used to make the heads of so-called
‘non-safety’ matches, which are the ones you can strike on any sort of material, on
bricks and so on, and they tend to be this rather red colour here. So the phosphorus, you’ll notice, that it’s
stored under water, and it’s stored under water to keep the oxygen and the atmosphere
away because it reacts very vigorously and can burn, hence the signs, it’s very, very
flammable. It’s so flammable in fact that it burns just with the heat of the skin. So
you can see a number of scars across my hands, these are all from playing with phosphorus
and doing reactions and experiments with phosphorus. Phosphorus is a very important point inside
your body. Some of you may have read Aldous Huxley’s book called ‘Brave New World’,
which when people died they were sent to the phosphorus reclamation plant. And each average
size person contains somewhat over a pound of phosphorus inside their bodies, and nowadays
people can use magnetic resonance imaging to look and see how the phosphorus is used
inside the body. So I’ve taken a small sample of my white
phosphorus and I’ve dissolved it in an organic solvent which is carbon disulphide, because
the P4 is molecular and it dissolves really quite nicely in this molecular solvent. So
now what we are going to do is we’re going to go outside and we’re going to put this
on a piece of filter paper and then let the carbon disulphide evaporate so we can see
the reaction of the phosphorus with the oxygen and the paper. And the average person produces inside their
body about 70 kilos a day of a molecule called ATP, adenosine triphosphate, which is the
energy producing molecule inside the body. Now you don’t keep 70 kilos inside you,
or you would explode, but you’re using it up all the time but in the course of the day
you synthesise nearly 70 kilos of this molecule. So as the carbon disulphide evaporates from
the paper, well there’s a couple of drips. And you can see that the phosphorus has oxidized
in the air and it’s taken some of the paper with it to generate a nice ‘P’ for phosphorus.

So here I’ve got a really nice sample of
silicon, alright? Ok. I’m going to take it out of the bottle…
of the… I’m going to have to wash my hands after this. So silicon is a very common element, it’s
particularly found in sand which is the oxide of silica; that’s
the compound of oxygen and silicon. It is also found in a variety of minerals
which contain silicon, oxygen and another metal which are known as
silicates. And silicates occur in an enormous number of different
minerals. It’s sort of the part of science that unless
you are a specialist you find quite boring but if you really go
into it like everything else it becomes really quite interesting. So this is a piece of polycrystalline silicon.
It’s a really quite fantastic element and it’s very often used,
or in fact it’s used very regularly to make electronic components.
All of the computers that we use and actually the camera
that you are recording me on now are based upon silicon
technology. Silicon is also extremely important and the
basis of most of the electronic devices we use: my watch, your
video camera, and also in computers. And if we look over
here, I have got here this is an example of a silicon wafer;
you can see at the back this is silicon. So the silicon is grown as a single crystal
from which we can make very highly-refined architectures on
silicon chips, but you see here we have a polycrystalline sample
so it is very pretty the way that it interacts with the
light and you can see the different grain sizes. So let me take it out. Did Martyn show you the single crystal, the
wafer? Yeah, he’s got a single chip, yeah, yeah. Cause if you can get the light coming off
it, you can get all sorts of different coloured affects. Here you can see, this is pure silicon on
the back and on the front, people have grown chips these are the
Pentium 4 chips for the computer, I think, I am not absolutely
sure but I think these are the chips and these are the connectors
on either side. So there are a whole lot of these chips
and they grow a large number of them at once. These are chopped
up and tested and the ones that worked are put into
computers and the ones that are no good are just chucked
and so this is a fantastically delicate piece of engineering
making these. This is so-called 20cm wafer. They now make silicon
chips on a 30cm wafer which is about this size and you
can get a large number more on them. If you get a single crystal of this silicon
structure, it can diffract the light and change the light so
that it diffracts and bends off at different angles so that you
get like a rainbow effect off it. It’s really quite beautiful. A compound of silicon, silicon nitride is
extremely tough and very light so it’s very difficult to break
and silicon nitride for example is used in the impellers in turbo
chargers in cars. So when you put your foot down on the accelerator
it will spin up very fast because it is very light but
it is very strong so it won’t very suddenly fall to bits as it is
revving up inside your engine. Right I must put that there because I want
to put that back in a bag.

**Transcript**:
So here I’ve got a really nice sample of
silicon, alright? Ok. I’m going to take it out of the bottle…
of the… I’m going to have to wash my hands after this. So silicon is a very common element, it’s
particularly found in sand which is the oxide of silica; that’s
the compound of oxygen and silicon. It is also found in a variety of minerals
which contain silicon, oxygen and another metal which are known as
silicates. And silicates occur in an enormous number of different
minerals. It’s sort of the part of science that unless
you are a specialist you find quite boring but if you really go
into it like everything else it becomes really quite interesting. So this is a piece of polycrystalline silicon.
It’s a really quite fantastic element and it’s very often used,
or in fact it’s used very regularly to make electronic components.
All of the computers that we use and actually the camera
that you are recording me on now are based upon silicon
technology. Silicon is also extremely important and the
basis of most of the electronic devices we use: my watch, your
video camera, and also in computers. And if we look over
here, I have got here this is an example of a silicon wafer;
you can see at the back this is silicon. So the silicon is grown as a single crystal
from which we can make very highly-refined architectures on
silicon chips, but you see here we have a polycrystalline sample
so it is very pretty the way that it interacts with the
light and you can see the different grain sizes. So let me take it out. Did Martyn show you the single crystal, the
wafer? Yeah, he’s got a single chip, yeah, yeah. Cause if you can get the light coming off
it, you can get all sorts of different coloured affects. Here you can see, this is pure silicon on
the back and on the front, people have grown chips these are the
Pentium 4 chips for the computer, I think, I am not absolutely
sure but I think these are the chips and these are the connectors
on either side. So there are a whole lot of these chips
and they grow a large number of them at once. These are chopped
up and tested and the ones that worked are put into
computers and the ones that are no good are just chucked
and so this is a fantastically delicate piece of engineering
making these. This is so-called 20cm wafer. They now make silicon
chips on a 30cm wafer which is about this size and you
can get a large number more on them. If you get a single crystal of this silicon
structure, it can diffract the light and change the light so
that it diffracts and bends off at different angles so that you
get like a rainbow effect off it. It’s really quite beautiful. A compound of silicon, silicon nitride is
extremely tough and very light so it’s very difficult to break
and silicon nitride for example is used in the impellers in turbo
chargers in cars. So when you put your foot down on the accelerator
it will spin up very fast because it is very light but
it is very strong so it won’t very suddenly fall to bits as it is
revving up inside your engine. Right I must put that there because I want
to put that back in a bag.

So we're gonna go find some liquid Nitrogen. We keep it in a really large dewar tank at the back of the shop, so we're gonna go find that now.  So this is a dewar that we used to keep the liquid Nitrogen in within the building so it's much more convenient for us and our students to get it. So what we're gonna do now is we're gonna fill up our small dewar to carry the Nitrogen back to the lab. So you can probably hear it hissing and fizzing going into the bottle, and you can see all the Nitrogen evaporating off. Nitrogen exists as a gas. Molecules of N2. And it is interesting, because the bond between the two Nitrogen atoms is the strongest bond that you can get between any two atoms in the Periodic Table. Any two atoms that are the same. Sometimes, if you have two atoms that are different, the bond can be slightly stronger, but the NN triple bond is one of the strongest that you can have. So what we're doing is we're filling up the dewar with liquid Nitrogen so that we can take that back to our lab to do our next experiment. So many explosive compounds, things that you've heard of, like TNT and other explosives, all contain Nitrogen, which are isolated atoms, and when the explosion goes off the atoms come together and release energy. Nitrogen is used widely in laboratories, partly because it's not as reactive as Oxygen, so if you do an experiment in an atmosphere of Nitrogen you can avoid reactions that might occur with air. You can also use Nitrogen when it's liquified as a coolant. Liquid Nitrogen boils at -196 degrees Centigrade, 77 degrees absolute, and you can just hold it in a normal thermous flask. So this is a dewar of liquid Nitrogen, and you can see that the Nitrogen is evaporating from the top, coming out and frosting, coming down over the sides because it's a little bit more dense than the air. You can see it's heavily laden with ice, and you can see that the ice crystals are starting to grow on the top of the dewar here. It's very cold though, so we mustn't touch it for too long. So if we just tip some out on the floor, we can see that the Nitrogen itself will come out like a liquid, like pouring water,  but the interesting thing is, water, when I pour it on the floor it forms a puddle. It does nothing useful. In fact, it sort of gets in the way. But liquid Nitrogen, when I pour it on the floor, it forms these really quite nice bubbles, and they fly across  to the side of the room and take all the dust with them. Pretty cool. But if you put materials like rubber or flowers into liquid Nitrogen, instead of being soft and bendy they become really rigid, and you can smash them with a hammer. So you can see all of the bubbles forming on this steel tray now, and they're sweeping away all the dust quite nicely as they evaporate and move further afield. So Neil's got a piece of tubing, and it's really quite flexible tubing, you can see it's really floppy, and now he's gonna put it into the cryogenic liquid Nitrogen and freeze it, and see what happens to the rubber. But you see another interesting thing there is that the liquid Nitrogen is siphoning out through the tube, and that's a really good joke, because you can direct that siphon at someones trousers and freeze their legs. So I think that's enough, Neil, let's see if it's a bit harder. Wow, that shattered.  And there's quite a nice little operation that I've heard about, in which you can take the lens out of somebody's eye when they're suitably anaesthetized, and this lens can be frozen and then put on the lathe and you can change its shape so you get the right shape, and then you let it unfreeze, it goes soft again, and you pop it back into their eye. . . . . . . . . . . . .

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the risk of asphyxiation due to nitrogen gas displacing oxygen in the air. Question 3 is about why Nitrogen is used widely in laboratories, and one of the options (B) mentions that it is not as reactive as Oxygen, which is related to the idea that nitrogen gas can displace oxygen in the air.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

But if you put materials like rubber or flowers into liquid Nitrogen, instead of being soft and bendy they become really rigid, and you can smash them with a hammer. So you can see all of the bubbles forming on this steel tray now, and they're sweeping away all the dust quite nicely as they evaporate and move further afield. So Neil's got a piece of tubing, and it's really quite flexible tubing, you can see it's really floppy, and now he's gonna put it into the cryogenic liquid Nitrogen and freeze it, and see what happens to the rubber. But you see another interesting thing there is that the liquid Nitrogen is siphoning out through the tube, and that's a really good joke, because you can direct that siphon at someones trousers and freeze their legs. So I think that's enough, Neil, let's see if it's a bit harder. Wow, that shattered.  And there's quite a nice little operation that I've heard about, in which you can take the lens out of somebody's eye when they're suitably anaesthetized, and this lens can be frozen and then put on the lathe and you can change its shape so you get the right shape, and then you let it unfreeze, it goes soft again, and you pop it back into their eye. . . . . . . . . . . . .

So the blue one in the middle of this series
is argon, so again this is a very nice glass tube that we’ve had made
with a low pressure of argon inside. We’ve put a potential across from
the two ends, here and here, and this excites all the argon molecules inside
so you can see this wonderful characteristic eerie blue glow coming
off from the argon. Argon is one of the noble gases or so-called
rare gases. It’s not really quite so rare. It consists in really quite
a high percentage, nearly one percent of the atmosphere. If I look at the one in the middle I can see
lots and lots of lines in the blue and the green region and these are all
specific to the individual atoms that are in the tubes themselves. But it’s very un-reactive so early chemists
found it quite difficult to identify, in fact it was only Sir William
Ramsey that identified the argon in 1894 and he was in fact the first person in
Britain to win a Nobel Prize for chemistry. So if we turn off the power to this, we turn
off the potential and then we don’t excite the molecules so what we’d
see is just a clear glass tube with no visible sign of anything inside. And
only when we turn on the potential that we excite the molecules, so
they emit and give us these really quite wonderful colours.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that shares some similarity with the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the reason for using argon to fill incandescent light bulbs, and the correct option is related to preventing the combustion of the tungsten filament.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 2: "Which of the following is a characteristic of argon?" has an option C: "Un-reactive", which is related to the reason why argon is used in light bulbs. Although the question and options do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, it shares some similarity in terms of the characteristic of argon being un-reactive.

However, a closer match can be found in the transcript, where it is mentioned that argon is "very un-reactive". This property of argon is relevant to the ground truth MCQ. But in terms of the generated MCQs, none directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar, but it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
So Potassium metal is very reactive.  One of my colleagues who used to work with it, described it as evil.  So we've come out behind the chemistry department. In the open air. To try and do  a re-take of the Potassium video.  The last sample of Potassium was very very small, maybe 500mg.  It will react, it is so reactive that if you have it  in a box with Argon, so that it can't get Oxygen from anywhere, it will take the Oxygen out of paper. Which is, paper is a compound of Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen. And it can extract this.  It's a reactive element. It's used in our body all the time. We have like, lots of Potassium floating around. And we've got some samples here, about a gram, maybe a gram and a half of each. It's a pretty big chunk of Potassium this.  Ready? Yeah. Very satisfying reaction.  After completing the 100 meters dash... Like Sodium it'ss quite a low melting point metal. And if you mix Sodium and Potassium together, to make so called Sodium Potassium amalgam, it's called NaK, by those who work in the trade, Na for Sodium, K for Potassium. NaK is a liquid at room temperature. It looks a bit like Mercury. A silver liquid. It's very light. And I never played with it, but people say that if you try and drop it on the floor, it will burst into flames before it hits the floor, because it reacts with the water in the air. Today I'm going to show you how to make a Potassium mirror. We will just fish out a nice little bit of Potassium. It's stored under mineral oil, because it reacts with water over time.  So it's quite malleable stuff. It's a little bit like if you imagine cutting Blu Tac. It's quite soft.  And it starts you see, it's starting to go a little bit already. Tarnishing a wee bit. So we can just manipulate it like that, and we are gonna pop it into our ampule, and we are gonna evacuate it now. I'm gonna remove all  of the atmosphere, from this ampule.  OK, we've done that because the, the boiling point of Potassium under one atmosphere is over 700 degrees C. Which is pretty high. It's too high for the glass to tolerate. If I heated it up to that temperature the glass would start to soften, melt. So by evacuating it, we remove all of the atmosphere which is keeping the boiling point as high as it is. So it lowers the boiling point  much lower. So it starts to drop into the range of water.   OK so we are just going to the blue flame, which is the nice hot flame.  And we just keep on gently warming it. And at some point, it will melt. Just enough that you will start to see bubbles  of Potassium just jumping out of this thin oxide layer, which is coating it at the minute. Now it's starting to form. So the reason we do it like this is that we end up with a  large surface of Potassium, so it's excellent for  keeping our solvents dry.  So what we've got now, is we've got the ampule, and all the way up here, this is literally a mirror of very thin Potassium.  Potassium is very important. Our bodies contain quite  a lot of Potassium. And it's in all sorts of biological material. If you burn  garden rubbish, in the ash that you get in the end is Potassium, which is presumably why it's called Potash. So as Neil quite literally wets the wall, to get rid of all the un-reacted Potassium. Wicked.  One of my colleagues  who used to work with it, described it as evil.  Captions by www.SubPLY.com

After completing the 100 meters dash... Like Sodium it'ss quite a low melting point metal. And if you mix Sodium and Potassium together, to make so called Sodium Potassium amalgam, it's called NaK, by those who work in the trade, Na for Sodium, K for Potassium. NaK is a liquid at room temperature. It looks a bit like Mercury. A silver liquid. It's very light. And I never played with it, but people say that if you try and drop it on the floor, it will burst into flames before it hits the floor, because it reacts with the water in the air. Today I'm going to show you how to make a Potassium mirror. We will just fish out a nice little bit of Potassium. It's stored under mineral oil, because it reacts with water over time.  So it's quite malleable stuff. It's a little bit like if you imagine cutting Blu Tac. It's quite soft.  And it starts you see, it's starting to go a little bit already. Tarnishing a wee bit. So we can just manipulate it like that, and we are gonna pop it into our ampule, and we are gonna evacuate it now. I'm gonna remove all  of the atmosphere, from this ampule.  OK, we've done that because the, the boiling point of Potassium under one atmosphere is over 700 degrees C. Which is pretty high. It's too high for the glass to tolerate. If I heated it up to that temperature the glass would start to soften, melt. So by evacuating it, we remove all of the atmosphere which is keeping the boiling point as high as it is. So it lowers the boiling point  much lower. So it starts to drop into the range of water.   OK so we are just going to the blue flame, which is the nice hot flame.  And we just keep on gently warming it. And at some point, it will melt. Just enough that you will start to see bubbles  of Potassium just jumping out of this thin oxide layer, which is coating it at the minute. Now it's starting to form. So the reason we do it like this is that we end up with a  large surface of Potassium, so it's excellent for  keeping our solvents dry.  So what we've got now, is we've got the ampule, and all the way up here, this is literally a mirror of very thin Potassium.  Potassium is very important. Our bodies contain quite  a lot of Potassium. And it's in all sorts of biological material. If you burn  garden rubbish, in the ash that you get in the end is Potassium, which is presumably why it's called Potash. So as Neil quite literally wets the wall, to get rid of all the un-reacted Potassium. Wicked.  One of my colleagues  who used to work with it, described it as evil.  Captions by www.SubPLY.com

**Transcript**:
Ok, so we take the top off. We add a match. The Barking Dog experiment was one of the
most famous experiments and favourite experiments that was done by
my former colleague, Colonel B.D. Shaw. So Neil and I are preparing for one of my
favourite reactions. Itís called the Barking Dog reaction. This is a reaction
which actually makes an element and weíre going to make some sulphur
today. So the reactionís quite cool. In the Barking Dog experiment you have a mixture
of the molecule carbon disulphide, CS2. Itís just like carbon
dioxide butÖwait a minute IímÖ So this is a test tube, a rather large test
tube, of laughing gas, N2O, and weíre going to use this to make some sulphur. So I have a model here. So itís CS2 which
has a carbon in the middle and sulphurs at either end. So it looks just like,
in a model, as a molecule of CO2, but it has sulphur there and there. And
this molecule, CS2, will react with laughing gas, N2O. So where are we going to do this now? In the dark somewhere. So essentially you are just using the laughing
gas as a sort of oxygen to burn this molecule. What we are actually going to do is generate
a lot of light. It used to be used as a flash, for cameras and for photography. What happens is you get a very bright emission
of a sort of bluish purple light, which in the old days was used for
taking photographs before people had flash-lamps on their cameras. They
would set this off and it would give a great flash of light which could
be used to take photographs. But because itís much slower
than a flash it makes people really have quite a surprised look and this
may well be why, in old photographs, people look so surprised because
"My god, this thing has gone off, Whoosh!" So weíre on the hunt for a very dark place. In the tube, as the reaction takes place it
generates heat. Ok, so into the small lecture theatre which
is vacant now. Itís quite nice because we can turn all the lights off and
make it a bit darker and see this reaction in its, sort of, best. So weíve managed to create a darker environment
so we can really see the benefits from this chemistry, and Neilís
put some water in the bottom of the tube. And weíre going to put about
6-8 millilitres of carbon disulphide into this tube, and a good mix
so you can be sure that we get all of that carbon disulphide going into the
later phase so that itíll react really quite quickly with all of that oxygen,
the N2O. As the flame goes down the tube it accelerates
because the reactionís going faster and faster so it gives this great
sort of ëwhoopí noise. Now then, that was a really, really energetic
reaction because the organic and the oxygen were all in the same
phase and the reaction got a lot faster. The noise it made got a lot
louder as it went down because of pressure. So what you can see in the tube
here is actually the result or the aim of our chemical reaction today
because we wanted to make some sulphur. So what weíve got here, coated
on the inside of this tube, is a thin layer of polymeric sulphur. So you
can see all this really quite nice sulphur coating the inside of the glass
flask itself. Now Iím really fortunate because Iím just going to go back
to my office and prepare a lecture and leave Neil to clean this. Thanks. What are you doing mate? Well Iíve just filled up my vessel with some
oxygen. So this is liquid oxygen which we made for an earlier demonstration,
and weíve just used it to drive off all of the non-combustible
nitrogen form inside this glass vessel. Well look at all that oxygen
floating around inside the bottom of that flask, thatís really cool.
All oscillating - a really nice experiment. Yeah this is a really quite crazy jar. Itís
a small amount of sulphur, or ësuphurí, that weíve decanted out and unfortunately
when we decanted it out we spelt the name wrong soÖ Whoís responsible for that? Err, itís aÖvery old friend of mine and
I couldnít possiblyÖgive you his identity as he would be really, really angry.
Wouldnít he, Neil? Yeah Iím saying nothing. And it wasnít Neil. It wasnít me. So here weíve got a small amount of sulphur
that we are going to put on the tip of this spoon. So you can see itís
starting to melt. Now with the top, so itís on fire and then weíll just
drop it into the flask. And you can see that that sulphurís burning really intensely
now, with a really quite beautiful flame. Itís generating a lot of
SO2, really smelly, which is why we are doing it inside this fume cupboard
and you can see this really rich intense blue flame as that sulphur is burning
in that excess oxygen in that atmosphere. Ok so this is actually a sort of geological
sample of sulphur. So you can see itís actually on the bottom, weíve actually
got a rock and the sulphur crystals have actually formed on top of it.
So actually, sulphur does occur naturally. I think itís been known
since ancient times so, you know, when sermons are being delivered, fire
and brimstone, was because hell is supposed to smell like sulphur,
which is brimstone. But actually sulphur itself doesnít actually
smell, but what you are smelling, the ësulphuryí smell, is actually oxidised
material and hydrogen sulphide. Well itís actually a mixture of sulphur and
sand that was picked up by one of my colleagues on his honeymoon, though
you see he was actually thinking about chemistry even on his honeymoon,
though I donít think he told his wife that. I have a feeling but I could wrong that I
bought this sample in Oxfordshire where I used to live and I think
itís actually from Brazil, though I could be wrong. So as we are using up all the sulphur now
the flame will die down until eventually it will go out. Cool, there you
go.

**Transcript**:
Magnesium is one of the lightest elements.
It’s right at the beginning of the period table and, in fact, it’s the first of the
light metals that you can actually use. Lithium and sodium react violently with water so you
can’t really use them as a metal and beryllium is fantastically poisonous so unless you are
using it in the lab where you can be sure that nobody is going to touch it, it’s useless,
so magnesium is the lightest metal you can use. So, for example, if you are trying to
make mobile phones that are really light, then you can make the frame of the mobile
phone out of magnesium. You can use it for laptops. There is a professor in Germany,
who has promised to send me a laptop frame made of magnesium, but it hasn’t arrived
yet. So another classroom classic. Normally comes
along in chemistry lesson number three I guess, time to combust a reactive metal in the air,
so the reactive metal we are going to look at is magnesium. The other thing that is good about magnesium
is that there is a lot of magnesium about in the world, so it is not an element that
is difficult to get. If you look at this periodic table here, which is from Barcelona so it
is in Catalan, the areas of these, each element are approximately the abundance in the world.
Some of the rarer elements have a slightly bigger squares than they should do so you
can read the letters, but you see magnesium here is pretty large, so magnesium and sodium
are pretty common, beryllium is much less common, and lithium is even less common than
that, so there is lots of magnesium. Magnesium is very light, it is very reactive,
very pliable metal, it is very nice, it is easily alloyed with things like aluminium
and other light metals to make very strong, very robust materials. Used in construction,
it’s used in high-performance components of cars. When I was a child when we got, had indigestion,
we were given ‘Milk of Magnesia’. Magnesium oxide in water which came in these really
nice blue bottles, sort of white looking liquid, didn’t taste very nice, but it was meant
to be good for you, I am not sure if it was. It is used in the hulls of ships, you know
like, warships, things like that, so incredibly strong, incredibly light but incredibly reactive
if you give it enough energy. So we are going to combust it in the oxygen and see what happens. Magnesium as you know, burns, and one of the
ways that magnesium used to be used was for photographic flashlights, and you use bulbs
like these which contain magnesium, inside a bulb filled with oxygen. And for each photograph
you had to put this on the top of the camera. So I’ve got one here that I have taken out. So, if you look at it, so much heat has been
produced by this tiny amount of magnesium, that it has melted the glass. So, let’s see what happens when we light
it. You can see, really fierce bright white light that classical glow, everyone has seen
this in the chemistry lab at school, fantastic reaction. It is one of the few metals which is meant
to burn in nitrogen. In theory you can take a piece of magnesium, set fire to it in air
so its burning well and then plunge it into nitrogen gas, and it should continue burning.
I have tried this experiment lots of times and it’s never worked. In fact for 25 years
I demonstrated this experiment to my lecture class when I was talking about nitrogen, and
every time, it didn’t work, and the students thought, the poor professor, he has been made
a fool of, it hasn’t worked and they didn’t know that it never worked and I would have
been more surprised if it had done, but it taught them a bit about the chemistry of nitrogen
and magnesium. Why did you keep doing it if it never worked? Because it is a really good experiment, because
it got such a good reaction from the audience. Because it went wrong? Yes! You were playing the fool on purpose? Yes! So this is magnesium metal, but the magnesium
metal here is not the ribbon which we normally see in perhaps, scientific labs or perhaps
in school labs, this is a very, very fine powder of magnesium, so what we are going
to do in a moment is bring on a really very powerful torch, a gas flame and we are going
to see what happens when we sprinkle a little of this material into the flame. Magnesium is also very important in all our
lives, because magnesium is found in the green pigments in the leaves of all plants, in chlorophyll.
Chlorophyll is an organic molecule, carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen and in the middle there
is an atom of magnesium, and it is chlorophyll which catches the sunlight and transfers it
eventually to cause the reaction of carbon dioxide and water to make all the sugars and
other things in the plant. If that didn’t happen none of us would be alive, because
we all rely either directly or indirectly on plants, to give us the energy to live. I don’t understand completely the mechanism
of photosynthesis, because the energy that is absorbed by one molecule, is transferred
to another and another one as it were along a chain, but the magnesium is very important,
if you don’t have magnesium there it is not nearly as efficient. Let’s light it again.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 1 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 1 does not match the ground truth MCQ's intent exactly, I will provide a more detailed analysis:

The ground truth MCQ asks about a property of magnesium shown on the Catalan periodic table, which is its abundance. None of the generated MCQs directly ask about this property. However, Question 1 asks about a key characteristic of magnesium, which could be related to its properties.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say it is Question 1, but with a note that it is not a perfect match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 1

Please note that the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ's intent, options, or content. A more accurate generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the property of magnesium shown on the Catalan periodic table, which is its abundance.

**Transcript**:
Magnesium is one of the lightest elements.
It’s right at the beginning of the period table and, in fact, it’s the first of the
light metals that you can actually use. Lithium and sodium react violently with water so you
can’t really use them as a metal and beryllium is fantastically poisonous so unless you are
using it in the lab where you can be sure that nobody is going to touch it, it’s useless,
so magnesium is the lightest metal you can use. So, for example, if you are trying to
make mobile phones that are really light, then you can make the frame of the mobile
phone out of magnesium. You can use it for laptops. There is a professor in Germany,
who has promised to send me a laptop frame made of magnesium, but it hasn’t arrived
yet. So another classroom classic. Normally comes
along in chemistry lesson number three I guess, time to combust a reactive metal in the air,
so the reactive metal we are going to look at is magnesium. The other thing that is good about magnesium
is that there is a lot of magnesium about in the world, so it is not an element that
is difficult to get. If you look at this periodic table here, which is from Barcelona so it
is in Catalan, the areas of these, each element are approximately the abundance in the world.
Some of the rarer elements have a slightly bigger squares than they should do so you
can read the letters, but you see magnesium here is pretty large, so magnesium and sodium
are pretty common, beryllium is much less common, and lithium is even less common than
that, so there is lots of magnesium. Magnesium is very light, it is very reactive,
very pliable metal, it is very nice, it is easily alloyed with things like aluminium
and other light metals to make very strong, very robust materials. Used in construction,
it’s used in high-performance components of cars. When I was a child when we got, had indigestion,
we were given ‘Milk of Magnesia’. Magnesium oxide in water which came in these really
nice blue bottles, sort of white looking liquid, didn’t taste very nice, but it was meant
to be good for you, I am not sure if it was. It is used in the hulls of ships, you know
like, warships, things like that, so incredibly strong, incredibly light but incredibly reactive
if you give it enough energy. So we are going to combust it in the oxygen and see what happens. Magnesium as you know, burns, and one of the
ways that magnesium used to be used was for photographic flashlights, and you use bulbs
like these which contain magnesium, inside a bulb filled with oxygen. And for each photograph
you had to put this on the top of the camera. So I’ve got one here that I have taken out. So, if you look at it, so much heat has been
produced by this tiny amount of magnesium, that it has melted the glass. So, let’s see what happens when we light
it. You can see, really fierce bright white light that classical glow, everyone has seen
this in the chemistry lab at school, fantastic reaction. It is one of the few metals which is meant
to burn in nitrogen. In theory you can take a piece of magnesium, set fire to it in air
so its burning well and then plunge it into nitrogen gas, and it should continue burning.
I have tried this experiment lots of times and it’s never worked. In fact for 25 years
I demonstrated this experiment to my lecture class when I was talking about nitrogen, and
every time, it didn’t work, and the students thought, the poor professor, he has been made
a fool of, it hasn’t worked and they didn’t know that it never worked and I would have
been more surprised if it had done, but it taught them a bit about the chemistry of nitrogen
and magnesium. Why did you keep doing it if it never worked? Because it is a really good experiment, because
it got such a good reaction from the audience. Because it went wrong? Yes! You were playing the fool on purpose? Yes! So this is magnesium metal, but the magnesium
metal here is not the ribbon which we normally see in perhaps, scientific labs or perhaps
in school labs, this is a very, very fine powder of magnesium, so what we are going
to do in a moment is bring on a really very powerful torch, a gas flame and we are going
to see what happens when we sprinkle a little of this material into the flame. Magnesium is also very important in all our
lives, because magnesium is found in the green pigments in the leaves of all plants, in chlorophyll.
Chlorophyll is an organic molecule, carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen and in the middle there
is an atom of magnesium, and it is chlorophyll which catches the sunlight and transfers it
eventually to cause the reaction of carbon dioxide and water to make all the sugars and
other things in the plant. If that didn’t happen none of us would be alive, because
we all rely either directly or indirectly on plants, to give us the energy to live. I don’t understand completely the mechanism
of photosynthesis, because the energy that is absorbed by one molecule, is transferred
to another and another one as it were along a chain, but the magnesium is very important,
if you don’t have magnesium there it is not nearly as efficient. Let’s light it again.

So Neil’s got a sample of sodium. Sodium
is a very reactive metal, it is stored under an oil to stop air or moisture getting on
it - stop it oxidising, stop it reacting - and as you can see it is a very soft metal, so
he is going to put his knife in and withdraw the lump of sodium, so there is about 2 kilos
of sodium here, it's a really quite large rod. So we are going to cut a small sample
of the sodium and we are going to see if we can explore some of its chemistry. Sodium is again a light metal, rather like
lithium and it has a, a melting point about 96 degrees. So the sodium is a very, very shiny metal
and as you can see as Neil cuts some off, you can see the quite nice shiny material.
It’s really quite beautiful. Reacts very, very quickly with air and also with water,
you form the oxide layer which is the white, or the hydroxide is the white crust on the
outside. And many of you will know that if you drop
sodium into water it reacts almost explosively. So we are going to go outside now, go get
some even bigger reactions, with the alkali metals. This is a dog bowl which is stoneware,
it is very hard, not likely to break, unless I drop it on my toes. This is sodium, the metal that we cut a minute
ago and you can see there is quite a substantial amount of the sodium, and we are going to
pop it into the water and see what we can do with the reaction. Ok? So here we have
a bowl full of water and maybe, oh, a gram of sodium? So let’s see what happens, see
what this reaction’s like. So it is reacting really, really quite quickly and really violently
with the water, and you can see it is fizzing around and it is generating lots and lots
of hydrogen gas. And see now the heat from the reaction is burning away all of that hydrogen
which is generating and you can see the orange sodium flame. That was um? That was good That is a bit of, a chunk of molten sodium
has come out of there mate. So, let’s burn that. Oh, it’s on your camera. Oh it is too! Sodium chloride is transparent through infrared
light and so here we have got a sheet of sodium chloride that has been stuck on to a glass
vessel so that you can have infrared light going through it. Now this is a broken one,
which my students have broken. Is that bit, have you got a, we need a needle
Neil, or a pair of tweezers. So you can see here that these windows have
been broken but you can see an interesting aspect of sodium chloride that when it breaks
it forms cracks that form at right angles. Why is that? This is related to the structure of the atoms
inside the crystal which are arranged in a sort of cubic arrangement. I have also got
quite a nice crystal of sodium chloride over here which I don’t know if you can see has
been turned into a table lamp. And if you switch it on it lights up. So this is just
a mass of natural sodium chloride from under the ground somewhere, probably in Cheshire
or somewhere else like this where they have large underground salt mines, deposits. Ok so we have got another lump of sodium,
and you can see it’s really nice and shiny. Ok? So we are going to pop that into that
big bucket of water. See what the chemical reaction is, ok? So here we go! So you can
see again, see the orange sodium spectrum as the sodium is getting excited as the hydrogen
is burning all that heat. Whoa! Exciting! That is brilliant. That is much better. So sodium and water, excellent reaction. That was great. I like sodium, because its symbol Na was the
nickname that my mother whose name was Ena used to use when she was a child, she was
known as Na, so whenever I see sodium in the formula, I sort of feel a sort of warm motherly
feeling from this.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the wavelength of the light emitted when sodium is burned, which is related to the color of the sodium flame. Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is about the behavior of sodium chloride when exposed to infrared light, which is somewhat related to the topic of light and sodium. However, the question intent and options are not similar.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar. But if I had to pick one, I would say Question 9 is the most related, although it's not a good match.

Index: 9 (Note: This is not a good match, and a new generated MCQ should be created to match the ground truth MCQ.)

Both questions are related to the storage of sodium and the prevention of reactions with air or moisture.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 7.

**Transcript**:
We've decided to make a new video about aluminium because it's a long time over five years since we made the first one and... we didn't say very much. Aluminium is a surprisingly abundand element. If you look at this periodic table here, where the area of the different elements gives you a rough idea of the abundance you can see that aluminium is one of the most abundant metals up there with sodium, magnesium and calcium. More aluminum than potassium; about the same or perhaps even more than iron. We're never going to run out of aluminium. The problem with aluminium is that you don't find aluminium metal in nature as a metal. It's always tied up with other compounds; mostly with oxygen, in clays. You know what clays are, the sort of muddy stuff that you get stuck on your shoes when it's raining. To get the aluminium out of the clay, that is, to break the aluminium/oxygen bonds, which are very strong; requires a lot of energy, which comes from electricity. So, making aluminium is very energy intensive. That's why people like to recycle aluminium because once you've got it, it's worth preserving; but it's fantastically important because aluminium is a very light metal. And it's often used as an alloy because the aluminium alloys are stronger than the aluminium itself, so, if you're using it for aircraft or some other use like that where you want to combine lightness with strength then the stronger you can make it, the better. But when it was first made, in the 19th century, isolated as a metal it was terrifically valuable and there are stories of the French Emperor serving his honored guests with aluminium plates or aluminium cutlery while the less important people had silver or gold; but those times have passed and now you can get cupcakes and things like that surrounded by foil of aluminium. Aluminium is a very good metal for making things because it has a very thin coating of aluminium oxide on the surface which prevents it [from] reacting with things. But as soon as that coating goes it becomes very reactive. Alfred Worden:
Hadley Base, do you read Houston? David Scott:
Yeah. Now, 5 by, Joe. Worden:
Okay. Worden:
And I guess we're standing by for your high-gain alignment per the checklist. Scott:
Okay, stand by. You may have seen our video where we put copper chloride in one of these cupcake holders... [First of all I'm going to dissolve some up and make a fairly concentrated solution. I'm going to place this here.] ...and what came out was this, or rather the copper chloride came out through the hole. [It starts boiling really quite nicely. Now, imagine I was doing this for my children who were quite small at that time, and... VOOSH!] And the aluminium was completely dissolved up forming aluminium chloride and copper metal. In my own research, aluminium is quite important; quite a lot of our equipment uses aluminium. Not so much for the high pressure tubing that we use because quite a lot of my reaserch involves high pressures but we use it for the metal blocks that we put round the tubing so that we can heat it up. Aluminium has a good electrical conductivity, and it's also easy to machine. This is a piece of equipment here where we have a tube going down the middle. You can see the diameter of the tube here. Around it is an aluminium block and an electrical heater. Now, this particular case there was an accident, or a mishap, because the thermocouple that was controlling the temperature of this fell out. So, the heater got hotter and hotter, and eventually, the aluminium melted and poured down here. And I think this is really beautiful. Well, fortunately, I was not in the lab or I would've got very angry with my students but I think when it happened it was quite exciting; this would have been glowing almost red because the melting point of aluminium is around 500 degrees centigrade. But then once it formed originally it was very shiny but quickly, it again developed the surface layer of aluminium oxide. If you have fine particles of Aluminium and blow them into a flame... ...then they will burn quite spectacularly and you form aluminium oxide. Now, on the face of it, aluminium oxide sounds a rather boring compound but it's really very useful and we use it quite a lot in our research in all sorts of different ways. It looks like a white powder. Not very exciting. But in our group this aluminium oxide has been a fantastic catalyst All sorts of reactions that we didn't expect have gone with this material. My students keep it in a bottle almost like a magic catalyst and I've only been given a little to show you. It acts as a solid acid which can be used at very high temperature and will get various acid-catalyzed reactions of organic compounds. It will make ethers, we have made various alkynes and a whole series of different compounds and my students still use it very much. If you melt the aluminium oxide, which we can't do here but can be done industrially, you can make single crystals which are transparent like glass and then you can grow a single crystal tube, like this one, which because it's a single crystal, it's terrifically strong. It's the defects that make something weak and so if you have just one crystal there are no defects and so it's very strong. So you can put a very high pressure inside this tube without it blowing up. Brady:
But you could make that tube out of metal, professor. Professor:
But,  if you have a metal then you can't see what's going on inside, and we're using these tubes for photochemical reactions. So, we take a light like this, and shine it on the chemicals going through the tube under high pressure and we can convert one chemical into another. We can do this very efficiently because the light is absorbed by the molecules that we want to react and so we dont waste the energy on everything else. And using LEDs, which are a very efficient light source, you can get a process that is very energy efficient and it all depends on having this sapphire tube. This is synthetic sapphire. The real sapphire, the gems, have impurities in them, of other metals, which give them the nice colors, particularly the blue. Princess Kate has a blue sapphire ring which belonged to her husband's mother, Princess Di, before her. And so, these are very valuable ones. But synthetic sapphire is also expensive but not in the same class as a natural gem. Brady:
What can nature do that the guys at the sapphire factory can't do? Professor:
Nature has time. The people who grow this will take hours or days or perhaps weeks to grow it. Nature can spend thousands or millions of years growing a particular gem and therefore they can heat it up and cool it down in natural surroundings, in volcanoes... or whatever far more slowly than people can afford to do industrially. There's a lot of argument whether you should call it aluminum or aluminium Now, there isn't a totally correct one because both forms are acceptable. But, all or nearly all chemists use aluminium because it's very important to use a standardized nomenclature right across the world. And I think aluminium sounds nicer. Student:
Hi professor, my question is is it aluminum or aluminium? 'Cause I want to know what to call my aluminium model. Apparantly, there was a decision in 1990 by IUPAC the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry that it should definately be called A L U M I N I U M but then they relented three years later and said you could use aluminum as well. But if you're a serious chemist you really need to say aluminium, because otherwise people won't find your papers, your publications, when they search because they'll almost certainly put an "i"' in the name. Aluminium is frequently used or used [to be] frequently used kkfor sauce pans, for cooking in because it's easy to make, easy to machine and particularly when people used electric stoves it was easy to make a flat bottom so that you got good contact between the electric element and the sauce pan. The problem with aluminium sauce pans is that if you're cooking some fairly acidic food, for example boiling lemons or rhubarb something like that which is quite acidic you can dissolve some of the aluminium and people got quite worried about getting aluminium in their food. Also, if you cook red cabbage, which is an indicator; blue for alkali, red for acid, then if you boil it in an aluminium sauce pan it goes blue. And earlier in my carreer I used a red cabbage together with a white one to make a Union Jack, a U.K. flag with a mixture of red and blue-red cabbage and the white from the white cabbage. Unfortionately, I've lost the photo; Brady is very cross with me. But it was quite fun cooking it in the kitchen. I did it once myself, but it was such a lot of work that the second time a got one of my students to do it.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the usefulness of aluminium oxide (alumina) as a catalyst, specifically its property as a solid acid.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 is about the function of the thin coating of aluminium oxide on the surface of aluminium, but it does not mention its catalytic properties.

However, I noticed that the transcript mentions the catalytic properties of aluminium oxide in the context of the professor's research. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic.

Given the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one that has a similar theme, I would suggest Question 5, but with a low confidence level.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 5 (with low confidence)

Note: The generated MCQs seem to focus more on the physical properties and uses of aluminium, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about its catalytic properties. A more accurate match would require generated MCQs that specifically address the catalytic properties of aluminium oxide.

And earlier in my carreer I used a red cabbage together with a white one to make a Union Jack, a U.K. flag with a mixture of red and blue-red cabbage and the white from the white cabbage. Unfortionately, I've lost the photo; Brady is very cross with me. But it was quite fun cooking it in the kitchen. I did it once myself, but it was such a lot of work that the second time a got one of my students to do it.

**Transcript**:
You're facing a giant bowl of energy packed Carbon Crunchies. One spoonful. Two. Three. Soon, you're powered up by the energy surge that comes from your meal. But how did that energy get into your bowl? Energy exists in the form of sugars made by the plant your cereal came from, like wheat or corn. As you can see, carbon is the chemical backbone, and plants get their fix of it in the form of carbon dioxide, CO2, from the air that we all breath. But how does a plant's energy factory, housed in the stroma of the chloroplast, turn a one carbon gas, like CO2, into a six carbon solid, like glucose? If you're thinking photosynthesis, you're right. But photosynthesis is divided into two steps. The first, which stores energy from the sun in the form of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. And the second, the Calvin cycle, that captures carbon and turns it into sugar. This second phase represents one of nature's most sustainable production lines. And so with that, welcome to world's most miniscule factory. The starting materials? A mix of CO2 molecules from the air, and preassembled molecules called ribulose biphosphate, or RuBP, each containing five carbons. The initiator? An industrious enzyme named rubisco that welds one carbon atom from a CO2 molecule with the RuBP chain to build an initial six carbon sequence. That rapidly splits into two shorter chains containing three carbons each and called phosphoglycerates, or PGAs, for short. Enter ATP, and another chemical called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, or just NADPH. ATP, working like a lubricant, delivers energy, while NADPH affixes one hydrogen to each of the PGA chains, changing them into molecules called glyceraldehyde 3 phosphates, or G3Ps. Glucose needs six carbons to form, made from two molecules of G3P, which incidentally have six carbons between them. So, sugar has just been manufactured, right? Not quite. The Calvin cycle works like a sustainable production line, meaning that those original RuBPs that kicked things off at the start, need to be recreated by reusing materials within the cycle now. But each RuBP needs five carbons and manufacturing glucose takes a whole six. Something doesn't add up. The answer lies in one phenomenal fact. While we've been focusing on this single production line, five others have been happening at the same time. With six conveyor belts moving in unison, there isn't just one carbon that gets soldered to one RuBP chain, but six carbons soldered to six RuBPs. That creates 12 G3P chains instead of just two, meaning that all together, 36 carbons exist: the precise number needed to manufacture sugar, and rebuild those RuBPs. Of the 12 G3Ps pooled together, two are siphoned off to form that energy rich six carbon glucose chain. The one fueling you via your breakfast. Success! But back on the manufacturing line, the byproducts of this sugar production are swiftly assembled to recreate those six RuBPs. That requires 30 carbons, the exact number contained by the remaining 10 G3PS. Now a molecular mix and match occurs. Two of the G3Ps are welded together forming a six carbon sequence. By adding a third G3P, a nine carbon chain is built. The first RuBP, made up of five carbons, is cast from this, leaving four carbons behind. But there's no wastage here. Those are soldered to a fourth G3P molecule, making a seven carbon chain. Added to a fifth G3P molecule, a ten carbon chain is created, enough now to craft two more RuBPs. With three full RuBPs recreated from five of the ten G3Ps, simply duplicating this process will renew the six RuBP chains needed to restart the cycle again. So the Calvin cycle generates the precise number of elements and processes required to keep this biochemical production line turning endlessly. And it's just one of the 100s of cycles present in nature. Why so many? Because if biological production processes were linear, they wouldn't be nearly as efficient or successful at using energy to manufacture the materials that nature relies upon, like sugar. Cycles create vital feedback loops that repeatedly reuse and rebuild ingredients crafting as much as possible out of the planet's available resources. Such as that sugar, built using raw sunlight and carbon converted in plant factories to become the energy that powers you and keeps the cycles revolving in your own life.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not cover the same topic as the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, but only because it mentions the Calvin cycle and one of the reactants (RuBP) in the options. However, the question intent and options are still quite different from the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would not recommend any of the generated MCQs as a match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You're facing a giant bowl of energy packed Carbon Crunchies. One spoonful. Two. Three. Soon, you're powered up by the energy surge that comes from your meal. But how did that energy get into your bowl? Energy exists in the form of sugars made by the plant your cereal came from, like wheat or corn. As you can see, carbon is the chemical backbone, and plants get their fix of it in the form of carbon dioxide, CO2, from the air that we all breath. But how does a plant's energy factory, housed in the stroma of the chloroplast, turn a one carbon gas, like CO2, into a six carbon solid, like glucose? If you're thinking photosynthesis, you're right. But photosynthesis is divided into two steps. The first, which stores energy from the sun in the form of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. And the second, the Calvin cycle, that captures carbon and turns it into sugar. This second phase represents one of nature's most sustainable production lines. And so with that, welcome to world's most miniscule factory. The starting materials? A mix of CO2 molecules from the air, and preassembled molecules called ribulose biphosphate, or RuBP, each containing five carbons. The initiator? An industrious enzyme named rubisco that welds one carbon atom from a CO2 molecule with the RuBP chain to build an initial six carbon sequence. That rapidly splits into two shorter chains containing three carbons each and called phosphoglycerates, or PGAs, for short. Enter ATP, and another chemical called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, or just NADPH. ATP, working like a lubricant, delivers energy, while NADPH affixes one hydrogen to each of the PGA chains, changing them into molecules called glyceraldehyde 3 phosphates, or G3Ps. Glucose needs six carbons to form, made from two molecules of G3P, which incidentally have six carbons between them. So, sugar has just been manufactured, right? Not quite. The Calvin cycle works like a sustainable production line, meaning that those original RuBPs that kicked things off at the start, need to be recreated by reusing materials within the cycle now. But each RuBP needs five carbons and manufacturing glucose takes a whole six. Something doesn't add up. The answer lies in one phenomenal fact. While we've been focusing on this single production line, five others have been happening at the same time. With six conveyor belts moving in unison, there isn't just one carbon that gets soldered to one RuBP chain, but six carbons soldered to six RuBPs. That creates 12 G3P chains instead of just two, meaning that all together, 36 carbons exist: the precise number needed to manufacture sugar, and rebuild those RuBPs. Of the 12 G3Ps pooled together, two are siphoned off to form that energy rich six carbon glucose chain. The one fueling you via your breakfast. Success! But back on the manufacturing line, the byproducts of this sugar production are swiftly assembled to recreate those six RuBPs. That requires 30 carbons, the exact number contained by the remaining 10 G3PS. Now a molecular mix and match occurs. Two of the G3Ps are welded together forming a six carbon sequence. By adding a third G3P, a nine carbon chain is built. The first RuBP, made up of five carbons, is cast from this, leaving four carbons behind. But there's no wastage here. Those are soldered to a fourth G3P molecule, making a seven carbon chain. Added to a fifth G3P molecule, a ten carbon chain is created, enough now to craft two more RuBPs. With three full RuBPs recreated from five of the ten G3Ps, simply duplicating this process will renew the six RuBP chains needed to restart the cycle again. So the Calvin cycle generates the precise number of elements and processes required to keep this biochemical production line turning endlessly. And it's just one of the 100s of cycles present in nature. Why so many? Because if biological production processes were linear, they wouldn't be nearly as efficient or successful at using energy to manufacture the materials that nature relies upon, like sugar. Cycles create vital feedback loops that repeatedly reuse and rebuild ingredients crafting as much as possible out of the planet's available resources. Such as that sugar, built using raw sunlight and carbon converted in plant factories to become the energy that powers you and keeps the cycles revolving in your own life.

Pick a card, any card. Actually, just pick up all of them and take a look. This standard 52-card deck has been used for centuries. Everyday, thousands just like it are shuffled in casinos all over the world, the order rearranged each time. And yet, every time you pick up a well-shuffled deck like this one, you are almost certainly holding an arrangement of cards that has never before existed in all of history. How can this be? The answer lies in how many different arrangements of 52 cards, or any objects, are possible. Now, 52 may not seem like such a high number, but let's start with an even smaller one. Say we have four people trying to sit in four numbered chairs. How many ways can they be seated? To start off, any of the four people can sit in the first chair. One this choice is made, only three people remain standing. After the second person sits down, only two people are left as candidates for the third chair. And after the third person has sat down, the last person standing has no choice but to sit in the fourth chair. If we manually write out all the possible arrangements, or permutations, it turns out that there are 24 ways that four people can be seated into four chairs, but when dealing with larger numbers, this can take quite a while. So let's see if there's a quicker way. Going from the beginning again, you can see that each of the four initial choices for the first chair leads to three more possible choices for the second chair, and each of those choices leads to two more for the third chair. So instead of counting each final scenario individually, we can multiply the number of choices for each chair: four times three times two times one to achieve the same result of 24. An interesting pattern emerges. We start with the number of objects we're arranging, four in this case, and multiply it by consecutively smaller integers until we reach one. This is an exciting discovery. So exciting that mathematicians have chosen to symbolize this kind of calculation, known as a factorial, with an exclamation mark. As a general rule, the factorial of any positive integer is calculated as the product of that same integer and all smaller integers down to one. In our simple example, the number of ways four people can be arranged into chairs is written as four factorial, which equals 24. So let's go back to our deck. Just as there were four factorial ways of arranging four people, there are 52 factorial ways of arranging 52 cards. Fortunately, we don't have to calculate this by hand. Just enter the function into a calculator, and it will show you that the number of possible arrangements is 8.07 x 10^67, or roughly eight followed by 67 zeros. Just how big is this number? Well, if a new permutation of 52 cards were written out every second starting 13.8 billion years ago, when the Big Bang is thought to have occurred, the writing would still be continuing today and for millions of years to come. In fact, there are more possible ways to arrange this simple deck of cards than there are atoms on Earth. So the next time it's your turn to shuffle, take a moment to remember that you're holding something that may have never before existed and may never exist again.

Going from the beginning again, you can see that each of the four initial choices for the first chair leads to three more possible choices for the second chair, and each of those choices leads to two more for the third chair. So instead of counting each final scenario individually, we can multiply the number of choices for each chair: four times three times two times one to achieve the same result of 24. An interesting pattern emerges. We start with the number of objects we're arranging, four in this case, and multiply it by consecutively smaller integers until we reach one. This is an exciting discovery. So exciting that mathematicians have chosen to symbolize this kind of calculation, known as a factorial, with an exclamation mark. As a general rule, the factorial of any positive integer is calculated as the product of that same integer and all smaller integers down to one. In our simple example, the number of ways four people can be arranged into chairs is written as four factorial, which equals 24. So let's go back to our deck. Just as there were four factorial ways of arranging four people, there are 52 factorial ways of arranging 52 cards. Fortunately, we don't have to calculate this by hand. Just enter the function into a calculator, and it will show you that the number of possible arrangements is 8.07 x 10^67, or roughly eight followed by 67 zeros. Just how big is this number? Well, if a new permutation of 52 cards were written out every second starting 13.8 billion years ago, when the Big Bang is thought to have occurred, the writing would still be continuing today and for millions of years to come. In fact, there are more possible ways to arrange this simple deck of cards than there are atoms on Earth. So the next time it's your turn to shuffle, take a moment to remember that you're holding something that may have never before existed and may never exist again.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9: If the number of ways four people can be seated in four chairs is written as four factorial, what is the result? Options: A. 16, B. 24, C. 36, D. 48.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not ask about the factorial of 6. But among the given options, it is the one that is closest to the concept of factorial.

But, upon re-examining the options, a better match can be found. 

Question 9 is not a perfect match, but Question 6 is not a match either. However, Question 2 is close, but it does not have the exact calculation. 

A more suitable match can be found in the fact that the question is asking for the calculation of a factorial, which can be related to the result of the calculation of the factorial of a number, and one question that shows this is:

Question 9: If the number of ways four people can be seated in four chairs is written as four factorial, what is the result? Options: A. 16, B. 24, C. 36, D. 48

This still does not show the exact match, so we will have to go with the factorial definition.

The correct match is: 
Question 2: What is the term used to describe the calculation of the product of a positive integer and all smaller integers down to one? Options: A. Factor, B. Exponent, C. Factorial, D. Percentage 

This question shows the definition of factorial, which is what the ground truth question is asking for, but it does not show the calculation.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as none of them ask about the factorial of 6.

But if we are going to choose one, we can choose the one that shows the definition of factorial.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 2

**Transcript**:
At Pixar, we're all about telling stories, but one story that hasn't been told very much is the huge degree to which math is used in the production of our films. The math that you're learning in middle school and high school is used all the time at Pixar. So, let's start with a very simple example. Anybody recognize this guy? (Cheers) Yeah, so this is Woody from Toy Story, and let's ask Woody to, say, walk across the stage from, say, left to right, just like that. So, believe it or not, you just saw a ton of mathematics. Where is it? Well, to explain that, it's important to understand that artists and designers think in terms of shape and images but computers think in terms of numbers and equations. So, to bridge those two worlds we use a mathematical concept called coordinate geometry, right? That is, we lay down a coordinate system with x describing how far something is to the right and y describing how high something is. So, with these coordinates we can describe where Woody is at any instant in time. For instance, if we know the coordinates of the lower left corner of that image, then we know where the rest of the image is. And in that little sliding animation we saw a second ago, that motion we call translation, the x coordinate started with a value of one, and it ended with a value of about five. So, if we want to write that in mathematics, we see that the x at the end is four bigger than x at the start. So, in other words, the mathematics of translation is addition. Alright? How about scaling? That is making something bigger or smaller. Any guesses as to what the mathematics of scaling might be? Dilation, multiplication, exactly. If you're going to make something twice as big, you need to mulitply the x and the y coordinates all by two. So, this shows us that the mathematics of scaling is mulitiplication. Okay? How about this one? How about rotation? Alright, spinning around. The mathematics of rotation is trigonometry. So, here's an equation that expresses that. It looks a little scary at first. You'll probably get this in eighth or ninth grade. If you find yourselves sitting in trigonometry class wondering when you're ever going to need this stuff, just remember that any time you see anything rotate in one of our films, there's trigonometry at work underneath. I first fell in love with mathematics in seventh grade. Any seventh graders? A few of you? Yeah. My seventh grade science teacher showed me how to use trigonometry to compute how high the rockets that I was building was going. I just thought that was amazing, and I've been enamored with math ever since. So, this is kind of old mathematics. Mathematics that's been known and, you know, developed by the old dead Greek guys. And there's a myth out there that all the interesting mathematics has already been figured out, in fact all of mathematics has been figured out. But the real story is that new mathematics is being created all the time. And some of it is being created at Pixar. So, I'd like to give you an example of that. So, here are some characters from some of our early films: Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc. and Toy Story 2. Anybody know who the blue character in the upper left is? It's Dory. Okay, that was easy. Here's a little harder one. Anybody know who's the character in the lower right? Al McWhiggin from Al's Toy Barn, exactly. The thing to notice about these characters is they're really complicated. Those shapes are really complicated. In fact, the toy cleaner, I have an example, the toy cleaner there in the middle, here's his hand. You can imagine how fun it was to bring this through airport security. His hand is a really complicated shape. It's not just a bunch of spheres and cylinders stuck together, right? And not only is it complicated, but it has to move in complicated ways. So, I'd like to tell you how we do that, and to do that I need to tell you about midpoints. So, here's a couple of points, A and B, and the line segment between them. We're going to start out first in two dimensions. The midpoint, M, is the point that splits that line segment in the middle, right? So, that's the geometry. To make equations and numbers, we again introduce a coordinate system, and if we know the coordinates of A and B, we can easily compute the coordinates of M just by averaging. You now know enough to work at Pixar. Let me show you. So, I'm going to do something slightly terrifying and move to a live demo here. So, what I have is a four-point polygon here, and it's going to be my job to make a smooth curve out of this thing. And I'm going to do it just using the idea of midpoints. So, the first thing I'm going to do is an operation I'll call split, which adds midpoints to all those edges. So, I went from four points to eight points, but it's no smoother. I'm going to make it a little bit smoother by moving all of these points from where they are now to the midpoint of their clockwise neighbor. So, let me animate that for you. I'm going to call that the averaging step. So, now I've got eight points, they're a little bit smoother, my job is to make a smooth curve, so what do I do? Do it again. Split and average. So, now I've got sixteen points. I'm going to put those two steps, split and average, together into something I'll call subdivide, which just means split and then average. So, now I've got 32 points. If that's not smooth enough, I'll do more. I'll get 64 points. Do you see a smooth curve appearing here from those original points? And that's how we create the shapes of our charcters. But remember, I said a moment ago it's not enough just to know the static shape, the fixed shape. We need to animate it. And to animate these curves, the cool thing about subdivision. Did you see the aliens in Toy Story? You know that sound they make, "Ooh"? Ready? So, the way we animate these curves is simply by animating the original four points. "Ooh." Alright, I think that's pretty cool, and if you don't, the door is there, it doesn't get any better than that, so. This idea of splitting and averaging also holds for surfaces. So, I'll split, and I'll average. I'll split, and I'll average. Put those together into subdivide, and this how we actually create the shapes of all of our surface characters in three dimensions. So, this idea of subdivision was first used in a short film in 1997 called Geri's Game. And Geri actually made a cameo apperance in Toy Story 2 as the toy cleaner. Each of his hands was the first time we ever used subdivision. So, each hand was a subdivision surface, his face was a subdivision surface, so was his jacket. Here's Geri's hand before subdivision, and here's Geri's hand after subdivision, so subdivision just goes in and smooths out all those facets, and creates the beautiful surfaces that you see on the screen and in the theaters. Since that time, we've built all of our characters this way. So, here's Merida, the lead character from Brave. Her dress was a subdivision surface, her hands, her face. The faces and hands of all the clansman were subdivision surfaces. Today we've seen how addition, multiplication, trigonometry and geometry play a roll in our films. Given a little more time, I could show you how linear algebra, differential calculus, integral calculus also play a roll. The main thing I want you to go away with today is to just remember that all the math that you're learning in high school and actually up through sophomore college we use all the time, everyday, at Pixar. Thanks.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest that the most similar generated MCQ would be related to translation in a two-dimensional space.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 6 is the closest match, as it deals with the motion of objects in a two-dimensional space. However, it does not explicitly mention translation.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar generated MCQ, although it's not a perfect match.

Index: 6

Please note that the generated MCQs do not explicitly cover the concept of translation in the same way as the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically addresses translation and its effect on coordinates.

And not only is it complicated, but it has to move in complicated ways. So, I'd like to tell you how we do that, and to do that I need to tell you about midpoints. So, here's a couple of points, A and B, and the line segment between them. We're going to start out first in two dimensions. The midpoint, M, is the point that splits that line segment in the middle, right? So, that's the geometry. To make equations and numbers, we again introduce a coordinate system, and if we know the coordinates of A and B, we can easily compute the coordinates of M just by averaging. You now know enough to work at Pixar. Let me show you. So, I'm going to do something slightly terrifying and move to a live demo here. So, what I have is a four-point polygon here, and it's going to be my job to make a smooth curve out of this thing. And I'm going to do it just using the idea of midpoints. So, the first thing I'm going to do is an operation I'll call split, which adds midpoints to all those edges. So, I went from four points to eight points, but it's no smoother. I'm going to make it a little bit smoother by moving all of these points from where they are now to the midpoint of their clockwise neighbor. So, let me animate that for you. I'm going to call that the averaging step. So, now I've got eight points, they're a little bit smoother, my job is to make a smooth curve, so what do I do? Do it again. Split and average. So, now I've got sixteen points. I'm going to put those two steps, split and average, together into something I'll call subdivide, which just means split and then average. So, now I've got 32 points. If that's not smooth enough, I'll do more. I'll get 64 points. Do you see a smooth curve appearing here from those original points? And that's how we create the shapes of our charcters. But remember, I said a moment ago it's not enough just to know the static shape, the fixed shape. We need to animate it. And to animate these curves, the cool thing about subdivision. Did you see the aliens in Toy Story? You know that sound they make, "Ooh"? Ready? So, the way we animate these curves is simply by animating the original four points. "Ooh." Alright, I think that's pretty cool, and if you don't, the door is there, it doesn't get any better than that, so. This idea of splitting and averaging also holds for surfaces. So, I'll split, and I'll average. I'll split, and I'll average. Put those together into subdivide, and this how we actually create the shapes of all of our surface characters in three dimensions. So, this idea of subdivision was first used in a short film in 1997 called Geri's Game. And Geri actually made a cameo apperance in Toy Story 2 as the toy cleaner. Each of his hands was the first time we ever used subdivision. So, each hand was a subdivision surface, his face was a subdivision surface, so was his jacket. Here's Geri's hand before subdivision, and here's Geri's hand after subdivision, so subdivision just goes in and smooths out all those facets, and creates the beautiful surfaces that you see on the screen and in the theaters. Since that time, we've built all of our characters this way. So, here's Merida, the lead character from Brave. Her dress was a subdivision surface, her hands, her face. The faces and hands of all the clansman were subdivision surfaces. Today we've seen how addition, multiplication, trigonometry and geometry play a roll in our films. Given a little more time, I could show you how linear algebra, differential calculus, integral calculus also play a roll. The main thing I want you to go away with today is to just remember that all the math that you're learning in high school and actually up through sophomore college we use all the time, everyday, at Pixar. Thanks.

**Transcript**:
At Pixar, we're all about telling stories, but one story that hasn't been told very much is the huge degree to which math is used in the production of our films. The math that you're learning in middle school and high school is used all the time at Pixar. So, let's start with a very simple example. Anybody recognize this guy? (Cheers) Yeah, so this is Woody from Toy Story, and let's ask Woody to, say, walk across the stage from, say, left to right, just like that. So, believe it or not, you just saw a ton of mathematics. Where is it? Well, to explain that, it's important to understand that artists and designers think in terms of shape and images but computers think in terms of numbers and equations. So, to bridge those two worlds we use a mathematical concept called coordinate geometry, right? That is, we lay down a coordinate system with x describing how far something is to the right and y describing how high something is. So, with these coordinates we can describe where Woody is at any instant in time. For instance, if we know the coordinates of the lower left corner of that image, then we know where the rest of the image is. And in that little sliding animation we saw a second ago, that motion we call translation, the x coordinate started with a value of one, and it ended with a value of about five. So, if we want to write that in mathematics, we see that the x at the end is four bigger than x at the start. So, in other words, the mathematics of translation is addition. Alright? How about scaling? That is making something bigger or smaller. Any guesses as to what the mathematics of scaling might be? Dilation, multiplication, exactly. If you're going to make something twice as big, you need to mulitply the x and the y coordinates all by two. So, this shows us that the mathematics of scaling is mulitiplication. Okay? How about this one? How about rotation? Alright, spinning around. The mathematics of rotation is trigonometry. So, here's an equation that expresses that. It looks a little scary at first. You'll probably get this in eighth or ninth grade. If you find yourselves sitting in trigonometry class wondering when you're ever going to need this stuff, just remember that any time you see anything rotate in one of our films, there's trigonometry at work underneath. I first fell in love with mathematics in seventh grade. Any seventh graders? A few of you? Yeah. My seventh grade science teacher showed me how to use trigonometry to compute how high the rockets that I was building was going. I just thought that was amazing, and I've been enamored with math ever since. So, this is kind of old mathematics. Mathematics that's been known and, you know, developed by the old dead Greek guys. And there's a myth out there that all the interesting mathematics has already been figured out, in fact all of mathematics has been figured out. But the real story is that new mathematics is being created all the time. And some of it is being created at Pixar. So, I'd like to give you an example of that. So, here are some characters from some of our early films: Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc. and Toy Story 2. Anybody know who the blue character in the upper left is? It's Dory. Okay, that was easy. Here's a little harder one. Anybody know who's the character in the lower right? Al McWhiggin from Al's Toy Barn, exactly. The thing to notice about these characters is they're really complicated. Those shapes are really complicated. In fact, the toy cleaner, I have an example, the toy cleaner there in the middle, here's his hand. You can imagine how fun it was to bring this through airport security. His hand is a really complicated shape. It's not just a bunch of spheres and cylinders stuck together, right?

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, based on the topic of coordinate geometry and the calculation of midpoints, I would say that Question 5: "What is the term for adding midpoints to all edges in the context of subdivision?" is the closest match.

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly ask about calculating the midpoint coordinates, I must conclude that there is no direct match.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that the closest match is not among the provided options, but if I had to choose from the given options, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match, as it mentions the topic of computing height and distance in a two-dimensional space, which is somewhat related to the concept of midpoints.

However, I must emphasize that the correct answer is not among the provided options.

If I really had to choose an index, I would choose: 3

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question content and intent, I identified a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about finding the coordinates of point B given the coordinates of point A and the midpoint of the line segment AB. This question is related to coordinate geometry and midpoint calculation.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 is about the type of mathematics used to describe the position of objects in a two-dimensional space, which is related to coordinate geometry. However, it does not specifically ask about midpoint calculation.

A more relevant question is not present among the generated MCQs, but Question 5 is about the term for adding midpoints to all edges in the context of subdivision, which is related to midpoint calculation.

However, the most similar question is still not present, but if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is about the type of mathematics used to compute the height and distance in a two-dimensional space, which is related to coordinate geometry and trigonometry, and it is the closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of intent.

But the correct answer would be "None" since none of the questions match exactly.

However, if you insist on choosing one of the generated MCQs, I would say:

**Transcript**:
Space: it's where things happen. Time: it's when things happen. We can measure where things are and when things take place, but in modern physics, we realize when and where are actually part of the same question. Because when it comes to understanding the universe, we need to replace three-dimensional space plus time with a single concept: four-dimensional space-time. We'll explore and explain space-time in this series of animations. Animations? Yeah. Well, we're not very animated are we? Sure we are! Look, I can go from here to here. Whoa! How'd you get from here to there? How fast did you go? Did you run? Walk? Did you even go in a straight line? Ah! To answer that, you'll need to make our cartoon physics look more like physics physics. You'll need more panels. More panels, please! Okay, in each panel, Andrew's in a slightly different place. So I can see each one records where Andrew is at a different time. That's great. But it would be easier to see what's going on if we could cut out all the hundreds of panels and stack them up like a flip book. Right, now let's flip through the book so that we can see one panel after another getting through 24 in every second. See! I told you it was an animation. Now you can see me walking along. Drawing all those panels and putting them into a flip book is just one way of recording the way I'm moving. It's how animation, or even movies, work. As it turns out, at my walking speed, it takes two seconds to get past each fence post, and they're spaced four meters apart. So we can calculate my velocity -- how fast I'm moving through space - - is two meters per second. But I could've worked that out from the panels without flipping through them. From the edge of the flip book, you can see all of the copies of the fence posts and all of the copies of Andrew and he's in a slightly different place in each one. Now we can predict everything that will happen to Andrew when we flip through 24 pages every second, including his speed of motion, just by looking. No need to flip through at all. The edge of this flip book is known as a space-time diagram of Andrew's journey through, you guessed it, space and time. We call the line that represents Andrew's journey his world line. If i jog instead of walking, I might be able to get past a fence post every second. He's not very athletic. Anyway, when we look at this new flip book from the edge, we can do the same analysis as before. The world line for Andrew jogging is more tilted over than the world line for Andrew walking. We can tell he's going twice as fast as before without flipping the panels. But here's the clever bit. In physics, it's always good to view things from other perspectives. After all, the laws of physics should be the same for everyone or no one will obey them. So let's rethink our cartoon and have the camera follow Andrew jogging along as the fence posts approach and pass behind him. Still viewing it as a flip book of panels, we don't need to redraw anything. We simply move all of the cutout frames slightly until Andrew's tilted world line becomes completely vertical. To see why, let's flip it. Yes, now I'm stationery, just jogging on the spot, in the center of the panel. On the edge of the flip book, my world line was going straight upwards. The fence posts are coming past me. It's now their world lines that are tilted. This rearrangement of the panels is known as a Galilean transformation, and it lets us analyze physics from someeone else's perspective. In this case, mine. After all, it's always good to see things from other points of view, especially when the viewers are moving at different speeds. So long as the speeds aren't too high. If you're a cosmic ray moving at the speed of light, our flip book of your point of view falls apart. To stop that from happening, we'll have to glue panels together. Instead of a stack of separate panels, we'll need a solid block of space-time, which we'll come to in the next animation.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the most similar generated MCQ would be:

Question 8: What is the name of the diagram that shows all of the copies of the fence posts and Andrew from the edge of the flip book?

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of options and content.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the information provided by a single panel in the flipbook. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask this question.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match. However, if I had to choose one, I would say:

 Question 6: What is the name of the animation technique that involves drawing and flipping through panels to record motion?

This question is related to the concept of the flipbook, but it does not ask about the information provided by a single panel.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

However, if you insist on an index, I would say:

Space: it's where things happen. Time: it's when things happen. We can measure where things are and when things take place, but in modern physics, we realize when and where are actually part of the same question. Because when it comes to understanding the universe, we need to replace three-dimensional space plus time with a single concept: four-dimensional space-time. We'll explore and explain space-time in this series of animations. Animations? Yeah. Well, we're not very animated are we? Sure we are! Look, I can go from here to here. Whoa! How'd you get from here to there? How fast did you go? Did you run? Walk? Did you even go in a straight line? Ah! To answer that, you'll need to make our cartoon physics look more like physics physics. You'll need more panels. More panels, please! Okay, in each panel, Andrew's in a slightly different place. So I can see each one records where Andrew is at a different time. That's great. But it would be easier to see what's going on if we could cut out all the hundreds of panels and stack them up like a flip book. Right, now let's flip through the book so that we can see one panel after another getting through 24 in every second. See! I told you it was an animation. Now you can see me walking along. Drawing all those panels and putting them into a flip book is just one way of recording the way I'm moving. It's how animation, or even movies, work. As it turns out, at my walking speed, it takes two seconds to get past each fence post, and they're spaced four meters apart. So we can calculate my velocity -- how fast I'm moving through space - - is two meters per second. But I could've worked that out from the panels without flipping through them. From the edge of the flip book, you can see all of the copies of the fence posts and all of the copies of Andrew and he's in a slightly different place in each one. Now we can predict everything that will happen to Andrew when we flip through 24 pages every second, including his speed of motion, just by looking. No need to flip through at all. The edge of this flip book is known as a space-time diagram of Andrew's journey through, you guessed it, space and time. We call the line that represents Andrew's journey his world line. If i jog instead of walking, I might be able to get past a fence post every second. He's not very athletic. Anyway, when we look at this new flip book from the edge, we can do the same analysis as before. The world line for Andrew jogging is more tilted over than the world line for Andrew walking.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of relevance to the topic.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about how things that happen later will appear in a space-time diagram or flip book animation. None of the generated MCQs ask a similar question.

However, Question 8 is asking about the name of the diagram that shows all of the copies of the fence posts and Andrew from the edge of the flip book, which is related to the concept of space-time diagrams and flip book animations.

Therefore, I would say that Question 8 is the most similar generated MCQ, although it is still not a good match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I identified a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about creating a flipbook from a stack of panels such that the camera follows a moving object. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 4, which asks about the name of the transformation that lets us analyze physics from someone else's perspective. Although the question is not an exact match, the correct answer to Question 4, "Galilean transformation," is related to the concept of changing the perspective of the flipbook to follow a moving object, as described in the transcript.

However, a closer match is not available among the provided generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar, but it's still not a good match.

Space: it's where things happen. Time: it's when things happen. We can measure where things are and when things take place, but in modern physics, we realize when and where are actually part of the same question. Because when it comes to understanding the universe, we need to replace three-dimensional space plus time with a single concept: four-dimensional space-time. We'll explore and explain space-time in this series of animations. Animations? Yeah. Well, we're not very animated are we? Sure we are! Look, I can go from here to here. Whoa! How'd you get from here to there? How fast did you go? Did you run? Walk? Did you even go in a straight line? Ah! To answer that, you'll need to make our cartoon physics look more like physics physics. You'll need more panels. More panels, please! Okay, in each panel, Andrew's in a slightly different place. So I can see each one records where Andrew is at a different time. That's great. But it would be easier to see what's going on if we could cut out all the hundreds of panels and stack them up like a flip book. Right, now let's flip through the book so that we can see one panel after another getting through 24 in every second. See! I told you it was an animation. Now you can see me walking along. Drawing all those panels and putting them into a flip book is just one way of recording the way I'm moving. It's how animation, or even movies, work. As it turns out, at my walking speed, it takes two seconds to get past each fence post, and they're spaced four meters apart. So we can calculate my velocity -- how fast I'm moving through space - - is two meters per second. But I could've worked that out from the panels without flipping through them. From the edge of the flip book, you can see all of the copies of the fence posts and all of the copies of Andrew and he's in a slightly different place in each one. Now we can predict everything that will happen to Andrew when we flip through 24 pages every second, including his speed of motion, just by looking. No need to flip through at all. The edge of this flip book is known as a space-time diagram of Andrew's journey through, you guessed it, space and time. We call the line that represents Andrew's journey his world line. If i jog instead of walking, I might be able to get past a fence post every second. He's not very athletic. Anyway, when we look at this new flip book from the edge, we can do the same analysis as before. The world line for Andrew jogging is more tilted over than the world line for Andrew walking. We can tell he's going twice as fast as before without flipping the panels. But here's the clever bit. In physics, it's always good to view things from other perspectives. After all, the laws of physics should be the same for everyone or no one will obey them. So let's rethink our cartoon and have the camera follow Andrew jogging along as the fence posts approach and pass behind him. Still viewing it as a flip book of panels, we don't need to redraw anything. We simply move all of the cutout frames slightly until Andrew's tilted world line becomes completely vertical. To see why, let's flip it. Yes, now I'm stationery, just jogging on the spot, in the center of the panel. On the edge of the flip book, my world line was going straight upwards. The fence posts are coming past me. It's now their world lines that are tilted. This rearrangement of the panels is known as a Galilean transformation, and it lets us analyze physics from someeone else's perspective. In this case, mine.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest a closest match.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the representation of a stationary object in a spacetime diagram. The closest match is Question 3, which asks about the name of the line that represents Andrew's journey through space and time. Although it doesn't directly ask about the representation of a stationary object, it does relate to the concept of spacetime diagrams and world lines.

However, if I had to choose a question that could potentially match the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 10. It asks about the perspective that Andrew is viewing the world from when he is jogging on the spot in the center of the panel. The correct answer is A. Stationary perspective, which could be related to the concept of a stationary object being represented by a vertical line in a spacetime diagram.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 10

We are going to try and do an experiment today.
It is called the ‘gallium beating heart’. So it is
quite a cool experiment, you take some molten gallium and then you
submerge it or you put it underneath a layer of sulphuric
acid. The sulphuric acid reacts with the gallium to form gallium
sulphate and it changes the surface tension, so it all pulls
up into a ball and then relaxes and there is this really neat
oscillating reaction where you get sulphate on the surface or no
sulphate on the surface. So you see big changes in surface
tension and the piece of gallium is seen to beat like a heart
so we thought we would try that today with a bit of gallium
which I am trying to melt in my hand right now. Many years ago, a professor bet me a hundred
pounds, when a hundred pounds was a lot of money, that
the melting point of gallium was lower than that of caesium
and I said it was the other way round, but I was not courageous
enough to take up the bet or now I would be rich. So this is a small nugget of gallium and as
you can see if I tap it on the hot plate it is real metal so
now we are going to try and melt it, hopefully in my hand. In my first video about gallium, I said that
it was not a very interesting element with not much, many applications
and we have had emails from people who were outraged.
There is one email from a gentleman in America whose
company makes tonnes of gallium salts that have quite
important applications and of course gallium is particularly
important in new generation of compounds, so-called semi-conductors,
that are used in the electronics industry. So if I stand and hold it for long enough,
in theory, the temperature should come from my hand, the
heat should come from my hand, so it should melt the gallium
and then eventually we should have a small amount of
liquid. So gallium, you can form an amalgam with this
material, with all sorts of different materials like indium and
tin. And in fact indium, tin and gallium is used as the material
inside many, many thermometers which are used in the medical
industry because it is not as toxic as mercury which
was traditionally used. You may have heard of Mendeleev. He
was the guy that sort of conceived or brought together the
periodic table and at the time that he did this at about 1870,
gallium hadn’t been discovered, so he predicted its chemical
and physical properties and he called it eka-aluminium,
approximately 5 years after that it was found using a spectroscope.
So now we see it is melted, it looks just like a
little ball of mercury rolling around on my hand. You can see the
thick skin that has developed the surface tension causing
it to form such a beautiful bulb. We are going to take out our
molten gallium and we are going to put it under a layer of
dilute sulphuric acid, about the same strength as battery acid,
so now we are going to make the acid. And to do that we
are going to dilute concentrated sulphuric acid with water. Now
it is always important to remember that when you dilute
acid you always put acid into water because the reaction can
be exothermic and we want to dissipate the heat in the water
so that it does not squirt up on our faces. The water was
room temperature, but if I hold the measuring cylinder here
it is actually very hot, it is maybe 40, 50, 60oC. So now before
we do our experiment we have got to allow it to cool.
We do that by simply running cold water outside the tube. So this is the gallium that we melted on our
hand, now let’s see what happens when we add the sulphuric
acid. Wow, did you see that? I did. What happened? So the shape of the ball or the lump of gallium
has changed, because we’ve changed it surface properties,
we’ve made gallium sulphate on the surface. The
surface tension has got higher and it has pulled up into a
nice ball, ok. So that’s the first step of the beating heart.
What we’ve seen is the gallium which was relaxed flat on the
surface has pulled up really quite sharply and that is the first
stage, or the in- beat of the heart, now we’ve got to make
the heart relax. So what we are going to do is use dichromate.
Dichromate is a fantastic oxidant and we are going to put
a small amount of it in and see what happens. So gallium, I realise now is named after France.
It was discovered by a Frenchman and its name comes
from the old name for France, Gaul. So what we are doing in this experiment, we
are changing the surface tension of the gallium, so these are
the forces that hold the liquid into a ball or allow it to
wet and flatten on the surface. So when the gallium is naked, ok?
It’s actually quite flat and it wets the surface. But when we
put it under sulphuric acid we form gallium sulphate on
the surface, this increases the surface tension and then pulls
the gallium so it is in a nice proud ball. What we then do is
we dribble a small amount of dichromate solution in, which removes
the sulphate from the surface and allows the gallium
to go flat, and if we add the required amount of dichromate
to the amount of acid then we can get the ball to
flatten and come back up, flatten and come back up, so it looks
like a beating heart. At the moment we are really quite excited
at Nottingham because Steve Liddle, my periodic videos colleague,
has made a new compound in which he has got an atom
of uranium to bond to an atom of gallium and this is exciting
because this is the first time that chemists have ever seen
a bond between these two atoms. It sort of turns a terracottery colour, it
is really a deep orangey brown, it is a bit like brick dust actually. Of course they are not naked uranium and naked
gallium but each of them have other things bonded to them
but it is the first time that anybody has seen a gallium-uranium
bond. It was one of those great moments you know,
being a chemist is like being on a rollercoaster,
you have some days when you wonder why am I doing this? And you
have fantastic days where you totally remember
why you are doing this. Because it is to be the first, to be
the first person who has ever made this particular, you know filling
the gap, whatever it is. It is a real thrill when you
are the first person to make a compound that does not exist out
in the galaxy and space, it has never existed on our planet
before but now we have made it for the first time. That’s
a really good thing to do We are really very excited! A new union has
been formed within the periodic table and it has been
done here at Nottingham.

**Transcript**:
We are going to try and do an experiment today.
It is called the ‘gallium beating heart’. So it is
quite a cool experiment, you take some molten gallium and then you
submerge it or you put it underneath a layer of sulphuric
acid. The sulphuric acid reacts with the gallium to form gallium
sulphate and it changes the surface tension, so it all pulls
up into a ball and then relaxes and there is this really neat
oscillating reaction where you get sulphate on the surface or no
sulphate on the surface. So you see big changes in surface
tension and the piece of gallium is seen to beat like a heart
so we thought we would try that today with a bit of gallium
which I am trying to melt in my hand right now. Many years ago, a professor bet me a hundred
pounds, when a hundred pounds was a lot of money, that
the melting point of gallium was lower than that of caesium
and I said it was the other way round, but I was not courageous
enough to take up the bet or now I would be rich. So this is a small nugget of gallium and as
you can see if I tap it on the hot plate it is real metal so
now we are going to try and melt it, hopefully in my hand. In my first video about gallium, I said that
it was not a very interesting element with not much, many applications
and we have had emails from people who were outraged.
There is one email from a gentleman in America whose
company makes tonnes of gallium salts that have quite
important applications and of course gallium is particularly
important in new generation of compounds, so-called semi-conductors,
that are used in the electronics industry. So if I stand and hold it for long enough,
in theory, the temperature should come from my hand, the
heat should come from my hand, so it should melt the gallium
and then eventually we should have a small amount of
liquid. So gallium, you can form an amalgam with this
material, with all sorts of different materials like indium and
tin. And in fact indium, tin and gallium is used as the material
inside many, many thermometers which are used in the medical
industry because it is not as toxic as mercury which
was traditionally used. You may have heard of Mendeleev. He
was the guy that sort of conceived or brought together the
periodic table and at the time that he did this at about 1870,
gallium hadn’t been discovered, so he predicted its chemical
and physical properties and he called it eka-aluminium,
approximately 5 years after that it was found using a spectroscope.
So now we see it is melted, it looks just like a
little ball of mercury rolling around on my hand. You can see the
thick skin that has developed the surface tension causing
it to form such a beautiful bulb. We are going to take out our
molten gallium and we are going to put it under a layer of
dilute sulphuric acid, about the same strength as battery acid,
so now we are going to make the acid. And to do that we
are going to dilute concentrated sulphuric acid with water. Now
it is always important to remember that when you dilute
acid you always put acid into water because the reaction can
be exothermic and we want to dissipate the heat in the water
so that it does not squirt up on our faces. The water was
room temperature, but if I hold the measuring cylinder here
it is actually very hot, it is maybe 40, 50, 60oC. So now before
we do our experiment we have got to allow it to cool.
We do that by simply running cold water outside the tube. So this is the gallium that we melted on our
hand, now let’s see what happens when we add the sulphuric
acid. Wow, did you see that? I did. What happened? So the shape of the ball or the lump of gallium
has changed, because we’ve changed it surface properties,
we’ve made gallium sulphate on the surface. The
surface tension has got higher and it has pulled up into a
nice ball, ok. So that’s the first step of the beating heart.
What we’ve seen is the gallium which was relaxed flat on the
surface has pulled up really quite sharply and that is the first
stage, or the in- beat of the heart, now we’ve got to make
the heart relax. So what we are going to do is use dichromate.
Dichromate is a fantastic oxidant and we are going to put
a small amount of it in and see what happens. So gallium, I realise now is named after France.
It was discovered by a Frenchman and its name comes
from the old name for France, Gaul. So what we are doing in this experiment, we
are changing the surface tension of the gallium, so these are
the forces that hold the liquid into a ball or allow it to
wet and flatten on the surface. So when the gallium is naked, ok?
It’s actually quite flat and it wets the surface. But when we
put it under sulphuric acid we form gallium sulphate on
the surface, this increases the surface tension and then pulls
the gallium so it is in a nice proud ball. What we then do is
we dribble a small amount of dichromate solution in, which removes
the sulphate from the surface and allows the gallium
to go flat, and if we add the required amount of dichromate
to the amount of acid then we can get the ball to
flatten and come back up, flatten and come back up, so it looks
like a beating heart. At the moment we are really quite excited
at Nottingham because Steve Liddle, my periodic videos colleague,
has made a new compound in which he has got an atom
of uranium to bond to an atom of gallium and this is exciting
because this is the first time that chemists have ever seen
a bond between these two atoms. It sort of turns a terracottery colour, it
is really a deep orangey brown, it is a bit like brick dust actually. Of course they are not naked uranium and naked
gallium but each of them have other things bonded to them
but it is the first time that anybody has seen a gallium-uranium
bond. It was one of those great moments you know,
being a chemist is like being on a rollercoaster,
you have some days when you wonder why am I doing this? And you
have fantastic days where you totally remember
why you are doing this. Because it is to be the first, to be
the first person who has ever made this particular, you know filling
the gap, whatever it is. It is a real thrill when you
are the first person to make a compound that does not exist out
in the galaxy and space, it has never existed on our planet
before but now we have made it for the first time. That’s
a really good thing to do We are really very excited! A new union has
been formed within the periodic table and it has been
done here at Nottingham.

**Transcript**:
Okay weíre going to be looking today at copper.
This is something looking back at the old video, itís a short video and there isnít
any experimentation in it so I thought weíd do something a bit practical. Copper is an element which people are very
familiar with because itís such a characteristic coloured metal, sort of reddish colour, though
it gets darker when oxide forms. But itís quite a soft metal and you can cut it quite
easily if you have a cutter like this which has steel blades, it will just dig into the
metal and it should just cut off. When you cut the metal you get this very nice, shiny,
fresh surface coloured just like copper. This is a ball of copper, copper metal. As
you might imagine itís a ball of metal so therefore it is quite dense and heavy. I mean
itís not as dense as, I think Steve told me this morning, that if we had a ball this
size of plutonium he told me it would weigh about a kilo and a half so he thought. So
itís not quite as heavy as that but still itís pretty heavy and dense. So this is a very, very nice sample of very
fine copper wire. So the copper wire here is, what width is this? This isÖ phew! Point
zero, Iím not even going toÖthatís just too small, so itís point one of a millimetre. So inside the beaker weíve got a solution
called sodium potassium tartrate, so no copper in there at the moment. Weíre going to introduce
that through this. This is a solution of copper sulphate. Copper is very popular for architectural use
because if you put it on the roofs of buildings it then reacts, particularly with carbon dioxide
in the air, to give a very nice green colour. First of all though we need to heat this to
about 50∞C, and to the sodium potassium tartrate we need to add some very weak, hydrogen
peroxide so this is only 3% hydrogen peroxide, so in it goes. We need to make sure they mix
together which is why thereís a stirring bar at the bottom there stirring away. Okay
so thatís stirring nicely, so as I said sodium potassium tartrate and hydrogen peroxide and
we need to add only one mill so thatís 1cm3 of the copper sulphate. The copper wire here is very, very high grade,
this is grade one copper wire and itís point one of a millimetre in diameter and you can
see the wonderful copperas lustre coming off the side there. What do you mean by grade one copper? So this is very high purity, this is like
99.99% copper, used for electronics fabrications and high quality research samples. Itís also used for electrical wiring, in
fact itís used so much that in a country like the UK each person has about 175 kilos
of copper associated with each person, in the piping, the wiring and so on. The problem
is that in many other countries, for example in China, people have very much less copper
associated with them, there isnít so much electrical wiring in rural parts of China.
And if everybody in China had the same amount of copper associated with them as those in
England or America or Canada there wouldnít be enough copper in all the known deposits
around the world. Copper is actually necessary for life, plants
and animals use copper. But actually you can have a disease called Wilsonís disease which
basically your body canít metabolise copper properly, itís actually an inherited disease. Ready? Whatís going on there is itís producing
a lot of gas so itís reacting to form a complex. And itís going from the potassium tartrate
complex there to well, its producing carbon dioxide and oxygen, mainly oxygen gas is being
produced which is why youíre seeing the fizzing. And itís become copper oxide, cuprous oxide
actually. Copper is found as a metal lying around in
various places in the world. I believe the name came from the island of Cyprus in the
middle of the Mediterranean, but copper has always been know even in pre-historic times
people found small amounts of copper. But as we use more and more copper people have
had to dig deeper and deeper mines. The mine in Chile where those very brave miners were
entombed for more than two months and then rescued was a copper mine. And to get the
metal that we need weíre going to have to go deeper and deeper and deeper into the earth. So what weíve got in there now is cuprous
oxide itís copper 1 oxide. And itís actually gone from what was a kind of clear see-through,
all right itís got a colour on it, but see-through solution to something thatís very cloudy.
So what weíve got there is a precipitate of copper oxide. Copper is very good because it has very high
thermal and electrical conductivity. What that means is that heat flows through it very
well and also electricity. If you make wires for electrical transmission out of copper,
when the electricity goes through them you get very much less heating than say if you
made the wires out of iron, and all this heating is of course lost energy. Youíd do even better
if you made the wires out of silver, but silver is too expensive. OK. So letís see if we can change this reaction
back. So at the moment it started out as being about 50∞C and itís shot up to about 63∞C,
I imagine it was even hotter than that when it originally changed colour. So weíll see
if we can take it back, Iíll put that back in. I actually bought this from the British Geological
Survey which is just down the road from here, I think it is in Keyworth I think. And I just
saw this and it was a Christmas present from my husband and I picked it out. I just think
itís really cool actually. What did your husband think of getting that
as a Christmas present? He knows what Iím like! So he buys these
things for me he knows Iím a bit of a magpie, I like to collect shiny things, and pretty
things, thatís my copper. So the colour is gradually changing, itís
gone from orange and now kind of a murky yellow. You can see itís kind of green now. And again
a gradual change, it wasnít a sudden spontaneous straight back to being blue and see-through,
you know clear. Now weíve got back to that clear solution. And again you can see on the
stirrer bar all the bubbles of the oxygen, little bit of C02 forming on that. Most organisms, you and me, use iron in our
blood to transport oxygen, thatís what makes our blood red. But in some sorts of crustaceans,
crabs and lobsters, theyíre different they use copper. They use a compound called hemocyanin,
itís a blue compound of copper. Cyanine is some classical word for blue. So they really
have blue blood. And these hemocyanin use two atoms of copper in each molecule to transport
the oxygen around the body of the crab or lobster. But itís not nearly as good as haemoglobin,
so if you start running after a crab or lobster it quickly gets tired compared to running
after a rabbit or something like that, which can keep going faster than you can.

So here we have a sample of cobalt. Now I
have got lots and lots of different samples of cobalt in my
drawer, so this is cobalt sponge. Cobalt is, in many ways, similar to iron.
It can form magnets. So this cobalt has been generated from a solution
and it’s been made in very, very finely dispersed so
it has a very large surface area. It’s very good for doing catalytic
reactions. The magnets that you use in colour televisions,
for the loud speakers, contain cobalt. You need to use
cobalt in the magnets in the colour television or the old
sort of colour television not the ones with LCD screens because
the magnetic fields from larger magnets could
affect the electron guns and so spoil the colours so you need
a very small magnet on your loud speaker or the colours
all go funny. Cobalt sponge absorbs lots and lots of gas
for perhaps hydrogenation. Many years ago, in the 1970s, when there was
a civil war in Africa in the region Katanga where cobalt
is mined, there was a shortage of cobalt and the production of
colour televisions stopped for some considerable time until the
production restarted. So you can see it flows in the bottle. So
I have another sample of cobalt and that is simply a foil.
So again that is a very nice malleable tin-type foil; very, very
good structures.

The thermite reaction which is the reaction
of aluminium and iron oxide is used to make iron and because
aluminium has much stronger bonds to oxygen than iron that
the reaction produces an enormous amount of heat and you
can use this for welding pieces of metals together. So this is a thermite mixture, it is a mixture
of iron oxide and aluminium powder and we are going to do some
redox chemistry and we are going to generate some
molten iron which will hopefully stream from the bottom
of the flower pot. So here you can see the black particles
of the iron oxide and the silver particles are the aluminium
powder. So we get some heat on this and we start an instantaneous
redox reaction so the aluminium and the iron oxide
swap oxygens so the aluminium will become oxidised and
the iron will become reduced hopefully we will generate
a lot of molten iron which should come from the bottom of
the test tube … of the flower pot. Alright! Right. Now there is a story about students in Berkley
that some students, or group of students, decided to
do a practical joke on a tram of the sort that has one door where
you go in and another when you go out. So a big group of
students queued onto the tram and got into the front and there
were enough of them so they could actually come out at
the end at the other door and form a loop so they were just
going round and round and round so the tram could not
leave because they were just more and more people getting
on. We’re going to run out of tape. And while they were doing this, other students
went down under the tram and set off two thermite reactions
and welded the metal wheels of the tram to the steel
rails so that when the tram tried to leave, when the students
eventually stopped going round and round, it was firmly welded
to the tracks and could not move at all. It’s gone out. Tell us about what is going on mate! So instantly the thermite reaction starts
and you can see that it’s so hot that it burnt a whole through
the bottom of that terracotta flower pot. But if we go in close
now Brady, you can see all that really quite nice molten
iron. Now that is so hot that the iron itself has melted and it
has formed this really quite big goo in the bottom on the
sand. Do you encourage these sorts of practical
jokes? No, no, no, no ,no, our students are far more
responsible. So as soon as the fire work, or the sparkler,
hit the top of the thermite reaction, in the top of here, it
started obviously, instantaneous redox reaction. So this is where
the metals were fighting for the oxygen, the aluminium
won that battle and the aluminium came out of this reaction
as aluminium oxide. The iron was reduced and we can see
that now in the bottom which is really hot so I am not going
to get too close but you can see all of this really, really
hot iron. The iron was molten, it dribbled out through the bottom
of the flower pot and it is now cooling. It didn’t dribble out of the bottom of the
flower pot. Well it smashed its way out of the flower
pot. Well you can say that iron is in my blood,
it is in your blood as well. It is iron that gives haemoglobin
the red pigment in your blood, its red colour. So the reaction we saw was about 5 minutes
ago and the iron that was generated is still glowing red hot
and you can see it has fused itself to the bottom half of the
flower pot, which it broke in its tumultuous step forward. It is an absolutely essential element to life,
except for crabs which use copper but you will have to hear
about that later. So iron is a really, really abundant metal
which is used in lots and lots of structural material, so you get
to see lots of pieces of iron around, some of the racking
and even in fact some of these pieces of equipment have got
high iron content. They have got other elements in them
to form alloys like stainless steel. I have an extremely long standing interest
in its chemistry and in particular, I made one compound of
iron so called iron tetracarbonyl which had 4 groups round it
and everybody had expected that it would have a shape like one
of these. Shaped with tetrahedron like that whereas, in fact,
it had a much more irregular shape, the 4 groups were arranged
like this, and so every since this, every time I hear
the word iron I get quite excited. So this is iron wire, ok, and as you can it
is a very small wire. It is 0.2 in diameter and you can see the
shiny material underneath is iron that has not undergone
oxidation so this is where it has been protected from the oxygen
in the air now if we look at the iron at the top we can see
that this looks really familiar especially because it looks like
some of the rust which we can see at the bottom of some of our cars.
So here is some iron oxide on top of the iron. The very first chemical experiment I did the
chemical reaction was with iron and I think the same is true
for many generations of school children. I heated up
iron and sulphur together and made iron sulphide sort of blackish
solid but then we put acid on it and got a terrible
smell of bad eggs and this was my introduction to chemistry
and I really loved it.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about iron dioxide minerals, specifically magnetite and haematite. Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 mentions iron and another metal (copper) used by crabs, but it does not directly relate to iron dioxide minerals.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2, which mentions iron oxide, but it does not specifically mention magnetite and haematite.

Therefore, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 2, but with a low confidence level, as it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The thermite reaction which is the reaction
of aluminium and iron oxide is used to make iron and because
aluminium has much stronger bonds to oxygen than iron that
the reaction produces an enormous amount of heat and you
can use this for welding pieces of metals together. So this is a thermite mixture, it is a mixture
of iron oxide and aluminium powder and we are going to do some
redox chemistry and we are going to generate some
molten iron which will hopefully stream from the bottom
of the flower pot. So here you can see the black particles
of the iron oxide and the silver particles are the aluminium
powder. So we get some heat on this and we start an instantaneous
redox reaction so the aluminium and the iron oxide
swap oxygens so the aluminium will become oxidised and
the iron will become reduced hopefully we will generate
a lot of molten iron which should come from the bottom of
the test tube … of the flower pot. Alright! Right. Now there is a story about students in Berkley

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 2: What happens during the thermite reaction between aluminium and iron oxide?

However, the options provided in Question 2 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, I can suggest a generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content.

A more suitable match would be Question 8: What is the result of the thermite reaction in the experiment with the flower pot? Options: A. The iron is oxidized, B. The iron is reduced, C. The iron is melted and fused to the flower pot, D. The iron is turned into iron oxide.

Although the options in Question 8 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (C. Aluminium oxide and iron) can be inferred from the correct option in Question 8 (B. The iron is reduced), as the reduction of iron implies the formation of aluminium oxide.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that best matches the ground truth MCQ based solely on the provided options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say Question 2 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
Two or three days ago, I got a letter from
one of our fans and it’s different from any other letter that we have ever had, because
this fan, Young, has attached to it a sample of an element and what’s more it is an element
that I had never seen. It’s scandium. It’s only a small piece
but according to my colleague Steve, it’s a very expensive element, so this might be
quite valuable, and scandium is a really interesting element, much more interesting than I realised,
when I first talked about it on the video. Scandium is an element which chemists usually
ignore, I have never used scandium in any of my research. It was one of the elements that Mendeleev
predicted ought to exist when he first devised the periodic table, when he made it there
were lots of elements which were not known, but what he did was to predict that there
were holes in various places where he felt that there ought to be an element and because
obviously these elements did not have names, he called them Ekea boron or Ekea aluminium
or Ekea silicon meaning underneath those elements. And the triumph of the periodic table was
that people actually discovered these elements. And the first one that was discovered was
the element Gallium (Ekea Aluminium) and the second one was Ekea Boron which is scandium.
Now you might think that it is a bit surprising because if you look at a modern periodic table,
scandium and boron are really quite a long way apart but in the original way that Medeleev
started the periodic table when he wrote it down first, scandium and boron came very close
together because both of them, have three electrons in their outer shell which makes
their chemistry quite similar. Of course Medeleev did not know about electrons, but he guessed
from looking at titanium which has four electrons and calcium which has two that he thought
there was something missing and what is also interesting about these three elements that
he predicted is that they all ended up with names of countries. There was gallium that
was named after France, from the latin word for France. Scandium that was named after,
well perhaps not a country but a region, Scandinavia, and then germanium, that was named after Germany. The first time that an element was discovered,
when gallium was discovered, people said well it was just luck, but when scandium was discovered,
they really began to take Mendeleev pretty seriously, and by the time germanium was discovered
they really all decided that Mendeleev was right. Scandium, because it is an uncommon
element, is one where people don’t know much about the chemistry. I have never really
done any research in this area but like many elements suddenly there comes a time where
they become really quite popular and topical and now is the time for scandium and the reason
is that scandium is a really light metal. Its density is slightly less than 4, that’s
4 grams per cubic centimetre and that is very much lighter than most metals. Copper is nearly
10 and lead and gold are close to 20, so this is really very light. So why should metals
be important if they are light, and that’s, the reason is sometimes you want to use a
metal, but you don’t want the object you make to be very heavy and so for example titanium
which is very light, is used for making everything from golf clubs to jet fighter planes, where
you want it to be really light either so that you can swing it fast or fly fast. For scandium
the reasons are rather different, people are now thinking about using hydrogen, to power
cars, to use hydrogen gas, to use hydrogen gas as the fuel to power cars, but what they
want to do is to store the hydrogen, in the equivalent of the petrol tank. You can’t
just pressurise the hydrogen as in a gas cylinder because the container would be so heavy, that
your car would be like a military tank it would be so heavy. So what they want to try
and do is produce a chemical compound, which is a bit like a sponge that will absorb the
hydrogen and then for example if you warm it gently they hydrogen will come out, and
it is here that you want the metal to be light because you want this material that you are
using to store hydrogen not to weigh very much. Because you have got to cart it around
in your car all the time, and scandium compounds are now looking really quite promising, for
storage of hydrogen, and the idea is that rather like a molecular model kit, where you
have balls joined with sticks, you can use organic compounds, those of carbon and hydrogen
with a little oxygen, like sticks to join together scandium atoms, and produce a structure
which has a lot of holes in it and then the hydrogen can go into those holes and be stored
without needing an enormous pressure. Sounds like an incredibly complicated way
to make a fuel tank. It is quite complicated but on the other hand,
if it works, you don’t need to understand the chemistry. You just add the hydrogen to
your tank and away you go. How can you have got to your ripe old age
as a chemist and never seen scandium? Well, chemists very often use compounds, salts
of metals, but it’s not too often that you use the metal itself and salts because they
don’t have to be purified and so on quite as much as the metals are easier to get, they
are not as expensive and so there are lots of the elements which I haven’t seen, but
I am really quite pleased with this sample of scandium, so when I am finished I am going
to frame it and hang it on my wall. So we have one of my students who works with
one of my colleagues, Martin Schroder and the student, has done his whole project, three
year project, on the chemistry of scandium, so when I got this letter I asked him: Have
you ever seen scandium? And he hadn’t, he had never seen the metal, so he was really
quite excited to see John’s letter.

**Transcript**:
Two or three days ago, I got a letter from
one of our fans and it’s different from any other letter that we have ever had, because
this fan, Young, has attached to it a sample of an element and what’s more it is an element
that I had never seen. It’s scandium. It’s only a small piece
but according to my colleague Steve, it’s a very expensive element, so this might be
quite valuable, and scandium is a really interesting element, much more interesting than I realised,
when I first talked about it on the video. Scandium is an element which chemists usually
ignore, I have never used scandium in any of my research. It was one of the elements that Mendeleev
predicted ought to exist when he first devised the periodic table, when he made it there
were lots of elements which were not known, but what he did was to predict that there
were holes in various places where he felt that there ought to be an element and because
obviously these elements did not have names, he called them Ekea boron or Ekea aluminium
or Ekea silicon meaning underneath those elements. And the triumph of the periodic table was
that people actually discovered these elements. And the first one that was discovered was
the element Gallium (Ekea Aluminium) and the second one was Ekea Boron which is scandium.
Now you might think that it is a bit surprising because if you look at a modern periodic table,
scandium and boron are really quite a long way apart but in the original way that Medeleev
started the periodic table when he wrote it down first, scandium and boron came very close
together because both of them, have three electrons in their outer shell which makes
their chemistry quite similar. Of course Medeleev did not know about electrons, but he guessed
from looking at titanium which has four electrons and calcium which has two that he thought
there was something missing and what is also interesting about these three elements that
he predicted is that they all ended up with names of countries. There was gallium that
was named after France, from the latin word for France. Scandium that was named after,
well perhaps not a country but a region, Scandinavia, and then germanium, that was named after Germany. The first time that an element was discovered,
when gallium was discovered, people said well it was just luck, but when scandium was discovered,
they really began to take Mendeleev pretty seriously, and by the time germanium was discovered
they really all decided that Mendeleev was right. Scandium, because it is an uncommon
element, is one where people don’t know much about the chemistry. I have never really
done any research in this area but like many elements suddenly there comes a time where
they become really quite popular and topical and now is the time for scandium and the reason
is that scandium is a really light metal. Its density is slightly less than 4, that’s
4 grams per cubic centimetre and that is very much lighter than most metals. Copper is nearly
10 and lead and gold are close to 20, so this is really very light. So why should metals
be important if they are light, and that’s, the reason is sometimes you want to use a
metal, but you don’t want the object you make to be very heavy and so for example titanium
which is very light, is used for making everything from golf clubs to jet fighter planes, where
you want it to be really light either so that you can swing it fast or fly fast. For scandium
the reasons are rather different, people are now thinking about using hydrogen, to power
cars, to use hydrogen gas, to use hydrogen gas as the fuel to power cars, but what they
want to do is to store the hydrogen, in the equivalent of the petrol tank. You can’t
just pressurise the hydrogen as in a gas cylinder because the container would be so heavy, that
your car would be like a military tank it would be so heavy. So what they want to try
and do is produce a chemical compound, which is a bit like a sponge that will absorb the
hydrogen and then for example if you warm it gently they hydrogen will come out, and
it is here that you want the metal to be light because you want this material that you are
using to store hydrogen not to weigh very much. Because you have got to cart it around
in your car all the time, and scandium compounds are now looking really quite promising, for
storage of hydrogen, and the idea is that rather like a molecular model kit, where you
have balls joined with sticks, you can use organic compounds, those of carbon and hydrogen
with a little oxygen, like sticks to join together scandium atoms, and produce a structure
which has a lot of holes in it and then the hydrogen can go into those holes and be stored
without needing an enormous pressure. Sounds like an incredibly complicated way
to make a fuel tank. It is quite complicated but on the other hand,
if it works, you don’t need to understand the chemistry. You just add the hydrogen to
your tank and away you go. How can you have got to your ripe old age
as a chemist and never seen scandium? Well, chemists very often use compounds, salts
of metals, but it’s not too often that you use the metal itself and salts because they
don’t have to be purified and so on quite as much as the metals are easier to get, they
are not as expensive and so there are lots of the elements which I haven’t seen, but
I am really quite pleased with this sample of scandium, so when I am finished I am going
to frame it and hang it on my wall. So we have one of my students who works with
one of my colleagues, Martin Schroder and the student, has done his whole project, three
year project, on the chemistry of scandium, so when I got this letter I asked him: Have
you ever seen scandium? And he hadn’t, he had never seen the metal, so he was really
quite excited to see John’s letter.

**Transcript**:
So this sample, it’s a very, very interesting
sample; it’s arsenic. So this is quality arsenic. So arsenic used to much more common in the
community than it is nowadays. It was used as a pigment in the nineteenth century for
green wallpaper contained copper arsenite, because there weren’t any other good green
pigments to make the wallpaper. And when the rooms were damp, Victorians didn’t like
opening the windows in their rooms, then mould would grow on the wall. And because arsenic
is poisonous to most life forms the mould would convert the arsenic into a volatile
compound, trimethylarsine, and the trimethylarsine went into the air and several people were
killed by the arsenic coming from their wall paper. Now arsenic as we know is very toxic and there
have been a number of very high profile and very famous cases of people that have poisoned
perhaps their partners or their business partners using arsenic. Okay, so I’m going to very
carefully take this vial out. He says very carefully then knocks it really hard. Arsenic was also used quite widely by people
to dispose of husbands, wives, lovers. Though now it is much less common. It is used in
the electronics industry for getting electronic properties for making transistors. And also
it is still sometimes used for medication for feeding to livestock. It is only quite
recently that the use of arsenic has been banned as an additive to chicken feed in the
United States. So here you see the arsenic powder okay. Now
this is a metallic very dark metal, but I’m not going to open this because like I said
it’s very, very toxic. It’s a very dark metallic sample, you can see a very fine powder
in the bottom of this vial. Now I’m going to put this back in before I get any on my
skin because it’s a very toxic material and I don’t want to expose myself.

**Transcript**:
Germanium is the first element in the periodic
table, beginning at hydrogen, that’s named after
a country: it is named after Germany. There are other elements
named after France and Poland and America but we will
come to those later. One of the things about Germanium and what
really makes it important in the periodic table is that this
is one of the elements which was unknown when Mendeleev
constructed the periodic table and he predicted its existence
and when it was found it had many of the properties that
he had predicted based on the change in properties
as you go down and across the periodic table. So this is a small sample of germanium, named
after Germany, so you can see the wonderful shiny
surfaces. Germanium is used quite widely as a so-called
semi- conducting material. If you look at it in
visible light it looks like a metal. Germanium na, na, n-na na. I have used germanium mirrors in some of my
experiments. The lasers that I used when I was younger
had a germanium mirror that let the light out at the front
of it and germanium is used quite widely in electronics. This is quite a nice piece of germanium. Unfortunately
I broke it somewhat earlier in my career, but you
can see very nicely how this material looks like a piece of metal
but on the other hand if you shine infrared light through it,
it’s transparent so the infrared light will through but visible
light doesn’t.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Question 1: What is the origin of the name of the element Germanium? Options: A. It was named after a famous scientist., B. It was named after a country: Germany., C. It was named after a concept in physics., D. It was named after a mineral. Correct Option: None
Question 2: Who predicted the existence of Germanium when constructing the periodic table? Options: A. Dmitri Mendeleev, B. Louis Pasteur, C. Marie Curie, D. Albert Einstein Correct Option: None
Question 3: What type of material is Germanium used as? Options: A. A highly conductive material, B. A semi-conducting material, C. A non-conductive material, D. A superconducting material Correct Option: None
Question 4: What happens when visible light is shone through Germanium? Options: A. It is completely absorbed, B. It passes through, C. It is reflected back, D. It doesn’t pass through Correct Option: None

That's what we like to see...haha Have this one handy as well.... So Zinc again is an abundant metal but it's a metal that we all need for life, it's part of enzymes and it's part of of many many biologically mediated processes. I don't know what else to say about Zinc it's a pretty boring metal.  It really is a boring metal. - Now I understand what my collegue said thinks bit boring. This isn't always the case and when you combine it with some other elements, it can get quite frisky, as you'll see in a bit. - Zinc is a really soft metal, it's sort of  greyish in colour, it reacts very easily with acids to produce hydrogen. In fact it's the way that people make hydrogen in the lab, or used to.  Now they usually buy it in cylinders. - Zinc is often found on things like roofs as well, very very high quality roofing material, very slow to oxidise. - Zinc is used very widely as a coating on iron. So called galvanizing. You put a thin layer of Zinc  and the Zinc then corrodes instead of the Iron, so that it stops the Iron rusting, at least for quite a long time. You can see it on corrugated iron roofs, metal gates in the countryside and so on. So this is Diethylzinc, so it's C4H10Zn.  - Zinc is quite important biologically, and there are all sorts of enzymes in our bodies that use Zinc. And particularly one called carbonic anhydrase that catalyse at the reaction of CO2 and water and so without Zinc, none of us could survive. The delivery of the statement that Zinc is boring were greatly under anticipating the result of this experiment. Really, you've built it up now. That's what we like to see. Have this one handy as well. Let's give this a go. - I told you to fix the stuff. So who says zinc's boring? Shall we do it again? Wow...No I don't think Zinc is in the least bit boring. I don't think that most elements are interesting, but Zinc is interesting because it's in the same group as Cadmium and Mercury and Cadmium and Mercury are both pretty poisonous. But Zinc is  essential to life. If you don't have enough Zinc you can't smell things. There are all sorts of enzymes in your body and those of other creatures, that won't work without Zinc. So it's really good. You may be bored about it, but if you didn't have Zinc, you wouldn't even be able to be bored. www.periodicvideos.com . . . . . . . . . . . .

**Transcript**:
French fries are delicious. French fries with ketchup are a little slice of heaven. The problem is it's basically impossible to pour the exactly right amount. We're so used to pouring ketchup that we don't realize how weird its behavior is. Imagine a ketchup bottle filled with a straight up solid like steel. No amount of shaking would ever get the steel out. Now imagine that same bottle full of a liquid like water. That would pour like a dream. Ketchup, though, can't seem to make up its mind. Is it is a solid? Or a liquid? The answer is, it depends. The world's most common fluids like water, oils and alcohols respond to force linearly. If you push on them twice as hard, they move twice as fast. Sir Isaac Newton, of apple fame, first proposed this relationship, and so those fluids are called Newtonian fluids. Ketchup, though, is part of a merry band of linear rule breakers called Non-Newtonian fluids. Mayonnaise, toothpaste, blood, paint, peanut butter and lots of other fluids respond to force non-linearly. That is, their apparent thickness changes depending on how hard you push, or how long, or how fast. And ketchup is actually Non-Newtonian in two different ways. Way number one: the harder you push, the thinner ketchup seems to get. Below a certain pushing force, ketchup basically behaves like a solid. But once you pass that breaking point, it switches gears and becomes a thousand times thinner than it was before. Sound familiar right? Way number two: if you push with a force below the threshold force eventually, the ketchup will start to flow. In this case, time, not force, is the key to releasing ketchup from its glassy prison. Alright, so, why does ketchup act all weird? Well, it's made from tomatoes, pulverized, smashed, thrashed, utterly destroyed tomatoes. See these tiny particles? This is what remains of tomatoes cells after they go through the ketchup treatment. And the liquid around those particles? That's mostly water and some vinegar, sugar, and spices. When ketchup is just sitting around, the tomato particles are evenly and randomly distributed. Now, let's say you apply a weak force very quickly. The particles bump into each other, but can't get out of each other's way, so the ketchup doesn't flow. Now, let's say you apply a strong force very quickly. That extra force is enough to squish the tomato particles, so maybe instead of little spheres, they get smushed into little ellipses, and boom! Now you have enough space for one group of particles to get passed others and the ketchup flows. Now let's say you apply a very weak force but for a very long time. Turns out, we're not exactly sure what happens in this scenario. One possibility is that the tomato particles near the walls of the container slowly get bumped towards the middle, leaving the soup they were dissolved in, which remember is basically water, near the edges. That water serves as a lubricant betwen the glass bottle and the center plug of ketchup, and so the ketchup flows. Another possibility is that the particles slowly rearrange themselves into lots of small groups, which then flow past each other. Scientists who study fluid flows are still actively researching how ketchup and its merry friends work. Ketchup basically gets thinner the harder you push, but other substances, like oobleck or some natural peanut butters, actually get thicker the harder you push. Others can climb up rotating rods, or continue to pour themselves out of a beeker, once you get them started. From a physics perspective, though, ketchup is one of the more complicated mixtures out there. And as if that weren't enough, the balance of ingredients and the presence of natural thickeners like xanthan gum, which is also found in many fruit drinks and milkshakes, can mean that two different ketchups can behave completely differently. But most will show two telltale properties: sudden thinning at a threshold force, and more gradual thinning after a small force is applied for a long time. And that means you could get ketchup out of the bottle in two ways: either give it a series of long, slow languid shakes making sure you don't ever stop applying force, or you could hit the bottle once very, very hard. What the real pros do is keep the lid on, give the bottle a few short, sharp shakes to wake up all those tomato particles, and then take the lid off and do a nice controlled pour onto their heavenly fries.

Ketchup basically gets thinner the harder you push, but other substances, like oobleck or some natural peanut butters, actually get thicker the harder you push. Others can climb up rotating rods, or continue to pour themselves out of a beeker, once you get them started. From a physics perspective, though, ketchup is one of the more complicated mixtures out there. And as if that weren't enough, the balance of ingredients and the presence of natural thickeners like xanthan gum, which is also found in many fruit drinks and milkshakes, can mean that two different ketchups can behave completely differently. But most will show two telltale properties: sudden thinning at a threshold force, and more gradual thinning after a small force is applied for a long time. And that means you could get ketchup out of the bottle in two ways: either give it a series of long, slow languid shakes making sure you don't ever stop applying force, or you could hit the bottle once very, very hard. What the real pros do is keep the lid on, give the bottle a few short, sharp shakes to wake up all those tomato particles, and then take the lid off and do a nice controlled pour onto their heavenly fries.

**Transcript**:
French fries are delicious. French fries with ketchup are a little slice of heaven. The problem is it's basically impossible to pour the exactly right amount. We're so used to pouring ketchup that we don't realize how weird its behavior is. Imagine a ketchup bottle filled with a straight up solid like steel. No amount of shaking would ever get the steel out. Now imagine that same bottle full of a liquid like water. That would pour like a dream. Ketchup, though, can't seem to make up its mind. Is it is a solid? Or a liquid? The answer is, it depends. The world's most common fluids like water, oils and alcohols respond to force linearly. If you push on them twice as hard, they move twice as fast. Sir Isaac Newton, of apple fame, first proposed this relationship, and so those fluids are called Newtonian fluids. Ketchup, though, is part of a merry band of linear rule breakers called Non-Newtonian fluids. Mayonnaise, toothpaste, blood, paint, peanut butter and lots of other fluids respond to force non-linearly. That is, their apparent thickness changes depending on how hard you push, or how long, or how fast. And ketchup is actually Non-Newtonian in two different ways. Way number one: the harder you push, the thinner ketchup seems to get. Below a certain pushing force, ketchup basically behaves like a solid. But once you pass that breaking point, it switches gears and becomes a thousand times thinner than it was before. Sound familiar right? Way number two: if you push with a force below the threshold force eventually, the ketchup will start to flow. In this case, time, not force, is the key to releasing ketchup from its glassy prison. Alright, so, why does ketchup act all weird? Well, it's made from tomatoes, pulverized, smashed, thrashed, utterly destroyed tomatoes. See these tiny particles? This is what remains of tomatoes cells after they go through the ketchup treatment. And the liquid around those particles? That's mostly water and some vinegar, sugar, and spices. When ketchup is just sitting around, the tomato particles are evenly and randomly distributed. Now, let's say you apply a weak force very quickly. The particles bump into each other, but can't get out of each other's way, so the ketchup doesn't flow. Now, let's say you apply a strong force very quickly. That extra force is enough to squish the tomato particles, so maybe instead of little spheres, they get smushed into little ellipses, and boom! Now you have enough space for one group of particles to get passed others and the ketchup flows. Now let's say you apply a very weak force but for a very long time. Turns out, we're not exactly sure what happens in this scenario. One possibility is that the tomato particles near the walls of the container slowly get bumped towards the middle, leaving the soup they were dissolved in, which remember is basically water, near the edges. That water serves as a lubricant betwen the glass bottle and the center plug of ketchup, and so the ketchup flows. Another possibility is that the particles slowly rearrange themselves into lots of small groups, which then flow past each other. Scientists who study fluid flows are still actively researching how ketchup and its merry friends work.

**Transcript**:
so I want to take you on a trip to an alien world and it's not a trip that requires light-years of travel but it's to a place where it's defined by light so it's a little appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make life I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution but mostly I'm entranced by it since my first dive in a deep diving submersible when I went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays I've been a bioluminescence junky but I would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words and they were totally inadequate to the task I needed some way to share the experience directly and the first time I figured out that way was in this little single person submersible called deep Rover this next video clip you're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence and the first thing you're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across in front of the Sun a mesh screen will come into contact with the soft bodied creatures of the deep sea with the subs light switched off it is possible to see their bioluminescence the light produced when they collide with the mesh this is the first time that has ever been recorded so I recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible but just to try to prove that fact to you I brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration so if we get up the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible I have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it and you'll note there's no light coming from them right now either because they're dead or because I need to stir them up in some way for you to be able to see what bioluminescence really looks like Oh I spend most of my time working in the dark I'm used to that okay so that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate a single-celled alga so why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light well uses it to defend itself from its predators the flash is like a scream for help it's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and just like the alarm on your car or your house it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away it's a lot of animals that use this trick for example this black dragon fish it's got a light organ under its eye it's got a chin barbel it's got a lot of other light organs you can't see but you'll see them here in a minute so we'd have to chase this and the submersible for quite some time because the top speed of this fish is one not which was a top speed of the submersible but it was worth it because we caught in a symmetric capture device brought it up into the lab on the ship and then everything on this fish lights up it's unbelievable the light organs under the eyes are flashing that chin barbel is flashing it's got light organs on its belly that are flashing fin lights it's a scream for help it's meant to attract attention it's phenomenal and you normally don't get to see this because we've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets there's other ways you can defend yourself with light for example this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud this blinds or distracts the predator this little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this now it may look like a tasty morsel or a pig's head with wings but if it's attacked it puts out a barrage of light in fact a barrage of photon torpedoes I just barely got the lights out in time for you be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transept screen and then just glowing it's phenomenal so there's a lot of animals in the open ocean most of them that make light and we have a pretty good idea for most of them why they use it for finding food for attracting mates for defending against predators but when you get down at the bottom of the ocean that's where things get really strange and some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in Avatar but you don't have to travel to pandora to see them there are things like this this is a golden coral a bush it grows very slowly in fact it's thought that some of these are as much as 3,000 years old which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed the other reason is this amazing bush glows so if you brush up against it anyplace you brushed against it you get this twinkling Bluegreen light it's just breathtaking and you see things like this this looks like something out of a dr. Seuss book just all manner of creatures all over this thing and these are flight wrapping enemies now if you poke it it pulls in its tentacles but if you keep poking it it starts to produce light and it actually ends up looking like a galaxy it produces these strings of light presumably as some form of defense there are starfish that can make light and there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms this looks like a plant but it's actually an animal and it angers itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock so it can actually hold itself in very strong currents as you see here but if we collect it very gently and bring it up into the lab just squeeze it at the base of the stock it produces this light that propagates from the stem to the plume change in color as it goes from green to blue colorization and sound effects added for your viewing pleasure but we have no idea why it does that here's another one this is also a see pen it's got a brittle star hitching a ride it's a green saber of light and like the one you just saw it can produce these as bands of light so if I squeeze the bass the band's go from base to tip if I squeeze the tip they go from tip to base so what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle I'd be very interested in your theories about what that's about so there's a language of light in the deep ocean and we're just beginning to understand it and one way we're going about that is we're imitating a lot of these displays this is an optical lure that I've used we call it the electronic jellyfish it's just sixteen blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays and we view it with a camera system I developed called I in the sea that uses far red light that's invisible to most animals so it's unobtrusive so I just want to show you some of the responses that we've elicited from animals in the deep sea so the camera is black and white it's not high resolution and what you're seeing here is a bait box with a bunch of like the cockroaches of the ocean they're isopods all over it and right in the front is the electronic jellyfish and when it starts flashing it's just going to be one of the LEDs that's flashing very fast but as soon as it starts to flash and it's going to look big because it blooms on the camera I want you to look right here and it's something small there that responds we're talking to something it looks like a little string of pearls basically in fact three strings of pearls this was very consistent this is in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet we basically have a chat room going on here because once it gets started everybody's talking and I think this is actually a shrimp that's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water but the cool thing is we're talking to it we don't know what we're saying personally I think it's something sexy and then finally I want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world's first deep-sea webcam which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year we've only just begun to analyze all of this data this is going to be a glowing source first which is like bioluminescent bacteria and it is an optical cue that there's carrion on the bottom of the ocean so this scavenger comes in which is a giant sixgill shark and I can't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in because there's bait right there but if it had been following the odor plume it would have come in from the other direction and it does actually try to seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish that's a 12-foot long giant sixgill shark okay so this next one is from the webcam and it's going to be this pinwheel display and this is a burglar alarm and that was a Humboldt squid a juvenile Humboldt squid about three feet long this is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon but if it's a burglar alarm you wouldn't expect it to attack the jellyfish directly it's supposed to be attacking what's attacking the jellyfish but we did see a bunch of responses like this this guy's a little more contemplative hey wait a minute there's supposed to be something else there he's thinking about it but he's persistent he keeps coming back and then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more and thinks maybe if I come in from a different angle nope so we are starting to get a handle on this but only just the beginnings we need more eyes on the process so if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible by all means climb in and take the plunge this is something that should be on everybody's bucket list because we live on an ocean planet more than 90% 99% of the living space on our planet is ocean it's a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures alien life-forms that you don't have to travel to another planet to see but if you do take the plunge please remember to turn out the lights but I warn you it's addictive thank you

so I want to take you on a trip to an alien world and it's not a trip that requires light-years of travel but it's to a place where it's defined by light so it's a little appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make life I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution but mostly I'm entranced by it since my first dive in a deep diving submersible when I went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays I've been a bioluminescence junky but I would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words and they were totally inadequate to the task I needed some way to share the experience directly and the first time I figured out that way was in this little single person submersible called deep Rover this next video clip you're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence and the first thing you're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across in front of the Sun a mesh screen will come into contact with the soft bodied creatures of the deep sea with the subs light switched off it is possible to see their bioluminescence the light produced when they collide with the mesh this is the first time that has ever been recorded so I recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible but just to try to prove that fact to you I brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration so if we get up the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible I have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it and you'll note there's no light coming from them right now either because they're dead or because I need to stir them up in some way for you to be able to see what bioluminescence really looks like Oh I spend most of my time working in the dark I'm used to that okay so that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate a single-celled alga so why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light well uses it to defend itself from its predators the flash is like a scream for help it's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and just like the alarm on your car or your house it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away it's a lot of animals that use this trick for example this black dragon fish it's got a light organ under its eye it's got a chin barbel it's got a lot of other light organs you can't see but you'll see them here in a minute so we'd have to chase this and the submersible for quite some time because the top speed of this fish is one not which was a top speed of the submersible but it was worth it because we caught in a symmetric capture device brought it up into the lab on the ship and then everything on this fish lights up it's unbelievable the light organs under the eyes are flashing that chin barbel is flashing it's got light organs on its belly that are flashing fin lights it's a scream for help it's meant to attract attention it's phenomenal and you normally don't get to see this because we've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets there's other ways you can defend yourself with light for example this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud this blinds or distracts the predator this little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this now it may look like a tasty morsel or a pig's head with wings but if it's attacked it puts out a barrage of light in fact a barrage of photon torpedoes I just barely got the lights out in time for you be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transept screen and then just glowing it's phenomenal so there's a lot of animals in the open ocean most of them that make light and we have a pretty good idea for most of them why they use it for finding food for attracting mates for defending against predators but when you get down at the bottom of the ocean that's where things get really strange and some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in Avatar but you don't have to travel to pandora to see them there are things like this this is a golden coral a bush it grows very slowly in fact it's thought that some of these are as much as 3,000 years old which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed the other reason is this amazing bush glows so if you brush up against it anyplace you brushed against it you get this twinkling Bluegreen light it's just breathtaking and you see things like this this looks like something out of a dr.

**Transcript**:
Carbon is a fantastically important element. There are probably, far more molecules that contain carbon, than any other element. The reason why you can get so many carbon compounds, is that carbon atoms, form chains very, very easily. Sometimes
millions of atoms long. If you just have atoms that will form one or two bonds
then you can't build up huge numbers of molecules. If there's no limit to the number of
bonds you can make, You can make things that are really long. It's like the difference between a
lorry; a truck which can pull if you're lucky, one trailer or perhaps two and a
train where you can put as many wagons or carriages as you want. So you can get
really long train, so it's just the same with carbon. So carbon it's around us everywhere.
We're all carbon,  there are lots of carbon in us, in all the hydrocarbons within
our body. Lots of that structures
inside us and many many of the materials that we use every day. In fact the majority of us use carbon in
the form of fuels every day to get to work or to go home. Without carbon we
couldn't exist. You're carbon, I'm carbon, We have bones
made that of calcium. But the important parts of our brains contain largely
carbon. They contain nitrogen and oxygen and hydrogen as well, but carbon is the key. Carbon is one of the very few elements;
that has given rise to a whole area of chemistry. Organic chemistry; the
chemistry of carbon compounds, is almost a separate discipline from some of the
areas of chemistry and most of the molecules that we use for plastics, for
pharmaceutical products, for our food are all carbon compounds. Carbon is an
extremely common element but it comes in a number of different allotropes, so
different forms and this one here; this is actually some charcoal, which is just
simple carbon. It's very, very similar and very very in fresh into it to graphite.
You can find lumps of carbon lying around. This is a piece here, that I found on a
beach, on the northeast of England; it's a piece of coal. Its not absolutely
pure carbon, but it has a very high proportion of carbon and compared to
other stones, of this sort of size, it's really quite light more recently
people have discovered diamonds, and of course graphite which is the black
material that you get in pencils. People call them lead pencils but they actually
contain the form of carbon called graphite so carbon comes graphite, as diamond, and also as as buckyballs or fullerenes so the carbon here which is a bit like the
graphite; it is very amorphous and it's very very free-flowing so I'm going
to pour a little bit of carbon out onto the paper so you can see
so you can see its a very light powder and you can see that it's a very very
nice, easily maneuverable and a really easy workable material. The thing that's really exciting is that
in the last 20 years people have discovered new forms of carbon; now this is extraordinary! People have
known of carbon for thousands of years, even longer,  and suddenly in the last 20
years the number of different types of carbon has grown enormously. I have a colleague who is a specialist
in these new forms of carbon and I went and asked him for a model and he gave me
a whole suitcase of models. Let me show you. ... So, what did we get? First of all, this is a model of graphite. The materials in the middle of pencils and it consists of layers of rings, hexagonal rings of carbon atoms. That six carbon atoms; and they're joined
together in layers. Can you see here? There are purple bonds in
between them. You can see they're not very strong; one is
even broken here. Very recently in the last 10 years its been discovered that
using a piece of sellotape, you can pull off these layers; and make single sheets
of these carbon atoms. It's called graphene. The 2-2010
Nobel Prize for physics, was given to two scientists for discovering graphene,
There's this structure here; where each carbon atom is joined to 4 others, in this
sort of tetrahedral pattern. Tetrahedron is this group one in the
middle with four rounded, and this–is diamond; it's really very strong. Whichever way you squash it, it's strong. You can't peel off layers of diamond with a piece of sellotape. Diamonds are colorless; and to understand why, you have to understand; what gives rise to
color, and the color of anything my tie, anything are caused by electrons
in the molecules or material and they absorb energy and go from one level to
another. In diamond, there are bonds between all the carbon
atoms that use all the electrons. The electrons are very tightly bound and
none of them can change their energy state, so you get no absorption. At least in the
visible region of the spectrum. On the other hand with graphite, the
electrons are less strongly bound. In fact it conducts electricity and it's
black because the electrons will absorb all wavelengths of visible light right
from the blue to the red so that it looks black because none of the light is
reflected from it. Inside here we have the famous molecule, C60 like a football (soccer ball US)
60 carbon atoms and Ray has put a little one inside here but forget that for a
moment. So you can have this molecule C60 first
discovered in the late 1980's. and only isolated in the early 1990's and there is a very similar molecule which looks a bit more squashed
which is C70. Now these are also colored, but their color is rather different. Have
a look here. I've got two samples one of C60 and one
of C70 both of them dissolved up in the solvent toluene. So if you look here C70 is a sort of
reddish brown color and C60 in the solvent has a beautiful color. I call it purple, other people call it
magenta. Back to the box (suitcase) ... and in here, we have the final form of
carbon which are called nanotubes these are whole tubes; made up of
hexagons. You have two sorts one which is closed at the end and this one here
which is open rather like a basket. you can put things inside it the final
model is graphene this material that you can peel off graphite with a seller tape
sticky tape and the reason that people get so excited is first of all this is a
very thin material it's only one atom thick and you can
react the carbon atoms on here with all sorts
of different molecules you can make very strong materials you
can start making electronics carbon computers things like that many people believe that graphene is one
of the materials of the future this is one of and raised exhibits he uses it in exhibitions to measure
electrical conductivity to see if you take a piece of metal like this coin and
you put the two electrodes on there you can see it conducts electricity all the
lights light up and the needle goes across so he's got different samples this one here is coal and this is graphite so there's a track of this is a photo
and this is a track of coal between two metal electrodes and you can see if we
put the electrodes on here the coal doesn't conduct electricity at all however if we take the graphite and do
the same it conducts electricity not very well
but you can see you do get some electricity going through on this other

really well not quite as well as a metal but pretty close

**Transcript**:
Carbon is a fantastically important element. There are probably, far more molecules that contain carbon, than any other element. The reason why you can get so many carbon compounds, is that carbon atoms, form chains very, very easily. Sometimes
millions of atoms long. If you just have atoms that will form one or two bonds
then you can't build up huge numbers of molecules. If there's no limit to the number of
bonds you can make, You can make things that are really long. It's like the difference between a
lorry; a truck which can pull if you're lucky, one trailer or perhaps two and a
train where you can put as many wagons or carriages as you want. So you can get
really long train, so it's just the same with carbon. So carbon it's around us everywhere.
We're all carbon,  there are lots of carbon in us, in all the hydrocarbons within
our body. Lots of that structures
inside us and many many of the materials that we use every day. In fact the majority of us use carbon in
the form of fuels every day to get to work or to go home. Without carbon we
couldn't exist. You're carbon, I'm carbon, We have bones
made that of calcium. But the important parts of our brains contain largely
carbon. They contain nitrogen and oxygen and hydrogen as well, but carbon is the key. Carbon is one of the very few elements;
that has given rise to a whole area of chemistry. Organic chemistry; the
chemistry of carbon compounds, is almost a separate discipline from some of the
areas of chemistry and most of the molecules that we use for plastics, for
pharmaceutical products, for our food are all carbon compounds. Carbon is an
extremely common element but it comes in a number of different allotropes, so
different forms and this one here; this is actually some charcoal, which is just
simple carbon. It's very, very similar and very very in fresh into it to graphite.
You can find lumps of carbon lying around. This is a piece here, that I found on a
beach, on the northeast of England; it's a piece of coal. Its not absolutely
pure carbon, but it has a very high proportion of carbon and compared to
other stones, of this sort of size, it's really quite light more recently
people have discovered diamonds, and of course graphite which is the black
material that you get in pencils. People call them lead pencils but they actually
contain the form of carbon called graphite so carbon comes graphite, as diamond, and also as as buckyballs or fullerenes so the carbon here which is a bit like the
graphite; it is very amorphous and it's very very free-flowing so I'm going
to pour a little bit of carbon out onto the paper so you can see
so you can see its a very light powder and you can see that it's a very very
nice, easily maneuverable and a really easy workable material. The thing that's really exciting is that
in the last 20 years people have discovered new forms of carbon; now this is extraordinary! People have
known of carbon for thousands of years, even longer,  and suddenly in the last 20
years the number of different types of carbon has grown enormously. I have a colleague who is a specialist
in these new forms of carbon and I went and asked him for a model and he gave me
a whole suitcase of models. Let me show you. ... So, what did we get? First of all, this is a model of graphite. The materials in the middle of pencils and it consists of layers of rings, hexagonal rings of carbon atoms. That six carbon atoms; and they're joined
together in layers. Can you see here? There are purple bonds in
between them. You can see they're not very strong; one is
even broken here. Very recently in the last 10 years its been discovered that
using a piece of sellotape, you can pull off these layers; and make single sheets
of these carbon atoms. It's called graphene. The 2-2010
Nobel Prize for physics, was given to two scientists for discovering graphene,
There's this structure here; where each carbon atom is joined to 4 others, in this
sort of tetrahedral pattern. Tetrahedron is this group one in the
middle with four rounded, and this–is diamond; it's really very strong. Whichever way you squash it, it's strong. You can't peel off layers of diamond with a piece of sellotape. Diamonds are colorless; and to understand why, you have to understand; what gives rise to
color, and the color of anything my tie, anything are caused by electrons
in the molecules or material and they absorb energy and go from one level to
another. In diamond, there are bonds between all the carbon
atoms that use all the electrons. The electrons are very tightly bound and
none of them can change their energy state, so you get no absorption. At least in the
visible region of the spectrum. On the other hand with graphite, the
electrons are less strongly bound. In fact it conducts electricity and it's
black because the electrons will absorb all wavelengths of visible light right
from the blue to the red so that it looks black because none of the light is
reflected from it. Inside here we have the famous molecule, C60 like a football (soccer ball US)
60 carbon atoms and Ray has put a little one inside here but forget that for a
moment. So you can have this molecule C60 first
discovered in the late 1980's. and only isolated in the early 1990's and there is a very similar molecule which looks a bit more squashed
which is C70. Now these are also colored, but their color is rather different. Have
a look here. I've got two samples one of C60 and one
of C70 both of them dissolved up in the solvent toluene. So if you look here C70 is a sort of
reddish brown color and C60 in the solvent has a beautiful color. I call it purple, other people call it
magenta. Back to the box (suitcase) ... and in here, we have the final form of
carbon which are called nanotubes these are whole tubes; made up of
hexagons. You have two sorts one which is closed at the end and this one here
which is open rather like a basket. you can put things inside it the final
model is graphene this material that you can peel off graphite with a seller tape
sticky tape and the reason that people get so excited is first of all this is a
very thin material it's only one atom thick and you can
react the carbon atoms on here with all sorts
of different molecules you can make very strong materials you
can start making electronics carbon computers things like that many people believe that graphene is one
of the materials of the future this is one of and raised exhibits he uses it in exhibitions to measure
electrical conductivity to see if you take a piece of metal like this coin and
you put the two electrodes on there you can see it conducts electricity all the
lights light up and the needle goes across so he's got different samples this one here is coal and this is graphite so there's a track of this is a photo
and this is a track of coal between two metal electrodes and you can see if we
put the electrodes on here the coal doesn't conduct electricity at all however if we take the graphite and do
the same it conducts electricity not very well
but you can see you do get some electricity going through on this other

the electrons can't jump between one molecule and the other but when you come

**Transcript**:
And you can see that the phosphorus has oxidized
in the air and it’s taken some of the paper with it to generate a nice ‘P’ for phosphorus. So this is a sample of my favourite element,
this is phosphorus. Phosphorus is a very, very reactive element, especially this type
of phosphorus which is white phosphorus. Phosphorus itself, elemental phosphorus, exists as a
number of different allotropes, so a bit like carbon with diamond and graphite, and here
we have one of these allotropes; it’s white phosphorus. It exists as discrete molecules
of four phosphorus atoms connected like a pyramid, and those four phosphorus atoms are
really strained, really reactive and they want to really react with oxygen as quick
as they can. This is the sort that is used in phosphorus
bombs. It burns very easily and gives a very intense white light out of it. So instantaneously you can see that fantastic
oxidation reaction as the phosphorus reacts with the molecular oxygen in the gas inside
the flask. You can put it out quite easily by putting
water on it, provided that it hasn’t got too hot and the water will just evaporate. Very reactive form the other allotropes, black
and red phosphorus, are not as reactive and are much, much easier for us to handle. Then there’s red phosphorus which is very
much less reactive which is what is used in matches. It is used to make the heads of so-called
‘non-safety’ matches, which are the ones you can strike on any sort of material, on
bricks and so on, and they tend to be this rather red colour here. So the phosphorus, you’ll notice, that it’s
stored under water, and it’s stored under water to keep the oxygen and the atmosphere
away because it reacts very vigorously and can burn, hence the signs, it’s very, very
flammable. It’s so flammable in fact that it burns just with the heat of the skin. So
you can see a number of scars across my hands, these are all from playing with phosphorus
and doing reactions and experiments with phosphorus. Phosphorus is a very important point inside
your body. Some of you may have read Aldous Huxley’s book called ‘Brave New World’,
which when people died they were sent to the phosphorus reclamation plant. And each average
size person contains somewhat over a pound of phosphorus inside their bodies, and nowadays
people can use magnetic resonance imaging to look and see how the phosphorus is used
inside the body. So I’ve taken a small sample of my white
phosphorus and I’ve dissolved it in an organic solvent which is carbon disulphide, because
the P4 is molecular and it dissolves really quite nicely in this molecular solvent. So
now what we are going to do is we’re going to go outside and we’re going to put this
on a piece of filter paper and then let the carbon disulphide evaporate so we can see
the reaction of the phosphorus with the oxygen and the paper. And the average person produces inside their
body about 70 kilos a day of a molecule called ATP, adenosine triphosphate, which is the
energy producing molecule inside the body. Now you don’t keep 70 kilos inside you,
or you would explode, but you’re using it up all the time but in the course of the day
you synthesise nearly 70 kilos of this molecule. So as the carbon disulphide evaporates from
the paper, well there’s a couple of drips. And you can see that the phosphorus has oxidized
in the air and it’s taken some of the paper with it to generate a nice ‘P’ for phosphorus.

as they can. This is the sort that is used in phosphorus
bombs. It burns very easily and gives a very intense white light out of it. So instantaneously you can see that fantastic
oxidation reaction as the phosphorus reacts with the molecular oxygen in the gas inside
the flask. You can put it out quite easily by putting
water on it, provided that it hasn’t got too hot and the water will just evaporate. Very reactive form the other allotropes, black
and red phosphorus, are not as reactive and are much, much easier for us to handle. Then there’s red phosphorus which is very
much less reactive which is what is used in matches. It is used to make the heads of so-called
‘non-safety’ matches, which are the ones you can strike on any sort of material, on
bricks and so on, and they tend to be this rather red colour here. So the phosphorus, you’ll notice, that it’s
stored under water, and it’s stored under water to keep the oxygen and the atmosphere
away because it reacts very vigorously and can burn, hence the signs, it’s very, very
flammable. It’s so flammable in fact that it burns just with the heat of the skin. So
you can see a number of scars across my hands, these are all from playing with phosphorus
and doing reactions and experiments with phosphorus. Phosphorus is a very important point inside
your body. Some of you may have read Aldous Huxley’s book called ‘Brave New World’,
which when people died they were sent to the phosphorus reclamation plant. And each average
size person contains somewhat over a pound of phosphorus inside their bodies, and nowadays
people can use magnetic resonance imaging to look and see how the phosphorus is used
inside the body. So I’ve taken a small sample of my white
phosphorus and I’ve dissolved it in an organic solvent which is carbon disulphide, because
the P4 is molecular and it dissolves really quite nicely in this molecular solvent. So
now what we are going to do is we’re going to go outside and we’re going to put this
on a piece of filter paper and then let the carbon disulphide evaporate so we can see
the reaction of the phosphorus with the oxygen and the paper. And the average person produces inside their
body about 70 kilos a day of a molecule called ATP, adenosine triphosphate, which is the
energy producing molecule inside the body. Now you don’t keep 70 kilos inside you,
or you would explode, but you’re using it up all the time but in the course of the day
you synthesise nearly 70 kilos of this molecule. So as the carbon disulphide evaporates from
the paper, well there’s a couple of drips. And you can see that the phosphorus has oxidized
in the air and it’s taken some of the paper with it to generate a nice ‘P’ for phosphorus.

**Transcript**:
So here I’ve got a really nice sample of
silicon, alright? Ok. I’m going to take it out of the bottle…
of the… I’m going to have to wash my hands after this. So silicon is a very common element, it’s
particularly found in sand which is the oxide of silica; that’s
the compound of oxygen and silicon. It is also found in a variety of minerals
which contain silicon, oxygen and another metal which are known as
silicates. And silicates occur in an enormous number of different
minerals. It’s sort of the part of science that unless
you are a specialist you find quite boring but if you really go
into it like everything else it becomes really quite interesting. So this is a piece of polycrystalline silicon.
It’s a really quite fantastic element and it’s very often used,
or in fact it’s used very regularly to make electronic components.
All of the computers that we use and actually the camera
that you are recording me on now are based upon silicon
technology. Silicon is also extremely important and the
basis of most of the electronic devices we use: my watch, your
video camera, and also in computers. And if we look over
here, I have got here this is an example of a silicon wafer;
you can see at the back this is silicon. So the silicon is grown as a single crystal
from which we can make very highly-refined architectures on
silicon chips, but you see here we have a polycrystalline sample
so it is very pretty the way that it interacts with the
light and you can see the different grain sizes. So let me take it out. Did Martyn show you the single crystal, the
wafer? Yeah, he’s got a single chip, yeah, yeah. Cause if you can get the light coming off
it, you can get all sorts of different coloured affects. Here you can see, this is pure silicon on
the back and on the front, people have grown chips these are the
Pentium 4 chips for the computer, I think, I am not absolutely
sure but I think these are the chips and these are the connectors
on either side. So there are a whole lot of these chips
and they grow a large number of them at once. These are chopped
up and tested and the ones that worked are put into
computers and the ones that are no good are just chucked
and so this is a fantastically delicate piece of engineering
making these. This is so-called 20cm wafer. They now make silicon
chips on a 30cm wafer which is about this size and you
can get a large number more on them. If you get a single crystal of this silicon
structure, it can diffract the light and change the light so
that it diffracts and bends off at different angles so that you
get like a rainbow effect off it. It’s really quite beautiful. A compound of silicon, silicon nitride is
extremely tough and very light so it’s very difficult to break
and silicon nitride for example is used in the impellers in turbo
chargers in cars. So when you put your foot down on the accelerator
it will spin up very fast because it is very light but
it is very strong so it won’t very suddenly fall to bits as it is
revving up inside your engine. Right I must put that there because I want
to put that back in a bag.

**Transcript**:
So we're gonna go find some liquid Nitrogen. We keep it in a really large dewar tank at the back of the shop, so we're gonna go find that now.  So this is a dewar that we used to keep the liquid Nitrogen in within the building so it's much more convenient for us and our students to get it. So what we're gonna do now is we're gonna fill up our small dewar to carry the Nitrogen back to the lab. So you can probably hear it hissing and fizzing going into the bottle, and you can see all the Nitrogen evaporating off. Nitrogen exists as a gas. Molecules of N2. And it is interesting, because the bond between the two Nitrogen atoms is the strongest bond that you can get between any two atoms in the Periodic Table. Any two atoms that are the same. Sometimes, if you have two atoms that are different, the bond can be slightly stronger, but the NN triple bond is one of the strongest that you can have. So what we're doing is we're filling up the dewar with liquid Nitrogen so that we can take that back to our lab to do our next experiment. So many explosive compounds, things that you've heard of, like TNT and other explosives, all contain Nitrogen, which are isolated atoms, and when the explosion goes off the atoms come together and release energy. Nitrogen is used widely in laboratories, partly because it's not as reactive as Oxygen, so if you do an experiment in an atmosphere of Nitrogen you can avoid reactions that might occur with air. You can also use Nitrogen when it's liquified as a coolant. Liquid Nitrogen boils at -196 degrees Centigrade, 77 degrees absolute, and you can just hold it in a normal thermous flask. So this is a dewar of liquid Nitrogen, and you can see that the Nitrogen is evaporating from the top, coming out and frosting, coming down over the sides because it's a little bit more dense than the air. You can see it's heavily laden with ice, and you can see that the ice crystals are starting to grow on the top of the dewar here. It's very cold though, so we mustn't touch it for too long. So if we just tip some out on the floor, we can see that the Nitrogen itself will come out like a liquid, like pouring water,  but the interesting thing is, water, when I pour it on the floor it forms a puddle. It does nothing useful. In fact, it sort of gets in the way. But liquid Nitrogen, when I pour it on the floor, it forms these really quite nice bubbles, and they fly across  to the side of the room and take all the dust with them. Pretty cool. But if you put materials like rubber or flowers into liquid Nitrogen, instead of being soft and bendy they become really rigid, and you can smash them with a hammer. So you can see all of the bubbles forming on this steel tray now, and they're sweeping away all the dust quite nicely as they evaporate and move further afield. So Neil's got a piece of tubing, and it's really quite flexible tubing, you can see it's really floppy, and now he's gonna put it into the cryogenic liquid Nitrogen and freeze it, and see what happens to the rubber. But you see another interesting thing there is that the liquid Nitrogen is siphoning out through the tube, and that's a really good joke, because you can direct that siphon at someones trousers and freeze their legs. So I think that's enough, Neil, let's see if it's a bit harder. Wow, that shattered.  And there's quite a nice little operation that I've heard about, in which you can take the lens out of somebody's eye when they're suitably anaesthetized, and this lens can be frozen and then put on the lathe and you can change its shape so you get the right shape, and then you let it unfreeze, it goes soft again, and you pop it back into their eye. . . . . . . . . . . . .

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
So we're gonna go find some liquid Nitrogen. We keep it in a really large dewar tank at the back of the shop, so we're gonna go find that now.  So this is a dewar that we used to keep the liquid Nitrogen in within the building so it's much more convenient for us and our students to get it. So what we're gonna do now is we're gonna fill up our small dewar to carry the Nitrogen back to the lab. So you can probably hear it hissing and fizzing going into the bottle, and you can see all the Nitrogen evaporating off. Nitrogen exists as a gas. Molecules of N2. And it is interesting, because the bond between the two Nitrogen atoms is the strongest bond that you can get between any two atoms in the Periodic Table. Any two atoms that are the same. Sometimes, if you have two atoms that are different, the bond can be slightly stronger, but the NN triple bond is one of the strongest that you can have. So what we're doing is we're filling up the dewar with liquid Nitrogen so that we can take that back to our lab to do our next experiment. So many explosive compounds, things that you've heard of, like TNT and other explosives, all contain Nitrogen, which are isolated atoms, and when the explosion goes off the atoms come together and release energy. Nitrogen is used widely in laboratories, partly because it's not as reactive as Oxygen, so if you do an experiment in an atmosphere of Nitrogen you can avoid reactions that might occur with air. You can also use Nitrogen when it's liquified as a coolant. Liquid Nitrogen boils at -196 degrees Centigrade, 77 degrees absolute, and you can just hold it in a normal thermous flask. So this is a dewar of liquid Nitrogen, and you can see that the Nitrogen is evaporating from the top, coming out and frosting, coming down over the sides because it's a little bit more dense than the air. You can see it's heavily laden with ice, and you can see that the ice crystals are starting to grow on the top of the dewar here. It's very cold though, so we mustn't touch it for too long. So if we just tip some out on the floor, we can see that the Nitrogen itself will come out like a liquid, like pouring water,  but the interesting thing is, water, when I pour it on the floor it forms a puddle. It does nothing useful. In fact, it sort of gets in the way. But liquid Nitrogen, when I pour it on the floor, it forms these really quite nice bubbles, and they fly across  to the side of the room and take all the dust with them. Pretty cool. But if you put materials like rubber or flowers into liquid Nitrogen, instead of being soft and bendy they become really rigid, and you can smash them with a hammer. So you can see all of the bubbles forming on this steel tray now, and they're sweeping away all the dust quite nicely as they evaporate and move further afield. So Neil's got a piece of tubing, and it's really quite flexible tubing, you can see it's really floppy, and now he's gonna put it into the cryogenic liquid Nitrogen and freeze it, and see what happens to the rubber. But you see another interesting thing there is that the liquid Nitrogen is siphoning out through the tube, and that's a really good joke, because you can direct that siphon at someones trousers and freeze their legs. So I think that's enough, Neil, let's see if it's a bit harder. Wow, that shattered.  And there's quite a nice little operation that I've heard about, in which you can take the lens out of somebody's eye when they're suitably anaesthetized, and this lens can be frozen and then put on the lathe and you can change its shape so you get the right shape, and then you let it unfreeze, it goes soft again, and you pop it back into their eye. . . . . . . . . . . . .

So the blue one in the middle of this series
is argon, so again this is a very nice glass tube that we’ve had made
with a low pressure of argon inside. We’ve put a potential across from
the two ends, here and here, and this excites all the argon molecules inside
so you can see this wonderful characteristic eerie blue glow coming
off from the argon. Argon is one of the noble gases or so-called
rare gases. It’s not really quite so rare. It consists in really quite
a high percentage, nearly one percent of the atmosphere. If I look at the one in the middle I can see
lots and lots of lines in the blue and the green region and these are all
specific to the individual atoms that are in the tubes themselves. But it’s very un-reactive so early chemists
found it quite difficult to identify, in fact it was only Sir William
Ramsey that identified the argon in 1894 and he was in fact the first person in
Britain to win a Nobel Prize for chemistry. So if we turn off the power to this, we turn
off the potential and then we don’t excite the molecules so what we’d
see is just a clear glass tube with no visible sign of anything inside. And
only when we turn on the potential that we excite the molecules, so
they emit and give us these really quite wonderful colours.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Options: A. 1%, B. 5%, C. 15%, D. 51%

**Transcript**:
So Potassium metal is very reactive.  One of my colleagues who used to work with it, described it as evil.  So we've come out behind the chemistry department. In the open air. To try and do  a re-take of the Potassium video.  The last sample of Potassium was very very small, maybe 500mg.  It will react, it is so reactive that if you have it  in a box with Argon, so that it can't get Oxygen from anywhere, it will take the Oxygen out of paper. Which is, paper is a compound of Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen. And it can extract this.  It's a reactive element. It's used in our body all the time. We have like, lots of Potassium floating around. And we've got some samples here, about a gram, maybe a gram and a half of each. It's a pretty big chunk of Potassium this.  Ready? Yeah. Very satisfying reaction.  After completing the 100 meters dash... Like Sodium it'ss quite a low melting point metal. And if you mix Sodium and Potassium together, to make so called Sodium Potassium amalgam, it's called NaK, by those who work in the trade, Na for Sodium, K for Potassium. NaK is a liquid at room temperature. It looks a bit like Mercury. A silver liquid. It's very light. And I never played with it, but people say that if you try and drop it on the floor, it will burst into flames before it hits the floor, because it reacts with the water in the air. Today I'm going to show you how to make a Potassium mirror. We will just fish out a nice little bit of Potassium. It's stored under mineral oil, because it reacts with water over time.  So it's quite malleable stuff. It's a little bit like if you imagine cutting Blu Tac. It's quite soft.  And it starts you see, it's starting to go a little bit already. Tarnishing a wee bit. So we can just manipulate it like that, and we are gonna pop it into our ampule, and we are gonna evacuate it now. I'm gonna remove all  of the atmosphere, from this ampule.  OK, we've done that because the, the boiling point of Potassium under one atmosphere is over 700 degrees C. Which is pretty high. It's too high for the glass to tolerate. If I heated it up to that temperature the glass would start to soften, melt. So by evacuating it, we remove all of the atmosphere which is keeping the boiling point as high as it is. So it lowers the boiling point  much lower. So it starts to drop into the range of water.   OK so we are just going to the blue flame, which is the nice hot flame.  And we just keep on gently warming it. And at some point, it will melt. Just enough that you will start to see bubbles  of Potassium just jumping out of this thin oxide layer, which is coating it at the minute. Now it's starting to form. So the reason we do it like this is that we end up with a  large surface of Potassium, so it's excellent for  keeping our solvents dry.  So what we've got now, is we've got the ampule, and all the way up here, this is literally a mirror of very thin Potassium.  Potassium is very important. Our bodies contain quite  a lot of Potassium. And it's in all sorts of biological material. If you burn  garden rubbish, in the ash that you get in the end is Potassium, which is presumably why it's called Potash. So as Neil quite literally wets the wall, to get rid of all the un-reacted Potassium. Wicked.  One of my colleagues  who used to work with it, described it as evil.  Captions by www.SubPLY.com

**Transcript**:
Ok, so we take the top off. We add a match. The Barking Dog experiment was one of the
most famous experiments and favourite experiments that was done by
my former colleague, Colonel B.D. Shaw. So Neil and I are preparing for one of my
favourite reactions. Itís called the Barking Dog reaction. This is a reaction
which actually makes an element and weíre going to make some sulphur
today. So the reactionís quite cool. In the Barking Dog experiment you have a mixture
of the molecule carbon disulphide, CS2. Itís just like carbon
dioxide butÖwait a minute IímÖ So this is a test tube, a rather large test
tube, of laughing gas, N2O, and weíre going to use this to make some sulphur. So I have a model here. So itís CS2 which
has a carbon in the middle and sulphurs at either end. So it looks just like,
in a model, as a molecule of CO2, but it has sulphur there and there. And
this molecule, CS2, will react with laughing gas, N2O. So where are we going to do this now? In the dark somewhere. So essentially you are just using the laughing
gas as a sort of oxygen to burn this molecule. What we are actually going to do is generate
a lot of light. It used to be used as a flash, for cameras and for photography. What happens is you get a very bright emission
of a sort of bluish purple light, which in the old days was used for
taking photographs before people had flash-lamps on their cameras. They
would set this off and it would give a great flash of light which could
be used to take photographs. But because itís much slower
than a flash it makes people really have quite a surprised look and this
may well be why, in old photographs, people look so surprised because
"My god, this thing has gone off, Whoosh!" So weíre on the hunt for a very dark place. In the tube, as the reaction takes place it
generates heat. Ok, so into the small lecture theatre which
is vacant now. Itís quite nice because we can turn all the lights off and
make it a bit darker and see this reaction in its, sort of, best. So weíve managed to create a darker environment
so we can really see the benefits from this chemistry, and Neilís
put some water in the bottom of the tube. And weíre going to put about
6-8 millilitres of carbon disulphide into this tube, and a good mix
so you can be sure that we get all of that carbon disulphide going into the
later phase so that itíll react really quite quickly with all of that oxygen,
the N2O. As the flame goes down the tube it accelerates
because the reactionís going faster and faster so it gives this great
sort of ëwhoopí noise. Now then, that was a really, really energetic
reaction because the organic and the oxygen were all in the same
phase and the reaction got a lot faster. The noise it made got a lot
louder as it went down because of pressure. So what you can see in the tube
here is actually the result or the aim of our chemical reaction today
because we wanted to make some sulphur. So what weíve got here, coated
on the inside of this tube, is a thin layer of polymeric sulphur. So you
can see all this really quite nice sulphur coating the inside of the glass
flask itself. Now Iím really fortunate because Iím just going to go back
to my office and prepare a lecture and leave Neil to clean this. Thanks. What are you doing mate? Well Iíve just filled up my vessel with some
oxygen. So this is liquid oxygen which we made for an earlier demonstration,
and weíve just used it to drive off all of the non-combustible
nitrogen form inside this glass vessel. Well look at all that oxygen
floating around inside the bottom of that flask, thatís really cool.
All oscillating - a really nice experiment. Yeah this is a really quite crazy jar. Itís
a small amount of sulphur, or ësuphurí, that weíve decanted out and unfortunately
when we decanted it out we spelt the name wrong soÖ Whoís responsible for that? Err, itís aÖvery old friend of mine and
I couldnít possiblyÖgive you his identity as he would be really, really angry.
Wouldnít he, Neil? Yeah Iím saying nothing. And it wasnít Neil. It wasnít me. So here weíve got a small amount of sulphur
that we are going to put on the tip of this spoon. So you can see itís
starting to melt. Now with the top, so itís on fire and then weíll just
drop it into the flask. And you can see that that sulphurís burning really intensely
now, with a really quite beautiful flame. Itís generating a lot of
SO2, really smelly, which is why we are doing it inside this fume cupboard
and you can see this really rich intense blue flame as that sulphur is burning
in that excess oxygen in that atmosphere. Ok so this is actually a sort of geological
sample of sulphur. So you can see itís actually on the bottom, weíve actually
got a rock and the sulphur crystals have actually formed on top of it.
So actually, sulphur does occur naturally. I think itís been known
since ancient times so, you know, when sermons are being delivered, fire
and brimstone, was because hell is supposed to smell like sulphur,
which is brimstone. But actually sulphur itself doesnít actually
smell, but what you are smelling, the ësulphuryí smell, is actually oxidised
material and hydrogen sulphide. Well itís actually a mixture of sulphur and
sand that was picked up by one of my colleagues on his honeymoon, though
you see he was actually thinking about chemistry even on his honeymoon,
though I donít think he told his wife that. I have a feeling but I could wrong that I
bought this sample in Oxfordshire where I used to live and I think
itís actually from Brazil, though I could be wrong. So as we are using up all the sulphur now
the flame will die down until eventually it will go out. Cool, there you
go.

**Transcript**:
Magnesium is one of the lightest elements.
It’s right at the beginning of the period table and, in fact, it’s the first of the
light metals that you can actually use. Lithium and sodium react violently with water so you
can’t really use them as a metal and beryllium is fantastically poisonous so unless you are
using it in the lab where you can be sure that nobody is going to touch it, it’s useless,
so magnesium is the lightest metal you can use. So, for example, if you are trying to
make mobile phones that are really light, then you can make the frame of the mobile
phone out of magnesium. You can use it for laptops. There is a professor in Germany,
who has promised to send me a laptop frame made of magnesium, but it hasn’t arrived
yet. So another classroom classic. Normally comes
along in chemistry lesson number three I guess, time to combust a reactive metal in the air,
so the reactive metal we are going to look at is magnesium. The other thing that is good about magnesium
is that there is a lot of magnesium about in the world, so it is not an element that
is difficult to get. If you look at this periodic table here, which is from Barcelona so it
is in Catalan, the areas of these, each element are approximately the abundance in the world.
Some of the rarer elements have a slightly bigger squares than they should do so you
can read the letters, but you see magnesium here is pretty large, so magnesium and sodium
are pretty common, beryllium is much less common, and lithium is even less common than
that, so there is lots of magnesium. Magnesium is very light, it is very reactive,
very pliable metal, it is very nice, it is easily alloyed with things like aluminium
and other light metals to make very strong, very robust materials. Used in construction,
it’s used in high-performance components of cars. When I was a child when we got, had indigestion,
we were given ‘Milk of Magnesia’. Magnesium oxide in water which came in these really
nice blue bottles, sort of white looking liquid, didn’t taste very nice, but it was meant
to be good for you, I am not sure if it was. It is used in the hulls of ships, you know
like, warships, things like that, so incredibly strong, incredibly light but incredibly reactive
if you give it enough energy. So we are going to combust it in the oxygen and see what happens. Magnesium as you know, burns, and one of the
ways that magnesium used to be used was for photographic flashlights, and you use bulbs
like these which contain magnesium, inside a bulb filled with oxygen. And for each photograph
you had to put this on the top of the camera. So I’ve got one here that I have taken out. So, if you look at it, so much heat has been
produced by this tiny amount of magnesium, that it has melted the glass. So, let’s see what happens when we light
it. You can see, really fierce bright white light that classical glow, everyone has seen
this in the chemistry lab at school, fantastic reaction. It is one of the few metals which is meant
to burn in nitrogen. In theory you can take a piece of magnesium, set fire to it in air
so its burning well and then plunge it into nitrogen gas, and it should continue burning.
I have tried this experiment lots of times and it’s never worked. In fact for 25 years
I demonstrated this experiment to my lecture class when I was talking about nitrogen, and
every time, it didn’t work, and the students thought, the poor professor, he has been made
a fool of, it hasn’t worked and they didn’t know that it never worked and I would have
been more surprised if it had done, but it taught them a bit about the chemistry of nitrogen
and magnesium. Why did you keep doing it if it never worked? Because it is a really good experiment, because
it got such a good reaction from the audience. Because it went wrong? Yes! You were playing the fool on purpose? Yes! So this is magnesium metal, but the magnesium
metal here is not the ribbon which we normally see in perhaps, scientific labs or perhaps
in school labs, this is a very, very fine powder of magnesium, so what we are going
to do in a moment is bring on a really very powerful torch, a gas flame and we are going
to see what happens when we sprinkle a little of this material into the flame. Magnesium is also very important in all our
lives, because magnesium is found in the green pigments in the leaves of all plants, in chlorophyll.
Chlorophyll is an organic molecule, carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen and in the middle there
is an atom of magnesium, and it is chlorophyll which catches the sunlight and transfers it
eventually to cause the reaction of carbon dioxide and water to make all the sugars and
other things in the plant. If that didn’t happen none of us would be alive, because
we all rely either directly or indirectly on plants, to give us the energy to live. I don’t understand completely the mechanism
of photosynthesis, because the energy that is absorbed by one molecule, is transferred
to another and another one as it were along a chain, but the magnesium is very important,
if you don’t have magnesium there it is not nearly as efficient. Let’s light it again.

**Transcript**:
So Neil’s got a sample of sodium. Sodium
is a very reactive metal, it is stored under an oil to stop air or moisture getting on
it - stop it oxidising, stop it reacting - and as you can see it is a very soft metal, so
he is going to put his knife in and withdraw the lump of sodium, so there is about 2 kilos
of sodium here, it's a really quite large rod. So we are going to cut a small sample
of the sodium and we are going to see if we can explore some of its chemistry. Sodium is again a light metal, rather like
lithium and it has a, a melting point about 96 degrees. So the sodium is a very, very shiny metal
and as you can see as Neil cuts some off, you can see the quite nice shiny material.
It’s really quite beautiful. Reacts very, very quickly with air and also with water,
you form the oxide layer which is the white, or the hydroxide is the white crust on the
outside. And many of you will know that if you drop
sodium into water it reacts almost explosively. So we are going to go outside now, go get
some even bigger reactions, with the alkali metals. This is a dog bowl which is stoneware,
it is very hard, not likely to break, unless I drop it on my toes. This is sodium, the metal that we cut a minute
ago and you can see there is quite a substantial amount of the sodium, and we are going to
pop it into the water and see what we can do with the reaction. Ok? So here we have
a bowl full of water and maybe, oh, a gram of sodium? So let’s see what happens, see
what this reaction’s like. So it is reacting really, really quite quickly and really violently
with the water, and you can see it is fizzing around and it is generating lots and lots
of hydrogen gas. And see now the heat from the reaction is burning away all of that hydrogen
which is generating and you can see the orange sodium flame. That was um? That was good That is a bit of, a chunk of molten sodium
has come out of there mate. So, let’s burn that. Oh, it’s on your camera. Oh it is too! Sodium chloride is transparent through infrared
light and so here we have got a sheet of sodium chloride that has been stuck on to a glass
vessel so that you can have infrared light going through it. Now this is a broken one,
which my students have broken. Is that bit, have you got a, we need a needle
Neil, or a pair of tweezers. So you can see here that these windows have
been broken but you can see an interesting aspect of sodium chloride that when it breaks
it forms cracks that form at right angles. Why is that? This is related to the structure of the atoms
inside the crystal which are arranged in a sort of cubic arrangement. I have also got
quite a nice crystal of sodium chloride over here which I don’t know if you can see has
been turned into a table lamp. And if you switch it on it lights up. So this is just
a mass of natural sodium chloride from under the ground somewhere, probably in Cheshire
or somewhere else like this where they have large underground salt mines, deposits. Ok so we have got another lump of sodium,
and you can see it’s really nice and shiny. Ok? So we are going to pop that into that
big bucket of water. See what the chemical reaction is, ok? So here we go! So you can
see again, see the orange sodium spectrum as the sodium is getting excited as the hydrogen
is burning all that heat. Whoa! Exciting! That is brilliant. That is much better. So sodium and water, excellent reaction. That was great. I like sodium, because its symbol Na was the
nickname that my mother whose name was Ena used to use when she was a child, she was
known as Na, so whenever I see sodium in the formula, I sort of feel a sort of warm motherly
feeling from this.

it is very hard, not likely to break, unless I drop it on my toes. This is sodium, the metal that we cut a minute
ago and you can see there is quite a substantial amount of the sodium, and we are going to
pop it into the water and see what we can do with the reaction. Ok? So here we have
a bowl full of water and maybe, oh, a gram of sodium? So let’s see what happens, see
what this reaction’s like. So it is reacting really, really quite quickly and really violently
with the water, and you can see it is fizzing around and it is generating lots and lots
of hydrogen gas. And see now the heat from the reaction is burning away all of that hydrogen
which is generating and you can see the orange sodium flame. That was um? That was good That is a bit of, a chunk of molten sodium
has come out of there mate. So, let’s burn that. Oh, it’s on your camera. Oh it is too! Sodium chloride is transparent through infrared
light and so here we have got a sheet of sodium chloride that has been stuck on to a glass
vessel so that you can have infrared light going through it. Now this is a broken one,
which my students have broken. Is that bit, have you got a, we need a needle
Neil, or a pair of tweezers. So you can see here that these windows have
been broken but you can see an interesting aspect of sodium chloride that when it breaks
it forms cracks that form at right angles. Why is that? This is related to the structure of the atoms
inside the crystal which are arranged in a sort of cubic arrangement. I have also got
quite a nice crystal of sodium chloride over here which I don’t know if you can see has
been turned into a table lamp. And if you switch it on it lights up. So this is just
a mass of natural sodium chloride from under the ground somewhere, probably in Cheshire
or somewhere else like this where they have large underground salt mines, deposits. Ok so we have got another lump of sodium,
and you can see it’s really nice and shiny. Ok? So we are going to pop that into that
big bucket of water. See what the chemical reaction is, ok? So here we go! So you can
see again, see the orange sodium spectrum as the sodium is getting excited as the hydrogen
is burning all that heat. Whoa! Exciting! That is brilliant. That is much better. So sodium and water, excellent reaction. That was great. I like sodium, because its symbol Na was the
nickname that my mother whose name was Ena used to use when she was a child, she was
known as Na, so whenever I see sodium in the formula, I sort of feel a sort of warm motherly
feeling from this.

**Transcript**:
We've decided to make a new video about aluminium because it's a long time over five years since we made the first one and... we didn't say very much. Aluminium is a surprisingly abundand element. If you look at this periodic table here, where the area of the different elements gives you a rough idea of the abundance you can see that aluminium is one of the most abundant metals up there with sodium, magnesium and calcium. More aluminum than potassium; about the same or perhaps even more than iron. We're never going to run out of aluminium. The problem with aluminium is that you don't find aluminium metal in nature as a metal. It's always tied up with other compounds; mostly with oxygen, in clays. You know what clays are, the sort of muddy stuff that you get stuck on your shoes when it's raining. To get the aluminium out of the clay, that is, to break the aluminium/oxygen bonds, which are very strong; requires a lot of energy, which comes from electricity. So, making aluminium is very energy intensive. That's why people like to recycle aluminium because once you've got it, it's worth preserving; but it's fantastically important because aluminium is a very light metal. And it's often used as an alloy because the aluminium alloys are stronger than the aluminium itself, so, if you're using it for aircraft or some other use like that where you want to combine lightness with strength then the stronger you can make it, the better. But when it was first made, in the 19th century, isolated as a metal it was terrifically valuable and there are stories of the French Emperor serving his honored guests with aluminium plates or aluminium cutlery while the less important people had silver or gold; but those times have passed and now you can get cupcakes and things like that surrounded by foil of aluminium. Aluminium is a very good metal for making things because it has a very thin coating of aluminium oxide on the surface which prevents it [from] reacting with things. But as soon as that coating goes it becomes very reactive. Alfred Worden:
Hadley Base, do you read Houston? David Scott:
Yeah. Now, 5 by, Joe. Worden:
Okay. Worden:
And I guess we're standing by for your high-gain alignment per the checklist. Scott:
Okay, stand by. You may have seen our video where we put copper chloride in one of these cupcake holders... [First of all I'm going to dissolve some up and make a fairly concentrated solution. I'm going to place this here.] ...and what came out was this, or rather the copper chloride came out through the hole. [It starts boiling really quite nicely. Now, imagine I was doing this for my children who were quite small at that time, and... VOOSH!] And the aluminium was completely dissolved up forming aluminium chloride and copper metal. In my own research, aluminium is quite important; quite a lot of our equipment uses aluminium. Not so much for the high pressure tubing that we use because quite a lot of my reaserch involves high pressures but we use it for the metal blocks that we put round the tubing so that we can heat it up. Aluminium has a good electrical conductivity, and it's also easy to machine. This is a piece of equipment here where we have a tube going down the middle. You can see the diameter of the tube here. Around it is an aluminium block and an electrical heater. Now, this particular case there was an accident, or a mishap, because the thermocouple that was controlling the temperature of this fell out. So, the heater got hotter and hotter, and eventually, the aluminium melted and poured down here. And I think this is really beautiful. Well, fortunately, I was not in the lab or I would've got very angry with my students but I think when it happened it was quite exciting; this would have been glowing almost red because the melting point of aluminium is around 500 degrees centigrade. But then once it formed originally it was very shiny but quickly, it again developed the surface layer of aluminium oxide. If you have fine particles of Aluminium and blow them into a flame... ...then they will burn quite spectacularly and you form aluminium oxide. Now, on the face of it, aluminium oxide sounds a rather boring compound but it's really very useful and we use it quite a lot in our research in all sorts of different ways. It looks like a white powder. Not very exciting. But in our group this aluminium oxide has been a fantastic catalyst All sorts of reactions that we didn't expect have gone with this material. My students keep it in a bottle almost like a magic catalyst and I've only been given a little to show you. It acts as a solid acid which can be used at very high temperature and will get various acid-catalyzed reactions of organic compounds. It will make ethers, we have made various alkynes and a whole series of different compounds and my students still use it very much. If you melt the aluminium oxide, which we can't do here but can be done industrially, you can make single crystals which are transparent like glass and then you can grow a single crystal tube, like this one, which because it's a single crystal, it's terrifically strong. It's the defects that make something weak and so if you have just one crystal there are no defects and so it's very strong. So you can put a very high pressure inside this tube without it blowing up. Brady:
But you could make that tube out of metal, professor. Professor:
But,  if you have a metal then you can't see what's going on inside, and we're using these tubes for photochemical reactions. So, we take a light like this, and shine it on the chemicals going through the tube under high pressure and we can convert one chemical into another. We can do this very efficiently because the light is absorbed by the molecules that we want to react and so we dont waste the energy on everything else. And using LEDs, which are a very efficient light source, you can get a process that is very energy efficient and it all depends on having this sapphire tube. This is synthetic sapphire. The real sapphire, the gems, have impurities in them, of other metals, which give them the nice colors, particularly the blue. Princess Kate has a blue sapphire ring which belonged to her husband's mother, Princess Di, before her. And so, these are very valuable ones. But synthetic sapphire is also expensive but not in the same class as a natural gem. Brady:
What can nature do that the guys at the sapphire factory can't do? Professor:
Nature has time. The people who grow this will take hours or days or perhaps weeks to grow it. Nature can spend thousands or millions of years growing a particular gem and therefore they can heat it up and cool it down in natural surroundings, in volcanoes... or whatever far more slowly than people can afford to do industrially. There's a lot of argument whether you should call it aluminum or aluminium Now, there isn't a totally correct one because both forms are acceptable. But, all or nearly all chemists use aluminium because it's very important to use a standardized nomenclature right across the world. And I think aluminium sounds nicer. Student:
Hi professor, my question is is it aluminum or aluminium? 'Cause I want to know what to call my aluminium model. Apparantly, there was a decision in 1990 by IUPAC the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry that it should definately be called A L U M I N I U M but then they relented three years later and said you could use aluminum as well. But if you're a serious chemist you really need to say aluminium, because otherwise people won't find your papers, your publications, when they search because they'll almost certainly put an "i"' in the name. Aluminium is frequently used or used [to be] frequently used kkfor sauce pans, for cooking in because it's easy to make, easy to machine and particularly when people used electric stoves it was easy to make a flat bottom so that you got good contact between the electric element and the sauce pan. The problem with aluminium sauce pans is that if you're cooking some fairly acidic food, for example boiling lemons or rhubarb something like that which is quite acidic you can dissolve some of the aluminium and people got quite worried about getting aluminium in their food. Also, if you cook red cabbage, which is an indicator; blue for alkali, red for acid, then if you boil it in an aluminium sauce pan it goes blue. And earlier in my carreer I used a red cabbage together with a white one to make a Union Jack, a U.K. flag with a mixture of red and blue-red cabbage and the white from the white cabbage. Unfortionately, I've lost the photo; Brady is very cross with me. But it was quite fun cooking it in the kitchen. I did it once myself, but it was such a lot of work that the second time a got one of my students to do it.

But then once it formed originally it was very shiny but quickly, it again developed the surface layer of aluminium oxide. If you have fine particles of Aluminium and blow them into a flame... ...then they will burn quite spectacularly and you form aluminium oxide. Now, on the face of it, aluminium oxide sounds a rather boring compound but it's really very useful and we use it quite a lot in our research in all sorts of different ways. It looks like a white powder. Not very exciting. But in our group this aluminium oxide has been a fantastic catalyst All sorts of reactions that we didn't expect have gone with this material. My students keep it in a bottle almost like a magic catalyst and I've only been given a little to show you. It acts as a solid acid which can be used at very high temperature and will get various acid-catalyzed reactions of organic compounds. It will make ethers, we have made various alkynes and a whole series of different compounds and my students still use it very much. If you melt the aluminium oxide, which we can't do here but can be done industrially, you can make single crystals which are transparent like glass and then you can grow a single crystal tube, like this one, which because it's a single crystal, it's terrifically strong. It's the defects that make something weak and so if you have just one crystal there are no defects and so it's very strong. So you can put a very high pressure inside this tube without it blowing up. Brady:
But you could make that tube out of metal, professor. Professor:
But,  if you have a metal then you can't see what's going on inside, and we're using these tubes for photochemical reactions. So, we take a light like this, and shine it on the chemicals going through the tube under high pressure and we can convert one chemical into another. We can do this very efficiently because the light is absorbed by the molecules that we want to react and so we dont waste the energy on everything else. And using LEDs, which are a very efficient light source, you can get a process that is very energy efficient and it all depends on having this sapphire tube. This is synthetic sapphire. The real sapphire, the gems, have impurities in them, of other metals, which give them the nice colors, particularly the blue. Princess Kate has a blue sapphire ring which belonged to her husband's mother, Princess Di, before her. And so, these are very valuable ones. But synthetic sapphire is also expensive but not in the same class as a natural gem. Brady:
What can nature do that the guys at the sapphire factory can't do? Professor:
Nature has time. The people who grow this will take hours or days or perhaps weeks to grow it. Nature can spend thousands or millions of years growing a particular gem and therefore they can heat it up and cool it down in natural surroundings, in volcanoes... or whatever far more slowly than people can afford to do industrially. There's a lot of argument whether you should call it aluminum or aluminium Now, there isn't a totally correct one because both forms are acceptable. But, all or nearly all chemists use aluminium because it's very important to use a standardized nomenclature right across the world. And I think aluminium sounds nicer. Student:
Hi professor, my question is is it aluminum or aluminium? 'Cause I want to know what to call my aluminium model. Apparantly, there was a decision in 1990 by IUPAC the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry that it should definately be called A L U M I N I U M but then they relented three years later and said you could use aluminum as well. But if you're a serious chemist you really need to say aluminium, because otherwise people won't find your papers, your publications, when they search because they'll almost certainly put an "i"' in the name. Aluminium is frequently used or used [to be] frequently used kkfor sauce pans, for cooking in because it's easy to make, easy to machine and particularly when people used electric stoves it was easy to make a flat bottom so that you got good contact between the electric element and the sauce pan. The problem with aluminium sauce pans is that if you're cooking some fairly acidic food, for example boiling lemons or rhubarb something like that which is quite acidic you can dissolve some of the aluminium and people got quite worried about getting aluminium in their food. Also, if you cook red cabbage, which is an indicator; blue for alkali, red for acid, then if you boil it in an aluminium sauce pan it goes blue. And earlier in my carreer I used a red cabbage together with a white one to make a Union Jack, a U.K. flag with a mixture of red and blue-red cabbage and the white from the white cabbage. Unfortionately, I've lost the photo; Brady is very cross with me. But it was quite fun cooking it in the kitchen. I did it once myself, but it was such a lot of work that the second time a got one of my students to do it.

**Transcript**:
You're facing a giant bowl of energy packed Carbon Crunchies. One spoonful. Two. Three. Soon, you're powered up by the energy surge that comes from your meal. But how did that energy get into your bowl? Energy exists in the form of sugars made by the plant your cereal came from, like wheat or corn. As you can see, carbon is the chemical backbone, and plants get their fix of it in the form of carbon dioxide, CO2, from the air that we all breath. But how does a plant's energy factory, housed in the stroma of the chloroplast, turn a one carbon gas, like CO2, into a six carbon solid, like glucose? If you're thinking photosynthesis, you're right. But photosynthesis is divided into two steps. The first, which stores energy from the sun in the form of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. And the second, the Calvin cycle, that captures carbon and turns it into sugar. This second phase represents one of nature's most sustainable production lines. And so with that, welcome to world's most miniscule factory. The starting materials? A mix of CO2 molecules from the air, and preassembled molecules called ribulose biphosphate, or RuBP, each containing five carbons. The initiator? An industrious enzyme named rubisco that welds one carbon atom from a CO2 molecule with the RuBP chain to build an initial six carbon sequence. That rapidly splits into two shorter chains containing three carbons each and called phosphoglycerates, or PGAs, for short. Enter ATP, and another chemical called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, or just NADPH. ATP, working like a lubricant, delivers energy, while NADPH affixes one hydrogen to each of the PGA chains, changing them into molecules called glyceraldehyde 3 phosphates, or G3Ps. Glucose needs six carbons to form, made from two molecules of G3P, which incidentally have six carbons between them. So, sugar has just been manufactured, right? Not quite. The Calvin cycle works like a sustainable production line, meaning that those original RuBPs that kicked things off at the start, need to be recreated by reusing materials within the cycle now. But each RuBP needs five carbons and manufacturing glucose takes a whole six. Something doesn't add up. The answer lies in one phenomenal fact. While we've been focusing on this single production line, five others have been happening at the same time. With six conveyor belts moving in unison, there isn't just one carbon that gets soldered to one RuBP chain, but six carbons soldered to six RuBPs. That creates 12 G3P chains instead of just two, meaning that all together, 36 carbons exist: the precise number needed to manufacture sugar, and rebuild those RuBPs. Of the 12 G3Ps pooled together, two are siphoned off to form that energy rich six carbon glucose chain. The one fueling you via your breakfast. Success! But back on the manufacturing line, the byproducts of this sugar production are swiftly assembled to recreate those six RuBPs. That requires 30 carbons, the exact number contained by the remaining 10 G3PS. Now a molecular mix and match occurs. Two of the G3Ps are welded together forming a six carbon sequence. By adding a third G3P, a nine carbon chain is built. The first RuBP, made up of five carbons, is cast from this, leaving four carbons behind. But there's no wastage here. Those are soldered to a fourth G3P molecule, making a seven carbon chain. Added to a fifth G3P molecule, a ten carbon chain is created, enough now to craft two more RuBPs. With three full RuBPs recreated from five of the ten G3Ps, simply duplicating this process will renew the six RuBP chains needed to restart the cycle again. So the Calvin cycle generates the precise number of elements and processes required to keep this biochemical production line turning endlessly. And it's just one of the 100s of cycles present in nature. Why so many? Because if biological production processes were linear, they wouldn't be nearly as efficient or successful at using energy to manufacture the materials that nature relies upon, like sugar. Cycles create vital feedback loops that repeatedly reuse and rebuild ingredients crafting as much as possible out of the planet's available resources. Such as that sugar, built using raw sunlight and carbon converted in plant factories to become the energy that powers you and keeps the cycles revolving in your own life.

Of the 12 G3Ps pooled together, two are siphoned off to form that energy rich six carbon glucose chain. The one fueling you via your breakfast. Success! But back on the manufacturing line, the byproducts of this sugar production are swiftly assembled to recreate those six RuBPs. That requires 30 carbons, the exact number contained by the remaining 10 G3PS. Now a molecular mix and match occurs. Two of the G3Ps are welded together forming a six carbon sequence. By adding a third G3P, a nine carbon chain is built. The first RuBP, made up of five carbons, is cast from this, leaving four carbons behind. But there's no wastage here. Those are soldered to a fourth G3P molecule, making a seven carbon chain. Added to a fifth G3P molecule, a ten carbon chain is created, enough now to craft two more RuBPs. With three full RuBPs recreated from five of the ten G3Ps, simply duplicating this process will renew the six RuBP chains needed to restart the cycle again. So the Calvin cycle generates the precise number of elements and processes required to keep this biochemical production line turning endlessly. And it's just one of the 100s of cycles present in nature. Why so many? Because if biological production processes were linear, they wouldn't be nearly as efficient or successful at using energy to manufacture the materials that nature relies upon, like sugar. Cycles create vital feedback loops that repeatedly reuse and rebuild ingredients crafting as much as possible out of the planet's available resources. Such as that sugar, built using raw sunlight and carbon converted in plant factories to become the energy that powers you and keeps the cycles revolving in your own life.

**Transcript**:
You're facing a giant bowl of energy packed Carbon Crunchies. One spoonful. Two. Three. Soon, you're powered up by the energy surge that comes from your meal. But how did that energy get into your bowl? Energy exists in the form of sugars made by the plant your cereal came from, like wheat or corn. As you can see, carbon is the chemical backbone, and plants get their fix of it in the form of carbon dioxide, CO2, from the air that we all breath. But how does a plant's energy factory, housed in the stroma of the chloroplast, turn a one carbon gas, like CO2, into a six carbon solid, like glucose? If you're thinking photosynthesis, you're right. But photosynthesis is divided into two steps. The first, which stores energy from the sun in the form of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. And the second, the Calvin cycle, that captures carbon and turns it into sugar. This second phase represents one of nature's most sustainable production lines. And so with that, welcome to world's most miniscule factory. The starting materials? A mix of CO2 molecules from the air, and preassembled molecules called ribulose biphosphate, or RuBP, each containing five carbons. The initiator? An industrious enzyme named rubisco that welds one carbon atom from a CO2 molecule with the RuBP chain to build an initial six carbon sequence. That rapidly splits into two shorter chains containing three carbons each and called phosphoglycerates, or PGAs, for short. Enter ATP, and another chemical called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, or just NADPH. ATP, working like a lubricant, delivers energy, while NADPH affixes one hydrogen to each of the PGA chains, changing them into molecules called glyceraldehyde 3 phosphates, or G3Ps. Glucose needs six carbons to form, made from two molecules of G3P, which incidentally have six carbons between them. So, sugar has just been manufactured, right? Not quite. The Calvin cycle works like a sustainable production line, meaning that those original RuBPs that kicked things off at the start, need to be recreated by reusing materials within the cycle now. But each RuBP needs five carbons and manufacturing glucose takes a whole six. Something doesn't add up. The answer lies in one phenomenal fact. While we've been focusing on this single production line, five others have been happening at the same time. With six conveyor belts moving in unison, there isn't just one carbon that gets soldered to one RuBP chain, but six carbons soldered to six RuBPs. That creates 12 G3P chains instead of just two, meaning that all together, 36 carbons exist: the precise number needed to manufacture sugar, and rebuild those RuBPs. Of the 12 G3Ps pooled together, two are siphoned off to form that energy rich six carbon glucose chain. The one fueling you via your breakfast. Success! But back on the manufacturing line, the byproducts of this sugar production are swiftly assembled to recreate those six RuBPs.

Pick a card, any card. Actually, just pick up all of them and take a look. This standard 52-card deck has been used for centuries. Everyday, thousands just like it are shuffled in casinos all over the world, the order rearranged each time. And yet, every time you pick up a well-shuffled deck like this one, you are almost certainly holding an arrangement of cards that has never before existed in all of history. How can this be? The answer lies in how many different arrangements of 52 cards, or any objects, are possible. Now, 52 may not seem like such a high number, but let's start with an even smaller one. Say we have four people trying to sit in four numbered chairs. How many ways can they be seated? To start off, any of the four people can sit in the first chair. One this choice is made, only three people remain standing. After the second person sits down, only two people are left as candidates for the third chair. And after the third person has sat down, the last person standing has no choice but to sit in the fourth chair. If we manually write out all the possible arrangements, or permutations, it turns out that there are 24 ways that four people can be seated into four chairs, but when dealing with larger numbers, this can take quite a while. So let's see if there's a quicker way. Going from the beginning again, you can see that each of the four initial choices for the first chair leads to three more possible choices for the second chair, and each of those choices leads to two more for the third chair. So instead of counting each final scenario individually, we can multiply the number of choices for each chair: four times three times two times one to achieve the same result of 24. An interesting pattern emerges. We start with the number of objects we're arranging, four in this case, and multiply it by consecutively smaller integers until we reach one. This is an exciting discovery. So exciting that mathematicians have chosen to symbolize this kind of calculation, known as a factorial, with an exclamation mark. As a general rule, the factorial of any positive integer is calculated as the product of that same integer and all smaller integers down to one. In our simple example, the number of ways four people can be arranged into chairs is written as four factorial, which equals 24. So let's go back to our deck. Just as there were four factorial ways of arranging four people, there are 52 factorial ways of arranging 52 cards. Fortunately, we don't have to calculate this by hand. Just enter the function into a calculator, and it will show you that the number of possible arrangements is 8.07 x 10^67, or roughly eight followed by 67 zeros. Just how big is this number? Well, if a new permutation of 52 cards were written out every second starting 13.8 billion years ago, when the Big Bang is thought to have occurred, the writing would still be continuing today and for millions of years to come. In fact, there are more possible ways to arrange this simple deck of cards than there are atoms on Earth. So the next time it's your turn to shuffle, take a moment to remember that you're holding something that may have never before existed and may never exist again.

Pick a card, any card. Actually, just pick up all of them and take a look. This standard 52-card deck has been used for centuries. Everyday, thousands just like it are shuffled in casinos all over the world, the order rearranged each time. And yet, every time you pick up a well-shuffled deck like this one, you are almost certainly holding an arrangement of cards that has never before existed in all of history. How can this be? The answer lies in how many different arrangements of 52 cards, or any objects, are possible. Now, 52 may not seem like such a high number, but let's start with an even smaller one. Say we have four people trying to sit in four numbered chairs. How many ways can they be seated? To start off, any of the four people can sit in the first chair. One this choice is made, only three people remain standing. After the second person sits down, only two people are left as candidates for the third chair. And after the third person has sat down, the last person standing has no choice but to sit in the fourth chair. If we manually write out all the possible arrangements, or permutations, it turns out that there are 24 ways that four people can be seated into four chairs, but when dealing with larger numbers, this can take quite a while. So let's see if there's a quicker way. Going from the beginning again, you can see that each of the four initial choices for the first chair leads to three more possible choices for the second chair, and each of those choices leads to two more for the third chair. So instead of counting each final scenario individually, we can multiply the number of choices for each chair: four times three times two times one to achieve the same result of 24. An interesting pattern emerges. We start with the number of objects we're arranging, four in this case, and multiply it by consecutively smaller integers until we reach one. This is an exciting discovery. So exciting that mathematicians have chosen to symbolize this kind of calculation, known as a factorial, with an exclamation mark. As a general rule, the factorial of any positive integer is calculated as the product of that same integer and all smaller integers down to one. In our simple example, the number of ways four people can be arranged into chairs is written as four factorial, which equals 24. So let's go back to our deck. Just as there were four factorial ways of arranging four people, there are 52 factorial ways of arranging 52 cards. Fortunately, we don't have to calculate this by hand. Just enter the function into a calculator, and it will show you that the number of possible arrangements is 8.07 x 10^67, or roughly eight followed by 67 zeros. Just how big is this number? Well, if a new permutation of 52 cards were written out every second starting 13.8 billion years ago, when the Big Bang is thought to have occurred, the writing would still be continuing today and for millions of years to come. In fact, there are more possible ways to arrange this simple deck of cards than there are atoms on Earth. So the next time it's your turn to shuffle, take a moment to remember that you're holding something that may have never before existed and may never exist again.

**Transcript**:
At Pixar, we're all about telling stories, but one story that hasn't been told very much is the huge degree to which math is used in the production of our films. The math that you're learning in middle school and high school is used all the time at Pixar. So, let's start with a very simple example. Anybody recognize this guy? (Cheers) Yeah, so this is Woody from Toy Story, and let's ask Woody to, say, walk across the stage from, say, left to right, just like that. So, believe it or not, you just saw a ton of mathematics. Where is it? Well, to explain that, it's important to understand that artists and designers think in terms of shape and images but computers think in terms of numbers and equations. So, to bridge those two worlds we use a mathematical concept called coordinate geometry, right? That is, we lay down a coordinate system with x describing how far something is to the right and y describing how high something is. So, with these coordinates we can describe where Woody is at any instant in time. For instance, if we know the coordinates of the lower left corner of that image, then we know where the rest of the image is. And in that little sliding animation we saw a second ago, that motion we call translation, the x coordinate started with a value of one, and it ended with a value of about five. So, if we want to write that in mathematics, we see that the x at the end is four bigger than x at the start. So, in other words, the mathematics of translation is addition. Alright? How about scaling? That is making something bigger or smaller. Any guesses as to what the mathematics of scaling might be? Dilation, multiplication, exactly. If you're going to make something twice as big, you need to mulitply the x and the y coordinates all by two. So, this shows us that the mathematics of scaling is mulitiplication. Okay? How about this one? How about rotation? Alright, spinning around. The mathematics of rotation is trigonometry. So, here's an equation that expresses that. It looks a little scary at first. You'll probably get this in eighth or ninth grade. If you find yourselves sitting in trigonometry class wondering when you're ever going to need this stuff, just remember that any time you see anything rotate in one of our films, there's trigonometry at work underneath. I first fell in love with mathematics in seventh grade. Any seventh graders? A few of you? Yeah. My seventh grade science teacher showed me how to use trigonometry to compute how high the rockets that I was building was going. I just thought that was amazing, and I've been enamored with math ever since. So, this is kind of old mathematics. Mathematics that's been known and, you know, developed by the old dead Greek guys. And there's a myth out there that all the interesting mathematics has already been figured out, in fact all of mathematics has been figured out. But the real story is that new mathematics is being created all the time. And some of it is being created at Pixar. So, I'd like to give you an example of that. So, here are some characters from some of our early films: Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc. and Toy Story 2. Anybody know who the blue character in the upper left is? It's Dory. Okay, that was easy. Here's a little harder one. Anybody know who's the character in the lower right? Al McWhiggin from Al's Toy Barn, exactly. The thing to notice about these characters is they're really complicated. Those shapes are really complicated. In fact, the toy cleaner, I have an example, the toy cleaner there in the middle, here's his hand. You can imagine how fun it was to bring this through airport security. His hand is a really complicated shape. It's not just a bunch of spheres and cylinders stuck together, right? And not only is it complicated, but it has to move in complicated ways. So, I'd like to tell you how we do that, and to do that I need to tell you about midpoints. So, here's a couple of points, A and B, and the line segment between them. We're going to start out first in two dimensions. The midpoint, M, is the point that splits that line segment in the middle, right? So, that's the geometry. To make equations and numbers, we again introduce a coordinate system, and if we know the coordinates of A and B, we can easily compute the coordinates of M just by averaging. You now know enough to work at Pixar. Let me show you. So, I'm going to do something slightly terrifying and move to a live demo here. So, what I have is a four-point polygon here, and it's going to be my job to make a smooth curve out of this thing. And I'm going to do it just using the idea of midpoints. So, the first thing I'm going to do is an operation I'll call split, which adds midpoints to all those edges. So, I went from four points to eight points, but it's no smoother. I'm going to make it a little bit smoother by moving all of these points from where they are now to the midpoint of their clockwise neighbor. So, let me animate that for you. I'm going to call that the averaging step. So, now I've got eight points, they're a little bit smoother, my job is to make a smooth curve, so what do I do? Do it again. Split and average. So, now I've got sixteen points. I'm going to put those two steps, split and average, together into something I'll call subdivide, which just means split and then average. So, now I've got 32 points. If that's not smooth enough, I'll do more. I'll get 64 points. Do you see a smooth curve appearing here from those original points? And that's how we create the shapes of our charcters. But remember, I said a moment ago it's not enough just to know the static shape, the fixed shape. We need to animate it. And to animate these curves, the cool thing about subdivision. Did you see the aliens in Toy Story? You know that sound they make, "Ooh"? Ready? So, the way we animate these curves is simply by animating the original four points. "Ooh." Alright, I think that's pretty cool, and if you don't, the door is there, it doesn't get any better than that, so. This idea of splitting and averaging also holds for surfaces. So, I'll split, and I'll average. I'll split, and I'll average. Put those together into subdivide, and this how we actually create the shapes of all of our surface characters in three dimensions. So, this idea of subdivision was first used in a short film in 1997 called Geri's Game. And Geri actually made a cameo apperance in Toy Story 2 as the toy cleaner. Each of his hands was the first time we ever used subdivision. So, each hand was a subdivision surface, his face was a subdivision surface, so was his jacket. Here's Geri's hand before subdivision, and here's Geri's hand after subdivision, so subdivision just goes in and smooths out all those facets, and creates the beautiful surfaces that you see on the screen and in the theaters. Since that time, we've built all of our characters this way. So, here's Merida, the lead character from Brave. Her dress was a subdivision surface, her hands, her face. The faces and hands of all the clansman were subdivision surfaces. Today we've seen how addition, multiplication, trigonometry and geometry play a roll in our films. Given a little more time, I could show you how linear algebra, differential calculus, integral calculus also play a roll. The main thing I want you to go away with today is to just remember that all the math that you're learning in high school and actually up through sophomore college we use all the time, everyday, at Pixar. Thanks.

To make equations and numbers, we again introduce a coordinate system, and if we know the coordinates of A and B, we can easily compute the coordinates of M just by averaging. You now know enough to work at Pixar. Let me show you. So, I'm going to do something slightly terrifying and move to a live demo here. So, what I have is a four-point polygon here, and it's going to be my job to make a smooth curve out of this thing. And I'm going to do it just using the idea of midpoints. So, the first thing I'm going to do is an operation I'll call split, which adds midpoints to all those edges. So, I went from four points to eight points, but it's no smoother. I'm going to make it a little bit smoother by moving all of these points from where they are now to the midpoint of their clockwise neighbor. So, let me animate that for you. I'm going to call that the averaging step. So, now I've got eight points, they're a little bit smoother, my job is to make a smooth curve, so what do I do? Do it again. Split and average. So, now I've got sixteen points. I'm going to put those two steps, split and average, together into something I'll call subdivide, which just means split and then average. So, now I've got 32 points. If that's not smooth enough, I'll do more. I'll get 64 points. Do you see a smooth curve appearing here from those original points? And that's how we create the shapes of our charcters. But remember, I said a moment ago it's not enough just to know the static shape, the fixed shape. We need to animate it. And to animate these curves, the cool thing about subdivision. Did you see the aliens in Toy Story? You know that sound they make, "Ooh"? Ready? So, the way we animate these curves is simply by animating the original four points. "Ooh." Alright, I think that's pretty cool, and if you don't, the door is there, it doesn't get any better than that, so. This idea of splitting and averaging also holds for surfaces. So, I'll split, and I'll average. I'll split, and I'll average. Put those together into subdivide, and this how we actually create the shapes of all of our surface characters in three dimensions. So, this idea of subdivision was first used in a short film in 1997 called Geri's Game. And Geri actually made a cameo apperance in Toy Story 2 as the toy cleaner. Each of his hands was the first time we ever used subdivision. So, each hand was a subdivision surface, his face was a subdivision surface, so was his jacket. Here's Geri's hand before subdivision, and here's Geri's hand after subdivision, so subdivision just goes in and smooths out all those facets, and creates the beautiful surfaces that you see on the screen and in the theaters. Since that time, we've built all of our characters this way. So, here's Merida, the lead character from Brave. Her dress was a subdivision surface, her hands, her face. The faces and hands of all the clansman were subdivision surfaces. Today we've seen how addition, multiplication, trigonometry and geometry play a roll in our films. Given a little more time, I could show you how linear algebra, differential calculus, integral calculus also play a roll. The main thing I want you to go away with today is to just remember that all the math that you're learning in high school and actually up through sophomore college we use all the time, everyday, at Pixar. Thanks.

**Transcript**:
At Pixar, we're all about telling stories, but one story that hasn't been told very much is the huge degree to which math is used in the production of our films. The math that you're learning in middle school and high school is used all the time at Pixar. So, let's start with a very simple example. Anybody recognize this guy? (Cheers) Yeah, so this is Woody from Toy Story, and let's ask Woody to, say, walk across the stage from, say, left to right, just like that. So, believe it or not, you just saw a ton of mathematics. Where is it? Well, to explain that, it's important to understand that artists and designers think in terms of shape and images but computers think in terms of numbers and equations. So, to bridge those two worlds we use a mathematical concept called coordinate geometry, right? That is, we lay down a coordinate system with x describing how far something is to the right and y describing how high something is. So, with these coordinates we can describe where Woody is at any instant in time. For instance, if we know the coordinates of the lower left corner of that image, then we know where the rest of the image is. And in that little sliding animation we saw a second ago, that motion we call translation, the x coordinate started with a value of one, and it ended with a value of about five. So, if we want to write that in mathematics, we see that the x at the end is four bigger than x at the start. So, in other words, the mathematics of translation is addition. Alright? How about scaling? That is making something bigger or smaller. Any guesses as to what the mathematics of scaling might be? Dilation, multiplication, exactly. If you're going to make something twice as big, you need to mulitply the x and the y coordinates all by two. So, this shows us that the mathematics of scaling is mulitiplication. Okay? How about this one? How about rotation? Alright, spinning around. The mathematics of rotation is trigonometry. So, here's an equation that expresses that. It looks a little scary at first. You'll probably get this in eighth or ninth grade. If you find yourselves sitting in trigonometry class wondering when you're ever going to need this stuff, just remember that any time you see anything rotate in one of our films, there's trigonometry at work underneath. I first fell in love with mathematics in seventh grade. Any seventh graders? A few of you? Yeah. My seventh grade science teacher showed me how to use trigonometry to compute how high the rockets that I was building was going. I just thought that was amazing, and I've been enamored with math ever since. So, this is kind of old mathematics. Mathematics that's been known and, you know, developed by the old dead Greek guys. And there's a myth out there that all the interesting mathematics has already been figured out, in fact all of mathematics has been figured out. But the real story is that new mathematics is being created all the time. And some of it is being created at Pixar. So, I'd like to give you an example of that. So, here are some characters from some of our early films: Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc. and Toy Story 2. Anybody know who the blue character in the upper left is? It's Dory. Okay, that was easy. Here's a little harder one. Anybody know who's the character in the lower right? Al McWhiggin from Al's Toy Barn, exactly. The thing to notice about these characters is they're really complicated. Those shapes are really complicated. In fact, the toy cleaner, I have an example, the toy cleaner there in the middle, here's his hand. You can imagine how fun it was to bring this through airport security. His hand is a really complicated shape. It's not just a bunch of spheres and cylinders stuck together, right? And not only is it complicated, but it has to move in complicated ways. So, I'd like to tell you how we do that, and to do that I need to tell you about midpoints. So, here's a couple of points, A and B, and the line segment between them. We're going to start out first in two dimensions. The midpoint, M, is the point that splits that line segment in the middle, right? So, that's the geometry. To make equations and numbers, we again introduce a coordinate system, and if we know the coordinates of A and B, we can easily compute the coordinates of M just by averaging.

**Transcript**:
Space: it's where things happen. Time: it's when things happen. We can measure where things are and when things take place, but in modern physics, we realize when and where are actually part of the same question. Because when it comes to understanding the universe, we need to replace three-dimensional space plus time with a single concept: four-dimensional space-time. We'll explore and explain space-time in this series of animations. Animations? Yeah. Well, we're not very animated are we? Sure we are! Look, I can go from here to here. Whoa! How'd you get from here to there? How fast did you go? Did you run? Walk? Did you even go in a straight line? Ah! To answer that, you'll need to make our cartoon physics look more like physics physics. You'll need more panels. More panels, please! Okay, in each panel, Andrew's in a slightly different place. So I can see each one records where Andrew is at a different time. That's great. But it would be easier to see what's going on if we could cut out all the hundreds of panels and stack them up like a flip book. Right, now let's flip through the book so that we can see one panel after another getting through 24 in every second. See! I told you it was an animation. Now you can see me walking along. Drawing all those panels and putting them into a flip book is just one way of recording the way I'm moving. It's how animation, or even movies, work. As it turns out, at my walking speed, it takes two seconds to get past each fence post, and they're spaced four meters apart. So we can calculate my velocity -- how fast I'm moving through space - - is two meters per second. But I could've worked that out from the panels without flipping through them. From the edge of the flip book, you can see all of the copies of the fence posts and all of the copies of Andrew and he's in a slightly different place in each one. Now we can predict everything that will happen to Andrew when we flip through 24 pages every second, including his speed of motion, just by looking. No need to flip through at all. The edge of this flip book is known as a space-time diagram of Andrew's journey through, you guessed it, space and time. We call the line that represents Andrew's journey his world line. If i jog instead of walking, I might be able to get past a fence post every second. He's not very athletic. Anyway, when we look at this new flip book from the edge, we can do the same analysis as before. The world line for Andrew jogging is more tilted over than the world line for Andrew walking. We can tell he's going twice as fast as before without flipping the panels. But here's the clever bit. In physics, it's always good to view things from other perspectives. After all, the laws of physics should be the same for everyone or no one will obey them. So let's rethink our cartoon and have the camera follow Andrew jogging along as the fence posts approach and pass behind him. Still viewing it as a flip book of panels, we don't need to redraw anything. We simply move all of the cutout frames slightly until Andrew's tilted world line becomes completely vertical. To see why, let's flip it. Yes, now I'm stationery, just jogging on the spot, in the center of the panel. On the edge of the flip book, my world line was going straight upwards.

**Transcript**:
Space: it's where things happen. Time: it's when things happen. We can measure where things are and when things take place, but in modern physics, we realize when and where are actually part of the same question. Because when it comes to understanding the universe, we need to replace three-dimensional space plus time with a single concept: four-dimensional space-time. We'll explore and explain space-time in this series of animations. Animations? Yeah. Well, we're not very animated are we? Sure we are! Look, I can go from here to here. Whoa! How'd you get from here to there? How fast did you go? Did you run? Walk? Did you even go in a straight line? Ah! To answer that, you'll need to make our cartoon physics look more like physics physics. You'll need more panels. More panels, please! Okay, in each panel, Andrew's in a slightly different place. So I can see each one records where Andrew is at a different time. That's great. But it would be easier to see what's going on if we could cut out all the hundreds of panels and stack them up like a flip book. Right, now let's flip through the book so that we can see one panel after another getting through 24 in every second. See! I told you it was an animation. Now you can see me walking along. Drawing all those panels and putting them into a flip book is just one way of recording the way I'm moving. It's how animation, or even movies, work. As it turns out, at my walking speed, it takes two seconds to get past each fence post, and they're spaced four meters apart. So we can calculate my velocity -- how fast I'm moving through space - - is two meters per second. But I could've worked that out from the panels without flipping through them. From the edge of the flip book, you can see all of the copies of the fence posts and all of the copies of Andrew and he's in a slightly different place in each one. Now we can predict everything that will happen to Andrew when we flip through 24 pages every second, including his speed of motion, just by looking. No need to flip through at all. The edge of this flip book is known as a space-time diagram of Andrew's journey through, you guessed it, space and time. We call the line that represents Andrew's journey his world line. If i jog instead of walking, I might be able to get past a fence post every second. He's not very athletic. Anyway, when we look at this new flip book from the edge, we can do the same analysis as before. The world line for Andrew jogging is more tilted over than the world line for Andrew walking. We can tell he's going twice as fast as before without flipping the panels. But here's the clever bit. In physics, it's always good to view things from other perspectives. After all, the laws of physics should be the same for everyone or no one will obey them. So let's rethink our cartoon and have the camera follow Andrew jogging along as the fence posts approach and pass behind him. Still viewing it as a flip book of panels, we don't need to redraw anything. We simply move all of the cutout frames slightly until Andrew's tilted world line becomes completely vertical. To see why, let's flip it. Yes, now I'm stationery, just jogging on the spot, in the center of the panel. On the edge of the flip book, my world line was going straight upwards. The fence posts are coming past me. It's now their world lines that are tilted. This rearrangement of the panels is known as a Galilean transformation, and it lets us analyze physics from someeone else's perspective. In this case, mine. After all, it's always good to see things from other points of view, especially when the viewers are moving at different speeds. So long as the speeds aren't too high.

**Transcript**:
Space: it's where things happen. Time: it's when things happen. We can measure where things are and when things take place, but in modern physics, we realize when and where are actually part of the same question. Because when it comes to understanding the universe, we need to replace three-dimensional space plus time with a single concept: four-dimensional space-time. We'll explore and explain space-time in this series of animations. Animations? Yeah. Well, we're not very animated are we? Sure we are! Look, I can go from here to here. Whoa! How'd you get from here to there? How fast did you go? Did you run? Walk? Did you even go in a straight line? Ah! To answer that, you'll need to make our cartoon physics look more like physics physics. You'll need more panels. More panels, please! Okay, in each panel, Andrew's in a slightly different place. So I can see each one records where Andrew is at a different time. That's great. But it would be easier to see what's going on if we could cut out all the hundreds of panels and stack them up like a flip book. Right, now let's flip through the book so that we can see one panel after another getting through 24 in every second. See! I told you it was an animation. Now you can see me walking along. Drawing all those panels and putting them into a flip book is just one way of recording the way I'm moving. It's how animation, or even movies, work. As it turns out, at my walking speed, it takes two seconds to get past each fence post, and they're spaced four meters apart. So we can calculate my velocity -- how fast I'm moving through space - - is two meters per second. But I could've worked that out from the panels without flipping through them. From the edge of the flip book, you can see all of the copies of the fence posts and all of the copies of Andrew and he's in a slightly different place in each one. Now we can predict everything that will happen to Andrew when we flip through 24 pages every second, including his speed of motion, just by looking. No need to flip through at all. The edge of this flip book is known as a space-time diagram of Andrew's journey through, you guessed it, space and time. We call the line that represents Andrew's journey his world line. If i jog instead of walking, I might be able to get past a fence post every second. He's not very athletic. Anyway, when we look at this new flip book from the edge, we can do the same analysis as before. The world line for Andrew jogging is more tilted over than the world line for Andrew walking. We can tell he's going twice as fast as before without flipping the panels. But here's the clever bit. In physics, it's always good to view things from other perspectives. After all, the laws of physics should be the same for everyone or no one will obey them. So let's rethink our cartoon and have the camera follow Andrew jogging along as the fence posts approach and pass behind him. Still viewing it as a flip book of panels, we don't need to redraw anything. We simply move all of the cutout frames slightly until Andrew's tilted world line becomes completely vertical. To see why, let's flip it. Yes, now I'm stationery, just jogging on the spot, in the center of the panel. On the edge of the flip book, my world line was going straight upwards. The fence posts are coming past me. It's now their world lines that are tilted. This rearrangement of the panels is known as a Galilean transformation, and it lets us analyze physics from someeone else's perspective. In this case, mine. After all, it's always good to see things from other points of view, especially when the viewers are moving at different speeds. So long as the speeds aren't too high. If you're a cosmic ray moving at the speed of light, our flip book of your point of view falls apart. To stop that from happening, we'll have to glue panels together. Instead of a stack of separate panels, we'll need a solid block of space-time, which we'll come to in the next animation.

**Transcript**:
We are going to try and do an experiment today.
It is called the ‘gallium beating heart’. So it is
quite a cool experiment, you take some molten gallium and then you
submerge it or you put it underneath a layer of sulphuric
acid. The sulphuric acid reacts with the gallium to form gallium
sulphate and it changes the surface tension, so it all pulls
up into a ball and then relaxes and there is this really neat
oscillating reaction where you get sulphate on the surface or no
sulphate on the surface. So you see big changes in surface
tension and the piece of gallium is seen to beat like a heart
so we thought we would try that today with a bit of gallium
which I am trying to melt in my hand right now. Many years ago, a professor bet me a hundred
pounds, when a hundred pounds was a lot of money, that
the melting point of gallium was lower than that of caesium
and I said it was the other way round, but I was not courageous
enough to take up the bet or now I would be rich. So this is a small nugget of gallium and as
you can see if I tap it on the hot plate it is real metal so
now we are going to try and melt it, hopefully in my hand. In my first video about gallium, I said that
it was not a very interesting element with not much, many applications
and we have had emails from people who were outraged.
There is one email from a gentleman in America whose
company makes tonnes of gallium salts that have quite
important applications and of course gallium is particularly
important in new generation of compounds, so-called semi-conductors,
that are used in the electronics industry. So if I stand and hold it for long enough,
in theory, the temperature should come from my hand, the
heat should come from my hand, so it should melt the gallium
and then eventually we should have a small amount of
liquid. So gallium, you can form an amalgam with this
material, with all sorts of different materials like indium and
tin. And in fact indium, tin and gallium is used as the material
inside many, many thermometers which are used in the medical
industry because it is not as toxic as mercury which
was traditionally used. You may have heard of Mendeleev. He
was the guy that sort of conceived or brought together the
periodic table and at the time that he did this at about 1870,
gallium hadn’t been discovered, so he predicted its chemical
and physical properties and he called it eka-aluminium,
approximately 5 years after that it was found using a spectroscope.
So now we see it is melted, it looks just like a
little ball of mercury rolling around on my hand. You can see the
thick skin that has developed the surface tension causing
it to form such a beautiful bulb. We are going to take out our
molten gallium and we are going to put it under a layer of
dilute sulphuric acid, about the same strength as battery acid,
so now we are going to make the acid. And to do that we
are going to dilute concentrated sulphuric acid with water. Now
it is always important to remember that when you dilute
acid you always put acid into water because the reaction can
be exothermic and we want to dissipate the heat in the water
so that it does not squirt up on our faces. The water was
room temperature, but if I hold the measuring cylinder here
it is actually very hot, it is maybe 40, 50, 60oC. So now before
we do our experiment we have got to allow it to cool.
We do that by simply running cold water outside the tube. So this is the gallium that we melted on our
hand, now let’s see what happens when we add the sulphuric
acid. Wow, did you see that? I did. What happened? So the shape of the ball or the lump of gallium
has changed, because we’ve changed it surface properties,
we’ve made gallium sulphate on the surface. The
surface tension has got higher and it has pulled up into a
nice ball, ok. So that’s the first step of the beating heart.
What we’ve seen is the gallium which was relaxed flat on the
surface has pulled up really quite sharply and that is the first
stage, or the in- beat of the heart, now we’ve got to make
the heart relax. So what we are going to do is use dichromate.
Dichromate is a fantastic oxidant and we are going to put
a small amount of it in and see what happens. So gallium, I realise now is named after France.
It was discovered by a Frenchman and its name comes
from the old name for France, Gaul. So what we are doing in this experiment, we
are changing the surface tension of the gallium, so these are
the forces that hold the liquid into a ball or allow it to
wet and flatten on the surface. So when the gallium is naked, ok?
It’s actually quite flat and it wets the surface. But when we
put it under sulphuric acid we form gallium sulphate on
the surface, this increases the surface tension and then pulls
the gallium so it is in a nice proud ball. What we then do is
we dribble a small amount of dichromate solution in, which removes
the sulphate from the surface and allows the gallium
to go flat, and if we add the required amount of dichromate
to the amount of acid then we can get the ball to
flatten and come back up, flatten and come back up, so it looks
like a beating heart. At the moment we are really quite excited
at Nottingham because Steve Liddle, my periodic videos colleague,
has made a new compound in which he has got an atom
of uranium to bond to an atom of gallium and this is exciting
because this is the first time that chemists have ever seen
a bond between these two atoms. It sort of turns a terracottery colour, it
is really a deep orangey brown, it is a bit like brick dust actually. Of course they are not naked uranium and naked
gallium but each of them have other things bonded to them
but it is the first time that anybody has seen a gallium-uranium
bond. It was one of those great moments you know,
being a chemist is like being on a rollercoaster,
you have some days when you wonder why am I doing this? And you
have fantastic days where you totally remember
why you are doing this. Because it is to be the first, to be
the first person who has ever made this particular, you know filling
the gap, whatever it is. It is a real thrill when you
are the first person to make a compound that does not exist out
in the galaxy and space, it has never existed on our planet
before but now we have made it for the first time. That’s
a really good thing to do We are really very excited! A new union has
been formed within the periodic table and it has been
done here at Nottingham.

stage, or the in- beat of the heart, now we’ve got to make
the heart relax. So what we are going to do is use dichromate.
Dichromate is a fantastic oxidant and we are going to put
a small amount of it in and see what happens. So gallium, I realise now is named after France.
It was discovered by a Frenchman and its name comes
from the old name for France, Gaul. So what we are doing in this experiment, we
are changing the surface tension of the gallium, so these are
the forces that hold the liquid into a ball or allow it to
wet and flatten on the surface. So when the gallium is naked, ok?
It’s actually quite flat and it wets the surface. But when we
put it under sulphuric acid we form gallium sulphate on
the surface, this increases the surface tension and then pulls
the gallium so it is in a nice proud ball. What we then do is
we dribble a small amount of dichromate solution in, which removes
the sulphate from the surface and allows the gallium
to go flat, and if we add the required amount of dichromate
to the amount of acid then we can get the ball to
flatten and come back up, flatten and come back up, so it looks
like a beating heart. At the moment we are really quite excited
at Nottingham because Steve Liddle, my periodic videos colleague,
has made a new compound in which he has got an atom
of uranium to bond to an atom of gallium and this is exciting
because this is the first time that chemists have ever seen
a bond between these two atoms. It sort of turns a terracottery colour, it
is really a deep orangey brown, it is a bit like brick dust actually. Of course they are not naked uranium and naked
gallium but each of them have other things bonded to them
but it is the first time that anybody has seen a gallium-uranium
bond. It was one of those great moments you know,
being a chemist is like being on a rollercoaster,
you have some days when you wonder why am I doing this? And you
have fantastic days where you totally remember
why you are doing this. Because it is to be the first, to be
the first person who has ever made this particular, you know filling
the gap, whatever it is. It is a real thrill when you
are the first person to make a compound that does not exist out
in the galaxy and space, it has never existed on our planet
before but now we have made it for the first time. That’s
a really good thing to do We are really very excited! A new union has
been formed within the periodic table and it has been
done here at Nottingham.

**Transcript**:
Okay weíre going to be looking today at copper.
This is something looking back at the old video, itís a short video and there isnít
any experimentation in it so I thought weíd do something a bit practical. Copper is an element which people are very
familiar with because itís such a characteristic coloured metal, sort of reddish colour, though
it gets darker when oxide forms. But itís quite a soft metal and you can cut it quite
easily if you have a cutter like this which has steel blades, it will just dig into the
metal and it should just cut off. When you cut the metal you get this very nice, shiny,
fresh surface coloured just like copper. This is a ball of copper, copper metal. As
you might imagine itís a ball of metal so therefore it is quite dense and heavy. I mean
itís not as dense as, I think Steve told me this morning, that if we had a ball this
size of plutonium he told me it would weigh about a kilo and a half so he thought. So
itís not quite as heavy as that but still itís pretty heavy and dense. So this is a very, very nice sample of very
fine copper wire. So the copper wire here is, what width is this? This isÖ phew! Point
zero, Iím not even going toÖthatís just too small, so itís point one of a millimetre. So inside the beaker weíve got a solution
called sodium potassium tartrate, so no copper in there at the moment. Weíre going to introduce
that through this. This is a solution of copper sulphate. Copper is very popular for architectural use
because if you put it on the roofs of buildings it then reacts, particularly with carbon dioxide
in the air, to give a very nice green colour. First of all though we need to heat this to
about 50∞C, and to the sodium potassium tartrate we need to add some very weak, hydrogen
peroxide so this is only 3% hydrogen peroxide, so in it goes. We need to make sure they mix
together which is why thereís a stirring bar at the bottom there stirring away. Okay
so thatís stirring nicely, so as I said sodium potassium tartrate and hydrogen peroxide and
we need to add only one mill so thatís 1cm3 of the copper sulphate. The copper wire here is very, very high grade,
this is grade one copper wire and itís point one of a millimetre in diameter and you can
see the wonderful copperas lustre coming off the side there. What do you mean by grade one copper? So this is very high purity, this is like
99.99% copper, used for electronics fabrications and high quality research samples. Itís also used for electrical wiring, in
fact itís used so much that in a country like the UK each person has about 175 kilos
of copper associated with each person, in the piping, the wiring and so on. The problem
is that in many other countries, for example in China, people have very much less copper
associated with them, there isnít so much electrical wiring in rural parts of China.
And if everybody in China had the same amount of copper associated with them as those in
England or America or Canada there wouldnít be enough copper in all the known deposits
around the world. Copper is actually necessary for life, plants
and animals use copper. But actually you can have a disease called Wilsonís disease which
basically your body canít metabolise copper properly, itís actually an inherited disease. Ready? Whatís going on there is itís producing
a lot of gas so itís reacting to form a complex. And itís going from the potassium tartrate
complex there to well, its producing carbon dioxide and oxygen, mainly oxygen gas is being
produced which is why youíre seeing the fizzing. And itís become copper oxide, cuprous oxide
actually. Copper is found as a metal lying around in
various places in the world. I believe the name came from the island of Cyprus in the
middle of the Mediterranean, but copper has always been know even in pre-historic times
people found small amounts of copper. But as we use more and more copper people have
had to dig deeper and deeper mines. The mine in Chile where those very brave miners were
entombed for more than two months and then rescued was a copper mine. And to get the
metal that we need weíre going to have to go deeper and deeper and deeper into the earth. So what weíve got in there now is cuprous
oxide itís copper 1 oxide. And itís actually gone from what was a kind of clear see-through,
all right itís got a colour on it, but see-through solution to something thatís very cloudy.
So what weíve got there is a precipitate of copper oxide. Copper is very good because it has very high
thermal and electrical conductivity. What that means is that heat flows through it very
well and also electricity. If you make wires for electrical transmission out of copper,
when the electricity goes through them you get very much less heating than say if you
made the wires out of iron, and all this heating is of course lost energy. Youíd do even better
if you made the wires out of silver, but silver is too expensive. OK. So letís see if we can change this reaction
back. So at the moment it started out as being about 50∞C and itís shot up to about 63∞C,
I imagine it was even hotter than that when it originally changed colour. So weíll see
if we can take it back, Iíll put that back in. I actually bought this from the British Geological
Survey which is just down the road from here, I think it is in Keyworth I think. And I just
saw this and it was a Christmas present from my husband and I picked it out. I just think
itís really cool actually. What did your husband think of getting that
as a Christmas present? He knows what Iím like! So he buys these
things for me he knows Iím a bit of a magpie, I like to collect shiny things, and pretty
things, thatís my copper. So the colour is gradually changing, itís
gone from orange and now kind of a murky yellow. You can see itís kind of green now. And again
a gradual change, it wasnít a sudden spontaneous straight back to being blue and see-through,
you know clear. Now weíve got back to that clear solution. And again you can see on the
stirrer bar all the bubbles of the oxygen, little bit of C02 forming on that. Most organisms, you and me, use iron in our
blood to transport oxygen, thatís what makes our blood red. But in some sorts of crustaceans,
crabs and lobsters, theyíre different they use copper. They use a compound called hemocyanin,
itís a blue compound of copper. Cyanine is some classical word for blue. So they really
have blue blood. And these hemocyanin use two atoms of copper in each molecule to transport
the oxygen around the body of the crab or lobster. But itís not nearly as good as haemoglobin,
so if you start running after a crab or lobster it quickly gets tired compared to running
after a rabbit or something like that, which can keep going faster than you can.

So here we have a sample of cobalt. Now I
have got lots and lots of different samples of cobalt in my
drawer, so this is cobalt sponge. Cobalt is, in many ways, similar to iron.
It can form magnets. So this cobalt has been generated from a solution
and it’s been made in very, very finely dispersed so
it has a very large surface area. It’s very good for doing catalytic
reactions. The magnets that you use in colour televisions,
for the loud speakers, contain cobalt. You need to use
cobalt in the magnets in the colour television or the old
sort of colour television not the ones with LCD screens because
the magnetic fields from larger magnets could
affect the electron guns and so spoil the colours so you need
a very small magnet on your loud speaker or the colours
all go funny. Cobalt sponge absorbs lots and lots of gas
for perhaps hydrogenation. Many years ago, in the 1970s, when there was
a civil war in Africa in the region Katanga where cobalt
is mined, there was a shortage of cobalt and the production of
colour televisions stopped for some considerable time until the
production restarted. So you can see it flows in the bottle. So
I have another sample of cobalt and that is simply a foil.
So again that is a very nice malleable tin-type foil; very, very
good structures.

**Transcript**:
The thermite reaction which is the reaction
of aluminium and iron oxide is used to make iron and because
aluminium has much stronger bonds to oxygen than iron that
the reaction produces an enormous amount of heat and you
can use this for welding pieces of metals together. So this is a thermite mixture, it is a mixture
of iron oxide and aluminium powder and we are going to do some
redox chemistry and we are going to generate some
molten iron which will hopefully stream from the bottom
of the flower pot. So here you can see the black particles
of the iron oxide and the silver particles are the aluminium
powder. So we get some heat on this and we start an instantaneous
redox reaction so the aluminium and the iron oxide
swap oxygens so the aluminium will become oxidised and
the iron will become reduced hopefully we will generate
a lot of molten iron which should come from the bottom of
the test tube … of the flower pot. Alright! Right. Now there is a story about students in Berkley
that some students, or group of students, decided to
do a practical joke on a tram of the sort that has one door where
you go in and another when you go out. So a big group of
students queued onto the tram and got into the front and there
were enough of them so they could actually come out at
the end at the other door and form a loop so they were just
going round and round and round so the tram could not
leave because they were just more and more people getting
on. We’re going to run out of tape. And while they were doing this, other students
went down under the tram and set off two thermite reactions
and welded the metal wheels of the tram to the steel
rails so that when the tram tried to leave, when the students
eventually stopped going round and round, it was firmly welded
to the tracks and could not move at all. It’s gone out. Tell us about what is going on mate! So instantly the thermite reaction starts
and you can see that it’s so hot that it burnt a whole through
the bottom of that terracotta flower pot. But if we go in close
now Brady, you can see all that really quite nice molten
iron. Now that is so hot that the iron itself has melted and it
has formed this really quite big goo in the bottom on the
sand. Do you encourage these sorts of practical
jokes? No, no, no, no ,no, our students are far more
responsible. So as soon as the fire work, or the sparkler,
hit the top of the thermite reaction, in the top of here, it
started obviously, instantaneous redox reaction. So this is where
the metals were fighting for the oxygen, the aluminium
won that battle and the aluminium came out of this reaction
as aluminium oxide. The iron was reduced and we can see
that now in the bottom which is really hot so I am not going
to get too close but you can see all of this really, really
hot iron. The iron was molten, it dribbled out through the bottom
of the flower pot and it is now cooling. It didn’t dribble out of the bottom of the
flower pot. Well it smashed its way out of the flower
pot. Well you can say that iron is in my blood,
it is in your blood as well. It is iron that gives haemoglobin
the red pigment in your blood, its red colour. So the reaction we saw was about 5 minutes
ago and the iron that was generated is still glowing red hot
and you can see it has fused itself to the bottom half of the
flower pot, which it broke in its tumultuous step forward. It is an absolutely essential element to life,
except for crabs which use copper but you will have to hear
about that later. So iron is a really, really abundant metal
which is used in lots and lots of structural material, so you get
to see lots of pieces of iron around, some of the racking
and even in fact some of these pieces of equipment have got
high iron content. They have got other elements in them
to form alloys like stainless steel. I have an extremely long standing interest
in its chemistry and in particular, I made one compound of
iron so called iron tetracarbonyl which had 4 groups round it
and everybody had expected that it would have a shape like one
of these. Shaped with tetrahedron like that whereas, in fact,
it had a much more irregular shape, the 4 groups were arranged
like this, and so every since this, every time I hear
the word iron I get quite excited. So this is iron wire, ok, and as you can it
is a very small wire. It is 0.2 in diameter and you can see the
shiny material underneath is iron that has not undergone
oxidation so this is where it has been protected from the oxygen
in the air now if we look at the iron at the top we can see
that this looks really familiar especially because it looks like
some of the rust which we can see at the bottom of some of our cars.
So here is some iron oxide on top of the iron. The very first chemical experiment I did the
chemical reaction was with iron and I think the same is true
for many generations of school children. I heated up
iron and sulphur together and made iron sulphide sort of blackish
solid but then we put acid on it and got a terrible
smell of bad eggs and this was my introduction to chemistry
and I really loved it.

**Transcript**:
The thermite reaction which is the reaction
of aluminium and iron oxide is used to make iron and because
aluminium has much stronger bonds to oxygen than iron that
the reaction produces an enormous amount of heat and you
can use this for welding pieces of metals together. So this is a thermite mixture, it is a mixture
of iron oxide and aluminium powder and we are going to do some
redox chemistry and we are going to generate some
molten iron which will hopefully stream from the bottom
of the flower pot. So here you can see the black particles
of the iron oxide and the silver particles are the aluminium
powder. So we get some heat on this and we start an instantaneous
redox reaction so the aluminium and the iron oxide
swap oxygens so the aluminium will become oxidised and
the iron will become reduced hopefully we will generate
a lot of molten iron which should come from the bottom of
the test tube … of the flower pot. Alright! Right. Now there is a story about students in Berkley
that some students, or group of students, decided to
do a practical joke on a tram of the sort that has one door where
you go in and another when you go out. So a big group of
students queued onto the tram and got into the front and there
were enough of them so they could actually come out at
the end at the other door and form a loop so they were just
going round and round and round so the tram could not
leave because they were just more and more people getting
on. We’re going to run out of tape. And while they were doing this, other students
went down under the tram and set off two thermite reactions
and welded the metal wheels of the tram to the steel
rails so that when the tram tried to leave, when the students
eventually stopped going round and round, it was firmly welded
to the tracks and could not move at all. It’s gone out. Tell us about what is going on mate! So instantly the thermite reaction starts
and you can see that it’s so hot that it burnt a whole through
the bottom of that terracotta flower pot. But if we go in close
now Brady, you can see all that really quite nice molten
iron. Now that is so hot that the iron itself has melted and it
has formed this really quite big goo in the bottom on the
sand. Do you encourage these sorts of practical
jokes? No, no, no, no ,no, our students are far more
responsible. So as soon as the fire work, or the sparkler,
hit the top of the thermite reaction, in the top of here, it
started obviously, instantaneous redox reaction. So this is where
the metals were fighting for the oxygen, the aluminium
won that battle and the aluminium came out of this reaction
as aluminium oxide. The iron was reduced and we can see
that now in the bottom which is really hot so I am not going
to get too close but you can see all of this really, really
hot iron. The iron was molten, it dribbled out through the bottom
of the flower pot and it is now cooling. It didn’t dribble out of the bottom of the
flower pot. Well it smashed its way out of the flower
pot. Well you can say that iron is in my blood,
it is in your blood as well. It is iron that gives haemoglobin
the red pigment in your blood, its red colour. So the reaction we saw was about 5 minutes
ago and the iron that was generated is still glowing red hot
and you can see it has fused itself to the bottom half of the
flower pot, which it broke in its tumultuous step forward. It is an absolutely essential element to life,
except for crabs which use copper but you will have to hear
about that later. So iron is a really, really abundant metal
which is used in lots and lots of structural material, so you get
to see lots of pieces of iron around, some of the racking
and even in fact some of these pieces of equipment have got
high iron content. They have got other elements in them
to form alloys like stainless steel. I have an extremely long standing interest
in its chemistry and in particular, I made one compound of
iron so called iron tetracarbonyl which had 4 groups round it
and everybody had expected that it would have a shape like one
of these. Shaped with tetrahedron like that whereas, in fact,
it had a much more irregular shape, the 4 groups were arranged
like this, and so every since this, every time I hear
the word iron I get quite excited. So this is iron wire, ok, and as you can it
is a very small wire. It is 0.2 in diameter and you can see the
shiny material underneath is iron that has not undergone
oxidation so this is where it has been protected from the oxygen
in the air now if we look at the iron at the top we can see
that this looks really familiar especially because it looks like
some of the rust which we can see at the bottom of some of our cars.
So here is some iron oxide on top of the iron. The very first chemical experiment I did the
chemical reaction was with iron and I think the same is true
for many generations of school children. I heated up
iron and sulphur together and made iron sulphide sort of blackish
solid but then we put acid on it and got a terrible
smell of bad eggs and this was my introduction to chemistry
and I really loved it.

**Transcript**:
Two or three days ago, I got a letter from
one of our fans and it’s different from any other letter that we have ever had, because
this fan, Young, has attached to it a sample of an element and what’s more it is an element
that I had never seen. It’s scandium. It’s only a small piece
but according to my colleague Steve, it’s a very expensive element, so this might be
quite valuable, and scandium is a really interesting element, much more interesting than I realised,
when I first talked about it on the video. Scandium is an element which chemists usually
ignore, I have never used scandium in any of my research. It was one of the elements that Mendeleev
predicted ought to exist when he first devised the periodic table, when he made it there
were lots of elements which were not known, but what he did was to predict that there
were holes in various places where he felt that there ought to be an element and because
obviously these elements did not have names, he called them Ekea boron or Ekea aluminium
or Ekea silicon meaning underneath those elements. And the triumph of the periodic table was
that people actually discovered these elements. And the first one that was discovered was
the element Gallium (Ekea Aluminium) and the second one was Ekea Boron which is scandium.
Now you might think that it is a bit surprising because if you look at a modern periodic table,
scandium and boron are really quite a long way apart but in the original way that Medeleev
started the periodic table when he wrote it down first, scandium and boron came very close
together because both of them, have three electrons in their outer shell which makes
their chemistry quite similar. Of course Medeleev did not know about electrons, but he guessed
from looking at titanium which has four electrons and calcium which has two that he thought
there was something missing and what is also interesting about these three elements that
he predicted is that they all ended up with names of countries. There was gallium that
was named after France, from the latin word for France. Scandium that was named after,
well perhaps not a country but a region, Scandinavia, and then germanium, that was named after Germany. The first time that an element was discovered,
when gallium was discovered, people said well it was just luck, but when scandium was discovered,
they really began to take Mendeleev pretty seriously, and by the time germanium was discovered
they really all decided that Mendeleev was right. Scandium, because it is an uncommon
element, is one where people don’t know much about the chemistry. I have never really
done any research in this area but like many elements suddenly there comes a time where
they become really quite popular and topical and now is the time for scandium and the reason
is that scandium is a really light metal. Its density is slightly less than 4, that’s
4 grams per cubic centimetre and that is very much lighter than most metals. Copper is nearly
10 and lead and gold are close to 20, so this is really very light. So why should metals
be important if they are light, and that’s, the reason is sometimes you want to use a
metal, but you don’t want the object you make to be very heavy and so for example titanium
which is very light, is used for making everything from golf clubs to jet fighter planes, where
you want it to be really light either so that you can swing it fast or fly fast. For scandium
the reasons are rather different, people are now thinking about using hydrogen, to power
cars, to use hydrogen gas, to use hydrogen gas as the fuel to power cars, but what they
want to do is to store the hydrogen, in the equivalent of the petrol tank. You can’t
just pressurise the hydrogen as in a gas cylinder because the container would be so heavy, that
your car would be like a military tank it would be so heavy. So what they want to try
and do is produce a chemical compound, which is a bit like a sponge that will absorb the
hydrogen and then for example if you warm it gently they hydrogen will come out, and
it is here that you want the metal to be light because you want this material that you are
using to store hydrogen not to weigh very much. Because you have got to cart it around
in your car all the time, and scandium compounds are now looking really quite promising, for
storage of hydrogen, and the idea is that rather like a molecular model kit, where you
have balls joined with sticks, you can use organic compounds, those of carbon and hydrogen
with a little oxygen, like sticks to join together scandium atoms, and produce a structure
which has a lot of holes in it and then the hydrogen can go into those holes and be stored
without needing an enormous pressure. Sounds like an incredibly complicated way
to make a fuel tank. It is quite complicated but on the other hand,
if it works, you don’t need to understand the chemistry. You just add the hydrogen to
your tank and away you go. How can you have got to your ripe old age
as a chemist and never seen scandium? Well, chemists very often use compounds, salts
of metals, but it’s not too often that you use the metal itself and salts because they
don’t have to be purified and so on quite as much as the metals are easier to get, they
are not as expensive and so there are lots of the elements which I haven’t seen, but
I am really quite pleased with this sample of scandium, so when I am finished I am going
to frame it and hang it on my wall. So we have one of my students who works with
one of my colleagues, Martin Schroder and the student, has done his whole project, three
year project, on the chemistry of scandium, so when I got this letter I asked him: Have
you ever seen scandium? And he hadn’t, he had never seen the metal, so he was really
quite excited to see John’s letter.

are not as expensive and so there are lots of the elements which I haven’t seen, but
I am really quite pleased with this sample of scandium, so when I am finished I am going
to frame it and hang it on my wall. So we have one of my students who works with
one of my colleagues, Martin Schroder and the student, has done his whole project, three
year project, on the chemistry of scandium, so when I got this letter I asked him: Have
you ever seen scandium? And he hadn’t, he had never seen the metal, so he was really
quite excited to see John’s letter.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: In our periodic table, scandium and boron are quite separate, but Mendeleev put them very close together. What explanation was given by the professor for this? Why is the chemistry of scandium and boron similar?
Options: A. Both of them have similar atomic number, B. Both of them have similar atomic mass, C. Both of them have 3 electrons in their outer shell
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: Who predicted the existence of scandium when he first devised the periodic table?
Options: A. Mendeleev, B. Young, C. Martin Schroder, D. Steve
Correct Option: None

**Transcript**:
So this sample, it’s a very, very interesting
sample; it’s arsenic. So this is quality arsenic. So arsenic used to much more common in the
community than it is nowadays. It was used as a pigment in the nineteenth century for
green wallpaper contained copper arsenite, because there weren’t any other good green
pigments to make the wallpaper. And when the rooms were damp, Victorians didn’t like
opening the windows in their rooms, then mould would grow on the wall. And because arsenic
is poisonous to most life forms the mould would convert the arsenic into a volatile
compound, trimethylarsine, and the trimethylarsine went into the air and several people were
killed by the arsenic coming from their wall paper. Now arsenic as we know is very toxic and there
have been a number of very high profile and very famous cases of people that have poisoned
perhaps their partners or their business partners using arsenic. Okay, so I’m going to very
carefully take this vial out. He says very carefully then knocks it really hard. Arsenic was also used quite widely by people
to dispose of husbands, wives, lovers. Though now it is much less common. It is used in
the electronics industry for getting electronic properties for making transistors. And also
it is still sometimes used for medication for feeding to livestock. It is only quite
recently that the use of arsenic has been banned as an additive to chicken feed in the
United States. So here you see the arsenic powder okay. Now
this is a metallic very dark metal, but I’m not going to open this because like I said
it’s very, very toxic. It’s a very dark metallic sample, you can see a very fine powder
in the bottom of this vial. Now I’m going to put this back in before I get any on my
skin because it’s a very toxic material and I don’t want to expose myself.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Nowadays, rather than as a pigment or a poison, arsenic has a more interesting and healthy application. As the professor explained, where can you find it at home?
Options: A. In mirrors, B. In windows, C. In transistors
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
Germanium is the first element in the periodic
table, beginning at hydrogen, that’s named after
a country: it is named after Germany. There are other elements
named after France and Poland and America but we will
come to those later. One of the things about Germanium and what
really makes it important in the periodic table is that this
is one of the elements which was unknown when Mendeleev
constructed the periodic table and he predicted its existence
and when it was found it had many of the properties that
he had predicted based on the change in properties
as you go down and across the periodic table. So this is a small sample of germanium, named
after Germany, so you can see the wonderful shiny
surfaces. Germanium is used quite widely as a so-called
semi- conducting material. If you look at it in
visible light it looks like a metal. Germanium na, na, n-na na. I have used germanium mirrors in some of my
experiments. The lasers that I used when I was younger
had a germanium mirror that let the light out at the front
of it and germanium is used quite widely in electronics. This is quite a nice piece of germanium. Unfortunately
I broke it somewhat earlier in my career, but you
can see very nicely how this material looks like a piece of metal
but on the other hand if you shine infrared light through it,
it’s transparent so the infrared light will through but visible
light doesn’t.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Like scandium and gallium, germanium was predicted to exist by Mendeleev. What was the name he gave to that undiscovered element at the time?
Options: A. Ekasilicon, B. Ekaboron, C. Ekaaluminium

That's what we like to see...haha Have this one handy as well.... So Zinc again is an abundant metal but it's a metal that we all need for life, it's part of enzymes and it's part of of many many biologically mediated processes. I don't know what else to say about Zinc it's a pretty boring metal.  It really is a boring metal. - Now I understand what my collegue said thinks bit boring. This isn't always the case and when you combine it with some other elements, it can get quite frisky, as you'll see in a bit. - Zinc is a really soft metal, it's sort of  greyish in colour, it reacts very easily with acids to produce hydrogen. In fact it's the way that people make hydrogen in the lab, or used to.  Now they usually buy it in cylinders. - Zinc is often found on things like roofs as well, very very high quality roofing material, very slow to oxidise. - Zinc is used very widely as a coating on iron. So called galvanizing. You put a thin layer of Zinc  and the Zinc then corrodes instead of the Iron, so that it stops the Iron rusting, at least for quite a long time. You can see it on corrugated iron roofs, metal gates in the countryside and so on. So this is Diethylzinc, so it's C4H10Zn.  - Zinc is quite important biologically, and there are all sorts of enzymes in our bodies that use Zinc. And particularly one called carbonic anhydrase that catalyse at the reaction of CO2 and water and so without Zinc, none of us could survive. The delivery of the statement that Zinc is boring were greatly under anticipating the result of this experiment. Really, you've built it up now. That's what we like to see. Have this one handy as well. Let's give this a go. - I told you to fix the stuff. So who says zinc's boring? Shall we do it again? Wow...No I don't think Zinc is in the least bit boring. I don't think that most elements are interesting, but Zinc is interesting because it's in the same group as Cadmium and Mercury and Cadmium and Mercury are both pretty poisonous. But Zinc is  essential to life. If you don't have enough Zinc you can't smell things. There are all sorts of enzymes in your body and those of other creatures, that won't work without Zinc. So it's really good. You may be bored about it, but if you didn't have Zinc, you wouldn't even be able to be bored. www.periodicvideos.com . . . . . . . . . . . .

And particularly one called carbonic anhydrase that catalyse at the reaction of CO2 and water and so without Zinc, none of us could survive. The delivery of the statement that Zinc is boring were greatly under anticipating the result of this experiment. Really, you've built it up now. That's what we like to see. Have this one handy as well. Let's give this a go. - I told you to fix the stuff. So who says zinc's boring? Shall we do it again? Wow...No I don't think Zinc is in the least bit boring. I don't think that most elements are interesting, but Zinc is interesting because it's in the same group as Cadmium and Mercury and Cadmium and Mercury are both pretty poisonous. But Zinc is  essential to life. If you don't have enough Zinc you can't smell things. There are all sorts of enzymes in your body and those of other creatures, that won't work without Zinc. So it's really good. You may be bored about it, but if you didn't have Zinc, you wouldn't even be able to be bored. www.periodicvideos.com . . . . . . . . . . . .
