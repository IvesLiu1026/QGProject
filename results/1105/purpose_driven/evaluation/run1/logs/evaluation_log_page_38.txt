**Transcript**:
What if, thousands of years from now, all
that was left of you…was your poop? I’m Anna Rothschild, and this is Gross Science. Every poop is a nugget of information. Poop records what we eat, where we live, even
how we died. So when archaeologists find the fossilized
poop of ancient humans, they get kind of excited. These poop fossils are called coprolites,
and they’re pretty rare. Although we make a lot of them, feces are
tough to preserve. But there are a few ways poop manages to stick
around for posterity. It can dry out—in caves or in a mummy’s
desiccated intestines. Particularly impressive poops can leave dents
in the earth that get filled in—creating a cast and mold of the ancient bowel movement. And a turd can also turn to stone, when minerals
in water slowly permeate and replace the molecules in the turd. Whatever else was in the poop gets mineralized
as well. Take this nearly 8-inch, 1000-year-old Viking
monstrosity discovered in England. The poor Viking who created this treasure
was infested with tons of intestinal parasites like whipworms, which were preserved along
with the giant poo, illustrating just how squalid everyday life was back then. And this guy wasn’t an anomaly—archaeologists
have also found cesspits (essentially Viking sewers) that were filled with parasite eggs. Poop can also tell us who was living where. In Puerto Rico, the contents of 1-2 millennia-old
coprolites backed up the archaeological evidence that native populations on the island at the
time were two distinct cultural groups, with different diets, and different parasites. Fossilized turds can even shed light on ancient
murder mysteries. In Medieval Verona, the warlord Cangrande
della Scala—patron of the poet Dante Alighieri—died at the age of 38 after a severe bout of vomiting
and diarrhea. Rumors of foul-play spread, though at the
time no one could prove it. But nearly 700 years later, researchers dug
up the body and analyzed the feces that were preserved in the corpse’s rectum. They found out that he had ingested a poisonous
plant before he died. And from the chamomile and mulberry pollen
preserved in the poop as well, the researchers surmised that he drank a poisoned tea that
killed him. So the next time you grab your newspaper and
head to the bathroom, think about it not so much as going number 2, but as contributing
to the archaeological record. Ew.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8: What is the purpose of analyzing the feces of ancient humans? Options: A. To determine their social status, B. To understand their diet and lifestyle, C. To identify the cause of death, D. To determine their place of origin.

However, the options in Question 8 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question with options that include inferring living conditions, identifying parasites, determining the cause of death, and understanding diet.

Since none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that best aligns with the intent and content.

A better match would be a combination of Question 5 and Question 8, but since I can only choose one, I will choose Question 8 as the closest match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the options in Question 2 do not directly answer the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses the meaning of the word "desiccated" in the context of the video lesson.

Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs directly ask about the meaning of the word "desiccated". However, Question 2 does mention "desiccated intestines" in one of its options, which is related to the context of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose from the provided options, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match, but it's not a perfect match.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
What if, thousands of years from now, all
that was left of you…was your poop? I’m Anna Rothschild, and this is Gross Science. Every poop is a nugget of information. Poop records what we eat, where we live, even
how we died. So when archaeologists find the fossilized
poop of ancient humans, they get kind of excited. These poop fossils are called coprolites,
and they’re pretty rare. Although we make a lot of them, feces are
tough to preserve. But there are a few ways poop manages to stick
around for posterity. It can dry out—in caves or in a mummy’s
desiccated intestines. Particularly impressive poops can leave dents
in the earth that get filled in—creating a cast and mold of the ancient bowel movement. And a turd can also turn to stone, when minerals
in water slowly permeate and replace the molecules in the turd. Whatever else was in the poop gets mineralized
as well. Take this nearly 8-inch, 1000-year-old Viking
monstrosity discovered in England. The poor Viking who created this treasure
was infested with tons of intestinal parasites like whipworms, which were preserved along
with the giant poo, illustrating just how squalid everyday life was back then. And this guy wasn’t an anomaly—archaeologists
have also found cesspits (essentially Viking sewers) that were filled with parasite eggs. Poop can also tell us who was living where. In Puerto Rico, the contents of 1-2 millennia-old
coprolites backed up the archaeological evidence that native populations on the island at the
time were two distinct cultural groups, with different diets, and different parasites. Fossilized turds can even shed light on ancient
murder mysteries. In Medieval Verona, the warlord Cangrande
della Scala—patron of the poet Dante Alighieri—died at the age of 38 after a severe bout of vomiting
and diarrhea. Rumors of foul-play spread, though at the
time no one could prove it. But nearly 700 years later, researchers dug
up the body and analyzed the feces that were preserved in the corpse’s rectum. They found out that he had ingested a poisonous
plant before he died. And from the chamomile and mulberry pollen
preserved in the poop as well, the researchers surmised that he drank a poisoned tea that
killed him. So the next time you grab your newspaper and
head to the bathroom, think about it not so much as going number 2, but as contributing
to the archaeological record. Ew.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8: What is the purpose of analyzing the feces of ancient humans? Options: A. To determine their social status, B. To understand their diet and lifestyle, C. To identify the cause of death, D. To determine their place of origin.

However, the options in Question 8 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question with options that include inferring living conditions, identifying parasites, determining the cause of death, and understanding diet.

Since none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that best aligns with the intent and content.

A better match would be a combination of Question 5 and Question 8, but since I can only choose one, I will choose Question 8 as the closest match.

in water slowly permeate and replace the molecules in the turd. Whatever else was in the poop gets mineralized
as well. Take this nearly 8-inch, 1000-year-old Viking
monstrosity discovered in England. The poor Viking who created this treasure
was infested with tons of intestinal parasites like whipworms, which were preserved along
with the giant poo, illustrating just how squalid everyday life was back then. And this guy wasn’t an anomaly—archaeologists
have also found cesspits (essentially Viking sewers) that were filled with parasite eggs. Poop can also tell us who was living where. In Puerto Rico, the contents of 1-2 millennia-old
coprolites backed up the archaeological evidence that native populations on the island at the
time were two distinct cultural groups, with different diets, and different parasites. Fossilized turds can even shed light on ancient
murder mysteries. In Medieval Verona, the warlord Cangrande
della Scala—patron of the poet Dante Alighieri—died at the age of 38 after a severe bout of vomiting
and diarrhea. Rumors of foul-play spread, though at the
time no one could prove it. But nearly 700 years later, researchers dug
up the body and analyzed the feces that were preserved in the corpse’s rectum. They found out that he had ingested a poisonous
plant before he died. And from the chamomile and mulberry pollen
preserved in the poop as well, the researchers surmised that he drank a poisoned tea that
killed him. So the next time you grab your newspaper and
head to the bathroom, think about it not so much as going number 2, but as contributing
to the archaeological record. Ew.

poop of ancient humans, they get kind of excited. These poop fossils are called coprolites,
and they’re pretty rare. Although we make a lot of them, feces are
tough to preserve. But there are a few ways poop manages to stick
around for posterity. It can dry out—in caves or in a mummy’s
desiccated intestines. Particularly impressive poops can leave dents
