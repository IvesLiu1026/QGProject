**Transcript**:
Day after day, the twin brothers,
Jun and Wuqub, ran back and forth playing ball. One day, their vigorous game disturbed
the lords of the underworld, who challenged the twins to a match. But when the brothers arrived, 
the lords trapped and killed them, hanging Jun’s head 
from a tree as a trophy. The tree soon sprouted massive fruit, which caught the attention 
of one of the lords’ daughters. When she reached for it, 
the skull of Jun spat on her hand and impregnated her. Fleeing of her father’s wrath, she sought refuge with her mother-in-law
and gave birth to twin sons: Junajpu and Ixb’alanke. The second generation of twins discovered 
their father’s ballgame equipment, which their grandmother had hidden, 
and began to play. Soon enough, the messengers 
from the underworld arrived to issue another challenge. Knowing what had happened
to their fathers, the twins nevertheless answered the call, trekking through deep caverns and across rivers filled 
with scorpions, blood, and pus, until they reached the great city from which the lords of the underworld
controlled every aspect of nature and caused suffering for humans. The twins pressed on, searching 
for the lords who had challenged them. The lords had hidden among statues 
of themselves to confuse their guests, but the brothers sent a mosquito 
ahead of them. When it stung the figures, 
the lords cried out, revealing themselves. They forced the twins to spend 
the night in the House of Darkness. They gave them a torch, but warned they
must return it unburnt or face death. As the darkness closed in, the quick-thinking brothers 
adorned the torch with red macaw feathers and fireflies. Come morning, the lords were shocked
to see the torch lit, but unburnt. They insisted on playing the game
with their own ball. The twins agreed, only to find 
that the lords had hidden a weapon inside the ball, which chased them around the court,
trying to kill them. The twins survived that first round, but by now they were sure 
this would be no ordinary match. They played many more rounds, and each time the twins scored
no better than a tie, leaving them to face 
whatever supernatural trial the lords set for them 
before picking up the game again. They survived the House of Cold
by lighting a fire, and the House of Jaguars by feeding
bones to the beasts. But in the House of Bats, 
a bat bit off Junajpu’s head. Certain they now had the advantage, the lords called for another round 
of the ballgame, hanging Junajpu’s head over the court. The quick-thinking Ixb’alanke
called the animals to him. A turtle brought him a chilacayote squash, and he carved it into the likeness 
of a head. While the lords chased the ball,
he swapped it with the head. With Junajpu’s head back on his body,
the twins played harder than ever. Finally, they won the game, hitting the hanging squash 
so it shattered on the ground. The twins knew their treacherous hosts
would not take the loss well. To protect themselves,
they enlisted a pair of seers. Sure enough, the lords burned
the brothers in an oven, but the seers made sure their remains
were thrown in the river, which restored them to life. The brothers then came before the lords
disguised as two disheveled children and began to dance and perform miracles. For their final trick, 
Ixb’alanke pretended to kill Junajpu, then resurrect him. The lords were so delighted 
that they demanded the same trick be performed on them. Still in disguise, the brothers were 
only too happy to oblige, and began killing the lords one by one. As the surviving lords realized 
who stood before them and that no resurrection was forthcoming, they begged for mercy,
and the twins spoke their curse. Henceforth, the lords would have
no sacrifices and no power over the surface world. Their days of terrorizing humans 
were over.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 9: How did the twins restore their lives after being burned in the oven? Options: A. They were resurrected by a magical plant., B. They were brought back to life by the river., C. They were revived by a seer., D. They were healed by a doctor.**

Although the question content is not an exact match, the intent and the options are related to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks if the twins act alone during the entire game, and the correct option is that they summon the seers. In Question 9, the twins are restored to life with the help of the seers (and the river), which is a related concept.

However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not have a direct match with the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs seem to focus more on specific events in the story rather than the overall theme or character actions.

If I had to choose an index, I would say:

**Index: 9**

Please keep in mind that this is an approximation, and a more accurate match might require rephrasing or re generating the MCQs to better align with the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Day after day, the twin brothers,
Jun and Wuqub, ran back and forth playing ball. One day, their vigorous game disturbed
the lords of the underworld, who challenged the twins to a match. But when the brothers arrived, 
the lords trapped and killed them, hanging Jun’s head 
from a tree as a trophy. The tree soon sprouted massive fruit, which caught the attention 
of one of the lords’ daughters. When she reached for it, 
the skull of Jun spat on her hand and impregnated her. Fleeing of her father’s wrath, she sought refuge with her mother-in-law
and gave birth to twin sons: Junajpu and Ixb’alanke. The second generation of twins discovered 
their father’s ballgame equipment, which their grandmother had hidden, 
and began to play. Soon enough, the messengers 
from the underworld arrived to issue another challenge. Knowing what had happened
to their fathers, the twins nevertheless answered the call, trekking through deep caverns and across rivers filled 
with scorpions, blood, and pus, until they reached the great city from which the lords of the underworld
controlled every aspect of nature and caused suffering for humans. The twins pressed on, searching 
for the lords who had challenged them. The lords had hidden among statues 
of themselves to confuse their guests, but the brothers sent a mosquito 
ahead of them. When it stung the figures, 
the lords cried out, revealing themselves. They forced the twins to spend 
the night in the House of Darkness. They gave them a torch, but warned they
must return it unburnt or face death. As the darkness closed in, the quick-thinking brothers 
adorned the torch with red macaw feathers and fireflies. Come morning, the lords were shocked
to see the torch lit, but unburnt. They insisted on playing the game
with their own ball. The twins agreed, only to find 
that the lords had hidden a weapon inside the ball, which chased them around the court,
trying to kill them. The twins survived that first round, but by now they were sure 
this would be no ordinary match. They played many more rounds, and each time the twins scored
no better than a tie, leaving them to face 
whatever supernatural trial the lords set for them 
before picking up the game again. They survived the House of Cold
by lighting a fire, and the House of Jaguars by feeding
bones to the beasts. But in the House of Bats, 
a bat bit off Junajpu’s head. Certain they now had the advantage, the lords called for another round 
of the ballgame, hanging Junajpu’s head over the court. The quick-thinking Ixb’alanke
called the animals to him. A turtle brought him a chilacayote squash, and he carved it into the likeness 
of a head. While the lords chased the ball,
he swapped it with the head. With Junajpu’s head back on his body,
the twins played harder than ever. Finally, they won the game, hitting the hanging squash 
so it shattered on the ground. The twins knew their treacherous hosts
would not take the loss well. To protect themselves,
they enlisted a pair of seers. Sure enough, the lords burned
the brothers in an oven, but the seers made sure their remains
were thrown in the river, which restored them to life. The brothers then came before the lords
disguised as two disheveled children and began to dance and perform miracles. For their final trick, 
Ixb’alanke pretended to kill Junajpu, then resurrect him. The lords were so delighted 
that they demanded the same trick be performed on them. Still in disguise, the brothers were 
only too happy to oblige, and began killing the lords one by one. As the surviving lords realized 
who stood before them and that no resurrection was forthcoming, they begged for mercy,
and the twins spoke their curse. Henceforth, the lords would have
no sacrifices and no power over the surface world. Their days of terrorizing humans 
were over.

**Transcript**:
A leather mask that clamps the mouth shut. A cannonball sewn 
into a soldier’s uniform. And a machine that delivers 
sudden electrical pulses. These old items were all
intended treatments for a problem that has haunted humanity
for millennia: snoring. It might seem harmless, but snoring can
be a sign of something more dangerous. So, what exactly causes snoring? 
And when does it become a problem? A snore’s quality can range from a
gentle mew to a stuttering chainsaw— but all snores originate 
from the respiratory tract, which is lined with soft tissues. During sleep, the muscles 
around these tissues relax, narrowing the airway. Many factors, including congestion, 
anatomical features, and the position you’re sleeping in, can further constrict this passage 
and lead to or exacerbate snoring. The narrower the respiratory tract is,
the stronger the airflow, and the more those relaxed tissues 
may vibrate, producing sound. Most of us will snore at some point
in our lives. But loud, chronic snoring is one sign 
of a sleep disorder known as obstructive sleep apnea. It affects about a quarter of all adults, but it’s estimated that around 80%
of people who suffer from it aren’t aware they have it. This is especially troublesome because it 
can lead to serious cardiovascular issues. Obstructive sleep apnea is usually
caused by blockages in the airway and is mainly characterized by pauses
in breathing during sleep. There's one other kind of sleep apnea
called central sleep apnea, which occurs when the brain temporarily
fails to regulate the body's breathing. This condition isn't as common, and snoring is usually 
a less prominent feature— though you can have both. If you’re experiencing 
obstructive sleep apnea, you might stop breathing for 10 or more
seconds before waking, sometimes without realizing it,
to catch your breath. In doing so, you might make 
a snorting or a choking sound. This may happen five times an hour, though in severe cases,
it could occur more than 30. And it's a problem because your tissues
are getting less oxygen. As you experience periods
of low oxygen intake, your body releases stress hormones. And your blood vessels constrict to get
oxygenated blood to your vital organs. This increases your blood pressure 
and puts additional stress on your heart. And this is why obstructive sleep apnea
can be linked to hypertension and other cardiovascular problems. Your difficulty breathing and poor-quality
rest may also lead to headaches, decreased concentration,
and chronic fatigue. So what puts someone at risk of developing
obstructive sleep apnea? Features like larger tongues, 
thicker necks, and smaller jaws can make people more susceptible. Older people are more at risk 
because, as we age, our soft tissues loosen,
further narrowing our airways. Drinking alcohol before going to sleep
can cause excessive relaxation of our throat and jaw muscles. And one of the main contributors 
to obstructive sleep apnea is weight gain because more tissue around the neck
can constrict the airway. Many researchers see weight loss 
as a solution to obstructive sleep apnea. Certain behavioral shifts, like limiting
your alcohol consumption before bed, elevating your head, and avoiding 
sleeping on your back may also help. For people who have a milder condition, mouth and throat exercises have been shown
to alleviate obstructive sleep apnea in some preliminary trials. But these approaches, 
and devices like oral appliances, may not always be sufficient. Sleep apnea can be reliably
treated using CPAP machines, which keep the airway open by delivering
a constant stream of pressurized air. Doctors will usually aim to remedy sleep
apnea with non-invasive treatments like these first, but if they don’t work,
they may consider surgery. Snores can be silly. But intense ones are well-worth 
investigating with a doctor. After all, everyone needs a chance 
to catch their breath— and some z’s...

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

Although Question 9 does not directly ask about the potential consequences of sleep apnea if left untreated, its options (headaches, decreased concentration, and chronic fatigue) are mentioned in the transcript as complications of obstructive sleep apnea. Moreover, the transcript also mentions that obstructive sleep apnea can lead to serious cardiovascular issues, including high blood pressure, if left untreated.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the potential consequences of sleep apnea. Among the provided options, Question 5 is the most relevant, as it discusses the effects of low oxygen intake due to obstructive sleep apnea on blood vessels, which is related to the development of high blood pressure.

**Transcript**:
A leather mask that clamps the mouth shut. A cannonball sewn 
into a soldier’s uniform. And a machine that delivers 
sudden electrical pulses. These old items were all
intended treatments for a problem that has haunted humanity
for millennia: snoring. It might seem harmless, but snoring can
be a sign of something more dangerous. So, what exactly causes snoring? 
And when does it become a problem? A snore’s quality can range from a
gentle mew to a stuttering chainsaw— but all snores originate 
from the respiratory tract, which is lined with soft tissues. During sleep, the muscles 
around these tissues relax, narrowing the airway. Many factors, including congestion, 
anatomical features, and the position you’re sleeping in, can further constrict this passage 
and lead to or exacerbate snoring. The narrower the respiratory tract is,
the stronger the airflow, and the more those relaxed tissues 
may vibrate, producing sound. Most of us will snore at some point
in our lives. But loud, chronic snoring is one sign 
of a sleep disorder known as obstructive sleep apnea. It affects about a quarter of all adults, but it’s estimated that around 80%
of people who suffer from it aren’t aware they have it. This is especially troublesome because it 
can lead to serious cardiovascular issues. Obstructive sleep apnea is usually
caused by blockages in the airway and is mainly characterized by pauses
in breathing during sleep. There's one other kind of sleep apnea
called central sleep apnea, which occurs when the brain temporarily
fails to regulate the body's breathing. This condition isn't as common, and snoring is usually 
a less prominent feature— though you can have both. If you’re experiencing 
obstructive sleep apnea, you might stop breathing for 10 or more
seconds before waking, sometimes without realizing it,
to catch your breath. In doing so, you might make 
a snorting or a choking sound. This may happen five times an hour, though in severe cases,
it could occur more than 30. And it's a problem because your tissues
are getting less oxygen. As you experience periods
of low oxygen intake, your body releases stress hormones. And your blood vessels constrict to get
oxygenated blood to your vital organs. This increases your blood pressure 
and puts additional stress on your heart. And this is why obstructive sleep apnea
can be linked to hypertension and other cardiovascular problems. Your difficulty breathing and poor-quality
rest may also lead to headaches, decreased concentration,
and chronic fatigue. So what puts someone at risk of developing
obstructive sleep apnea? Features like larger tongues, 
thicker necks, and smaller jaws can make people more susceptible. Older people are more at risk 
because, as we age, our soft tissues loosen,
further narrowing our airways. Drinking alcohol before going to sleep
can cause excessive relaxation of our throat and jaw muscles. And one of the main contributors 
to obstructive sleep apnea is weight gain because more tissue around the neck
can constrict the airway. Many researchers see weight loss 
as a solution to obstructive sleep apnea. Certain behavioral shifts, like limiting
your alcohol consumption before bed, elevating your head, and avoiding 
sleeping on your back may also help. For people who have a milder condition, mouth and throat exercises have been shown
to alleviate obstructive sleep apnea in some preliminary trials. But these approaches, 
and devices like oral appliances, may not always be sufficient. Sleep apnea can be reliably
treated using CPAP machines, which keep the airway open by delivering
a constant stream of pressurized air. Doctors will usually aim to remedy sleep
apnea with non-invasive treatments like these first, but if they don’t work,
they may consider surgery. Snores can be silly. But intense ones are well-worth 
investigating with a doctor. After all, everyone needs a chance 
to catch their breath— and some z’s...

**Transcript**:
These eight ferocious notes open one of the most explosive pieces
of music ever composed. Ludwig van Beethoven’s 
Symphony Number Five premiered in 1808, 
on a blisteringly cold Vienna night. The piece was just one small part
of a lengthy program, and the orchestra had been hastily
assembled and under-rehearsed. But despite this inauspicious premiere,
the symphony quickly won acclaim. One critic likened the piece 
to “glowing beams of light, piercing through the darkness.” This intensity persists
throughout the composition, and its dramatic musicality continues
to move listeners today. So what exactly makes 
Beethoven’s Fifth so captivating? When the symphony premiered, Beethoven
already had a formidable reputation. While his peers produced music exclusively
for religious functions or private events held by their wealthy patrons, Beethoven was one of the first
freelance composers. He made his living 
composing and selling his music to publishers in multiple countries and showcasing his compositions
to an adoring public. This career choice gave him the 
flexibility to compose for self-expression and Beethoven was always pursuing new ways to translate his powerful emotions 
into music. At the time, most composers worked
within the Classical style, which offered limited options 
for a piece’s overarching structure and instrumentation. Beethoven composed most 
of his earlier pieces in this tradition, following in the footsteps 
of role models like Mozart and Haydn. But with his Fifth Symphony, he
experimented with elements of Romanticism. This blossoming mode of composition was
known for its expressive melodies, extended forms 
and surprising instrumentations. The first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth
uses a Classical sonata form, in which a central musical idea 
is explored, developed, and repeated in an altered manner. Within these parameters, he explores 
a simple idea with incredible depth. A single rhythmic motif serves as the 
building block for most of the movement: three short notes, 
followed by a lingering fourth. One of Beethoven’s biographers would 
later call this pattern the “fate motif,” because it suggests
the figure of fate knocking at the door. While it's not clear if Beethoven composed
the motif with fate in mind, these notes certainly create
a gripping hook. The rhythmic pattern creates
forward movement, while the prolonged fourth note 
signals doom. This motif haunts the symphony, including its accompanying parts
and rhythmic flourishes. Beethoven experiments with dozens 
of variations, playing out across different 
instruments and pitches. Throughout the piece, this motif is passed
around the orchestra like a whisper, gradually reaching more and more 
instruments until it becomes a roar. The motif’s inventive repetition 
is a large part of what makes this piece so memorable, but it’s not the only innovation 
on display. This was the first major orchestral
composition to use trombones, and Beethoven also employs 
a high-pitched piccolo and a low-pitched contrabassoon to give the orchestra a wider range 
than most classical compositions. Exaggerated musical dynamics
further heighten the drama. And harmonically, the piece has
a clear emotional arc— beginning in a somber C minor 
and ending in a triumphant C major. This progression, from ominous unease
to majestic resolution, is a testament to Beethoven’s ability 
to inject raw emotionality into his music. He wrote this symphony 
while battling with hearing loss, and his anguish can be heard 
in the composition’s thunderous and repeating musical phrases. Beethoven continued to compose even
after he became completely deaf, producing innovative music
until his death in 1827. And the Fifth Symphony’s central motif 
has continued to resound through the ages. Outside of concert halls, the piece has become a symbol 
for suspense, revelation, and triumph. The fate motif sounds out the letter V 
in Morse code, and during World War II, the Fifth Symphony became a code 
for victory amongst the Allies. The iconic composition can
be found in film scores, and it’s even been explored through
musical reinterpretations and visual art. But whatever the context, Beethoven’s Fifth takes its listeners 
through a dark world, then guides them into the light.

uses a Classical sonata form, in which a central musical idea 
is explored, developed, and repeated in an altered manner. Within these parameters, he explores 
a simple idea with incredible depth. A single rhythmic motif serves as the 
building block for most of the movement: three short notes, 
followed by a lingering fourth. One of Beethoven’s biographers would 
later call this pattern the “fate motif,” because it suggests
the figure of fate knocking at the door. While it's not clear if Beethoven composed
the motif with fate in mind, these notes certainly create
a gripping hook. The rhythmic pattern creates
forward movement, while the prolonged fourth note 
signals doom. This motif haunts the symphony, including its accompanying parts
and rhythmic flourishes. Beethoven experiments with dozens 
of variations, playing out across different 
instruments and pitches. Throughout the piece, this motif is passed
around the orchestra like a whisper, gradually reaching more and more 
instruments until it becomes a roar. The motif’s inventive repetition 
is a large part of what makes this piece so memorable, but it’s not the only innovation 
on display. This was the first major orchestral
composition to use trombones, and Beethoven also employs 
a high-pitched piccolo and a low-pitched contrabassoon to give the orchestra a wider range 
than most classical compositions. Exaggerated musical dynamics
further heighten the drama. And harmonically, the piece has
a clear emotional arc— beginning in a somber C minor 
and ending in a triumphant C major. This progression, from ominous unease
to majestic resolution, is a testament to Beethoven’s ability 
to inject raw emotionality into his music. He wrote this symphony 
while battling with hearing loss, and his anguish can be heard 
in the composition’s thunderous and repeating musical phrases. Beethoven continued to compose even
after he became completely deaf, producing innovative music
until his death in 1827. And the Fifth Symphony’s central motif 
has continued to resound through the ages. Outside of concert halls, the piece has become a symbol 
for suspense, revelation, and triumph. The fate motif sounds out the letter V 
in Morse code, and during World War II, the Fifth Symphony became a code 
for victory amongst the Allies. The iconic composition can
be found in film scores, and it’s even been explored through
musical reinterpretations and visual art. But whatever the context, Beethoven’s Fifth takes its listeners 
through a dark world, then guides them into the light.

**Transcript**:
These eight ferocious notes open one of the most explosive pieces
of music ever composed. Ludwig van Beethoven’s 
Symphony Number Five premiered in 1808, 
on a blisteringly cold Vienna night. The piece was just one small part
of a lengthy program, and the orchestra had been hastily
assembled and under-rehearsed. But despite this inauspicious premiere,
the symphony quickly won acclaim. One critic likened the piece 
to “glowing beams of light, piercing through the darkness.” This intensity persists
throughout the composition, and its dramatic musicality continues
to move listeners today. So what exactly makes 
Beethoven’s Fifth so captivating? When the symphony premiered, Beethoven
already had a formidable reputation. While his peers produced music exclusively
for religious functions or private events held by their wealthy patrons, Beethoven was one of the first
freelance composers. He made his living 
composing and selling his music to publishers in multiple countries and showcasing his compositions
to an adoring public. This career choice gave him the 
flexibility to compose for self-expression and Beethoven was always pursuing new ways to translate his powerful emotions 
into music. At the time, most composers worked
within the Classical style, which offered limited options 
for a piece’s overarching structure and instrumentation. Beethoven composed most 
of his earlier pieces in this tradition, following in the footsteps 
of role models like Mozart and Haydn. But with his Fifth Symphony, he
experimented with elements of Romanticism. This blossoming mode of composition was
known for its expressive melodies, extended forms 
and surprising instrumentations. The first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth
uses a Classical sonata form, in which a central musical idea 
is explored, developed, and repeated in an altered manner. Within these parameters, he explores

- This is the most dangerous
problem in mathematics, one that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's
best mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're gonna apply two rules. If the number is odd, we
multiply by three and add one. So three times seven
is 21, plus one is 22. If the number is even, we divide by two. So 22 divided by two is 11. Now, we keep applying these two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply
by 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by two, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by two, 26, still even. Divide by two, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39,
add one, and that's 40, which is even, so we divide by two, 20, divide by two, 10,
divide by two, five, odd. Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16, divide by two that's eight,
and then four, two, and one. Now, one is odd, so we
multiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one, so we're in a loop, and
the lowest number is one. Now, the conjecture is this: every positive integer,
if you apply these rules, will eventually end up in
the four, two, one loop. This is commonly called
the Collatz conjecture after German mathematician,
Luther Collatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many
origin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1. Why is 3x+1 so famous? - Among professional mathematicians, maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone
actually admits in public that they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them. (laughs) - [Narrator] The numbers
you get by applying 3x+1 are called hailstone numbers, because they go up and down like hailstones in a thundercloud, but eventually, they all fall down to one, or at least we think they do. You can think of the numbers as representing the height
above the ground in meters. So a number like 26 would start
26 meters above the ground. And if you apply 3x+1, it rises up as high as 40 meters. And, in total, it takes
10 steps to get to one. So 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all
the way up to 9,232. As an altitude, that is
higher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground. In total, it takes 111 steps
for 27 to get down to one and end up in the four, two, one loop. The paths that different
numbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other. So how do you even start to
make progress on this problem? Well, honestly, mathematicians struggled. - People just decided that this was something
invented by the Soviets to slow down U.S. science, and it was doing a good job at it 'cause everybody's sitting
there twiddling their thumbs and making no progress
on this trivial thing that you can tell a school of children. - [Narrator] Jeffrey Lagarias is the world authority on 3x+1. - The first time I met him
I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and
he said, "Don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending
time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while
to establish yourself." - [Narrator] Alex
Kontorovich didn't listen. He and Yakov Sinai looked at the paths of
the hailstone numbers. Were there any patterns? But obviously all of them ended up at one. But what about the paths
they take to get there? The pattern is randomness. Here is the sequence of a
large number chosen at random. The graph peaks and then drop so low that you can't really see
what's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm, you find this wiggly graph
with a downward trend. It looks like the stock
market on a bad day. And this is no coincidence. Both are examples of
geometric Brownian motion. That means if you take the log
and remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up, tails, it goes down. 3x+1 is just like the random
wiggles of the stock market. Over long-enough periods, the stock market tends to trend upwards, while 3x+1 trends down. Another way to analyze 3x+1 is by looking at the
leading digit of each number in a sequence. Here are the hailstone
numbers starting with three as the seed. And we can count up how many
numbers start with a one, how many start with a two, how many start with a three,
and so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the sequence that starts with four,
and that's a short one, and for the sequences that
start with five, six, and seven. Again, for each sequence, we're just counting up how many numbers start with each digit, one through nine, and adding that to our histogram. If you keep doing this
for more and more numbers, eventually the histogram
settles into a stable pattern. For the first billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the
most common leading digit. 30% of all numbers start with one, around 17.5% start with
two, 12% start with three, and the frequency decreases
for higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the
numbers start with nine. Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x+1. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries, to the value of companies, all the physical constants
and the Fibonacci numbers, just to name a few. The distribution is
known as Benford's law, and it is even used to detect fraud. If all the numbers on
your income tax forms obey Benford's law, then, well, you're probably being honest. If not, you may be hiding something. In elections, Benford's law can be used to spot irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best
when the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude as they do for 3x+1. But Benford's law can't tell us whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop or not. For that, we need a
different sort of analysis. Now, at first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x+1, all numbers should end up at one. I mean, consider that
there are the same number of odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in half. Therefore, it seems like
every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the catch. Every time you multiply
an odd number by three and then add one, it will
always become an even number, and that means the next
step is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not
actually tripled by 3x+1. They're increased by a factor
of about three over two. I'm neglecting the plus one because it's insignificant
for large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the
numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up
under the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest
living mathematicians, Terry Tao, was able to show 3x+1 obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all
numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x so long as that function goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise
as slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,
for almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples. - It had happened to
me just two years ago, where there was something
I was trying to prove, that I was trying for
three years to prove, and I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counterexample, and then I realized what
the correct statement should have been. And then a month later, I
proved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples
than we're currently spending. - [Narrator] I mean,
remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number
reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can
be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example,
climbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just
shoot off to infinity. And it would take only one
to disprove the conjecture, or some set of numbers
could be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is
only one loop: four, two, one. But something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low
values like -17 and -5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most
convincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture
is Terry Tao's proof that almost all numbers have
a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all
numbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as
proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are
not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite
number of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has
transformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you
like, so long as it is finite. But if you want a number that
increases by three over two five consecutive times, you
can calculate that number. If you want a number that
climbs by three over two 10 times in a row, or
100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been
tested, always falls to one. If there is a counterexample, it's virtually impossible
that someone's gonna guess it. And the space of all possibilities is too big to search
exhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by
some intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false. And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling to prove this thing because
it's not actually true? And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence. And even the statistical
version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created
a generalization of 3x+1. It was a mathematical machine
that he called FRACTRAN. And he was able to show this
machine is turing-complete, which means it can do anything
a modern computer can do, but it also means that it's
subject to the halting problem, a chance that the machine
never stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject
to the halting problem, but it is possible that
given what we know, we may never prove the Collatz
conjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of
stuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows
that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems. - For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as
these incredibly regular things full of patterns,
symmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly
in the coral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,
organic-looking, and, thus far, intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to the structure, or is there some unique filament,
a spindly little thread, that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it so hard to tell? I think that's why Paul Erdos said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." (gentle music) What I love about 3x+1 is it's a problem almost
anyone can understand and play around with. And actually trying to figure
things out for yourself is the best way to learn, which is why I subscribed to Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Now, recently, Brilliant have
upped their interactivity. For example, here is a great lesson on the Pythagorean theorem. So, you don't just remember the formula, but you really understand what it means. Now, Brilliant is a website and an app designed to get you thinking deeply by engaging you in problem-solving. It's one thing to read through a textbook and think that you get it, but it's quite another
to play with interactives and actually test yourself as you go, and Brilliant curates the experiences so they get more and more
challenging over time. There's always a helpful
tip or explanation that takes your understanding
to the next level. I'd highly recommend their course on mathematical fundamentals, which now has even more interactivity and it has topics that are
relevant to all areas of STEM and algorithm fundamentals for
anyone interested in coding. It's great to have a resource like this to inspire you to learn
something new every single day. I try to start off my day by challenging myself with Brilliant. And so if you'd like to join me and a community of 8
million other learners, go to brilliant.org/veritasium. I will put that link
down in the description. So I wanna thank Brilliant
for sponsoring this video, and I wanna thank you for watching.

**Transcript**:
- This is the most dangerous
problem in mathematics, one that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's
best mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're gonna apply two rules. If the number is odd, we
multiply by three and add one. So three times seven
is 21, plus one is 22. If the number is even, we divide by two. So 22 divided by two is 11. Now, we keep applying these two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply
by 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by two, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by two, 26, still even. Divide by two, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39,
add one, and that's 40, which is even, so we divide by two, 20, divide by two, 10,
divide by two, five, odd. Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16, divide by two that's eight,
and then four, two, and one. Now, one is odd, so we
multiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one, so we're in a loop, and
the lowest number is one. Now, the conjecture is this: every positive integer,
if you apply these rules, will eventually end up in
the four, two, one loop. This is commonly called
the Collatz conjecture after German mathematician,
Luther Collatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many
origin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1. Why is 3x+1 so famous? - Among professional mathematicians, maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone

I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and

the hailstone numbers. Were there any patterns? But obviously all of them ended up at one. But what about the paths

can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the
numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up
under the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest
living mathematicians, Terry Tao, was able to show 3x+1 obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all
numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x so long as that function goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise
as slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,
for almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples. - It had happened to
me just two years ago, where there was something
I was trying to prove, that I was trying for
three years to prove, and I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counterexample, and then I realized what
the correct statement should have been. And then a month later, I
proved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples
than we're currently spending. - [Narrator] I mean,
remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number
reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can
be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example,
climbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just
shoot off to infinity. And it would take only one
to disprove the conjecture, or some set of numbers
could be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is
only one loop: four, two, one. But something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low
values like -17 and -5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most
convincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture
is Terry Tao's proof that almost all numbers have
a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all
numbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as
proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are
not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite
number of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has
transformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you
like, so long as it is finite. But if you want a number that
increases by three over two five consecutive times, you
can calculate that number. If you want a number that
climbs by three over two 10 times in a row, or
100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been
tested, always falls to one. If there is a counterexample, it's virtually impossible
that someone's gonna guess it. And the space of all possibilities is too big to search
exhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by
some intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false. And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling to prove this thing because
it's not actually true? And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence. And even the statistical
version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created
a generalization of 3x+1. It was a mathematical machine
that he called FRACTRAN. And he was able to show this
machine is turing-complete, which means it can do anything
a modern computer can do, but it also means that it's
subject to the halting problem, a chance that the machine
never stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject
to the halting problem, but it is possible that
given what we know, we may never prove the Collatz
conjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of
stuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows
that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems. - For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as
these incredibly regular things full of patterns,
symmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly
in the coral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,
organic-looking, and, thus far, intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to the structure, or is there some unique filament,
a spindly little thread, that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it so hard to tell? I think that's why Paul Erdos said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." (gentle music) What I love about 3x+1 is it's a problem almost
anyone can understand and play around with. And actually trying to figure
things out for yourself is the best way to learn, which is why I subscribed to Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Now, recently, Brilliant have
upped their interactivity. For example, here is a great lesson on the Pythagorean theorem. So, you don't just remember the formula, but you really understand what it means. Now, Brilliant is a website and an app designed to get you thinking deeply by engaging you in problem-solving. It's one thing to read through a textbook and think that you get it, but it's quite another
to play with interactives and actually test yourself as you go, and Brilliant curates the experiences so they get more and more
challenging over time. There's always a helpful
tip or explanation that takes your understanding
to the next level. I'd highly recommend their course on mathematical fundamentals, which now has even more interactivity and it has topics that are
relevant to all areas of STEM and algorithm fundamentals for
anyone interested in coding. It's great to have a resource like this to inspire you to learn
something new every single day. I try to start off my day by challenging myself with Brilliant. And so if you'd like to join me and a community of 8
million other learners, go to brilliant.org/veritasium. I will put that link
down in the description. So I wanna thank Brilliant
for sponsoring this video, and I wanna thank you for watching.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the name of the numbers obtained when applying the 3x+1 rule, and the correct answer is "Hailstone numbers".

Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 mentions "hailstone numbers" in the context of Benford's law, but it does not ask about the name of the numbers.

Since there is no exact match, I will not provide an index. However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2, which mentions "hailstone numbers" in a different context.

To create a more similar MCQ, I would suggest generating a new question that asks about the name of the numbers obtained when applying the 3x+1 rule, with options similar to the ground truth MCQ. For example:

**Transcript**:
- This is the most dangerous
problem in mathematics, one that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's
best mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're gonna apply two rules. If the number is odd, we
multiply by three and add one. So three times seven
is 21, plus one is 22. If the number is even, we divide by two. So 22 divided by two is 11. Now, we keep applying these two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply
by 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by two, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by two, 26, still even. Divide by two, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39,
add one, and that's 40, which is even, so we divide by two, 20, divide by two, 10,
divide by two, five, odd. Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16, divide by two that's eight,
and then four, two, and one. Now, one is odd, so we
multiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one, so we're in a loop, and
the lowest number is one. Now, the conjecture is this: every positive integer,
if you apply these rules, will eventually end up in
the four, two, one loop. This is commonly called
the Collatz conjecture after German mathematician,
Luther Collatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many
origin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1. Why is 3x+1 so famous? - Among professional mathematicians, maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone
actually admits in public that they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them. (laughs) - [Narrator] The numbers
you get by applying 3x+1 are called hailstone numbers, because they go up and down like hailstones in a thundercloud, but eventually, they all fall down to one, or at least we think they do. You can think of the numbers as representing the height
above the ground in meters. So a number like 26 would start
26 meters above the ground. And if you apply 3x+1, it rises up as high as 40 meters. And, in total, it takes
10 steps to get to one. So 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all
the way up to 9,232. As an altitude, that is
higher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground. In total, it takes 111 steps
for 27 to get down to one and end up in the four, two, one loop. The paths that different
numbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other. So how do you even start to
make progress on this problem? Well, honestly, mathematicians struggled. - People just decided that this was something
invented by the Soviets to slow down U.S. science, and it was doing a good job at it 'cause everybody's sitting
there twiddling their thumbs and making no progress
on this trivial thing that you can tell a school of children. - [Narrator] Jeffrey Lagarias is the world authority on 3x+1. - The first time I met him
I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and
he said, "Don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending
time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while
to establish yourself." - [Narrator] Alex
Kontorovich didn't listen. He and Yakov Sinai looked at the paths of
the hailstone numbers. Were there any patterns? But obviously all of them ended up at one. But what about the paths
they take to get there? The pattern is randomness. Here is the sequence of a
large number chosen at random. The graph peaks and then drop so low that you can't really see
what's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm, you find this wiggly graph
with a downward trend. It looks like the stock
market on a bad day. And this is no coincidence. Both are examples of
geometric Brownian motion. That means if you take the log
and remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up, tails, it goes down. 3x+1 is just like the random
wiggles of the stock market. Over long-enough periods, the stock market tends to trend upwards, while 3x+1 trends down. Another way to analyze 3x+1 is by looking at the
leading digit of each number in a sequence. Here are the hailstone
numbers starting with three as the seed. And we can count up how many
numbers start with a one, how many start with a two, how many start with a three,
and so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the sequence that starts with four,
and that's a short one, and for the sequences that
start with five, six, and seven. Again, for each sequence, we're just counting up how many numbers start with each digit, one through nine, and adding that to our histogram. If you keep doing this
for more and more numbers, eventually the histogram
settles into a stable pattern. For the first billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the
most common leading digit. 30% of all numbers start with one, around 17.5% start with
two, 12% start with three, and the frequency decreases
for higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the
numbers start with nine. Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x+1. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries, to the value of companies, all the physical constants
and the Fibonacci numbers, just to name a few. The distribution is
known as Benford's law, and it is even used to detect fraud. If all the numbers on
your income tax forms obey Benford's law, then, well, you're probably being honest. If not, you may be hiding something. In elections, Benford's law can be used to spot irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best
when the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude as they do for 3x+1. But Benford's law can't tell us whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop or not. For that, we need a
different sort of analysis. Now, at first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x+1, all numbers should end up at one. I mean, consider that
there are the same number of odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in half. Therefore, it seems like
every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the catch. Every time you multiply
an odd number by three and then add one, it will
always become an even number, and that means the next
step is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not
actually tripled by 3x+1. They're increased by a factor
of about three over two. I'm neglecting the plus one because it's insignificant
for large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the

as slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,
for almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is

remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number
reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can

proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are
not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite
number of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has
transformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you
like, so long as it is finite. But if you want a number that
increases by three over two five consecutive times, you
can calculate that number. If you want a number that
climbs by three over two 10 times in a row, or
100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been
tested, always falls to one. If there is a counterexample, it's virtually impossible
that someone's gonna guess it. And the space of all possibilities is too big to search
exhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by
some intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false. And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling to prove this thing because
it's not actually true? And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence. And even the statistical
version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created
a generalization of 3x+1. It was a mathematical machine
that he called FRACTRAN. And he was able to show this
machine is turing-complete, which means it can do anything
a modern computer can do, but it also means that it's
subject to the halting problem, a chance that the machine
never stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject
to the halting problem, but it is possible that
given what we know, we may never prove the Collatz
conjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of
stuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows
that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems. - For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as
these incredibly regular things full of patterns,
symmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly
in the coral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,
organic-looking, and, thus far, intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to the structure, or is there some unique filament,
a spindly little thread, that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it so hard to tell? I think that's why Paul Erdos said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." (gentle music) What I love about 3x+1 is it's a problem almost

**Transcript**:
- This is the most dangerous
problem in mathematics, one that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's
best mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're gonna apply two rules. If the number is odd, we
multiply by three and add one. So three times seven
is 21, plus one is 22. If the number is even, we divide by two. So 22 divided by two is 11. Now, we keep applying these two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply
by 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by two, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by two, 26, still even. Divide by two, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39,
add one, and that's 40, which is even, so we divide by two, 20, divide by two, 10,
divide by two, five, odd. Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16, divide by two that's eight,
and then four, two, and one. Now, one is odd, so we
multiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one, so we're in a loop, and
the lowest number is one. Now, the conjecture is this: every positive integer,
if you apply these rules, will eventually end up in
the four, two, one loop. This is commonly called
the Collatz conjecture after German mathematician,
Luther Collatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many
origin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1. Why is 3x+1 so famous? - Among professional mathematicians, maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone
actually admits in public that they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them. (laughs) - [Narrator] The numbers
you get by applying 3x+1 are called hailstone numbers, because they go up and down like hailstones in a thundercloud, but eventually, they all fall down to one, or at least we think they do. You can think of the numbers as representing the height
above the ground in meters. So a number like 26 would start
26 meters above the ground. And if you apply 3x+1, it rises up as high as 40 meters. And, in total, it takes
10 steps to get to one. So 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all
the way up to 9,232. As an altitude, that is
higher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground. In total, it takes 111 steps
for 27 to get down to one and end up in the four, two, one loop. The paths that different
numbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other. So how do you even start to
make progress on this problem? Well, honestly, mathematicians struggled. - People just decided that this was something
invented by the Soviets to slow down U.S. science, and it was doing a good job at it 'cause everybody's sitting
there twiddling their thumbs and making no progress
on this trivial thing that you can tell a school of children. - [Narrator] Jeffrey Lagarias is the world authority on 3x+1. - The first time I met him
I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and
he said, "Don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending
time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while
to establish yourself." - [Narrator] Alex
Kontorovich didn't listen. He and Yakov Sinai looked at the paths of
the hailstone numbers. Were there any patterns? But obviously all of them ended up at one. But what about the paths
they take to get there? The pattern is randomness. Here is the sequence of a
large number chosen at random. The graph peaks and then drop so low that you can't really see
what's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm, you find this wiggly graph
with a downward trend. It looks like the stock
market on a bad day. And this is no coincidence. Both are examples of
geometric Brownian motion. That means if you take the log
and remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up, tails, it goes down. 3x+1 is just like the random
wiggles of the stock market. Over long-enough periods, the stock market tends to trend upwards, while 3x+1 trends down. Another way to analyze 3x+1 is by looking at the
leading digit of each number in a sequence. Here are the hailstone
numbers starting with three as the seed. And we can count up how many
numbers start with a one, how many start with a two, how many start with a three,
and so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the sequence that starts with four,
and that's a short one, and for the sequences that
start with five, six, and seven. Again, for each sequence, we're just counting up how many numbers start with each digit, one through nine, and adding that to our histogram. If you keep doing this
for more and more numbers, eventually the histogram
settles into a stable pattern. For the first billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the
most common leading digit. 30% of all numbers start with one, around 17.5% start with
two, 12% start with three, and the frequency decreases
for higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the
numbers start with nine. Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x+1. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries, to the value of companies, all the physical constants
and the Fibonacci numbers, just to name a few. The distribution is
known as Benford's law, and it is even used to detect fraud. If all the numbers on
your income tax forms obey Benford's law, then, well, you're probably being honest. If not, you may be hiding something. In elections, Benford's law can be used to spot irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best
when the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude as they do for 3x+1. But Benford's law can't tell us whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop or not. For that, we need a
different sort of analysis. Now, at first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x+1, all numbers should end up at one. I mean, consider that
there are the same number of odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in half. Therefore, it seems like
every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the catch. Every time you multiply
an odd number by three and then add one, it will
always become an even number, and that means the next
step is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not
actually tripled by 3x+1. They're increased by a factor
of about three over two. I'm neglecting the plus one because it's insignificant
for large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the
numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up
under the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest
living mathematicians, Terry Tao, was able to show 3x+1 obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all
numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x so long as that function goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise
as slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,
for almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples. - It had happened to
me just two years ago, where there was something
I was trying to prove, that I was trying for
three years to prove, and I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counterexample, and then I realized what
the correct statement should have been. And then a month later, I
proved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples
than we're currently spending. - [Narrator] I mean,
remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number
reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can
be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example,
climbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just
shoot off to infinity. And it would take only one
to disprove the conjecture, or some set of numbers
could be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is
only one loop: four, two, one. But something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low
values like -17 and -5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most
convincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture
is Terry Tao's proof that almost all numbers have
a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all
numbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as
proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are
not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite
number of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has
transformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you

100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the maximum growth of an odd number in one step, which is related to the Collatz conjecture. Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is the most relevant, but it does not ask about the growth of an odd number. Instead, it asks about the mathematician who showed that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address the concept of the maximum growth of an odd number in one step. Therefore, I must conclude that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3, but with a low confidence level.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3 (with low confidence)

**Transcript**:
- This is the most dangerous
problem in mathematics, one that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's
best mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're gonna apply two rules. If the number is odd, we
multiply by three and add one. So three times seven
is 21, plus one is 22. If the number is even, we divide by two. So 22 divided by two is 11. Now, we keep applying these two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply
by 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by two, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by two, 26, still even. Divide by two, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39,
add one, and that's 40, which is even, so we divide by two, 20, divide by two, 10,
divide by two, five, odd. Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16, divide by two that's eight,
and then four, two, and one. Now, one is odd, so we
multiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one, so we're in a loop, and
the lowest number is one. Now, the conjecture is this: every positive integer,
if you apply these rules, will eventually end up in
the four, two, one loop. This is commonly called
the Collatz conjecture after German mathematician,
Luther Collatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many
origin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1. Why is 3x+1 so famous? - Among professional mathematicians, maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone
actually admits in public that they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them. (laughs) - [Narrator] The numbers
you get by applying 3x+1 are called hailstone numbers, because they go up and down like hailstones in a thundercloud, but eventually, they all fall down to one, or at least we think they do. You can think of the numbers as representing the height
above the ground in meters. So a number like 26 would start
26 meters above the ground. And if you apply 3x+1, it rises up as high as 40 meters. And, in total, it takes
10 steps to get to one. So 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all
the way up to 9,232. As an altitude, that is
higher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground. In total, it takes 111 steps
for 27 to get down to one and end up in the four, two, one loop. The paths that different
numbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other. So how do you even start to
make progress on this problem? Well, honestly, mathematicians struggled. - People just decided that this was something
invented by the Soviets to slow down U.S. science, and it was doing a good job at it 'cause everybody's sitting
there twiddling their thumbs and making no progress
on this trivial thing that you can tell a school of children. - [Narrator] Jeffrey Lagarias is the world authority on 3x+1. - The first time I met him
I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and
he said, "Don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending
time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while
to establish yourself." - [Narrator] Alex
Kontorovich didn't listen. He and Yakov Sinai looked at the paths of
the hailstone numbers. Were there any patterns? But obviously all of them ended up at one. But what about the paths
they take to get there? The pattern is randomness. Here is the sequence of a
large number chosen at random. The graph peaks and then drop so low that you can't really see
what's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm, you find this wiggly graph
with a downward trend. It looks like the stock
market on a bad day. And this is no coincidence. Both are examples of
geometric Brownian motion. That means if you take the log
and remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up, tails, it goes down. 3x+1 is just like the random
wiggles of the stock market. Over long-enough periods, the stock market tends to trend upwards, while 3x+1 trends down. Another way to analyze 3x+1 is by looking at the
leading digit of each number in a sequence. Here are the hailstone
numbers starting with three as the seed. And we can count up how many
numbers start with a one, how many start with a two, how many start with a three,
and so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the sequence that starts with four,
and that's a short one, and for the sequences that
start with five, six, and seven. Again, for each sequence, we're just counting up how many numbers start with each digit, one through nine, and adding that to our histogram. If you keep doing this
for more and more numbers, eventually the histogram
settles into a stable pattern. For the first billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the
most common leading digit. 30% of all numbers start with one, around 17.5% start with
two, 12% start with three, and the frequency decreases
for higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the
numbers start with nine. Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x+1. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries, to the value of companies, all the physical constants
and the Fibonacci numbers, just to name a few. The distribution is
known as Benford's law, and it is even used to detect fraud. If all the numbers on
your income tax forms obey Benford's law, then, well, you're probably being honest. If not, you may be hiding something. In elections, Benford's law can be used to spot irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best
when the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude as they do for 3x+1. But Benford's law can't tell us whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop or not. For that, we need a
different sort of analysis. Now, at first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x+1, all numbers should end up at one. I mean, consider that
there are the same number of odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in half. Therefore, it seems like
every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the catch. Every time you multiply
an odd number by three and then add one, it will
always become an even number, and that means the next
step is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not
actually tripled by 3x+1. They're increased by a factor
of about three over two. I'm neglecting the plus one because it's insignificant
for large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the
numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up
under the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest
living mathematicians, Terry Tao, was able to show 3x+1 obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all
numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x so long as that function goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise
as slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,
for almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples. - It had happened to
me just two years ago, where there was something
I was trying to prove, that I was trying for
three years to prove, and I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counterexample, and then I realized what
the correct statement should have been. And then a month later, I
proved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples
than we're currently spending. - [Narrator] I mean,
remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number
reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can
be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example,
climbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just
shoot off to infinity. And it would take only one
to disprove the conjecture, or some set of numbers
could be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is
only one loop: four, two, one. But something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low
values like -17 and -5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most
convincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture
is Terry Tao's proof that almost all numbers have
a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all
numbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as
proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are
not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite
number of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has
transformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you
like, so long as it is finite. But if you want a number that
increases by three over two five consecutive times, you
can calculate that number. If you want a number that
climbs by three over two 10 times in a row, or
100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been
tested, always falls to one. If there is a counterexample, it's virtually impossible
that someone's gonna guess it. And the space of all possibilities is too big to search
exhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by
some intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false. And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling to prove this thing because
it's not actually true? And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence. And even the statistical
version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created
a generalization of 3x+1. It was a mathematical machine
that he called FRACTRAN. And he was able to show this
machine is turing-complete, which means it can do anything
a modern computer can do, but it also means that it's
subject to the halting problem, a chance that the machine
never stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject
to the halting problem, but it is possible that
given what we know, we may never prove the Collatz
conjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of
stuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows
that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems. - For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as
these incredibly regular things full of patterns,
symmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly
in the coral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,
organic-looking, and, thus far, intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to the structure, or is there some unique filament,
a spindly little thread, that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it so hard to tell? I think that's why Paul Erdos said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." (gentle music) What I love about 3x+1 is it's a problem almost
anyone can understand and play around with. And actually trying to figure
things out for yourself is the best way to learn, which is why I subscribed to Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Now, recently, Brilliant have
upped their interactivity. For example, here is a great lesson on the Pythagorean theorem. So, you don't just remember the formula, but you really understand what it means. Now, Brilliant is a website and an app designed to get you thinking deeply by engaging you in problem-solving. It's one thing to read through a textbook and think that you get it, but it's quite another
to play with interactives and actually test yourself as you go, and Brilliant curates the experiences so they get more and more
challenging over time. There's always a helpful
tip or explanation that takes your understanding
to the next level. I'd highly recommend their course on mathematical fundamentals, which now has even more interactivity and it has topics that are
relevant to all areas of STEM and algorithm fundamentals for
anyone interested in coding. It's great to have a resource like this to inspire you to learn
something new every single day. I try to start off my day by challenging myself with Brilliant. And so if you'd like to join me and a community of 8
million other learners, go to brilliant.org/veritasium. I will put that link

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is related to the content of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the likelihood of 3x+1 sequences to grow or shrink. While there isn't a direct match, Question 3 mentions the work of Riho Terras, who showed that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. This is related to the idea that 3x+1 sequences are more likely to shrink than grow.

However, a closer match is not present in the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most related, but it's not a direct match.

If I had to create a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

Question: What is the statistical behavior of 3x+1 sequences?
Options: A. More likely to grow than shrink, B. More likely to shrink than grow

This new MCQ directly matches the ground truth MCQ.

Since there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, I will not provide an index. However, I can suggest that Question 3 is the most related to the content of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1932, the Great Depression
entered its third winter. One in four Americans was unemployed, marking the highest unemployment rate
in the country’s history. Tens of thousands had lost 
their homes and life savings, and there was very little confidence that
Republican President Herbert Hoover could turn things around. So when the election came, voters flocked 
to his Democratic competitor. Franklin D. Roosevelt promised
a New Deal for Americans— a comprehensive set of legislation 
to support struggling citizens and put the country back to work. The massive federal intervention Roosevelt
proposed was a radical challenge to the individualist ideals that governed
many Americans’ lives. But due to the extreme circumstances, he began his presidency 
with public and political support. With the help of his advisers, Roosevelt’s
first hundred days in office were perhaps the most eventful 
of any US president. In just over three months, he pushed 
over 15 bills through Congress and created an “alphabet soup” 
of government agencies to help farmers, workers, and businesses. The New Deal’s first priority was
stabilizing the banks. Over the previous three years, 
many Americans had withdrawn their savings out of fear the bank would lose 
their money in bad investments. So to regain the public's confidence, FDR increased federal oversight
of commercial banks, and created bank insurance to guarantee
that any deposited funds would always be available. Next, he established the Federal Emergency
Relief Administration. FERA cataloged each state’s
need for relief and provided funds to help citizens afford
groceries, rent, clothing, coal, and other necessities. Meanwhile, the Agricultural Adjustment
Administration subsidized farmers and educated them in improving
planting techniques. These policies fed and housed thousands, but they didn’t significantly address 
the New Deal’s biggest promise: reducing unemployment. So the Civilian Conservation Corps was
established to employ over 250,000 young men for projects like tree planting, irrigation, 
and fire prevention. The CCC offered onsite work camps that provided food, shelter, 
and education to those employed; mostly young, single men 
with families in need of relief. Subsequent programs 
like the Works Progress Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority added projects building roads, bridges, 
and hydroelectric dams. The WPA also funded art, writing,
and theater programs. These initiatives cut 
civilian unemployment in half. And they did so alongside labor acts 
that abolished child labor, granted unions the right 
to collective bargaining, and set the first national minimum wage. Benefits were also created to help 
those unable to work. The Social Security Act established 
an old-age pension system in addition to unemployment insurance, 
disability benefits, and welfare assistance. But despite these sweeping policies, the New Deal helped some groups
more than others. Black Americans were hit hardest
by the economic downturn, and the New Deal’s impact 
on Black communities varied widely. In northern cities like Chicago, Black citizens received a large share of 
jobs, vocational training, and education, with New Deal programs teaching more than
one million Black Americans to read. Northern Black communities also received
an influx of public housing, though it was heavily segregated. In the South, results were less positive. Roosevelt relied heavily on the support 
of Southern Democrats, who welcomed economic development 
but fought to preserve white supremacy. They ensured that new labor laws excluded domestic servants 
and agricultural workers, occupations held by many Black Americans. These politicians and many others also
undermined Eleanor Roosevelt’s attempts to push her husband toward supporting
a federal anti-lynching law. As a result, the New Deal has often been
called a “raw deal” for Black communities. And many modern inequities in housing, 
employment, and financial stability are partially due to New Deal programs 
prioritizing white Americans. In these ways and more, the New Deal 
didn’t fully live up to its promises. Despite employing 
over 8 million Americans, unemployment never went
lower than 14%. And the US economy wouldn’t fully
recover until the country’s mobilization for World War II. But this bold campaign 
of progressive policies did empower unions to start 
their own revolution. In the coming decades, northern liberals, 
Black Americans, and other working minorities, united to fight discriminatory hiring. In the process, they reshaped
the Democratic Party; challenging its racist leadership, and laying the groundwork

**Transcript**:
In 1932, the Great Depression
entered its third winter. One in four Americans was unemployed, marking the highest unemployment rate
in the country’s history. Tens of thousands had lost 
their homes and life savings, and there was very little confidence that
Republican President Herbert Hoover could turn things around. So when the election came, voters flocked 
to his Democratic competitor. Franklin D. Roosevelt promised
a New Deal for Americans— a comprehensive set of legislation 
to support struggling citizens and put the country back to work. The massive federal intervention Roosevelt
proposed was a radical challenge to the individualist ideals that governed
many Americans’ lives. But due to the extreme circumstances, he began his presidency 
with public and political support. With the help of his advisers, Roosevelt’s
first hundred days in office were perhaps the most eventful 
of any US president. In just over three months, he pushed 
over 15 bills through Congress and created an “alphabet soup” 
of government agencies to help farmers, workers, and businesses. The New Deal’s first priority was
stabilizing the banks. Over the previous three years, 
many Americans had withdrawn their savings out of fear the bank would lose 
their money in bad investments. So to regain the public's confidence, FDR increased federal oversight
of commercial banks, and created bank insurance to guarantee
that any deposited funds would always be available. Next, he established the Federal Emergency
Relief Administration. FERA cataloged each state’s
need for relief and provided funds to help citizens afford
groceries, rent, clothing, coal, and other necessities. Meanwhile, the Agricultural Adjustment
Administration subsidized farmers and educated them in improving
planting techniques. These policies fed and housed thousands, but they didn’t significantly address 
the New Deal’s biggest promise: reducing unemployment. So the Civilian Conservation Corps was
established to employ over 250,000 young men for projects like tree planting, irrigation, 
and fire prevention. The CCC offered onsite work camps that provided food, shelter, 
and education to those employed; mostly young, single men 
with families in need of relief. Subsequent programs 
like the Works Progress Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority added projects building roads, bridges, 
and hydroelectric dams. The WPA also funded art, writing,
and theater programs. These initiatives cut 
civilian unemployment in half. And they did so alongside labor acts 
that abolished child labor, granted unions the right 
to collective bargaining, and set the first national minimum wage. Benefits were also created to help 
those unable to work. The Social Security Act established 
an old-age pension system in addition to unemployment insurance, 
disability benefits, and welfare assistance. But despite these sweeping policies, the New Deal helped some groups
more than others. Black Americans were hit hardest
by the economic downturn, and the New Deal’s impact 
on Black communities varied widely. In northern cities like Chicago, Black citizens received a large share of 
jobs, vocational training, and education, with New Deal programs teaching more than
one million Black Americans to read. Northern Black communities also received
an influx of public housing, though it was heavily segregated. In the South, results were less positive. Roosevelt relied heavily on the support 
of Southern Democrats, who welcomed economic development 
but fought to preserve white supremacy. They ensured that new labor laws excluded domestic servants 
and agricultural workers, occupations held by many Black Americans. These politicians and many others also
undermined Eleanor Roosevelt’s attempts to push her husband toward supporting
a federal anti-lynching law. As a result, the New Deal has often been
called a “raw deal” for Black communities. And many modern inequities in housing, 
employment, and financial stability are partially due to New Deal programs 
prioritizing white Americans. In these ways and more, the New Deal

on Black communities varied widely. In northern cities like Chicago, Black citizens received a large share of 
jobs, vocational training, and education, with New Deal programs teaching more than
one million Black Americans to read. Northern Black communities also received
an influx of public housing, though it was heavily segregated. In the South, results were less positive. Roosevelt relied heavily on the support 
of Southern Democrats, who welcomed economic development 
but fought to preserve white supremacy. They ensured that new labor laws excluded domestic servants 
and agricultural workers, occupations held by many Black Americans. These politicians and many others also
undermined Eleanor Roosevelt’s attempts to push her husband toward supporting
a federal anti-lynching law. As a result, the New Deal has often been
called a “raw deal” for Black communities. And many modern inequities in housing, 
employment, and financial stability are partially due to New Deal programs 
prioritizing white Americans. In these ways and more, the New Deal 
didn’t fully live up to its promises. Despite employing 
over 8 million Americans, unemployment never went
lower than 14%. And the US economy wouldn’t fully
recover until the country’s mobilization for World War II. But this bold campaign 
of progressive policies did empower unions to start 
their own revolution. In the coming decades, northern liberals, 
Black Americans, and other working minorities, united to fight discriminatory hiring. In the process, they reshaped
the Democratic Party; challenging its racist leadership, and laying the groundwork 
for an emerging civil rights coalition.

**Transcript**:
In 1849, in the ancient city 
of Nineveh in northern Iraq, archaeologists sifted 
through dusty remains, hoping to find records to prove
that Bible stories were true. What they found instead was 
one of the oldest libraries in the world. Inscribed on crumbling clay tablets
was a 4,000-year-old story so riveting the first person to translate
it started stripping from excitement. Called the epic of Gilgamesh, the story starts with Gilgamesh,
king of the city of Uruk, crashing every wedding 
and sleeping with the bride before she has a chance 
to sleep with her husband. To tame Gilgamesh, the goddess Aruru 
created a rival called Enkidu. Enkidu lived beyond the walls of the city, where chaos reigned and wild animals, 
invaders, and evil spirits prowled. After a priestess of the goddess Ishtar 
seduced Enkidu, the wild animals beyond the wall rejected
him and he ventured into the city. There, he encountered Gilgamesh
up to his usual tricks. Enkidu stepped in to stop him. Almost perfectly matched, the two men
wrestled all through the city streets until Gilgamesh won the fight by a hair. Afterwards, they were inseparable. With his new friend, Gilgamesh turned 
his attention from the brides of Uruk to proving his strength in combat. They set out to slay Humbaba, a creature with a thousand faces who
guarded the trees of the Forest of Cedar. They tracked Humbaba and ambushed him. Cornered, he begged for his life, then cursed them 
as Gilgamesh dealt the final blow. Back home in Uruk, the goddess Ishtar 
took a romantic interest in Gilgamesh. Knowing she tended to lose interest
and curse her former flames, Gilgamesh refused her advances. So Ishtar unleashed the Bull of Heaven 
on Uruk to destroy crops and kill people. When Gilgamesh and Enkidu slayed 
the creature defending the city, the gods killed Enkidu. He entered the House of Dust, the shadowy Mesopotamian underworld 
where the spirits of the dead knelt eternally on the ground, 
eating dirt and drinking stone. Grieving for Enkidu and terrified
of meeting this fate himself, Gilgamesh set off beyond the cosmic
mountains to seek immortality. He passed scorpion people
and groves of gemstone trees, travelled beneath the mountains 
and outran the rising sun, until he finally came 
to the end of the world, where he found a bar. The bartender was a goddess named Shiduri, who urged Gilgamesh to give up his quest. She told him all mortals must die, but until death comes,
he should enjoy his life. But Gilgamesh refused to give up. Reluctantly, Shiduri gave him directions
to cross the Waters of Death and meet the immortal man Utanapishti. The gods had granted Utanapishti
immortality following a great flood, during which he built a boat, loaded two of every animal onto it,
and landed on a mountain peak. Utanapishti also encouraged Gilgamesh 
to accept that death comes for everyone. But Gilgamesh still would not budge. So Utanapishti told him 
that if he could conquer sleep, the gods might grant him immortality. Gilgamesh intended to stay
awake for seven days, but fell asleep immediately. Utanapishti then told him about a magical 
plant that grew at the bottom of the ocean and granted eternal youth. Though Gilgamesh successfully
retrieved the plant, a snake stole it on his way home. But when Gilgamesh laid eyes 
on his beautiful city again, he made peace with his mortality and vowed
to spend his lifetime doing great deeds. He wrote his story 
on a lapis lazuli tablet and buried it under the city walls for 
future generations to find and learn from. The tablets uncovered in Nineveh were part of the library 
of the Assyrian king, Ashurbanipal. Though the story is mythical, Gilgamesh 
was probably a real king of Uruk. Versions of his tale date to 2000 BCE
and perhaps even longer ago, and still echo through literature today.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar.

The ground truth MCQ is about the underworld in Mesopotamia, and none of the generated MCQs specifically ask about the underworld. However, Question 3 mentions the goddess Aruru, who created Enkidu, and the text does mention the underworld (the "House of Dust") in the context of Enkidu's death.

But a more relevant question is Question 9, which asks about what Gilgamesh vowed to do with his life after he made peace with his mortality. This question is related to the theme of mortality and the afterlife, which is also present in the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar question, I would say that Question 3 is not the most similar, but rather, no question is directly similar. But if I had to choose, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar, because it asks about the goddess Shiduri, who urged Gilgamesh to give up his quest for immortality, and in the text, it is mentioned that Gilgamesh was terrified of meeting the fate of the dead in the underworld.

So, my answer would be Question 6, but with the caveat that none of the generated MCQs are directly similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the most similar generated MCQ would be:

Question 8: What was the magical plant that grew at the bottom of the ocean and granted eternal youth? Options: A. The Plant of Life, B. The Plant of Youth, C. The Magical Plant, D. The Plant of Immortality

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of the specific event described (i.e., what happened after Gilgamesh retrieved the magical plant). But in terms of relevance to the magical plant, it is the closest match.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 8 is the closest match, but with a note that it doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1849, in the ancient city 
of Nineveh in northern Iraq, archaeologists sifted 
through dusty remains, hoping to find records to prove
that Bible stories were true. What they found instead was 
one of the oldest libraries in the world. Inscribed on crumbling clay tablets
was a 4,000-year-old story so riveting the first person to translate
it started stripping from excitement. Called the epic of Gilgamesh, the story starts with Gilgamesh,
king of the city of Uruk, crashing every wedding 
and sleeping with the bride before she has a chance 
to sleep with her husband. To tame Gilgamesh, the goddess Aruru 
created a rival called Enkidu. Enkidu lived beyond the walls of the city, where chaos reigned and wild animals, 
invaders, and evil spirits prowled. After a priestess of the goddess Ishtar 
seduced Enkidu, the wild animals beyond the wall rejected
him and he ventured into the city. There, he encountered Gilgamesh
up to his usual tricks. Enkidu stepped in to stop him. Almost perfectly matched, the two men
wrestled all through the city streets until Gilgamesh won the fight by a hair. Afterwards, they were inseparable. With his new friend, Gilgamesh turned 
his attention from the brides of Uruk to proving his strength in combat. They set out to slay Humbaba, a creature with a thousand faces who
guarded the trees of the Forest of Cedar. They tracked Humbaba and ambushed him. Cornered, he begged for his life, then cursed them 
as Gilgamesh dealt the final blow. Back home in Uruk, the goddess Ishtar 
took a romantic interest in Gilgamesh. Knowing she tended to lose interest
and curse her former flames, Gilgamesh refused her advances. So Ishtar unleashed the Bull of Heaven 
on Uruk to destroy crops and kill people. When Gilgamesh and Enkidu slayed 
the creature defending the city, the gods killed Enkidu. He entered the House of Dust, the shadowy Mesopotamian underworld 
where the spirits of the dead knelt eternally on the ground, 
eating dirt and drinking stone. Grieving for Enkidu and terrified
of meeting this fate himself, Gilgamesh set off beyond the cosmic
mountains to seek immortality. He passed scorpion people
and groves of gemstone trees, travelled beneath the mountains 
and outran the rising sun, until he finally came 
to the end of the world, where he found a bar. The bartender was a goddess named Shiduri, who urged Gilgamesh to give up his quest. She told him all mortals must die, but until death comes,
he should enjoy his life. But Gilgamesh refused to give up. Reluctantly, Shiduri gave him directions
to cross the Waters of Death and meet the immortal man Utanapishti. The gods had granted Utanapishti
immortality following a great flood, during which he built a boat, loaded two of every animal onto it,
and landed on a mountain peak. Utanapishti also encouraged Gilgamesh 
to accept that death comes for everyone. But Gilgamesh still would not budge. So Utanapishti told him 
that if he could conquer sleep, the gods might grant him immortality. Gilgamesh intended to stay
awake for seven days, but fell asleep immediately. Utanapishti then told him about a magical 
plant that grew at the bottom of the ocean and granted eternal youth. Though Gilgamesh successfully
retrieved the plant, a snake stole it on his way home. But when Gilgamesh laid eyes 
on his beautiful city again, he made peace with his mortality and vowed
to spend his lifetime doing great deeds. He wrote his story 
on a lapis lazuli tablet and buried it under the city walls for 
future generations to find and learn from. The tablets uncovered in Nineveh were part of the library 
of the Assyrian king, Ashurbanipal. Though the story is mythical, Gilgamesh 
was probably a real king of Uruk. Versions of his tale date to 2000 BCE
and perhaps even longer ago, and still echo through literature today.

**Transcript**:
Day after day, the twin brothers,
Jun and Wuqub, ran back and forth playing ball. One day, their vigorous game disturbed
the lords of the underworld, who challenged the twins to a match. But when the brothers arrived, 
the lords trapped and killed them, hanging Jun’s head 
from a tree as a trophy. The tree soon sprouted massive fruit, which caught the attention 
of one of the lords’ daughters. When she reached for it, 
the skull of Jun spat on her hand and impregnated her. Fleeing of her father’s wrath, she sought refuge with her mother-in-law
and gave birth to twin sons: Junajpu and Ixb’alanke. The second generation of twins discovered 
their father’s ballgame equipment, which their grandmother had hidden, 
and began to play. Soon enough, the messengers 
from the underworld arrived to issue another challenge. Knowing what had happened
to their fathers, the twins nevertheless answered the call, trekking through deep caverns and across rivers filled 
with scorpions, blood, and pus, until they reached the great city from which the lords of the underworld
controlled every aspect of nature and caused suffering for humans. The twins pressed on, searching 
for the lords who had challenged them. The lords had hidden among statues 
of themselves to confuse their guests, but the brothers sent a mosquito 
ahead of them. When it stung the figures, 
the lords cried out, revealing themselves. They forced the twins to spend 
the night in the House of Darkness. They gave them a torch, but warned they
must return it unburnt or face death. As the darkness closed in, the quick-thinking brothers 
adorned the torch with red macaw feathers and fireflies. Come morning, the lords were shocked
to see the torch lit, but unburnt. They insisted on playing the game
with their own ball. The twins agreed, only to find 
that the lords had hidden a weapon inside the ball, which chased them around the court,
trying to kill them. The twins survived that first round, but by now they were sure 
this would be no ordinary match. They played many more rounds, and each time the twins scored
no better than a tie, leaving them to face 
whatever supernatural trial the lords set for them 
before picking up the game again. They survived the House of Cold
by lighting a fire, and the House of Jaguars by feeding
bones to the beasts. But in the House of Bats, 
a bat bit off Junajpu’s head. Certain they now had the advantage, the lords called for another round 
of the ballgame, hanging Junajpu’s head over the court. The quick-thinking Ixb’alanke
called the animals to him. A turtle brought him a chilacayote squash, and he carved it into the likeness 
of a head. While the lords chased the ball,
he swapped it with the head. With Junajpu’s head back on his body,
the twins played harder than ever. Finally, they won the game, hitting the hanging squash 
so it shattered on the ground. The twins knew their treacherous hosts
would not take the loss well. To protect themselves,
they enlisted a pair of seers. Sure enough, the lords burned
the brothers in an oven, but the seers made sure their remains
were thrown in the river, which restored them to life. The brothers then came before the lords
disguised as two disheveled children and began to dance and perform miracles. For their final trick, 
Ixb’alanke pretended to kill Junajpu, then resurrect him. The lords were so delighted 
that they demanded the same trick be performed on them. Still in disguise, the brothers were 
only too happy to oblige, and began killing the lords one by one. As the surviving lords realized 
who stood before them and that no resurrection was forthcoming, they begged for mercy,
and the twins spoke their curse. Henceforth, the lords would have
no sacrifices and no power over the surface world. Their days of terrorizing humans 
were over.

**Transcript**:
Day after day, the twin brothers,
Jun and Wuqub, ran back and forth playing ball. One day, their vigorous game disturbed
the lords of the underworld, who challenged the twins to a match. But when the brothers arrived, 
the lords trapped and killed them, hanging Jun’s head 
from a tree as a trophy. The tree soon sprouted massive fruit, which caught the attention 
of one of the lords’ daughters. When she reached for it, 
the skull of Jun spat on her hand and impregnated her. Fleeing of her father’s wrath, she sought refuge with her mother-in-law
and gave birth to twin sons: Junajpu and Ixb’alanke. The second generation of twins discovered 
their father’s ballgame equipment, which their grandmother had hidden, 
and began to play. Soon enough, the messengers 
from the underworld arrived to issue another challenge. Knowing what had happened
to their fathers, the twins nevertheless answered the call, trekking through deep caverns and across rivers filled 
with scorpions, blood, and pus, until they reached the great city from which the lords of the underworld
controlled every aspect of nature and caused suffering for humans. The twins pressed on, searching 
for the lords who had challenged them. The lords had hidden among statues 
of themselves to confuse their guests, but the brothers sent a mosquito 
ahead of them. When it stung the figures, 
the lords cried out, revealing themselves. They forced the twins to spend 
the night in the House of Darkness. They gave them a torch, but warned they
must return it unburnt or face death. As the darkness closed in, the quick-thinking brothers 
adorned the torch with red macaw feathers and fireflies. Come morning, the lords were shocked
to see the torch lit, but unburnt. They insisted on playing the game
with their own ball. The twins agreed, only to find 
that the lords had hidden a weapon inside the ball, which chased them around the court,
trying to kill them. The twins survived that first round, but by now they were sure 
this would be no ordinary match. They played many more rounds, and each time the twins scored
no better than a tie, leaving them to face 
whatever supernatural trial the lords set for them 
before picking up the game again. They survived the House of Cold
by lighting a fire, and the House of Jaguars by feeding
bones to the beasts. But in the House of Bats, 
a bat bit off Junajpu’s head. Certain they now had the advantage, the lords called for another round 
of the ballgame, hanging Junajpu’s head over the court. The quick-thinking Ixb’alanke
called the animals to him. A turtle brought him a chilacayote squash, and he carved it into the likeness 
of a head. While the lords chased the ball,
he swapped it with the head. With Junajpu’s head back on his body,
the twins played harder than ever. Finally, they won the game, hitting the hanging squash 
so it shattered on the ground. The twins knew their treacherous hosts
would not take the loss well. To protect themselves,
they enlisted a pair of seers. Sure enough, the lords burned
the brothers in an oven, but the seers made sure their remains
were thrown in the river, which restored them to life. The brothers then came before the lords
disguised as two disheveled children and began to dance and perform miracles. For their final trick, 
Ixb’alanke pretended to kill Junajpu, then resurrect him. The lords were so delighted 
that they demanded the same trick be performed on them. Still in disguise, the brothers were 
only too happy to oblige, and began killing the lords one by one. As the surviving lords realized 
who stood before them and that no resurrection was forthcoming, they begged for mercy,
and the twins spoke their curse. Henceforth, the lords would have
no sacrifices and no power over the surface world. Their days of terrorizing humans 
were over.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A leather mask that clamps the mouth shut. A cannonball sewn 
into a soldier’s uniform. And a machine that delivers 
sudden electrical pulses. These old items were all
intended treatments for a problem that has haunted humanity
for millennia: snoring. It might seem harmless, but snoring can
be a sign of something more dangerous. So, what exactly causes snoring? 
And when does it become a problem? A snore’s quality can range from a
gentle mew to a stuttering chainsaw— but all snores originate 
from the respiratory tract, which is lined with soft tissues. During sleep, the muscles 
around these tissues relax, narrowing the airway. Many factors, including congestion, 
anatomical features, and the position you’re sleeping in, can further constrict this passage 
and lead to or exacerbate snoring. The narrower the respiratory tract is,
the stronger the airflow, and the more those relaxed tissues 
may vibrate, producing sound. Most of us will snore at some point
in our lives. But loud, chronic snoring is one sign 
of a sleep disorder known as obstructive sleep apnea. It affects about a quarter of all adults, but it’s estimated that around 80%
of people who suffer from it aren’t aware they have it. This is especially troublesome because it 
can lead to serious cardiovascular issues. Obstructive sleep apnea is usually
caused by blockages in the airway and is mainly characterized by pauses
in breathing during sleep. There's one other kind of sleep apnea
called central sleep apnea, which occurs when the brain temporarily
fails to regulate the body's breathing. This condition isn't as common, and snoring is usually 
a less prominent feature— though you can have both. If you’re experiencing 
obstructive sleep apnea, you might stop breathing for 10 or more
seconds before waking, sometimes without realizing it,
to catch your breath. In doing so, you might make 
a snorting or a choking sound. This may happen five times an hour, though in severe cases,
it could occur more than 30. And it's a problem because your tissues
are getting less oxygen. As you experience periods
of low oxygen intake, your body releases stress hormones. And your blood vessels constrict to get
oxygenated blood to your vital organs. This increases your blood pressure 
and puts additional stress on your heart. And this is why obstructive sleep apnea
can be linked to hypertension and other cardiovascular problems. Your difficulty breathing and poor-quality
rest may also lead to headaches, decreased concentration,
and chronic fatigue. So what puts someone at risk of developing
obstructive sleep apnea? Features like larger tongues, 
thicker necks, and smaller jaws can make people more susceptible. Older people are more at risk 
because, as we age, our soft tissues loosen,
further narrowing our airways. Drinking alcohol before going to sleep
can cause excessive relaxation of our throat and jaw muscles. And one of the main contributors 
to obstructive sleep apnea is weight gain because more tissue around the neck
can constrict the airway. Many researchers see weight loss 
as a solution to obstructive sleep apnea. Certain behavioral shifts, like limiting
your alcohol consumption before bed, elevating your head, and avoiding 
sleeping on your back may also help. For people who have a milder condition, mouth and throat exercises have been shown
to alleviate obstructive sleep apnea in some preliminary trials. But these approaches, 
and devices like oral appliances, may not always be sufficient. Sleep apnea can be reliably
treated using CPAP machines, which keep the airway open by delivering
a constant stream of pressurized air. Doctors will usually aim to remedy sleep
apnea with non-invasive treatments like these first, but if they don’t work,
they may consider surgery. Snores can be silly. But intense ones are well-worth 
investigating with a doctor. After all, everyone needs a chance 
to catch their breath— and some z’s...

**Transcript**:
A leather mask that clamps the mouth shut. A cannonball sewn 
into a soldier’s uniform. And a machine that delivers 
sudden electrical pulses. These old items were all
intended treatments for a problem that has haunted humanity
for millennia: snoring. It might seem harmless, but snoring can
be a sign of something more dangerous. So, what exactly causes snoring? 
And when does it become a problem? A snore’s quality can range from a
gentle mew to a stuttering chainsaw— but all snores originate 
from the respiratory tract, which is lined with soft tissues. During sleep, the muscles 
around these tissues relax, narrowing the airway. Many factors, including congestion, 
anatomical features, and the position you’re sleeping in, can further constrict this passage 
and lead to or exacerbate snoring. The narrower the respiratory tract is,
the stronger the airflow, and the more those relaxed tissues 
may vibrate, producing sound. Most of us will snore at some point
in our lives. But loud, chronic snoring is one sign 
of a sleep disorder known as obstructive sleep apnea. It affects about a quarter of all adults, but it’s estimated that around 80%
of people who suffer from it aren’t aware they have it. This is especially troublesome because it 
can lead to serious cardiovascular issues. Obstructive sleep apnea is usually
caused by blockages in the airway and is mainly characterized by pauses
in breathing during sleep. There's one other kind of sleep apnea
called central sleep apnea, which occurs when the brain temporarily
fails to regulate the body's breathing. This condition isn't as common, and snoring is usually 
a less prominent feature— though you can have both. If you’re experiencing 
obstructive sleep apnea, you might stop breathing for 10 or more
seconds before waking, sometimes without realizing it,
to catch your breath. In doing so, you might make 
a snorting or a choking sound. This may happen five times an hour, though in severe cases,
it could occur more than 30. And it's a problem because your tissues
are getting less oxygen. As you experience periods
of low oxygen intake, your body releases stress hormones. And your blood vessels constrict to get
oxygenated blood to your vital organs. This increases your blood pressure 
and puts additional stress on your heart. And this is why obstructive sleep apnea
can be linked to hypertension and other cardiovascular problems. Your difficulty breathing and poor-quality
rest may also lead to headaches, decreased concentration,
and chronic fatigue. So what puts someone at risk of developing
obstructive sleep apnea? Features like larger tongues, 
thicker necks, and smaller jaws can make people more susceptible. Older people are more at risk 
because, as we age, our soft tissues loosen,
further narrowing our airways. Drinking alcohol before going to sleep
can cause excessive relaxation of our throat and jaw muscles. And one of the main contributors 
to obstructive sleep apnea is weight gain because more tissue around the neck
can constrict the airway. Many researchers see weight loss 
as a solution to obstructive sleep apnea. Certain behavioral shifts, like limiting
your alcohol consumption before bed, elevating your head, and avoiding 
sleeping on your back may also help. For people who have a milder condition, mouth and throat exercises have been shown
to alleviate obstructive sleep apnea in some preliminary trials. But these approaches, 
and devices like oral appliances, may not always be sufficient. Sleep apnea can be reliably
treated using CPAP machines, which keep the airway open by delivering
a constant stream of pressurized air. Doctors will usually aim to remedy sleep
apnea with non-invasive treatments like these first, but if they don’t work,
they may consider surgery. Snores can be silly. But intense ones are well-worth 
investigating with a doctor. After all, everyone needs a chance 
to catch their breath— and some z’s...

**Transcript**:
These eight ferocious notes open one of the most explosive pieces
of music ever composed. Ludwig van Beethoven’s 
Symphony Number Five premiered in 1808, 
on a blisteringly cold Vienna night. The piece was just one small part
of a lengthy program, and the orchestra had been hastily
assembled and under-rehearsed. But despite this inauspicious premiere,
the symphony quickly won acclaim. One critic likened the piece 
to “glowing beams of light, piercing through the darkness.” This intensity persists
throughout the composition, and its dramatic musicality continues
to move listeners today. So what exactly makes 
Beethoven’s Fifth so captivating? When the symphony premiered, Beethoven
already had a formidable reputation. While his peers produced music exclusively
for religious functions or private events held by their wealthy patrons, Beethoven was one of the first
freelance composers. He made his living 
composing and selling his music to publishers in multiple countries and showcasing his compositions
to an adoring public. This career choice gave him the 
flexibility to compose for self-expression and Beethoven was always pursuing new ways to translate his powerful emotions 
into music. At the time, most composers worked
within the Classical style, which offered limited options 
for a piece’s overarching structure and instrumentation. Beethoven composed most 
of his earlier pieces in this tradition, following in the footsteps 
of role models like Mozart and Haydn. But with his Fifth Symphony, he
experimented with elements of Romanticism. This blossoming mode of composition was
known for its expressive melodies, extended forms 
and surprising instrumentations. The first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth
uses a Classical sonata form, in which a central musical idea 
is explored, developed, and repeated in an altered manner. Within these parameters, he explores 
a simple idea with incredible depth. A single rhythmic motif serves as the 
building block for most of the movement: three short notes, 
followed by a lingering fourth. One of Beethoven’s biographers would 
later call this pattern the “fate motif,” because it suggests
the figure of fate knocking at the door. While it's not clear if Beethoven composed
the motif with fate in mind, these notes certainly create
a gripping hook. The rhythmic pattern creates
forward movement, while the prolonged fourth note 
signals doom. This motif haunts the symphony, including its accompanying parts
and rhythmic flourishes. Beethoven experiments with dozens 
of variations, playing out across different 
instruments and pitches. Throughout the piece, this motif is passed
around the orchestra like a whisper, gradually reaching more and more 
instruments until it becomes a roar. The motif’s inventive repetition 
is a large part of what makes this piece so memorable, but it’s not the only innovation 
on display. This was the first major orchestral
composition to use trombones, and Beethoven also employs 
a high-pitched piccolo and a low-pitched contrabassoon to give the orchestra a wider range 
than most classical compositions. Exaggerated musical dynamics
further heighten the drama. And harmonically, the piece has
a clear emotional arc— beginning in a somber C minor 
and ending in a triumphant C major. This progression, from ominous unease
to majestic resolution, is a testament to Beethoven’s ability 
to inject raw emotionality into his music. He wrote this symphony 
while battling with hearing loss, and his anguish can be heard 
in the composition’s thunderous and repeating musical phrases. Beethoven continued to compose even
after he became completely deaf, producing innovative music
until his death in 1827. And the Fifth Symphony’s central motif 
has continued to resound through the ages. Outside of concert halls, the piece has become a symbol 
for suspense, revelation, and triumph. The fate motif sounds out the letter V 
in Morse code, and during World War II, the Fifth Symphony became a code 
for victory amongst the Allies. The iconic composition can
be found in film scores, and it’s even been explored through
musical reinterpretations and visual art. But whatever the context, Beethoven’s Fifth takes its listeners 
through a dark world, then guides them into the light.

within the Classical style, which offered limited options 
for a piece’s overarching structure and instrumentation. Beethoven composed most 
of his earlier pieces in this tradition, following in the footsteps 
of role models like Mozart and Haydn. But with his Fifth Symphony, he
experimented with elements of Romanticism. This blossoming mode of composition was
known for its expressive melodies, extended forms 
and surprising instrumentations. The first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth
uses a Classical sonata form, in which a central musical idea 
is explored, developed, and repeated in an altered manner. Within these parameters, he explores 
a simple idea with incredible depth. A single rhythmic motif serves as the 
building block for most of the movement: three short notes, 
followed by a lingering fourth. One of Beethoven’s biographers would 
later call this pattern the “fate motif,” because it suggests
the figure of fate knocking at the door. While it's not clear if Beethoven composed
the motif with fate in mind, these notes certainly create
a gripping hook. The rhythmic pattern creates
forward movement, while the prolonged fourth note 
signals doom. This motif haunts the symphony, including its accompanying parts
and rhythmic flourishes. Beethoven experiments with dozens 
of variations, playing out across different 
instruments and pitches. Throughout the piece, this motif is passed
around the orchestra like a whisper, gradually reaching more and more 
instruments until it becomes a roar. The motif’s inventive repetition 
is a large part of what makes this piece so memorable, but it’s not the only innovation 
on display. This was the first major orchestral
composition to use trombones, and Beethoven also employs 
a high-pitched piccolo and a low-pitched contrabassoon to give the orchestra a wider range 
than most classical compositions. Exaggerated musical dynamics
further heighten the drama. And harmonically, the piece has
a clear emotional arc— beginning in a somber C minor 
and ending in a triumphant C major. This progression, from ominous unease
to majestic resolution, is a testament to Beethoven’s ability 
to inject raw emotionality into his music. He wrote this symphony 
while battling with hearing loss, and his anguish can be heard 
in the composition’s thunderous and repeating musical phrases. Beethoven continued to compose even
after he became completely deaf, producing innovative music
until his death in 1827. And the Fifth Symphony’s central motif 
has continued to resound through the ages. Outside of concert halls, the piece has become a symbol 
for suspense, revelation, and triumph. The fate motif sounds out the letter V 
in Morse code, and during World War II, the Fifth Symphony became a code 
for victory amongst the Allies. The iconic composition can
be found in film scores, and it’s even been explored through
musical reinterpretations and visual art. But whatever the context, Beethoven’s Fifth takes its listeners 
through a dark world, then guides them into the light.

These eight ferocious notes open one of the most explosive pieces
of music ever composed. Ludwig van Beethoven’s 
Symphony Number Five premiered in 1808, 
on a blisteringly cold Vienna night. The piece was just one small part
of a lengthy program, and the orchestra had been hastily

**Transcript**:
- This is the most dangerous
problem in mathematics, one that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's
best mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're gonna apply two rules. If the number is odd, we
multiply by three and add one. So three times seven
is 21, plus one is 22. If the number is even, we divide by two. So 22 divided by two is 11. Now, we keep applying these two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply
by 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by two, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by two, 26, still even. Divide by two, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39,
add one, and that's 40, which is even, so we divide by two, 20, divide by two, 10,
divide by two, five, odd. Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16, divide by two that's eight,
and then four, two, and one. Now, one is odd, so we
multiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one, so we're in a loop, and
the lowest number is one. Now, the conjecture is this: every positive integer,
if you apply these rules, will eventually end up in
the four, two, one loop. This is commonly called
the Collatz conjecture after German mathematician,
Luther Collatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many
origin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1. Why is 3x+1 so famous? - Among professional mathematicians, maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone
actually admits in public that they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them. (laughs) - [Narrator] The numbers
you get by applying 3x+1 are called hailstone numbers, because they go up and down like hailstones in a thundercloud, but eventually, they all fall down to one, or at least we think they do. You can think of the numbers as representing the height
above the ground in meters. So a number like 26 would start
26 meters above the ground. And if you apply 3x+1, it rises up as high as 40 meters. And, in total, it takes
10 steps to get to one. So 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all
the way up to 9,232. As an altitude, that is
higher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground. In total, it takes 111 steps
for 27 to get down to one and end up in the four, two, one loop. The paths that different
numbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other. So how do you even start to
make progress on this problem? Well, honestly, mathematicians struggled. - People just decided that this was something
invented by the Soviets to slow down U.S. science, and it was doing a good job at it 'cause everybody's sitting
there twiddling their thumbs and making no progress
on this trivial thing that you can tell a school of children. - [Narrator] Jeffrey Lagarias is the world authority on 3x+1. - The first time I met him
I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and
he said, "Don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending
time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while
to establish yourself." - [Narrator] Alex
Kontorovich didn't listen. He and Yakov Sinai looked at the paths of
the hailstone numbers. Were there any patterns? But obviously all of them ended up at one. But what about the paths
they take to get there? The pattern is randomness. Here is the sequence of a
large number chosen at random. The graph peaks and then drop so low that you can't really see
what's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm, you find this wiggly graph
with a downward trend. It looks like the stock
market on a bad day. And this is no coincidence. Both are examples of
geometric Brownian motion. That means if you take the log
and remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up, tails, it goes down. 3x+1 is just like the random
wiggles of the stock market. Over long-enough periods, the stock market tends to trend upwards, while 3x+1 trends down. Another way to analyze 3x+1 is by looking at the
leading digit of each number in a sequence. Here are the hailstone
numbers starting with three as the seed. And we can count up how many
numbers start with a one, how many start with a two, how many start with a three,
and so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the sequence that starts with four,
and that's a short one, and for the sequences that
start with five, six, and seven. Again, for each sequence, we're just counting up how many numbers start with each digit, one through nine, and adding that to our histogram. If you keep doing this
for more and more numbers, eventually the histogram
settles into a stable pattern. For the first billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the
most common leading digit. 30% of all numbers start with one, around 17.5% start with
two, 12% start with three, and the frequency decreases
for higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the
numbers start with nine. Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x+1. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries, to the value of companies, all the physical constants
and the Fibonacci numbers, just to name a few. The distribution is
known as Benford's law, and it is even used to detect fraud. If all the numbers on
your income tax forms obey Benford's law, then, well, you're probably being honest. If not, you may be hiding something. In elections, Benford's law can be used to spot irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best
when the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude as they do for 3x+1. But Benford's law can't tell us whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop or not. For that, we need a
different sort of analysis. Now, at first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x+1, all numbers should end up at one. I mean, consider that
there are the same number of odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in half. Therefore, it seems like
every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the catch. Every time you multiply
an odd number by three and then add one, it will
always become an even number, and that means the next
step is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not
actually tripled by 3x+1. They're increased by a factor
of about three over two. I'm neglecting the plus one because it's insignificant
for large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the
numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up
under the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest
living mathematicians, Terry Tao, was able to show 3x+1 obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all
numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x so long as that function goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise
as slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,
for almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples. - It had happened to
me just two years ago, where there was something
I was trying to prove, that I was trying for
three years to prove, and I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counterexample, and then I realized what
the correct statement should have been. And then a month later, I
proved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples
than we're currently spending. - [Narrator] I mean,
remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number
reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can
be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example,
climbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just
shoot off to infinity. And it would take only one
to disprove the conjecture, or some set of numbers
could be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is
only one loop: four, two, one. But something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low
values like -17 and -5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most
convincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture
is Terry Tao's proof that almost all numbers have
a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all
numbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as
proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are
not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite
number of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has
transformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you
like, so long as it is finite. But if you want a number that
increases by three over two five consecutive times, you
can calculate that number. If you want a number that
climbs by three over two 10 times in a row, or
100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been
tested, always falls to one. If there is a counterexample, it's virtually impossible
that someone's gonna guess it. And the space of all possibilities is too big to search
exhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by
some intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false. And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling to prove this thing because
it's not actually true? And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence. And even the statistical
version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created
a generalization of 3x+1. It was a mathematical machine
that he called FRACTRAN. And he was able to show this
machine is turing-complete, which means it can do anything
a modern computer can do, but it also means that it's
subject to the halting problem, a chance that the machine
never stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject
to the halting problem, but it is possible that
given what we know, we may never prove the Collatz
conjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of
stuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows
that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems. - For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as
these incredibly regular things full of patterns,
symmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly
in the coral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,
organic-looking, and, thus far, intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to the structure, or is there some unique filament,
a spindly little thread, that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it so hard to tell? I think that's why Paul Erdos said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." (gentle music) What I love about 3x+1 is it's a problem almost
anyone can understand and play around with. And actually trying to figure
things out for yourself is the best way to learn, which is why I subscribed to Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Now, recently, Brilliant have
upped their interactivity. For example, here is a great lesson on the Pythagorean theorem. So, you don't just remember the formula, but you really understand what it means. Now, Brilliant is a website and an app designed to get you thinking deeply by engaging you in problem-solving. It's one thing to read through a textbook and think that you get it, but it's quite another
to play with interactives and actually test yourself as you go, and Brilliant curates the experiences so they get more and more
challenging over time. There's always a helpful
tip or explanation that takes your understanding
to the next level. I'd highly recommend their course on mathematical fundamentals, which now has even more interactivity and it has topics that are
relevant to all areas of STEM and algorithm fundamentals for
anyone interested in coding. It's great to have a resource like this to inspire you to learn
something new every single day. I try to start off my day by challenging myself with Brilliant. And so if you'd like to join me and a community of 8
million other learners, go to brilliant.org/veritasium. I will put that link

**Transcript**:
- This is the most dangerous
problem in mathematics, one that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's
best mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're gonna apply two rules. If the number is odd, we
multiply by three and add one. So three times seven
is 21, plus one is 22. If the number is even, we divide by two. So 22 divided by two is 11. Now, we keep applying these two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply
by 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by two, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by two, 26, still even. Divide by two, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39,
add one, and that's 40, which is even, so we divide by two, 20, divide by two, 10,
divide by two, five, odd. Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16, divide by two that's eight,
and then four, two, and one. Now, one is odd, so we
multiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one, so we're in a loop, and
the lowest number is one. Now, the conjecture is this: every positive integer,
if you apply these rules, will eventually end up in
the four, two, one loop. This is commonly called
the Collatz conjecture after German mathematician,
Luther Collatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many
origin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1. Why is 3x+1 so famous? - Among professional mathematicians, maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone
actually admits in public that they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them. (laughs) - [Narrator] The numbers
you get by applying 3x+1 are called hailstone numbers, because they go up and down like hailstones in a thundercloud, but eventually, they all fall down to one, or at least we think they do. You can think of the numbers as representing the height
above the ground in meters. So a number like 26 would start
26 meters above the ground. And if you apply 3x+1, it rises up as high as 40 meters. And, in total, it takes
10 steps to get to one. So 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all
the way up to 9,232. As an altitude, that is
higher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground. In total, it takes 111 steps
for 27 to get down to one and end up in the four, two, one loop. The paths that different
numbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other. So how do you even start to
make progress on this problem? Well, honestly, mathematicians struggled. - People just decided that this was something
invented by the Soviets to slow down U.S. science, and it was doing a good job at it 'cause everybody's sitting
there twiddling their thumbs and making no progress
on this trivial thing that you can tell a school of children. - [Narrator] Jeffrey Lagarias is the world authority on 3x+1. - The first time I met him
I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and
he said, "Don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending
time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while
to establish yourself." - [Narrator] Alex
Kontorovich didn't listen. He and Yakov Sinai looked at the paths of
the hailstone numbers. Were there any patterns? But obviously all of them ended up at one. But what about the paths
they take to get there? The pattern is randomness. Here is the sequence of a
large number chosen at random. The graph peaks and then drop so low that you can't really see
what's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm, you find this wiggly graph
with a downward trend. It looks like the stock
market on a bad day. And this is no coincidence. Both are examples of
geometric Brownian motion. That means if you take the log
and remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up, tails, it goes down. 3x+1 is just like the random
wiggles of the stock market. Over long-enough periods, the stock market tends to trend upwards, while 3x+1 trends down. Another way to analyze 3x+1 is by looking at the
leading digit of each number in a sequence. Here are the hailstone
numbers starting with three as the seed. And we can count up how many
numbers start with a one, how many start with a two, how many start with a three,
and so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the sequence that starts with four,
and that's a short one, and for the sequences that
start with five, six, and seven. Again, for each sequence, we're just counting up how many numbers start with each digit, one through nine, and adding that to our histogram. If you keep doing this
for more and more numbers, eventually the histogram
settles into a stable pattern. For the first billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the
most common leading digit. 30% of all numbers start with one, around 17.5% start with
two, 12% start with three, and the frequency decreases
for higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the
numbers start with nine. Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x+1. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries, to the value of companies, all the physical constants
and the Fibonacci numbers, just to name a few. The distribution is
known as Benford's law, and it is even used to detect fraud. If all the numbers on
your income tax forms obey Benford's law, then, well, you're probably being honest. If not, you may be hiding something. In elections, Benford's law can be used to spot irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best
when the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude as they do for 3x+1. But Benford's law can't tell us whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop or not. For that, we need a
different sort of analysis. Now, at first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x+1, all numbers should end up at one. I mean, consider that
there are the same number of odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in half. Therefore, it seems like
every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the catch. Every time you multiply
an odd number by three and then add one, it will
always become an even number, and that means the next
step is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not
actually tripled by 3x+1. They're increased by a factor
of about three over two. I'm neglecting the plus one because it's insignificant
for large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the
numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up
under the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest

but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is

**Transcript**:
- This is the most dangerous
problem in mathematics, one that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's
best mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're gonna apply two rules. If the number is odd, we
multiply by three and add one. So three times seven
is 21, plus one is 22. If the number is even, we divide by two. So 22 divided by two is 11. Now, we keep applying these two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply
by 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by two, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by two, 26, still even. Divide by two, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39,
add one, and that's 40, which is even, so we divide by two, 20, divide by two, 10,
divide by two, five, odd. Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16, divide by two that's eight,
and then four, two, and one. Now, one is odd, so we
multiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one, so we're in a loop, and
the lowest number is one. Now, the conjecture is this: every positive integer,
if you apply these rules, will eventually end up in
the four, two, one loop. This is commonly called
the Collatz conjecture after German mathematician,
Luther Collatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many
origin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1. Why is 3x+1 so famous? - Among professional mathematicians, maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone
actually admits in public that they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them. (laughs) - [Narrator] The numbers
you get by applying 3x+1 are called hailstone numbers, because they go up and down like hailstones in a thundercloud, but eventually, they all fall down to one, or at least we think they do. You can think of the numbers as representing the height
above the ground in meters. So a number like 26 would start
26 meters above the ground. And if you apply 3x+1, it rises up as high as 40 meters. And, in total, it takes
10 steps to get to one. So 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all
the way up to 9,232. As an altitude, that is
higher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground. In total, it takes 111 steps
for 27 to get down to one and end up in the four, two, one loop. The paths that different
numbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other. So how do you even start to
make progress on this problem? Well, honestly, mathematicians struggled. - People just decided that this was something
invented by the Soviets to slow down U.S. science, and it was doing a good job at it 'cause everybody's sitting
there twiddling their thumbs and making no progress
on this trivial thing that you can tell a school of children. - [Narrator] Jeffrey Lagarias is the world authority on 3x+1. - The first time I met him
I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and
he said, "Don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending
time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while
to establish yourself." - [Narrator] Alex
Kontorovich didn't listen. He and Yakov Sinai looked at the paths of
the hailstone numbers. Were there any patterns? But obviously all of them ended up at one. But what about the paths
they take to get there? The pattern is randomness. Here is the sequence of a
large number chosen at random. The graph peaks and then drop so low that you can't really see
what's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm, you find this wiggly graph
with a downward trend. It looks like the stock
market on a bad day. And this is no coincidence. Both are examples of
geometric Brownian motion. That means if you take the log
and remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up, tails, it goes down. 3x+1 is just like the random
wiggles of the stock market. Over long-enough periods, the stock market tends to trend upwards, while 3x+1 trends down. Another way to analyze 3x+1 is by looking at the
leading digit of each number in a sequence. Here are the hailstone
numbers starting with three as the seed. And we can count up how many
numbers start with a one, how many start with a two, how many start with a three,
and so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the sequence that starts with four,
and that's a short one, and for the sequences that
start with five, six, and seven. Again, for each sequence, we're just counting up how many numbers start with each digit, one through nine, and adding that to our histogram. If you keep doing this
for more and more numbers, eventually the histogram
settles into a stable pattern. For the first billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the
most common leading digit. 30% of all numbers start with one, around 17.5% start with
two, 12% start with three, and the frequency decreases
for higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the
numbers start with nine. Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x+1. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries, to the value of companies, all the physical constants
and the Fibonacci numbers, just to name a few. The distribution is
known as Benford's law, and it is even used to detect fraud. If all the numbers on
your income tax forms obey Benford's law, then, well, you're probably being honest. If not, you may be hiding something. In elections, Benford's law can be used to spot irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best
when the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude as they do for 3x+1. But Benford's law can't tell us whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop or not. For that, we need a
different sort of analysis. Now, at first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x+1, all numbers should end up at one. I mean, consider that
there are the same number of odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in half. Therefore, it seems like
every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the catch. Every time you multiply
an odd number by three and then add one, it will
always become an even number, and that means the next
step is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not
actually tripled by 3x+1. They're increased by a factor
of about three over two. I'm neglecting the plus one because it's insignificant
for large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the
numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up
under the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest
living mathematicians, Terry Tao, was able to show 3x+1 obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all
numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x so long as that function goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise
as slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,
for almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples. - It had happened to
me just two years ago, where there was something
I was trying to prove, that I was trying for
three years to prove, and I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counterexample, and then I realized what
the correct statement should have been. And then a month later, I
proved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples
than we're currently spending. - [Narrator] I mean,
remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number
reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can
be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example,
climbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just
shoot off to infinity. And it would take only one
to disprove the conjecture, or some set of numbers
could be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is
only one loop: four, two, one. But something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low
values like -17 and -5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most
convincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture
is Terry Tao's proof that almost all numbers have
a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all
numbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as
proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are
not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite
number of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has
transformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you
like, so long as it is finite. But if you want a number that
increases by three over two five consecutive times, you
can calculate that number. If you want a number that
climbs by three over two 10 times in a row, or
100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been
tested, always falls to one. If there is a counterexample, it's virtually impossible
that someone's gonna guess it. And the space of all possibilities is too big to search
exhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by
some intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false. And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling to prove this thing because
it's not actually true? And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence. And even the statistical
version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created
a generalization of 3x+1. It was a mathematical machine
that he called FRACTRAN. And he was able to show this
machine is turing-complete, which means it can do anything
a modern computer can do, but it also means that it's
subject to the halting problem, a chance that the machine
never stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject
to the halting problem, but it is possible that
given what we know, we may never prove the Collatz
conjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of
stuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows
that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems. - For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as
these incredibly regular things full of patterns,
symmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly
in the coral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,
organic-looking, and, thus far, intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to the structure, or is there some unique filament,
a spindly little thread, that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it so hard to tell? I think that's why Paul Erdos said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." (gentle music) What I love about 3x+1 is it's a problem almost

I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and
he said, "Don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending
time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while
to establish yourself." - [Narrator] Alex
Kontorovich didn't listen. He and Yakov Sinai looked at the paths of
the hailstone numbers. Were there any patterns? But obviously all of them ended up at one. But what about the paths
they take to get there? The pattern is randomness. Here is the sequence of a
large number chosen at random. The graph peaks and then drop so low that you can't really see
what's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm, you find this wiggly graph
with a downward trend. It looks like the stock
market on a bad day. And this is no coincidence. Both are examples of
geometric Brownian motion. That means if you take the log
and remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up, tails, it goes down. 3x+1 is just like the random
wiggles of the stock market. Over long-enough periods, the stock market tends to trend upwards, while 3x+1 trends down. Another way to analyze 3x+1 is by looking at the
leading digit of each number in a sequence. Here are the hailstone
numbers starting with three as the seed. And we can count up how many
numbers start with a one, how many start with a two, how many start with a three,
and so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the sequence that starts with four,
and that's a short one, and for the sequences that
start with five, six, and seven. Again, for each sequence, we're just counting up how many numbers start with each digit, one through nine, and adding that to our histogram. If you keep doing this
for more and more numbers, eventually the histogram
settles into a stable pattern. For the first billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the
most common leading digit. 30% of all numbers start with one, around 17.5% start with
two, 12% start with three, and the frequency decreases
for higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the
numbers start with nine. Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x+1. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries, to the value of companies, all the physical constants
and the Fibonacci numbers, just to name a few. The distribution is
known as Benford's law, and it is even used to detect fraud. If all the numbers on
your income tax forms obey Benford's law, then, well, you're probably being honest. If not, you may be hiding something. In elections, Benford's law can be used to spot irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best
when the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude as they do for 3x+1. But Benford's law can't tell us whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop or not. For that, we need a
different sort of analysis. Now, at first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x+1, all numbers should end up at one. I mean, consider that
there are the same number of odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in half. Therefore, it seems like
every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the catch. Every time you multiply
an odd number by three and then add one, it will
always become an even number, and that means the next
step is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not
actually tripled by 3x+1. They're increased by a factor
of about three over two. I'm neglecting the plus one because it's insignificant
for large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the
numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up
under the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest
living mathematicians, Terry Tao, was able to show 3x+1 obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all
numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x so long as that function goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise
as slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,
for almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples. - It had happened to
me just two years ago, where there was something
I was trying to prove, that I was trying for
three years to prove, and I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counterexample, and then I realized what
the correct statement should have been. And then a month later, I
proved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples
than we're currently spending. - [Narrator] I mean,
remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number
reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can
be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example,
climbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just
shoot off to infinity. And it would take only one
to disprove the conjecture, or some set of numbers
could be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is
only one loop: four, two, one. But something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low
values like -17 and -5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most
convincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture
is Terry Tao's proof that almost all numbers have
a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all
numbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as
proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are
not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite
number of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has
transformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you
like, so long as it is finite. But if you want a number that
increases by three over two five consecutive times, you
can calculate that number. If you want a number that
climbs by three over two 10 times in a row, or
100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been
tested, always falls to one. If there is a counterexample, it's virtually impossible
that someone's gonna guess it. And the space of all possibilities is too big to search
exhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by
some intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false. And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling to prove this thing because
it's not actually true? And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence. And even the statistical
version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created
a generalization of 3x+1. It was a mathematical machine
that he called FRACTRAN. And he was able to show this
machine is turing-complete, which means it can do anything
a modern computer can do, but it also means that it's
subject to the halting problem, a chance that the machine
never stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject
to the halting problem, but it is possible that
given what we know, we may never prove the Collatz
conjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of
stuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows
that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems. - For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as
these incredibly regular things full of patterns,
symmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly
in the coral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,
organic-looking, and, thus far, intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to the structure, or is there some unique filament,
a spindly little thread, that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it so hard to tell? I think that's why Paul Erdos said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." (gentle music) What I love about 3x+1 is it's a problem almost
anyone can understand and play around with. And actually trying to figure
things out for yourself is the best way to learn, which is why I subscribed to Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Now, recently, Brilliant have
upped their interactivity. For example, here is a great lesson on the Pythagorean theorem. So, you don't just remember the formula, but you really understand what it means. Now, Brilliant is a website and an app designed to get you thinking deeply by engaging you in problem-solving. It's one thing to read through a textbook and think that you get it, but it's quite another
to play with interactives and actually test yourself as you go, and Brilliant curates the experiences so they get more and more
challenging over time. There's always a helpful
tip or explanation that takes your understanding
to the next level. I'd highly recommend their course on mathematical fundamentals, which now has even more interactivity and it has topics that are
relevant to all areas of STEM and algorithm fundamentals for
anyone interested in coding. It's great to have a resource like this to inspire you to learn
something new every single day. I try to start off my day by challenging myself with Brilliant. And so if you'd like to join me and a community of 8
million other learners, go to brilliant.org/veritasium. I will put that link
down in the description. So I wanna thank Brilliant

**Transcript**:
- This is the most dangerous
problem in mathematics, one that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's
best mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're gonna apply two rules. If the number is odd, we
multiply by three and add one. So three times seven
is 21, plus one is 22. If the number is even, we divide by two. So 22 divided by two is 11. Now, we keep applying these two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply
by 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by two, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by two, 26, still even. Divide by two, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39,
add one, and that's 40, which is even, so we divide by two, 20, divide by two, 10,
divide by two, five, odd. Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16, divide by two that's eight,
and then four, two, and one. Now, one is odd, so we
multiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one, so we're in a loop, and
the lowest number is one. Now, the conjecture is this: every positive integer,
if you apply these rules, will eventually end up in
the four, two, one loop. This is commonly called
the Collatz conjecture after German mathematician,
Luther Collatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many
origin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1. Why is 3x+1 so famous? - Among professional mathematicians, maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone
actually admits in public that they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them. (laughs) - [Narrator] The numbers
you get by applying 3x+1 are called hailstone numbers, because they go up and down like hailstones in a thundercloud, but eventually, they all fall down to one, or at least we think they do. You can think of the numbers as representing the height
above the ground in meters. So a number like 26 would start
26 meters above the ground. And if you apply 3x+1, it rises up as high as 40 meters. And, in total, it takes
10 steps to get to one. So 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all
the way up to 9,232. As an altitude, that is
higher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground. In total, it takes 111 steps
for 27 to get down to one and end up in the four, two, one loop. The paths that different
numbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other. So how do you even start to
make progress on this problem? Well, honestly, mathematicians struggled. - People just decided that this was something
invented by the Soviets to slow down U.S. science, and it was doing a good job at it 'cause everybody's sitting
there twiddling their thumbs and making no progress
on this trivial thing that you can tell a school of children. - [Narrator] Jeffrey Lagarias is the world authority on 3x+1. - The first time I met him
I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and
he said, "Don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending
time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while
to establish yourself." - [Narrator] Alex

in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples. - It had happened to
me just two years ago, where there was something
I was trying to prove, that I was trying for
three years to prove, and I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counterexample, and then I realized what
the correct statement should have been. And then a month later, I
proved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples
than we're currently spending. - [Narrator] I mean,
remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number
reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can
be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example,
climbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just
shoot off to infinity. And it would take only one
to disprove the conjecture, or some set of numbers
could be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is
only one loop: four, two, one. But something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low
values like -17 and -5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most
convincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture
is Terry Tao's proof that almost all numbers have
a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all
numbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as
proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are
not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite
number of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has
transformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you
like, so long as it is finite. But if you want a number that
increases by three over two five consecutive times, you
can calculate that number. If you want a number that
climbs by three over two 10 times in a row, or
100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been
tested, always falls to one. If there is a counterexample, it's virtually impossible
that someone's gonna guess it. And the space of all possibilities is too big to search
exhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by
some intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false. And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling to prove this thing because
it's not actually true? And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence. And even the statistical
version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created
a generalization of 3x+1. It was a mathematical machine
that he called FRACTRAN. And he was able to show this
machine is turing-complete, which means it can do anything
a modern computer can do, but it also means that it's
subject to the halting problem, a chance that the machine
never stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject
to the halting problem, but it is possible that
given what we know, we may never prove the Collatz
conjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of
stuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows
that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems. - For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as
these incredibly regular things full of patterns,
symmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly
in the coral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,
organic-looking, and, thus far, intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to the structure, or is there some unique filament,
a spindly little thread, that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it so hard to tell? I think that's why Paul Erdos said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." (gentle music) What I love about 3x+1 is it's a problem almost
anyone can understand and play around with. And actually trying to figure
things out for yourself is the best way to learn, which is why I subscribed to Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Now, recently, Brilliant have
upped their interactivity. For example, here is a great lesson on the Pythagorean theorem. So, you don't just remember the formula, but you really understand what it means. Now, Brilliant is a website and an app designed to get you thinking deeply by engaging you in problem-solving. It's one thing to read through a textbook and think that you get it, but it's quite another
to play with interactives and actually test yourself as you go, and Brilliant curates the experiences so they get more and more
challenging over time. There's always a helpful
tip or explanation that takes your understanding
to the next level. I'd highly recommend their course on mathematical fundamentals, which now has even more interactivity and it has topics that are
relevant to all areas of STEM and algorithm fundamentals for
anyone interested in coding. It's great to have a resource like this to inspire you to learn
something new every single day. I try to start off my day by challenging myself with Brilliant. And so if you'd like to join me and a community of 8
million other learners, go to brilliant.org/veritasium. I will put that link
down in the description. So I wanna thank Brilliant
for sponsoring this video, and I wanna thank you for watching.

**Transcript**:
In 1932, the Great Depression
entered its third winter. One in four Americans was unemployed, marking the highest unemployment rate
in the country’s history. Tens of thousands had lost 
their homes and life savings, and there was very little confidence that
Republican President Herbert Hoover could turn things around. So when the election came, voters flocked 
to his Democratic competitor. Franklin D. Roosevelt promised
a New Deal for Americans— a comprehensive set of legislation 
to support struggling citizens and put the country back to work. The massive federal intervention Roosevelt
proposed was a radical challenge to the individualist ideals that governed
many Americans’ lives. But due to the extreme circumstances, he began his presidency 
with public and political support. With the help of his advisers, Roosevelt’s
first hundred days in office were perhaps the most eventful 
of any US president. In just over three months, he pushed 
over 15 bills through Congress and created an “alphabet soup” 
of government agencies to help farmers, workers, and businesses. The New Deal’s first priority was
stabilizing the banks. Over the previous three years, 
many Americans had withdrawn their savings out of fear the bank would lose 
their money in bad investments. So to regain the public's confidence, FDR increased federal oversight
of commercial banks, and created bank insurance to guarantee
that any deposited funds would always be available. Next, he established the Federal Emergency
Relief Administration. FERA cataloged each state’s
need for relief and provided funds to help citizens afford
groceries, rent, clothing, coal, and other necessities. Meanwhile, the Agricultural Adjustment
Administration subsidized farmers and educated them in improving
planting techniques. These policies fed and housed thousands, but they didn’t significantly address 
the New Deal’s biggest promise: reducing unemployment. So the Civilian Conservation Corps was
established to employ over 250,000 young men for projects like tree planting, irrigation, 
and fire prevention. The CCC offered onsite work camps that provided food, shelter, 
and education to those employed; mostly young, single men 
with families in need of relief. Subsequent programs 
like the Works Progress Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority added projects building roads, bridges, 
and hydroelectric dams. The WPA also funded art, writing,
and theater programs. These initiatives cut 
civilian unemployment in half. And they did so alongside labor acts 
that abolished child labor, granted unions the right 
to collective bargaining, and set the first national minimum wage. Benefits were also created to help 
those unable to work. The Social Security Act established 
an old-age pension system in addition to unemployment insurance, 
disability benefits, and welfare assistance. But despite these sweeping policies, the New Deal helped some groups
more than others. Black Americans were hit hardest
by the economic downturn, and the New Deal’s impact 
on Black communities varied widely. In northern cities like Chicago, Black citizens received a large share of 
jobs, vocational training, and education, with New Deal programs teaching more than
one million Black Americans to read. Northern Black communities also received
an influx of public housing, though it was heavily segregated. In the South, results were less positive. Roosevelt relied heavily on the support 
of Southern Democrats, who welcomed economic development 
but fought to preserve white supremacy. They ensured that new labor laws excluded domestic servants 
and agricultural workers, occupations held by many Black Americans. These politicians and many others also
undermined Eleanor Roosevelt’s attempts to push her husband toward supporting
a federal anti-lynching law. As a result, the New Deal has often been
called a “raw deal” for Black communities. And many modern inequities in housing, 
employment, and financial stability are partially due to New Deal programs 
prioritizing white Americans. In these ways and more, the New Deal 
didn’t fully live up to its promises. Despite employing 
over 8 million Americans, unemployment never went
lower than 14%. And the US economy wouldn’t fully
recover until the country’s mobilization for World War II. But this bold campaign 
of progressive policies did empower unions to start 
their own revolution. In the coming decades, northern liberals, 
Black Americans, and other working minorities, united to fight discriminatory hiring. In the process, they reshaped
the Democratic Party; challenging its racist leadership, and laying the groundwork 
for an emerging civil rights coalition.

**Transcript**:
In 1932, the Great Depression
entered its third winter. One in four Americans was unemployed, marking the highest unemployment rate
in the country’s history. Tens of thousands had lost 
their homes and life savings, and there was very little confidence that
Republican President Herbert Hoover could turn things around. So when the election came, voters flocked 
to his Democratic competitor. Franklin D. Roosevelt promised
a New Deal for Americans— a comprehensive set of legislation 
to support struggling citizens and put the country back to work. The massive federal intervention Roosevelt
proposed was a radical challenge to the individualist ideals that governed
many Americans’ lives. But due to the extreme circumstances, he began his presidency 
with public and political support. With the help of his advisers, Roosevelt’s
first hundred days in office were perhaps the most eventful 
of any US president. In just over three months, he pushed 
over 15 bills through Congress and created an “alphabet soup” 
of government agencies to help farmers, workers, and businesses. The New Deal’s first priority was
stabilizing the banks. Over the previous three years, 
many Americans had withdrawn their savings out of fear the bank would lose 
their money in bad investments. So to regain the public's confidence, FDR increased federal oversight
of commercial banks, and created bank insurance to guarantee
that any deposited funds would always be available. Next, he established the Federal Emergency
Relief Administration. FERA cataloged each state’s
need for relief and provided funds to help citizens afford
groceries, rent, clothing, coal, and other necessities. Meanwhile, the Agricultural Adjustment
Administration subsidized farmers and educated them in improving
planting techniques. These policies fed and housed thousands, but they didn’t significantly address 
the New Deal’s biggest promise: reducing unemployment. So the Civilian Conservation Corps was
established to employ over 250,000 young men for projects like tree planting, irrigation, 
and fire prevention. The CCC offered onsite work camps that provided food, shelter, 
and education to those employed; mostly young, single men 
with families in need of relief. Subsequent programs 
like the Works Progress Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority added projects building roads, bridges, 
and hydroelectric dams. The WPA also funded art, writing,
and theater programs. These initiatives cut 
civilian unemployment in half. And they did so alongside labor acts 
that abolished child labor, granted unions the right 
to collective bargaining, and set the first national minimum wage. Benefits were also created to help 
those unable to work. The Social Security Act established 
an old-age pension system in addition to unemployment insurance, 
disability benefits, and welfare assistance. But despite these sweeping policies, the New Deal helped some groups
more than others. Black Americans were hit hardest
by the economic downturn, and the New Deal’s impact 
on Black communities varied widely. In northern cities like Chicago, Black citizens received a large share of 
jobs, vocational training, and education, with New Deal programs teaching more than
one million Black Americans to read. Northern Black communities also received
an influx of public housing, though it was heavily segregated. In the South, results were less positive. Roosevelt relied heavily on the support 
of Southern Democrats, who welcomed economic development 
but fought to preserve white supremacy. They ensured that new labor laws excluded domestic servants 
and agricultural workers, occupations held by many Black Americans. These politicians and many others also
undermined Eleanor Roosevelt’s attempts to push her husband toward supporting
a federal anti-lynching law. As a result, the New Deal has often been
called a “raw deal” for Black communities. And many modern inequities in housing, 
employment, and financial stability are partially due to New Deal programs 
prioritizing white Americans. In these ways and more, the New Deal 
didn’t fully live up to its promises. Despite employing 
over 8 million Americans, unemployment never went
lower than 14%. And the US economy wouldn’t fully
recover until the country’s mobilization for World War II. But this bold campaign 
of progressive policies did empower unions to start 
their own revolution. In the coming decades, northern liberals, 
Black Americans, and other working minorities, united to fight discriminatory hiring. In the process, they reshaped
the Democratic Party; challenging its racist leadership, and laying the groundwork 
for an emerging civil rights coalition.

**Transcript**:
In 1849, in the ancient city 
of Nineveh in northern Iraq, archaeologists sifted 
through dusty remains, hoping to find records to prove
that Bible stories were true. What they found instead was 
one of the oldest libraries in the world. Inscribed on crumbling clay tablets
was a 4,000-year-old story so riveting the first person to translate
it started stripping from excitement. Called the epic of Gilgamesh, the story starts with Gilgamesh,
king of the city of Uruk, crashing every wedding 
and sleeping with the bride before she has a chance 
to sleep with her husband. To tame Gilgamesh, the goddess Aruru 
created a rival called Enkidu. Enkidu lived beyond the walls of the city, where chaos reigned and wild animals, 
invaders, and evil spirits prowled. After a priestess of the goddess Ishtar 
seduced Enkidu, the wild animals beyond the wall rejected
him and he ventured into the city. There, he encountered Gilgamesh
up to his usual tricks. Enkidu stepped in to stop him. Almost perfectly matched, the two men
wrestled all through the city streets until Gilgamesh won the fight by a hair. Afterwards, they were inseparable. With his new friend, Gilgamesh turned 
his attention from the brides of Uruk to proving his strength in combat. They set out to slay Humbaba, a creature with a thousand faces who
guarded the trees of the Forest of Cedar. They tracked Humbaba and ambushed him. Cornered, he begged for his life, then cursed them 
as Gilgamesh dealt the final blow. Back home in Uruk, the goddess Ishtar 
took a romantic interest in Gilgamesh. Knowing she tended to lose interest
and curse her former flames, Gilgamesh refused her advances. So Ishtar unleashed the Bull of Heaven 
on Uruk to destroy crops and kill people. When Gilgamesh and Enkidu slayed 
the creature defending the city, the gods killed Enkidu. He entered the House of Dust, the shadowy Mesopotamian underworld 
where the spirits of the dead knelt eternally on the ground, 
eating dirt and drinking stone. Grieving for Enkidu and terrified
of meeting this fate himself, Gilgamesh set off beyond the cosmic
mountains to seek immortality. He passed scorpion people
and groves of gemstone trees, travelled beneath the mountains 
and outran the rising sun, until he finally came 
to the end of the world, where he found a bar. The bartender was a goddess named Shiduri, who urged Gilgamesh to give up his quest. She told him all mortals must die, but until death comes,
he should enjoy his life. But Gilgamesh refused to give up. Reluctantly, Shiduri gave him directions
to cross the Waters of Death and meet the immortal man Utanapishti. The gods had granted Utanapishti
immortality following a great flood, during which he built a boat, loaded two of every animal onto it,
and landed on a mountain peak. Utanapishti also encouraged Gilgamesh 
to accept that death comes for everyone. But Gilgamesh still would not budge. So Utanapishti told him 
that if he could conquer sleep, the gods might grant him immortality. Gilgamesh intended to stay
awake for seven days, but fell asleep immediately. Utanapishti then told him about a magical 
plant that grew at the bottom of the ocean and granted eternal youth. Though Gilgamesh successfully
retrieved the plant, a snake stole it on his way home. But when Gilgamesh laid eyes 
on his beautiful city again, he made peace with his mortality and vowed
to spend his lifetime doing great deeds. He wrote his story 
on a lapis lazuli tablet and buried it under the city walls for 
future generations to find and learn from. The tablets uncovered in Nineveh were part of the library 
of the Assyrian king, Ashurbanipal. Though the story is mythical, Gilgamesh 
was probably a real king of Uruk. Versions of his tale date to 2000 BCE
and perhaps even longer ago, and still echo through literature today.

seduced Enkidu, the wild animals beyond the wall rejected
him and he ventured into the city. There, he encountered Gilgamesh
up to his usual tricks. Enkidu stepped in to stop him. Almost perfectly matched, the two men
wrestled all through the city streets until Gilgamesh won the fight by a hair. Afterwards, they were inseparable. With his new friend, Gilgamesh turned 
his attention from the brides of Uruk to proving his strength in combat. They set out to slay Humbaba, a creature with a thousand faces who
guarded the trees of the Forest of Cedar. They tracked Humbaba and ambushed him. Cornered, he begged for his life, then cursed them 
as Gilgamesh dealt the final blow. Back home in Uruk, the goddess Ishtar 
took a romantic interest in Gilgamesh. Knowing she tended to lose interest
and curse her former flames, Gilgamesh refused her advances. So Ishtar unleashed the Bull of Heaven 
on Uruk to destroy crops and kill people. When Gilgamesh and Enkidu slayed 
the creature defending the city, the gods killed Enkidu. He entered the House of Dust, the shadowy Mesopotamian underworld 
where the spirits of the dead knelt eternally on the ground, 
eating dirt and drinking stone. Grieving for Enkidu and terrified
of meeting this fate himself, Gilgamesh set off beyond the cosmic
mountains to seek immortality. He passed scorpion people
and groves of gemstone trees, travelled beneath the mountains 
and outran the rising sun, until he finally came 
to the end of the world, where he found a bar. The bartender was a goddess named Shiduri, who urged Gilgamesh to give up his quest. She told him all mortals must die, but until death comes,
he should enjoy his life. But Gilgamesh refused to give up. Reluctantly, Shiduri gave him directions
to cross the Waters of Death and meet the immortal man Utanapishti. The gods had granted Utanapishti
immortality following a great flood, during which he built a boat, loaded two of every animal onto it,
and landed on a mountain peak. Utanapishti also encouraged Gilgamesh 
to accept that death comes for everyone. But Gilgamesh still would not budge. So Utanapishti told him 
that if he could conquer sleep, the gods might grant him immortality. Gilgamesh intended to stay
awake for seven days, but fell asleep immediately. Utanapishti then told him about a magical 
plant that grew at the bottom of the ocean and granted eternal youth. Though Gilgamesh successfully
retrieved the plant, a snake stole it on his way home. But when Gilgamesh laid eyes 
on his beautiful city again, he made peace with his mortality and vowed
to spend his lifetime doing great deeds. He wrote his story 
on a lapis lazuli tablet and buried it under the city walls for 
future generations to find and learn from. The tablets uncovered in Nineveh were part of the library 
of the Assyrian king, Ashurbanipal. Though the story is mythical, Gilgamesh 
was probably a real king of Uruk. Versions of his tale date to 2000 BCE
and perhaps even longer ago, and still echo through literature today.

**Transcript**:
In 1849, in the ancient city 
of Nineveh in northern Iraq, archaeologists sifted 
through dusty remains, hoping to find records to prove
that Bible stories were true. What they found instead was 
one of the oldest libraries in the world. Inscribed on crumbling clay tablets
was a 4,000-year-old story so riveting the first person to translate
it started stripping from excitement. Called the epic of Gilgamesh, the story starts with Gilgamesh,
king of the city of Uruk, crashing every wedding 
and sleeping with the bride before she has a chance 
to sleep with her husband. To tame Gilgamesh, the goddess Aruru 
created a rival called Enkidu. Enkidu lived beyond the walls of the city, where chaos reigned and wild animals,
