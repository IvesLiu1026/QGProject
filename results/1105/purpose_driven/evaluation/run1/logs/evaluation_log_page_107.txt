**Transcript**:
In the 7th century CE, 
one man started a chain of events that would change
the world order for good. The prophet Muhammad united the people
of the Arabian Peninsula through the formation of Islam. These people included both 
nomadic Bedouin tribes and the inhabitants of oasis cities
like Mecca and Medina. Until Muhammad’s time, the region 
hadn’t been considered a serious match for the powerful neighboring 
Persian and Byzantine empires. But the alliance Muhammad formed 
was political as well as religious, an empire with Medina 
as its political heart and a force to be reckoned with. Muhammad was a one-of-a-kind leader. He had been a member of the Quraysh,
the tribe that controlled Mecca. After Muhammad’s death, those close to him deliberated
who should succeed him— a contentious question. Abū Bakr, Muhammad’s father-in-law, emerged victorious and became 
the new caliph, or successor. Over the next 30 years, four caliphs,
all from Muhammad's tribe, conquered vast areas beyond Arabia, including their mighty neighbors, 
the Persians and the Byzantines. But as the empire expanded, 
dissent within it grew and a civil war erupted. The fourth caliph, Ali, was assassinated. Afterwards, the Umayyad Dynasty
came to power. The Umayyads were from the same tribe
as Muhammad, but from a different, rival clan. They extended the empire’s reach
from present-day Spain to India and made Damascus their capital. But an empire this vast, 
full of many different peoples, was at risk of conflict and fracture. The Umayyads stabilized it by replacing
the ruling elite in conquered territories with Muslim officials, while largely allowing the day-to-day
customs of local populations— including their religious preferences—
to continue. Arabic was used 
as the administrative language, unifying political affairs
across the empire, but people continued to speak and write
local languages, too. Still, many in the empire were
dissatisfied with Umayyad rule and questioned the dynasty's legitimacy. The Abbasid family capitalized
on these sentiments, promoting themselves as more direct
descendants of the prophet, though their actual relation to Muhammad
was more tenuous than they claimed. They overthrew the Umayyad caliphate
in 750 CE, becoming the second great dynasty
of the Islamic Empire. To establish themselves as the new rulers, they relocated the capital once more, this time building a new city: Baghdad. Under Abbasid rule, the elite 
enjoyed a lifestyle of luxury, thanks to extensive trade networks
that brought both products and people from all over the known world to Baghdad. Byzantine, Persian, Indian and Arab
cultures and knowledge intermingled, leading to artistic and scientific
advancement. The caliph was wealthy and powerful
beyond imagination. But there was never a clear line 
of succession dictating who would become
the next caliph. Any male relative of the former caliph 
was eligible, so brothers, nephews, and uncles 
fought to gain power. Within the court, army officers, wives, 
concubines, and government officials all demanded their share of the treasury. Because the caliph depended 
on his entourage to stay in power, each transition of rulership opened
the doors for favoritism and corruption. Outside the court, many questioned the legitimacy
of the caliph, noting that the caliph’s religious duty
to moral excellence was at odds with the court’s 
decadent displays of wealth. In 1258 CE, the Mongols
approached Baghdad. They encountered little resistance 
as they thoroughly destroyed the city. Legend has it that they rolled
the caliph in a rug and had horses trample him to death, and that the Tigris River ran
black from the ink of the manuscripts that were thrown into it. The siege of Baghdad laid bare
a longstanding reality: for centuries, the caliphs had
ruled mostly symbolically. Local leaders throughout the empire
had grown more powerful, and they refused to pay taxes, spending the money on their own courts
instead. The time of one united Islamic Empire
was over, but its influence 
through written and spoken Arabic, Islam, and the ideas 
of its greatest intellectuals, left a lasting mark on the world.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of relevance to the topic.

The ground truth MCQ asks about why Muhammad was a "one-of-a-kind" leader. The closest generated MCQ that relates to Muhammad's leadership is Question 1, which asks about who united the people of the Arabian Peninsula through the formation of Islam in the 7th century CE. However, this question does not directly address why Muhammad was a unique leader.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 1 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, Question 3 is the closest in terms of the topic of succession after Muhammad's death.

But a more similar question is Question 7. It deals with the issue of succession, which is related to the ground truth MCQ's focus on the cause of fighting among early Muslims due to disagreement on who should become the new leader.

However, the most similar generated MCQ is not among the provided options, as none directly address the cause of fighting among early Muslims. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 7 is the closest.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of topic relevance.

The ground truth MCQ is about the Islamic conquest and whether it involved large-scale forced conversion. The closest generated MCQ in terms of topic relevance is:

None of the above questions match the ground truth question, however Question 6 does mention the results of extensive trade networks which could imply the allowance of different cultures and possibly freedom of religion which is somewhat related to the ground truth question.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, and the similarity is quite low.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: 6 (with a very low confidence score)

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 5: What was the name of the city built by the Abbasid family as the new capital after they overthrew the Umayyad caliphate in 750 CE?**

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match is not present among the provided generated MCQs, but Question 5 hints at the change of capitals in the Islamic Empire, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **5**

However, I would like to note that the generated MCQs do not directly address the question of whether Mecca and Medina remained political centers throughout the history of the Islamic Empire. A more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically addresses this topic.

Here's an example of a generated MCQ that would more closely match the ground truth MCQ:

**Question: What happened to the political power of Mecca and Medina after the conquests of the Islamic Empire?**
Options: A. They remained the most important cities, B. They were replaced by Damascus and later Baghdad, C. They became less important but remained religious centers, D. They were never important to begin with.

This type of question would more directly match the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the 7th century CE, 
one man started a chain of events that would change
the world order for good. The prophet Muhammad united the people
of the Arabian Peninsula through the formation of Islam. These people included both 
nomadic Bedouin tribes and the inhabitants of oasis cities
like Mecca and Medina. Until Muhammad’s time, the region 
hadn’t been considered a serious match for the powerful neighboring 
Persian and Byzantine empires. But the alliance Muhammad formed 
was political as well as religious, an empire with Medina 
as its political heart and a force to be reckoned with. Muhammad was a one-of-a-kind leader. He had been a member of the Quraysh,
the tribe that controlled Mecca. After Muhammad’s death, those close to him deliberated
who should succeed him— a contentious question. Abū Bakr, Muhammad’s father-in-law, emerged victorious and became 
the new caliph, or successor. Over the next 30 years, four caliphs,
all from Muhammad's tribe, conquered vast areas beyond Arabia, including their mighty neighbors, 
the Persians and the Byzantines. But as the empire expanded, 
dissent within it grew and a civil war erupted. The fourth caliph, Ali, was assassinated. Afterwards, the Umayyad Dynasty
came to power. The Umayyads were from the same tribe
as Muhammad, but from a different, rival clan. They extended the empire’s reach
from present-day Spain to India and made Damascus their capital. But an empire this vast, 
full of many different peoples, was at risk of conflict and fracture. The Umayyads stabilized it by replacing
the ruling elite in conquered territories with Muslim officials, while largely allowing the day-to-day
customs of local populations— including their religious preferences—
to continue. Arabic was used 
as the administrative language, unifying political affairs
across the empire, but people continued to speak and write
local languages, too. Still, many in the empire were
dissatisfied with Umayyad rule and questioned the dynasty's legitimacy. The Abbasid family capitalized
on these sentiments, promoting themselves as more direct
descendants of the prophet, though their actual relation to Muhammad
was more tenuous than they claimed. They overthrew the Umayyad caliphate
in 750 CE, becoming the second great dynasty
of the Islamic Empire. To establish themselves as the new rulers, they relocated the capital once more, this time building a new city: Baghdad. Under Abbasid rule, the elite 
enjoyed a lifestyle of luxury, thanks to extensive trade networks
that brought both products and people from all over the known world to Baghdad. Byzantine, Persian, Indian and Arab
cultures and knowledge intermingled, leading to artistic and scientific
advancement. The caliph was wealthy and powerful
beyond imagination. But there was never a clear line 
of succession dictating who would become
the next caliph. Any male relative of the former caliph 
was eligible, so brothers, nephews, and uncles 
fought to gain power. Within the court, army officers, wives, 
concubines, and government officials all demanded their share of the treasury. Because the caliph depended 
on his entourage to stay in power, each transition of rulership opened
the doors for favoritism and corruption. Outside the court, many questioned the legitimacy
of the caliph, noting that the caliph’s religious duty
to moral excellence was at odds with the court’s 
decadent displays of wealth. In 1258 CE, the Mongols
approached Baghdad. They encountered little resistance 
as they thoroughly destroyed the city. Legend has it that they rolled
the caliph in a rug and had horses trample him to death, and that the Tigris River ran
black from the ink of the manuscripts that were thrown into it. The siege of Baghdad laid bare
a longstanding reality: for centuries, the caliphs had
ruled mostly symbolically. Local leaders throughout the empire
had grown more powerful, and they refused to pay taxes, spending the money on their own courts
instead. The time of one united Islamic Empire
was over, but its influence 
through written and spoken Arabic, Islam, and the ideas 
of its greatest intellectuals, left a lasting mark on the world.

**Transcript**:
These paintings are in peril. All three have been defaced, some in ways that are almost impossible
to see with the naked eye. Can you guess how they've been altered? You might be surprised. When a museum curator 
inspected this portrait, attributed to the 16th century 
Italian painter Bronzino, they suspected it was a modern fake. However, closely examining the cracks
on its surface, an art conservator discovered
that it was from that era— It had just undergone drastic changes
in recent centuries. Using x-ray technology, they peered 
under the outer surface of paint and saw the countenance 
of a completely different woman. Essential parts of the painting
had been modified during a 19th century restoration. Prior to the mid-20th century, art restorers took a more
heavy-handed approach, often believing they were improving art. Nowadays, they focus on keeping
the original work intact with minimal intervention. When they need to fix something up, they usually make their markings visually
and chemically distinct from the original, so they can be harmlessly removed. But the work of past restorers is a threat
they regularly contend with— as was the case with this portrait. To recover the original, the conservator began removing
the outer varnish coat. Varnish is commonly used to protect
paintings from debris and make their colors pop. But the natural varnishes past restorers
applied eventually darkened, which is what gives older paintings 
that aged, yellowy look. Slowly dissolving the varnish, the conservator uncovered
crisp colors below. Taking small samples from the added
and original paint layers, they analyzed the compositions of each. Then, they decided which solvents
could dissolve the overpainting while minimally affecting the original. Carefully dabbing the canvas with them, they removed the overpainting’s 
dainty hands and idealized face. The true painting underneath revealed
Isabella of the Italian Medici dynasty. The portrait isn’t Bronzino’s, but it is from around 1570,
and may have been painted by one of his students. Its Victorian makeover was likely done
to boost sales because the original subject wasn’t
considered attractive. But now, Isabella is back, 
meeting her viewer’s gaze directly. This painting, 
“An Allegory with Venus and Cupid,” is actually Bronzino’s, 
and it was completed around 1545. It centers on a kiss between Venus
and her son Cupid– but it’s been subtly altered. When London’s National Gallery
acquired it in 1860, the Gallery’s director deemed it 
too risqué for Victorian England. So, he commissioned a restorer to obscure
Venus’s tongue and nipple. A century after this modification, art conservators analyzed and removed
the overpainting with select solvents. In the process, they also realized 
that the veil covering Venus’s crotch and the branch hiding Cupid’s posterior
were other add-ons. Removing two layers of censorship
from the painting, it was finally free to boast
its provocative original details. This massive painting called 
“The Night Watch” was completed by Rembrandt in 1642. Since then, it’s endured one
dramatic amputation, two stabbings, an acid attack, and centuries of grime. A museum guard immediately neutralized
the acid with water. Restorers lifted the grime, revealing that the painting was
not set at night, and healed the slashes using adhesive
and extra canvas backing. But they faced an even trickier problem. In 1715, strips were removed
from all sides of the canvas, including two whole feet from the left,
to fit it inside Amsterdam’s Town Hall. They've been lost ever since. But a multi-year conservation project that began in 2019 
replaced the missing pieces. They managed this by training
an artificial intelligence to digitally paint in Rembrandt’s style. Then, using another artist’s rendering
of the original, the program recreated and printed
the painting’s lost sections. Finally, the team returned 
“The Night Watch” to its full size, with AI-generated best guesses
to fill in the blanks. All of these paintings had been altered,
but none of them were irrevocably ruined. With painstaking scientific analysis
and technical skill, art conservators immortalize
priceless artifacts. They counteract sudden damage
and creeping threats— and sometimes, they perform near miracles. This video was made possible with support

**Transcript**:
These paintings are in peril. All three have been defaced, some in ways that are almost impossible
to see with the naked eye. Can you guess how they've been altered? You might be surprised. When a museum curator 
inspected this portrait, attributed to the 16th century 
Italian painter Bronzino, they suspected it was a modern fake. However, closely examining the cracks
on its surface, an art conservator discovered
that it was from that era— It had just undergone drastic changes
in recent centuries. Using x-ray technology, they peered 
under the outer surface of paint and saw the countenance 
of a completely different woman. Essential parts of the painting
had been modified during a 19th century restoration. Prior to the mid-20th century, art restorers took a more
heavy-handed approach, often believing they were improving art. Nowadays, they focus on keeping
the original work intact with minimal intervention. When they need to fix something up, they usually make their markings visually
and chemically distinct from the original, so they can be harmlessly removed. But the work of past restorers is a threat
they regularly contend with— as was the case with this portrait. To recover the original, the conservator began removing
the outer varnish coat. Varnish is commonly used to protect
paintings from debris and make their colors pop. But the natural varnishes past restorers
applied eventually darkened, which is what gives older paintings 
that aged, yellowy look. Slowly dissolving the varnish, the conservator uncovered
crisp colors below. Taking small samples from the added
and original paint layers, they analyzed the compositions of each. Then, they decided which solvents
could dissolve the overpainting while minimally affecting the original. Carefully dabbing the canvas with them, they removed the overpainting’s 
dainty hands and idealized face. The true painting underneath revealed
Isabella of the Italian Medici dynasty. The portrait isn’t Bronzino’s, but it is from around 1570,
and may have been painted by one of his students. Its Victorian makeover was likely done
to boost sales because the original subject wasn’t
considered attractive. But now, Isabella is back, 
meeting her viewer’s gaze directly. This painting, 
“An Allegory with Venus and Cupid,” is actually Bronzino’s, 
and it was completed around 1545. It centers on a kiss between Venus
and her son Cupid– but it’s been subtly altered. When London’s National Gallery
acquired it in 1860, the Gallery’s director deemed it 
too risqué for Victorian England. So, he commissioned a restorer to obscure
Venus’s tongue and nipple. A century after this modification, art conservators analyzed and removed
the overpainting with select solvents. In the process, they also realized 
that the veil covering Venus’s crotch and the branch hiding Cupid’s posterior
were other add-ons. Removing two layers of censorship
from the painting, it was finally free to boast
its provocative original details. This massive painting called 
“The Night Watch” was completed by Rembrandt in 1642. Since then, it’s endured one
dramatic amputation, two stabbings, an acid attack, and centuries of grime. A museum guard immediately neutralized
the acid with water. Restorers lifted the grime, revealing that the painting was
not set at night, and healed the slashes using adhesive
and extra canvas backing. But they faced an even trickier problem. In 1715, strips were removed
from all sides of the canvas, including two whole feet from the left,
to fit it inside Amsterdam’s Town Hall. They've been lost ever since. But a multi-year conservation project that began in 2019 
replaced the missing pieces. They managed this by training
an artificial intelligence to digitally paint in Rembrandt’s style. Then, using another artist’s rendering
of the original, the program recreated and printed
the painting’s lost sections. Finally, the team returned 
“The Night Watch” to its full size, with AI-generated best guesses
to fill in the blanks. All of these paintings had been altered,
but none of them were irrevocably ruined. With painstaking scientific analysis
and technical skill, art conservators immortalize
priceless artifacts. They counteract sudden damage
and creeping threats— and sometimes, they perform near miracles. This video was made possible with support

**Transcript**:
Beginning in the 3rd century,
before the coming era, the Romans conquered
the Iberian Peninsula. This period gave rise to several regional
languages in the area that's now Spain, including Castilian, Catalan and Galician. One of these would become Spanish—
but not for another 1,500 years. Those years tell the origin story 
of what’s become a global modern language. During the Roman occupation, colloquial spoken Latin, 
often called “Vulgar Latin,” mixed with Indigenous languages. Approximately 75% of modern Spanish comes
from Latin, including syntactic rules. For instance, verbs are conjugated
in a similar way as in Latin. And like other Roman languages, 
nouns have gender: el sol, the sun, is masculine, 
whereas la luna, the moon, is feminine. After the Roman Empire collapsed, a series of other powers conquered 
the region. First came the Visigoths starting 
in the 5th century of the common era. They spoke an eastern Germanic language that would eventually become 
part of German and lent a few words to the language
that would become Spanish. Then the Umayyad Caliphate
ousted the Visigoths. They spoke Arabic, which left 
a strong mark on modern Spanish: over a thousand words come from Arabic. These often have a starting 
“a” or “z” sound, and sometimes include an “h.” In 1492, the Catholic Church consolidated
its power through two monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand, expelling Muslims and Jews, combining the distinct regional kingdoms
into one nation, and adopting one of the local languages 
as the official state language. That language was Castellano,
or Castilian, from the Kingdom of Castile, which was centrally located in Spain
and home to Madrid. Thereafter Castellano became Español,
or Spanish. But the Spanish of 1492 was Old Spanish,
very different from Spanish today. That same year, Christopher Columbus
sailed across the Atlantic Ocean, marking the start of the Spanish conquest
of the Americas. The Indigenous population of the Americas spoke an estimated 
2,000 different languages. Over the next few decades, most of them were forced to adopt Spanish
at the expense of their own languages. Still, words from Indigenous languages
became part of Spanish. From Nahuatl, 
the language of the Aztec Empire, came words with “ch” and “y”
like “chapulin” and “coyote.” From Quechua, 
a language spoken in the Peruvian Andes, came words with “ch”
like “cancha,” “chullo,” and “poncho.” Some of these words describe things that hadn’t existed in the Spanish lexicon
before, while others replaced existing
Spanish words even in Spain. By the time Miguel de Cervantes published
the first part of “Don Quixote” in 1605, the language was arguably more similar 
to modern Spanish than plays of one of his contemporaries, 
William Shakespeare, were to modern English. Starting in the 18th century, French language and culture were
extremely fashionable in Spain, and later Hispanic America. While the two languages already had
commonalities from their shared roots in Latin, Spanish gained new words from French
during this period. In the 19th century, 
all over Central and South America, people revolted to gain independence 
from Spain. In the newly sovereign nations, people continued to speak the language
of their former oppressors. Today, there are approximately 415 million
inhabitants of Hispanic America. Spanish is the official language 
of 21 countries and Puerto Rico. As of 2021, only English, Mandarin,
and Hindi have more speakers. How does a language with so many
speakers around the world not break apart into new languages
the way Vulgar Latin did? There's no easy answer to this question. Other languages that spread 
through colonialism, like French, have mixed with Indigenous languages 
to form entirely new ones. Some would argue that Spanglish,
a mixture of Spanish and English, is a distinct language 
or on its way to becoming one. But although a person in Buenos Aires
occasionally might use words that aren’t fully intelligible to someone
in Bogotá or Mexico City, Spanish retains enough unity 
of syntax, grammar, and vocabulary to remain one language.

**Transcript**:
Beginning in the 3rd century,
before the coming era, the Romans conquered
the Iberian Peninsula. This period gave rise to several regional
languages in the area that's now Spain, including Castilian, Catalan and Galician. One of these would become Spanish—
but not for another 1,500 years. Those years tell the origin story 
of what’s become a global modern language. During the Roman occupation, colloquial spoken Latin, 
often called “Vulgar Latin,” mixed with Indigenous languages. Approximately 75% of modern Spanish comes
from Latin, including syntactic rules. For instance, verbs are conjugated
in a similar way as in Latin. And like other Roman languages, 
nouns have gender: el sol, the sun, is masculine, 
whereas la luna, the moon, is feminine. After the Roman Empire collapsed, a series of other powers conquered 
the region. First came the Visigoths starting 
in the 5th century of the common era. They spoke an eastern Germanic language that would eventually become 
part of German and lent a few words to the language
that would become Spanish. Then the Umayyad Caliphate
ousted the Visigoths. They spoke Arabic, which left 
a strong mark on modern Spanish: over a thousand words come from Arabic. These often have a starting 
“a” or “z” sound, and sometimes include an “h.” In 1492, the Catholic Church consolidated
its power through two monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand, expelling Muslims and Jews, combining the distinct regional kingdoms
into one nation, and adopting one of the local languages 
as the official state language. That language was Castellano,
or Castilian, from the Kingdom of Castile, which was centrally located in Spain
and home to Madrid. Thereafter Castellano became Español,
or Spanish. But the Spanish of 1492 was Old Spanish,

**Transcript**:
In 2010, South Korea experienced
a particularly cold winter. People couldn't activate their smartphones
while wearing gloves, so they began wielding snack sausages— causing one company to see 
a 40% rise in sausage sales. So, what could sausages do
that gloves couldn’t? In other words, 
how do touchscreens actually work? In 1965, the first ever touchscreen 
was invented to help British air traffic controllers
efficiently update flight plans. However, the technology was too unwieldy
and expensive for widespread use. Over the following decades, engineers further developed
this technology and experimented with alternative
kinds of touchscreens. Soon, resistive touchscreens
dominated the market. But then, in 2007, Apple released
the first iPhone. It was a breakthrough, yet it functioned
using the same principle as the first touchscreen: capacitance. Nowadays, capacitive and resistive 
touchscreens are two of the most common types. Both use an external input 
to complete their electric circuits. In conductive materials, 
electrons flow around atoms, forming an electric current. In contrast to insulators, the electrons in conductors are
weakly bound and flow easily. A resistive touchscreen has two layers. The top is a clear, flexible material—
usually plastic— while the bottom is something rigid,
like glass. These layers are coated 
with a conductive substance and separated by a thin gap. When something pushes
hard enough, the layers connect, completing the electric circuit. This causes a change in voltage 
that the machine’s software reacts to. Resistive touchscreens can
be a little unresponsive, but they're generally cheap and durable, so they're favored for industrial
or mass use. A vast majority of the touchscreens
produced in 2007 were resistive. But in the years following 
the iPhone’s release, most became capacitive. Individual models vary, 
but smartphone touchscreens today typically consist of a protective, 
insulating glass exterior and an LCD screen at the bottom 
that produces the images you see. Between the glass exterior 
and the LCD screen are several sheets. One is lined with rows of a transparent,
conductive material that carry an alternating 
electric current. A thin insulating layer separates these
conductive lines from others that are arranged as columns. One on top of the other, 
the lines form a grid. The points where they intersect
are called nodes. The phone's battery draws electrons
along the first layer of lines, and some electrons accumulate 
at every node, creating a small electric field. These screens are called 
capacitive touchscreens because the nodes act like capacitors
by storing charge. They’re generally easier to use
than resistive touchscreens because they interact directly with your
finger without the application of force. Your body is a great conductor and is
constantly transmitting electric currents. Why? Because about 60% of you is water. Now, while chemically pure water 
is an insulator, most water is impure. The water inside you is loaded with ions— atoms or molecules that have
a net electrical charge. So when you click on an app, your finger
functions like a third electrical line. It interacts with the existing
electric field, which induces a weak electric current
that travels through your finger and eventually back into the phone. This changes the amount of charge
at the affected nodes. And voltage measurements along
the second layer of lines tell the phone’s microprocessor which
part of the screen is being touched. However, if you try using a smartphone
while your hands are wet or gloved, you'll probably have some trouble. Both interrupt the electrical connection
between your finger and phone. If water is splashed across the screen,
it might trigger many underlying nodes, and the phone could act like you’ve 
touched it in multiple places at once. On the other hand, gloves are insulators,
so the charge has nowhere to go. Meanwhile, objects that conduct
electricity about as well as your finger— like banana peels 
and certain processed meats— can all activate the screen— knowledge that can come in clutch,
when you’re in a pickle.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: What happens when you try to use a smartphone while your hands are wet or gloved?

This question is similar in intent and content to the ground truth MCQ, which asks which of the following couldn’t be used to operate an iPhone screen. Both questions are related to the functionality of touchscreens and the factors that affect their performance.

However, it's worth noting that Question 7 is not an exact match, as it asks about the effect of using a smartphone with wet or gloved hands, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about which option couldn't be used to operate the screen.

A more similar question would be one that asks about which material or object cannot be used to activate a touchscreen. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match this intent.

But if I had to choose, I would say that Question 7 is the closest match, with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
In 2010, South Korea experienced
a particularly cold winter. People couldn't activate their smartphones
while wearing gloves, so they began wielding snack sausages— causing one company to see 
a 40% rise in sausage sales. So, what could sausages do
that gloves couldn’t? In other words, 
how do touchscreens actually work? In 1965, the first ever touchscreen 
was invented to help British air traffic controllers
efficiently update flight plans. However, the technology was too unwieldy
and expensive for widespread use. Over the following decades, engineers further developed
this technology and experimented with alternative
kinds of touchscreens. Soon, resistive touchscreens
dominated the market. But then, in 2007, Apple released
the first iPhone. It was a breakthrough, yet it functioned
using the same principle as the first touchscreen: capacitance. Nowadays, capacitive and resistive 
touchscreens are two of the most common types. Both use an external input 
to complete their electric circuits. In conductive materials, 
electrons flow around atoms, forming an electric current. In contrast to insulators, the electrons in conductors are
weakly bound and flow easily. A resistive touchscreen has two layers. The top is a clear, flexible material—
usually plastic— while the bottom is something rigid,
like glass. These layers are coated 
with a conductive substance and separated by a thin gap. When something pushes
hard enough, the layers connect, completing the electric circuit. This causes a change in voltage 
that the machine’s software reacts to. Resistive touchscreens can
be a little unresponsive, but they're generally cheap and durable, so they're favored for industrial
or mass use. A vast majority of the touchscreens
produced in 2007 were resistive. But in the years following 
the iPhone’s release, most became capacitive. Individual models vary, 
but smartphone touchscreens today typically consist of a protective, 
insulating glass exterior and an LCD screen at the bottom 
that produces the images you see. Between the glass exterior 
and the LCD screen are several sheets. One is lined with rows of a transparent,
conductive material that carry an alternating 
electric current. A thin insulating layer separates these
conductive lines from others that are arranged as columns. One on top of the other, 
the lines form a grid. The points where they intersect
are called nodes. The phone's battery draws electrons
along the first layer of lines, and some electrons accumulate 
at every node, creating a small electric field. These screens are called 
capacitive touchscreens because the nodes act like capacitors
by storing charge. They’re generally easier to use
than resistive touchscreens because they interact directly with your
finger without the application of force. Your body is a great conductor and is
constantly transmitting electric currents. Why? Because about 60% of you is water. Now, while chemically pure water 
is an insulator, most water is impure. The water inside you is loaded with ions— atoms or molecules that have

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly asking about the type of touchscreen used in the iPhone. However, Question 1 is asking about the type of touchscreen technology that was first invented in 1965, and it mentions that the iPhone uses the same principle as the first touchscreen, which is capacitance.

Although Question 1 is not a direct match, it is the closest one in terms of question intent and content. However, since none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the type of touchscreen used in the iPhone, I will choose the one that is most closely related to the topic.

But a closer look at the options of the generated MCQs shows that Question 9 has an option that mentions the advantage of capacitive touchscreens, which is the type of touchscreen used in the iPhone.

However, the most similar generated MCQ is actually not present, but if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the closest.

So the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 1

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

Although the options and wording are not identical, the intent and content of Question 6 are similar to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions ask why the human body (or finger) is a good conductor, and both correct answers relate to the presence of water in the body. 

However, it's worth noting that the correct option in Question 6 is not as detailed as the correct option in the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ specifies that the water in the body is "impure" and "loaded with ions," which is an important detail that explains why the body is a good conductor. In contrast, Question 6 simply states that the body is a good conductor because it is made up of 60% water, without mentioning the role of ions. 

Despite this difference, Question 6 is still the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the middle of Florida’s 
Apalachicola National Forest, a bizarre, almost magical scene 
is unraveling. Sliding a metal strip over a wooden stake, a master summoner is sending deep croaking
noises reverberating through the area. And, as if in a trance, hundreds of earthworms 
begin emerging from the soil. This is worm grunting, also called
worm charming or fiddling. It’s a tradition that’s been practiced
for more than a century, but its inner workings were 
a mystery until only recently. Worms collectively undertaking
an underground exodus seems especially unbelievable when you
consider how vulnerable this makes them. So why is surfacing worth the risk? Over the years, people have proposed
a number of imaginative hypotheses. One was that worms were somehow
charmed by the noise, like the rats from the medieval
Pied Piper legend. Okay, sounds fun, but how would 
the worms actually become bewitched? Another hypothesis was that worm grunting
tickled their bodies, so they emerged to end the aggravation. Whimsical! But worm grunting vibrates
the ground’s surface. If worms were evading the vibrations,
wouldn't they burrow deeper instead? Perhaps the most popular hypothesis was
that worm grunting mimicked falling rain and the worms fled to avoid drowning. In 2008, biologist Kenneth Catania
tested this hypothesis, setting up three arenas filled with soil and 300 individuals of the large species 
of earthworm found in the Florida Panhandle. After an hour of rain, 
water had pooled at the surface, but only two earthworms emerged. The rest remained buried and healthy. So, unlike those containers, 
this hypothesis just didn’t hold water. Catania decided to explore
another route of inquiry. In 1881, Charles Darwin published
his final work, a bestseller that rivaled his
most well-known books at the time: “The Formation of Vegetable Mould,
Through the Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits.” Yes, it was literally called that— and it was the culmination of 40 years
of earthworm investigations. Within it, Darwin noted that worms
sometimes left their burrows when the ground trembled 
and mentioned an interesting hypothesis: maybe they flee because they believe
they’re being pursued by moles. Catania got to work testing
this hypothesis himself. He found that Eastern moles had
astounding tracking abilities, could eat their weight in worms every day, and were abundant 
in the Florida Panhandle. When Catania released a single mole 
into worm- and soil-filled arenas, about 30% of the worms crawled 
to the surface in the first hour— a markedly different result 
from the control and rain trials. And when he recorded 
the vibrations produced by worm grunters and moles digging, their frequencies 
overlapped substantially. This was it. Over hundreds of thousands of years, these earthworms evolved a behavior
that helped them escape a top predator. Aboveground, they were immune
to the moles, which usually stayed subterranean. But then humans came along. And, funnily enough, we aren’t even
the only ones that take advantage of this behavior. Herring gulls and wood turtles also 
sometimes drum their feet on the earth to summon worms. So then why does this behavior persist? Scientists think it’s beneficial 
for a prey species to maintain its adaptations 
against a more frequent predator, even if it makes it more vulnerable 
to a rarer one. Many insects, for example, 
use flight to avoid predation. But painted redstarts take
advantage of this: they boldly flash their colorful tail 
and wing feathers to elicit this response, then catch the insects 
as they try to fly away. It seems the prey species’ response 
remains simply because it’s beneficial 
most of the time. For over a century, humans
in the southern US, the UK, and elsewhere have been unknowingly exploiting 
the worm’s escape response. The current world record 
for “most worms charmed” was set by a 10-year-old 
British girl in 2009. Wiggling a fork in the ground 
and hitting it with a stick, she made 567 worms surface 
in just 30 minutes. Charming, really.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 1: What is the name of the tradition where people use a metal strip or a fork to summon earthworms? Options: A. Worm grunting, B. Worm charming, C. Worm fiddling, D. Earthworm calling**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the names of the tradition, and Question 1 also asks about the name of the tradition. However, the options in Question 1 do not include "Worm whistling", which is the incorrect option in the ground truth MCQ.

To make Question 1 more similar to the ground truth MCQ, the options could be modified to include "Worm whistling" and the question could be rephrased to ask which of the options is NOT a correct name for the tradition.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Transcript**:
In the middle of Florida’s 
Apalachicola National Forest, a bizarre, almost magical scene 
is unraveling. Sliding a metal strip over a wooden stake, a master summoner is sending deep croaking
noises reverberating through the area. And, as if in a trance, hundreds of earthworms 
begin emerging from the soil. This is worm grunting, also called
worm charming or fiddling. It’s a tradition that’s been practiced
for more than a century, but its inner workings were 
a mystery until only recently. Worms collectively undertaking
an underground exodus seems especially unbelievable when you
consider how vulnerable this makes them. So why is surfacing worth the risk? Over the years, people have proposed
a number of imaginative hypotheses. One was that worms were somehow
charmed by the noise, like the rats from the medieval
Pied Piper legend. Okay, sounds fun, but how would 
the worms actually become bewitched? Another hypothesis was that worm grunting
tickled their bodies, so they emerged to end the aggravation. Whimsical! But worm grunting vibrates
the ground’s surface. If worms were evading the vibrations,
wouldn't they burrow deeper instead? Perhaps the most popular hypothesis was
that worm grunting mimicked falling rain and the worms fled to avoid drowning. In 2008, biologist Kenneth Catania
tested this hypothesis, setting up three arenas filled with soil and 300 individuals of the large species 
of earthworm found in the Florida Panhandle. After an hour of rain, 
water had pooled at the surface, but only two earthworms emerged. The rest remained buried and healthy. So, unlike those containers, 
this hypothesis just didn’t hold water. Catania decided to explore
another route of inquiry. In 1881, Charles Darwin published
his final work, a bestseller that rivaled his
most well-known books at the time: “The Formation of Vegetable Mould,
Through the Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits.” Yes, it was literally called that— and it was the culmination of 40 years
of earthworm investigations. Within it, Darwin noted that worms
sometimes left their burrows when the ground trembled 
and mentioned an interesting hypothesis: maybe they flee because they believe
they’re being pursued by moles. Catania got to work testing
this hypothesis himself. He found that Eastern moles had
astounding tracking abilities, could eat their weight in worms every day, and were abundant 
in the Florida Panhandle. When Catania released a single mole 
into worm- and soil-filled arenas, about 30% of the worms crawled 
to the surface in the first hour— a markedly different result 
from the control and rain trials. And when he recorded 
the vibrations produced by worm grunters and moles digging, their frequencies 
overlapped substantially. This was it. Over hundreds of thousands of years, these earthworms evolved a behavior
that helped them escape a top predator. Aboveground, they were immune
to the moles, which usually stayed subterranean. But then humans came along. And, funnily enough, we aren’t even
the only ones that take advantage of this behavior. Herring gulls and wood turtles also 
sometimes drum their feet on the earth to summon worms. So then why does this behavior persist? Scientists think it’s beneficial 
for a prey species to maintain its adaptations 
against a more frequent predator, even if it makes it more vulnerable 
to a rarer one. Many insects, for example, 
use flight to avoid predation. But painted redstarts take
advantage of this: they boldly flash their colorful tail 
and wing feathers to elicit this response, then catch the insects 
as they try to fly away. It seems the prey species’ response 
remains simply because it’s beneficial 
most of the time. For over a century, humans
in the southern US, the UK, and elsewhere have been unknowingly exploiting 
the worm’s escape response. The current world record 
for “most worms charmed” was set by a 10-year-old 
British girl in 2009. Wiggling a fork in the ground 
and hitting it with a stick, she made 567 worms surface 
in just 30 minutes. Charming, really.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why do the worms still come to the surface when they sense the vibrations, even though they could be created by humans, wood turtles or herring gulls?
Options: A. The escape behavior works most of the time., B. Worms are incapable of learning., C. The charming of the vibrations is irresistible., D. Worms love a good challenge.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

This question has a similar intent to the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the reason why the worm's escape response persists. The correct option for Question 5, "It is beneficial for the prey species to maintain its adaptations against a more frequent predator," is similar to the correct option for the ground truth MCQ, "The escape behavior works most of the time." Both options suggest that the worm's escape response is maintained because it is beneficial for the prey species, even if it makes them vulnerable to other predators.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 5.

**Transcript**:
Gold is one of Earth’s most
valuable resources, with one kilogram regularly valued
at over 55,000 US dollars. In 2020, Mali produced an estimated
71.2 tons of gold. But Mali only saw $850 million 
from gold in 2020, when that amount is worth billions, not to mention that the country likely 
produced much more than the reported 71.2 tons. The situation isn’t unique: a number of other gold-rich countries
in Africa, including Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, 
Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Niger also aren’t seeing the income they should,
given the price of gold. The force behind this is greed on an individual, corporate, 
and national scale, and a corrupt system 
that perpetuates itself. Although Mali has abundant gold, the country lacks the infrastructure
to mine and export it. So the government allows multinational
corporations to apply for licenses to mine gold in exchange
for taxes paid to Mali’s government. These taxes should, theoretically,
finance development, like building the infrastructure 
to mine gold, improve the economy, and provide citizens with public goods
like healthcare and education. Tax money alone isn’t enough
to do these things, of course: a government also has to be invested 
in its people’s well-being, and government corruption
can prevent progress. But without adequate funds, even the best intentioned government 
doesn’t stand a chance of improving circumstances 
for its citizens. Foreign corporations exploit 
Mali’s need for tax revenue to get the government to sign on to very
unfavorable yet perfectly legal contracts. For example, one such contract stated 
that no corporate taxes would be owed for the first five years, 
costing Mali millions in tax revenue. Meanwhile, mining licenses sometimes allow
these corporations to take samples of gold out of the country 
without registering them or paying taxes on them. These should be small amounts of gold 
used to test for quality, but the license doesn’t limit
the size of samples, so this creates a loophole where corporations export large
amounts of gold without paying any tax. The multinational corporations are 
also evading taxes they are legally required to pay. They filter profits through a labyrinth 
of tax havens that’s difficult to trace. Or they exaggerate their expenses 
so they end up owing very little in taxes. For instance, a corporation in Mali uses
a subsidiary in Ireland to manage its operations
and another subsidiary in the Netherlands to license its brand name. The corporation in Mali pays 
management fees to the Irish subsidiary and pays intellectual property license
fees to the Dutch company, all for enormous sums. These costs are deducted 
from overall profits, leaving the amount subject 
to taxes at a bare minimum. These companies also buy gold
on the black market. Local, small-scale miners often operate
without a license, so the government is unaware
of how much gold they mine. Corporations buy gold from these miners, avoiding the cost of mining 
the gold themselves, and pay the miners far below market value. Then they turn around and tell
the government they incurred huge expenses 
mining gold they didn’t mine at all. There’s no way for Mali’s revenue 
authority to verify this information, causing the country to lose
even more tax money. Similarly, corporations pay corrupt
government officials to help them smuggle gold across borders,
primarily to the United Arab Emirates, rather than operating 
through legal channels. In 2016, Mali reported around $200 million
of exported gold, but the UAE reported receiving slightly
over $1.5 billion of imported gold from Mali that same year. The gold is then sold to European, 
American, and Asian markets from the UAE, with no questions asked about its origins. Similar patterns can be seen 
with gold-rich countries across Africa, indicating that gold smuggling 
is happening on a massive scale, without ever being subject to taxes. All of this creates a vicious cycle, forcing a continued reliance on the corporations that helped create
the situation in the first place. More than half of Mali’s citizens live 
below the international poverty line, while their nation’s wealth lines
the pockets of foreign corporations and corrupt officials.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although the wording is not identical, the intent and content of Question 4 align with the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the exchange for which the government of Mali permits foreign companies to apply for gold mining licenses, and the correct answer is "Taxes." Question 4 asks about the purpose of the taxes paid by multinational corporations to Mali's government, and while it does not directly mention licenses, it implies a similar relationship between the government and corporations.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable generated MCQ would have options that directly match the ground truth MCQ, such as "Machinery," "Taxes," "Technology," or a combination of these.

**Transcript**:
Gold is one of Earth’s most
valuable resources, with one kilogram regularly valued
at over 55,000 US dollars. In 2020, Mali produced an estimated
71.2 tons of gold. But Mali only saw $850 million 
from gold in 2020, when that amount is worth billions, not to mention that the country likely 
produced much more than the reported 71.2 tons. The situation isn’t unique: a number of other gold-rich countries
in Africa, including Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, 
Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Niger also aren’t seeing the income they should,
given the price of gold. The force behind this is greed on an individual, corporate, 
and national scale, and a corrupt system 
that perpetuates itself. Although Mali has abundant gold, the country lacks the infrastructure
to mine and export it. So the government allows multinational
corporations to apply for licenses to mine gold in exchange
for taxes paid to Mali’s government. These taxes should, theoretically,
finance development, like building the infrastructure 
to mine gold, improve the economy, and provide citizens with public goods
like healthcare and education. Tax money alone isn’t enough
to do these things, of course: a government also has to be invested 
in its people’s well-being, and government corruption
can prevent progress. But without adequate funds, even the best intentioned government 
doesn’t stand a chance of improving circumstances 
for its citizens. Foreign corporations exploit 
Mali’s need for tax revenue to get the government to sign on to very
unfavorable yet perfectly legal contracts. For example, one such contract stated 
that no corporate taxes would be owed for the first five years, 
costing Mali millions in tax revenue. Meanwhile, mining licenses sometimes allow
these corporations to take samples of gold out of the country 
without registering them or paying taxes on them. These should be small amounts of gold 
used to test for quality, but the license doesn’t limit
the size of samples, so this creates a loophole where corporations export large
amounts of gold without paying any tax. The multinational corporations are 
also evading taxes they are legally required to pay. They filter profits through a labyrinth 
of tax havens that’s difficult to trace. Or they exaggerate their expenses 
so they end up owing very little in taxes. For instance, a corporation in Mali uses
a subsidiary in Ireland to manage its operations
and another subsidiary in the Netherlands to license its brand name. The corporation in Mali pays 
management fees to the Irish subsidiary and pays intellectual property license
fees to the Dutch company, all for enormous sums. These costs are deducted 
from overall profits, leaving the amount subject 
to taxes at a bare minimum. These companies also buy gold
on the black market. Local, small-scale miners often operate
without a license, so the government is unaware
of how much gold they mine. Corporations buy gold from these miners, avoiding the cost of mining 
the gold themselves, and pay the miners far below market value. Then they turn around and tell
the government they incurred huge expenses 
mining gold they didn’t mine at all. There’s no way for Mali’s revenue 
authority to verify this information, causing the country to lose
even more tax money. Similarly, corporations pay corrupt
government officials to help them smuggle gold across borders,
primarily to the United Arab Emirates, rather than operating 
through legal channels. In 2016, Mali reported around $200 million
of exported gold, but the UAE reported receiving slightly
over $1.5 billion of imported gold from Mali that same year. The gold is then sold to European, 
American, and Asian markets from the UAE, with no questions asked about its origins. Similar patterns can be seen 
with gold-rich countries across Africa, indicating that gold smuggling 
is happening on a massive scale, without ever being subject to taxes. All of this creates a vicious cycle, forcing a continued reliance on the corporations that helped create
the situation in the first place. More than half of Mali’s citizens live 
below the international poverty line, while their nation’s wealth lines
the pockets of foreign corporations and corrupt officials.

**Transcript**:
In January of 1995, Russia detected
a nuclear missile headed its way. The alert went all the way
to the president, who was deciding whether to strike back when another system contradicted
the initial warning. What they thought was the first missile
in a massive attack was actually a research rocket
studying the Northern Lights. This incident happened 
after the end of the Cold War, but was nevertheless one of the closest
calls we’ve had to igniting a global nuclear war. With the invention of the atomic bomb, humanity gained the power to destroy
itself for the first time in our history. Since then, our existential risk— risk of either extinction or the unrecoverable collapse 
of human civilization— has steadily increased. It’s well within our power
to reduce this risk, but in order to do so, we have to understand which 
of our activities pose existential threats now, 
and which might in the future. So far, our species has survived
2,000 centuries, each with some extinction risk
from natural causes— asteroid impacts, supervolcanoes,
and the like. Assessing existential risk is 
an inherently uncertain business because usually when we try to figure out
how likely something is, we check how often it's happened before. But the complete destruction of humanity
has never happened before. While there’s no perfect method to
determine our risk from natural threats, experts estimate it’s about 
1 in 10,000 per century. Nuclear weapons were our first
addition to that baseline. While there are many risks associated
with nuclear weapons, the existential risk comes
from the possibility of a global nuclear war that leads
to a nuclear winter, where soot from burning cities
blocks out the sun for years, causing the crops that humanity
depends on to fail. We haven't had a nuclear war yet, but our track record is too short to tell
if they’re inherently unlikely or we’ve simply been lucky. We also can’t say for sure whether a global nuclear war
would cause a nuclear winter so severe it would pose an existential threat
to humanity. The next major addition to our existential
risk was climate change. Like nuclear war, 
climate change could result in a lot of terrible scenarios 
that we should be working hard to avoid, but that would stop short of causing
extinction or unrecoverable collapse. We expect a few degrees
Celsius of warming, but can’t yet completely 
rule out 6 or even 10 degrees, which would cause a calamity of possibly
unprecedented proportions. Even in this worst-case scenario, it’s not clear whether warming would pose
a direct existential risk, but the disruption it would cause
would likely make us more vulnerable to other existential risks. The greatest risks may come 
from technologies that are still emerging. Take engineered pandemics. The biggest catastrophes in human history
have been from pandemics. And biotechnology is enabling
us to modify and create germs that could be much more deadly
than naturally occurring ones. Such germs could cause pandemics 
through biowarfare and research accidents. Decreased costs of genome sequencing
and modification, along with increased availability
of potentially dangerous information like the published genomes 
of deadly viruses, also increase the number of people
and groups who could potentially create
such pathogens. Another concern is unaligned AI. Most AI researchers think this will be
the century where we develop artificial intelligence
that surpasses human abilities across the board. If we cede this advantage, we place
our future in the hands of the systems we create. Even if created solely with humanity’s 
best interests in mind, superintelligent AI could pose 
an existential risk if it isn’t perfectly aligned 
with human values— a task scientists are finding
extremely difficult. Based on what we know at this point, some experts estimate the anthropogenic
existential risk is more than 100 times higher 
than the background rate of natural risk. But these odds depend heavily
on human choices. Because most of the risk is from human
action, and it’s within human control. If we treat safeguarding humanity's future
as the defining issue of our time, we can reduce this risk. Whether humanity fulfils its potential— or not— is in our hands.

**Transcript**:
In January of 1995, Russia detected
a nuclear missile headed its way. The alert went all the way
to the president, who was deciding whether to strike back when another system contradicted
the initial warning. What they thought was the first missile
in a massive attack was actually a research rocket
studying the Northern Lights. This incident happened 
after the end of the Cold War, but was nevertheless one of the closest
calls we’ve had to igniting a global nuclear war. With the invention of the atomic bomb, humanity gained the power to destroy
itself for the first time in our history. Since then, our existential risk— risk of either extinction or the unrecoverable collapse 
of human civilization— has steadily increased. It’s well within our power
to reduce this risk, but in order to do so, we have to understand which 
of our activities pose existential threats now, 
and which might in the future. So far, our species has survived
2,000 centuries, each with some extinction risk
from natural causes— asteroid impacts, supervolcanoes,
and the like. Assessing existential risk is 
an inherently uncertain business because usually when we try to figure out
how likely something is, we check how often it's happened before. But the complete destruction of humanity
has never happened before. While there’s no perfect method to
determine our risk from natural threats, experts estimate it’s about 
1 in 10,000 per century. Nuclear weapons were our first
addition to that baseline. While there are many risks associated
with nuclear weapons, the existential risk comes
from the possibility of a global nuclear war that leads
to a nuclear winter, where soot from burning cities
blocks out the sun for years, causing the crops that humanity
depends on to fail. We haven't had a nuclear war yet, but our track record is too short to tell
if they’re inherently unlikely or we’ve simply been lucky. We also can’t say for sure whether a global nuclear war
would cause a nuclear winter so severe it would pose an existential threat
to humanity. The next major addition to our existential
risk was climate change. Like nuclear war, 
climate change could result in a lot of terrible scenarios 
that we should be working hard to avoid, but that would stop short of causing
extinction or unrecoverable collapse. We expect a few degrees
Celsius of warming, but can’t yet completely 
rule out 6 or even 10 degrees, which would cause a calamity of possibly
unprecedented proportions. Even in this worst-case scenario, it’s not clear whether warming would pose
a direct existential risk, but the disruption it would cause
would likely make us more vulnerable to other existential risks. The greatest risks may come 
from technologies that are still emerging. Take engineered pandemics. The biggest catastrophes in human history
have been from pandemics. And biotechnology is enabling
us to modify and create germs that could be much more deadly
than naturally occurring ones. Such germs could cause pandemics 
through biowarfare and research accidents. Decreased costs of genome sequencing
and modification, along with increased availability
of potentially dangerous information like the published genomes 
of deadly viruses, also increase the number of people
and groups who could potentially create
such pathogens. Another concern is unaligned AI. Most AI researchers think this will be
the century where we develop artificial intelligence
that surpasses human abilities across the board. If we cede this advantage, we place
our future in the hands of the systems we create. Even if created solely with humanity’s 
best interests in mind, superintelligent AI could pose 
an existential risk if it isn’t perfectly aligned 
with human values— a task scientists are finding
extremely difficult. Based on what we know at this point, some experts estimate the anthropogenic
existential risk is more than 100 times higher 
than the background rate of natural risk. But these odds depend heavily
on human choices. Because most of the risk is from human
action, and it’s within human control. If we treat safeguarding humanity's future
as the defining issue of our time, we can reduce this risk. Whether humanity fulfils its potential— or not— is in our hands.

**Transcript**:
The vagina harbors hundreds of different
kinds of microorganisms. Some tend to be especially prevalent,
like Lactobacilli. These bacteria produce an acid 
that lowers the vagina’s pH, limiting what can survive there and
preventing against certain infections. Candida yeasts are also usually present
in small quantities. Most of the time, 
these fungi are harmless. The body’s immune system keeps them 
in check while other microorganisms, like Lactobacilli, combat and outcompete
them for nutrients and territory. But under certain conditions, 
Candida yeasts can cause infections. One species in particular,
called Candida albicans, is the usual culprit of vaginal thrush
or yeast infections, which affect 3 out of every 4 people 
with a vagina. So, how exactly does a yeast
infection happen? Candida albicans yeasts are shapeshifters. And when the balance within the vagina
is disrupted— like the pH increases or there are 
fewer microbes to compete with— Candida albicans may assume 
their disease-causing forms. They multiply and metamorphose— substituting their rounded structures for elongated thread-like forms 
called hyphae. Then, they secrete enzymes that degrade
the epithelial cells lining the vagina and permeate the tissue. Immune cells rush to the site, generating some of the most recognizable
symptoms of yeast infections: itching, burning, swelling, and redness. These may also be accompanied
by a change in vaginal discharge, the fluid that’s frequently flushed from
the vagina to keep it healthy and clean. During a yeast infection,
discharge may become thicker and whiter because the vagina is shedding 
more epithelial and Candida cells. A few major factors, like 
antibiotic treatments and lower immunity, can make people more susceptible 
to vaginal yeast infections. When someone’s immune system is
compromised, from illness or otherwise, their body may be unable to control
Candida effectively. And in treating bacterial infections,
antibiotics kill harmful bacteria, but they can also wipe out beneficial 
ones, like Lactobacilli, allowing Candida to multiply more easily. Many other factors also help set
the stage for yeast infections. Hormonal changes and diet alter
the vaginal microbiome. Semen is relatively basic, 
so it can disrupt the vagina’s pH. Tight, non-breathable, and wet garments
incubate moisture and are thought to facilitate
a more Candida-friendly environment. Soaps can damage the protective
mucus that coats the vagina, making it easier for Candida to permeate. That’s why many doctors recommend
just gently washing the vulva with water. And it’s important to wipe 
from front to back to avoid introducing more Candida as well 
as other potentially harmful microbes to the vagina. Most yeast infections are mild 
and clear up within two weeks. Antifungal medications usually offer
dependable treatments by reducing the number of Candida cells, allowing the immune system and 
other microorganisms to regain control. And interestingly, the solution 
to treating some yeast infections could be more yeasts. Preliminary studies with probiotics 
containing the harmless yeasts we use in brewing and baking have shown 
promise in keeping Candida in check while reducing inflammation. But some yeast infections
require more extensive therapies. About 5 to 10% of people with vaginas experience at least 4 yeast infections 
a year. For some of those, 
the cause seems to be genetic. Some people have gene variants that make
it harder for their immune systems to recognize and regulate Candida cells. But why many others have recurrent
infections is currently unclear— and requires a lot more research. In fact, so does basically everything
we've just talked about. We don’t know nearly enough 
about the vaginal microbiome. This is probably because of stigma
and underfunding when it comes to topics that traditionally
fall under the umbrella of “women’s health.” For instance, while erectile dysfunction
affects a much smaller percentage of people than vaginal yeast infections, there’s about 6 times more
research on the subject. Hopefully, we’ll soon have
a better understanding of the many microorganismal multitudes 
we contain— and how best to keep them in balance.

**Transcript**:
The vagina harbors hundreds of different
kinds of microorganisms. Some tend to be especially prevalent,
like Lactobacilli. These bacteria produce an acid 
that lowers the vagina’s pH, limiting what can survive there and
preventing against certain infections. Candida yeasts are also usually present
in small quantities. Most of the time, 
these fungi are harmless. The body’s immune system keeps them 
in check while other microorganisms, like Lactobacilli, combat and outcompete
them for nutrients and territory. But under certain conditions, 
Candida yeasts can cause infections. One species in particular,
called Candida albicans, is the usual culprit of vaginal thrush
or yeast infections, which affect 3 out of every 4 people 
with a vagina. So, how exactly does a yeast
infection happen? Candida albicans yeasts are shapeshifters. And when the balance within the vagina
is disrupted— like the pH increases or there are 
fewer microbes to compete with— Candida albicans may assume 
their disease-causing forms. They multiply and metamorphose— substituting their rounded structures for elongated thread-like forms 
called hyphae. Then, they secrete enzymes that degrade
the epithelial cells lining the vagina and permeate the tissue. Immune cells rush to the site, generating some of the most recognizable
symptoms of yeast infections: itching, burning, swelling, and redness. These may also be accompanied
by a change in vaginal discharge, the fluid that’s frequently flushed from
the vagina to keep it healthy and clean. During a yeast infection,
discharge may become thicker and whiter because the vagina is shedding 
more epithelial and Candida cells. A few major factors, like 
antibiotic treatments and lower immunity, can make people more susceptible 
to vaginal yeast infections. When someone’s immune system is
compromised, from illness or otherwise, their body may be unable to control
Candida effectively. And in treating bacterial infections,
antibiotics kill harmful bacteria, but they can also wipe out beneficial 
ones, like Lactobacilli, allowing Candida to multiply more easily. Many other factors also help set
the stage for yeast infections. Hormonal changes and diet alter
the vaginal microbiome. Semen is relatively basic, 
so it can disrupt the vagina’s pH. Tight, non-breathable, and wet garments
incubate moisture and are thought to facilitate
a more Candida-friendly environment. Soaps can damage the protective
mucus that coats the vagina, making it easier for Candida to permeate. That’s why many doctors recommend
just gently washing the vulva with water. And it’s important to wipe 
from front to back to avoid introducing more Candida as well 
as other potentially harmful microbes to the vagina. Most yeast infections are mild 
and clear up within two weeks. Antifungal medications usually offer
dependable treatments by reducing the number of Candida cells, allowing the immune system and 
other microorganisms to regain control. And interestingly, the solution 
to treating some yeast infections could be more yeasts. Preliminary studies with probiotics 
containing the harmless yeasts we use in brewing and baking have shown 
promise in keeping Candida in check while reducing inflammation. But some yeast infections
require more extensive therapies. About 5 to 10% of people with vaginas experience at least 4 yeast infections 
a year. For some of those, 
the cause seems to be genetic. Some people have gene variants that make
it harder for their immune systems to recognize and regulate Candida cells. But why many others have recurrent
infections is currently unclear— and requires a lot more research. In fact, so does basically everything
we've just talked about. We don’t know nearly enough 
about the vaginal microbiome. This is probably because of stigma
and underfunding when it comes to topics that traditionally
fall under the umbrella of “women’s health.” For instance, while erectile dysfunction
affects a much smaller percentage of people than vaginal yeast infections, there’s about 6 times more
research on the subject. Hopefully, we’ll soon have
a better understanding of the many microorganismal multitudes 
we contain— and how best to keep them in balance.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the thread-like form Candida albicans adopts to penetrate epithelial cells. Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the closest in terms of content, as it mentions Candida yeasts assuming disease-causing forms when the balance within the vagina is disrupted. However, it does not specifically ask about the thread-like form.

A more relevant question would be one that asks about the specific form Candida albicans takes to penetrate epithelial cells. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this description.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say Question 2 is the closest, but it's still not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
As the truck screeched to a halt,
one of its containers slid off, hit an approaching Prius 
and spilled its contents. Those contents happened to be thousands
of kilograms of live hagfish, also known as slime eels. The result of this 2017 car accident 
was an absolute mess: the highway was littered 
with wriggling fish and coated in a thick slime that took 
the fire department 7 hours to clear. Astonishingly good looks aside, the standout strength of all hagfishes
is their slime. In fact, they’re probably 
Earth’s slimiest animals. But why be so slimy? Watch and learn. This hagfish has detected a dead fish
using its keen sense of smell and the tastebud-like organs 
dotting its skin. Revealing imposing rows of toothlike
structures, it takes the first bite. A shark glides on to the scene
and suddenly lunges. Being caught in the shark’s powerful jaws
may seem like a guaranteed death sentence, but the hagfish has some tricks 
up its sleeve. The shark’s teeth clench down
but there are no bones to crush— only flexible cartilage. And because the hagfish’s skin is so 
loosely attached to the rest of its body, the pressure from the bite causes the hagfish’s essential organs
to slip out of the way, avoiding damage. This is where being a noodle 
in a baggy wetsuit really pays off. Meanwhile, the hagfish also actively
repels the shark by spewing a stupendous supply of slime. Around a hundred slime glands
line each side of the hagfish’s body. Within them are mucus and thread cells. The mucus cells are packed with hundreds
of vesicles of condensed mucus while each thread cell contains 
an intricately coiled protein fiber. The hagfish contracts the muscles
surrounding some of its slime glands, causing the cells to eject their contents
into the seawater. In a fraction of a second, 
the mucus vesicles swell and burst, and the protein fibers unravel. Together, they expand to 10,000 times
their original volume, instantly creating liters of slime. Because the substance is composed of mucus and reinforced with numerous superfine 
and strong silk-like fibers, the slime is incredibly soft yet tough. It lodges in the shark’s delicate gills, and as the shark chokes 
and tries to clear the slime, it releases the hagfish. Now, the hagfish is free 
from the jaws of death. But it’s in a dilemma of its own doing, trapped in a cloud of its own
suffocating slime. So what does it do? Well, it ties itself in a knot, of course. Starting at its tail 
and passing its body through, the hagfish effectively wipes away
its own slime. Apparently unfazed by the whole encounter, it returns to its meal. When it gets to a tougher part 
of the carcass... Voila! The hagfish ties itself 
in yet another knot to gain leverage and yank off the meat. The hagfish’s slime is so remarkable
that people are trying to emulate it. Currently, a lot of athletic 
and safety gear is made from non-renewable
petroleum-based fibers. But hagfish slime threads rival 
the properties of materials like nylon. And fibers modeled after those 
in hagfish slime may present a much more sustainable alternative. Meanwhile, hagfish slime is also being 
explored in military contexts as a non-lethal weapon that could be used
to stop boats by sliming up their propellers. In addition to mastering
the art of slime and knot-tying, hagfish have four little hearts and can survive 36 hours 
without oxygen unscathed. Oh, and they also clean the seafloor and cycle essential nutrients 
in the deep sea. Proto-hagfish were navigating
the ocean’s depths more than 300 million years ago— before dinosaurs roamed 
and back when Pangea was still a thing. Having persisted through multiple
mass extinction events, hagfish have just about seen it all. And it would appear that they’re still
having a wonderful slime.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly stated in the options provided. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a match.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the hagfish's secret for surviving shark bites. The correct option is "Loose skin." 

Among the generated MCQs, none directly ask about the hagfish's secret for surviving shark bites. However, Question 6 mentions the effect of the hagfish's slime on its own body and how it causes the hagfish to tie itself in a knot to escape, which is related to the hagfish's ability to survive shark bites.

But a more relevant question is not available in the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match, as it mentions the encounter between the hagfish and the shark, but it does not directly address the hagfish's secret for surviving shark bites.

Therefore, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 2, but it is not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
As the truck screeched to a halt,
one of its containers slid off, hit an approaching Prius 
and spilled its contents. Those contents happened to be thousands
of kilograms of live hagfish, also known as slime eels. The result of this 2017 car accident 
was an absolute mess: the highway was littered 
with wriggling fish and coated in a thick slime that took 
the fire department 7 hours to clear. Astonishingly good looks aside, the standout strength of all hagfishes
is their slime. In fact, they’re probably 
Earth’s slimiest animals. But why be so slimy? Watch and learn. This hagfish has detected a dead fish
using its keen sense of smell and the tastebud-like organs 
dotting its skin. Revealing imposing rows of toothlike
structures, it takes the first bite. A shark glides on to the scene
and suddenly lunges. Being caught in the shark’s powerful jaws
may seem like a guaranteed death sentence, but the hagfish has some tricks 
up its sleeve. The shark’s teeth clench down
but there are no bones to crush— only flexible cartilage. And because the hagfish’s skin is so 
loosely attached to the rest of its body, the pressure from the bite causes the hagfish’s essential organs

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the question intent and content related to hagfish slime, I would identify Question 4 as the most similar generated MCQ.

Although Question 4 does not ask about the expansion volume of hagfish slime, it does ask about the primary component of hagfish slime, which is related to the slime's properties and behavior. The correct answer to Question 4 is not explicitly provided, but based on the transcript, the correct answer would be A. Mucus and thread cells.

If I had to choose an index, I would choose Question 4 (Index 4), but I want to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ.

However, a new question can be generated based on the information in the passage that can match the ground truth MCQ as follows:

of vesicles of condensed mucus while each thread cell contains 
an intricately coiled protein fiber. The hagfish contracts the muscles
surrounding some of its slime glands, causing the cells to eject their contents
into the seawater. In a fraction of a second, 
the mucus vesicles swell and burst, and the protein fibers unravel. Together, they expand to 10,000 times
their original volume, instantly creating liters of slime. Because the substance is composed of mucus and reinforced with numerous superfine 
and strong silk-like fibers, the slime is incredibly soft yet tough. It lodges in the shark’s delicate gills, and as the shark chokes 
and tries to clear the slime, it releases the hagfish. Now, the hagfish is free 
from the jaws of death. But it’s in a dilemma of its own doing, trapped in a cloud of its own
suffocating slime. So what does it do? Well, it ties itself in a knot, of course. Starting at its tail 
and passing its body through, the hagfish effectively wipes away
its own slime. Apparently unfazed by the whole encounter, it returns to its meal. When it gets to a tougher part 
of the carcass... Voila! The hagfish ties itself 
in yet another knot to gain leverage and yank off the meat. The hagfish’s slime is so remarkable
that people are trying to emulate it. Currently, a lot of athletic 
and safety gear is made from non-renewable
petroleum-based fibers. But hagfish slime threads rival 
the properties of materials like nylon. And fibers modeled after those 
in hagfish slime may present a much more sustainable alternative. Meanwhile, hagfish slime is also being 
explored in military contexts as a non-lethal weapon that could be used
to stop boats by sliming up their propellers. In addition to mastering
the art of slime and knot-tying, hagfish have four little hearts and can survive 36 hours 
without oxygen unscathed. Oh, and they also clean the seafloor and cycle essential nutrients 
in the deep sea. Proto-hagfish were navigating
the ocean’s depths more than 300 million years ago— before dinosaurs roamed 
and back when Pangea was still a thing. Having persisted through multiple
mass extinction events, hagfish have just about seen it all. And it would appear that they’re still
having a wonderful slime.

**Transcript**:
What’s the best country 
in the world to live in? Is it the one with the best food?
The longest life expectancy? The best weather? For the past 70 years, most governments 
have relied heavily on a single number to answer that question. This number influences elections, 
the stock market, and government policy. But it was never intended
for its current purpose; and some would argue that the world 
is addicted to making it grow... forever. This number is called 
the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, and it was invented by the economist
Simon Kuznets in the 1930s, to try and gauge the size of an economy
in a single, easy to understand number. GDP is the total monetary value 
of everything a country produces and sells on the market. To this day, GDP per capita, which is just the total GDP divided by the
number of people living in that country, is widely seen as a measure of well-being. But GDP doesn’t actually say anything
direct about well-being, because it doesn't take into account
what a country produces or who has access to it. A million dollars of weapons contributes 
the exact same amount to a country’s GDP as a million dollars of vaccines or food. The value society derives from things
like public school or firefighters isn’t counted in GDP at all, because those
services aren’t sold on the market. And if a country has a lot of wealth, but most of it is controlled
by relatively few people, GDP per capita gives a distorted picture
of how much money a typical person has. Despite all that, for a long time, higher GDP did correlate closely
to a higher quality of life for people in many countries. From 1945 to 1970, as GDP doubled,
tripled or even quadrupled in some western economies, people’s wages often grew proportionally. By the 1980s, this changed. Countries continued to grow richer, but wages stopped keeping pace 
with GDP growth, or in some cases, even declined, and most of the benefits went to an 
ever-smaller percentage of the population. Still, the idea of capturing
a nation’s well-being in a single number had powerful appeal. In 1972, King Jigme Singye Wangchuk
of Bhutan came up with the idea 
of Gross National Happiness as an alternative 
to Gross Domestic Product. Gross National Happiness is a metric 
that factors in matters like health, education, 
strong communities, and living standards, having citizens answer questions like, “How happy do you think your family
members are at the moment?” “What is your knowledge of names of plants
and wild animals in your area?” and “What type of day was yesterday?” The United Nations’ Human Development
Index is a more widely used metric; it takes into account health
and education, as well as income per capita 
to estimate overall well-being. Meanwhile, a metric called
the Sustainable Development Index factors in both well-being and the 
environmental burdens of economic growth, again, boiling all this down
to a single number. Though no country has been able to meet the basic needs of its people while also using resources 
fully sustainably, Costa Rica currently comes the closest. Over the past few decades, it’s managed to grow its economy
and improve living standards substantially without drastically increasing 
its emissions. Other countries,
like Colombia and Jordan, have made notable progress. Costa Rica now has better well-being
outcomes like life expectancy than some of the world’s 
richest countries. Ultimately, there are limits 
to any approach that boils the quality of life in a country 
down to a single number. Increasingly, experts favor a dashboard
approach that lays out all the factors a single number obscures. This approach makes even more sense given 
that people have different priorities, and the answer to which country 
is best to live in depends on who’s asking the question. So what if that were you designing 
your countries well-being metric? What do you value, 
and what would you measure?

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of relevance to the topic of GDP.

The ground truth MCQ asks, "What is GDP?" and provides options that define GDP in different ways. The closest generated MCQ that relates to GDP is Question 2, which asks, "What is the main difference between GDP and Gross National Happiness?" However, this question does not directly ask for the definition of GDP.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one based on relevance to the topic of GDP, I would say Question 2 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest that Question 7 is the closest match.

Question 7: What is the main limitation of using a single number to capture the quality of life in a country? 
Options: A. It is too complex and difficult to understand, B. It does not take into account multiple factors that are important for well-being, C. It is less accurate than a more nuanced approach, D. It is not relevant to most people's lives 

Although this question does not directly ask what GDP does not capture, it implies that a single number (like GDP) has limitations in capturing the quality of life in a country. The correct answer (B) mentions that it does not take into account multiple factors that are important for well-being, which is similar to the ground truth MCQ's correct answer (D) that GDP does not capture services provided but not sold on the market, levels of inequality, and people's happiness.

However, please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs do not explicitly cover the same topic as the ground truth MCQ.

The longest life expectancy? The best weather? For the past 70 years, most governments 
have relied heavily on a single number to answer that question. This number influences elections, 
the stock market, and government policy. But it was never intended
for its current purpose; and some would argue that the world 
is addicted to making it grow... forever. This number is called 
the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, and it was invented by the economist
Simon Kuznets in the 1930s, to try and gauge the size of an economy
in a single, easy to understand number. GDP is the total monetary value 
of everything a country produces and sells on the market. To this day, GDP per capita, which is just the total GDP divided by the
number of people living in that country, is widely seen as a measure of well-being. But GDP doesn’t actually say anything
direct about well-being, because it doesn't take into account
what a country produces or who has access to it. A million dollars of weapons contributes 
the exact same amount to a country’s GDP as a million dollars of vaccines or food. The value society derives from things
like public school or firefighters isn’t counted in GDP at all, because those
services aren’t sold on the market. And if a country has a lot of wealth, but most of it is controlled
by relatively few people, GDP per capita gives a distorted picture
of how much money a typical person has. Despite all that, for a long time, higher GDP did correlate closely
to a higher quality of life for people in many countries. From 1945 to 1970, as GDP doubled,
tripled or even quadrupled in some western economies, people’s wages often grew proportionally. By the 1980s, this changed. Countries continued to grow richer, but wages stopped keeping pace 
with GDP growth, or in some cases, even declined, and most of the benefits went to an 
ever-smaller percentage of the population. Still, the idea of capturing
a nation’s well-being in a single number had powerful appeal. In 1972, King Jigme Singye Wangchuk
of Bhutan came up with the idea 
of Gross National Happiness as an alternative 
to Gross Domestic Product. Gross National Happiness is a metric 
that factors in matters like health, education, 
strong communities, and living standards, having citizens answer questions like, “How happy do you think your family
members are at the moment?” “What is your knowledge of names of plants
and wild animals in your area?” and “What type of day was yesterday?” The United Nations’ Human Development
Index is a more widely used metric; it takes into account health
and education, as well as income per capita 
to estimate overall well-being. Meanwhile, a metric called
the Sustainable Development Index factors in both well-being and the 
environmental burdens of economic growth, again, boiling all this down
to a single number. Though no country has been able to meet the basic needs of its people while also using resources 
fully sustainably, Costa Rica currently comes the closest. Over the past few decades, it’s managed to grow its economy
and improve living standards substantially without drastically increasing 
its emissions. Other countries,
like Colombia and Jordan, have made notable progress. Costa Rica now has better well-being
outcomes like life expectancy than some of the world’s 
richest countries. Ultimately, there are limits 
to any approach that boils the quality of life in a country 
down to a single number. Increasingly, experts favor a dashboard
approach that lays out all the factors a single number obscures. This approach makes even more sense given 
that people have different priorities, and the answer to which country 
is best to live in depends on who’s asking the question. So what if that were you designing 
your countries well-being metric? What do you value, 
and what would you measure?

**Transcript**:
If someone teleported from sea level
to the top of Mt. Everest, things would go bad fast. At an altitude of 8,848 meters, barometric pressure is approximately
33% of what it is at sea level. This means there's significantly
less oxygen in the air, and our teleported individual would
likely suffocate in minutes. However, for people that make this same
journey over the course of a month, it's possible to survive
at the peak for hours. So what can happen to our bodies 
in just one month that allows us to endure
this incredible altitude? Let’s imagine you’re one 
of the 5.8 billion people living less than 500 meters 
above sea level. When you take a breath at this altitude, your lungs fill up with air composed
of numerous gases and compounds. Most important among these 
are oxygen molecules, which bind to the hemoglobin 
in your red blood cells. Blood then circulates 
throughout your body, bringing essential oxygen
to all your cells. But as altitude increases, 
the air starts to get thinner. The relative amounts of each compound
remain the same well into the upper atmosphere, but overall, there is less oxygen 
for our bodies to absorb. And if you ascend to altitudes
above 2,500 meters, the resulting oxygen deprivation can cause
a form of altitude sickness known as AMS, often causing headaches,
fatigue and nausea. Fortunately, AMS only happens
when we ascend too fast, because our bodies have numerous ways
of adapting to high altitudes. Within minutes or even seconds 
of reaching altitudes of 1,500 meters, carotid chemoreceptors in your neck
sense your blood’s low oxygen pressure. This triggers a response that increases 
the rate and depth of your breathing to counteract the lack of oxygen. Your heart rate also increases and your heart contracts more tightly 
to pump additional blood with each beat, quickly moving oxygenated
blood around your body. All these changes happen relatively fast,
and if you were to keep ascending, your heart rate and breathing
would speed up accordingly. But if you stayed at this altitude
for several weeks, you could reap the benefits 
of some longer-term adaptations. Within the first few days 
above 1,500 meters, the volume of plasma 
in your blood decreases, which increases the concentration
of hemoglobin. Over the next two weeks, your hemoglobin
levels will continue to rise, allowing your blood to carry 
even more oxygen per milliliter. Paired with your high heart rate, this new hemoglobin-rich blood efficiently
distributes oxygen throughout your body. So much so that the volume of blood 
being pumped with each heartbeat can return to normal levels. Over this same time, your breathing 
also increases even further in a process called 
ventilatory acclimatization. After this several weeks 
of extended acclimatization, your body has made enough significant
changes to climb even higher. However, you’ll still have to spend
additional time acclimating along the way, often climbing back down to recover 
before ascending even higher. Because the summit of Everest
isn't just high, it’s the highest place on Earth. And at altitudes above 3,500 meters, 
our bodies are under incredible stress. Arteries and veins in the brain
dilate to speed up blood flow, But our smallest blood vessels,
called capillaries, remain the same size. This increased pressure can cause
blood vessels to leak, and fluid to build up in the brain. A similar issue can occur in the lungs, where low oxygen causes blood vessels 
to constrict, leading to more leaking vessels
and fluid buildup. These two conditions— 
known as HACE and HAPE, respectively— are incredibly rare, but can be life-threatening 
if not dealt with quickly. Some Tibetans and South Americans 
with family histories of living at high altitude have genetic advantages that can 
prevent minor altitude sickness, but even they aren’t immune
to these severe conditions. Yet despite these risks, 
climbers over the last century have proved people can go higher 
than scientists ever thought possible. Pushing past their body’s limitations, these climbers have redefined
what humanity can adapt to.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, some generated MCQs touch on related topics, such as altitude sickness and its effects.

The most similar generated MCQ would be one that discusses symptoms or effects of altitude sickness. Among the options, Question 3 mentions a condition related to altitude sickness, but it does not ask about symptoms. Question 6 also mentions a condition related to altitude sickness but again does not ask about symptoms.

Given the available options, none directly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the topic of altitude sickness (though not directly matching the question about symptoms), I would suggest Question 3 or Question 6 as a distant match, keeping in mind that neither directly addresses the symptoms as the ground truth MCQ does.

However, since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ's intent and content directly, it's more accurate to say there isn't a matching MCQ available in the provided set based on the given criteria.

the rate and depth of your breathing to counteract the lack of oxygen. Your heart rate also increases and your heart contracts more tightly 
to pump additional blood with each beat, quickly moving oxygenated
blood around your body. All these changes happen relatively fast,
and if you were to keep ascending, your heart rate and breathing
would speed up accordingly. But if you stayed at this altitude
for several weeks, you could reap the benefits 
of some longer-term adaptations. Within the first few days 
above 1,500 meters, the volume of plasma 
in your blood decreases, which increases the concentration
of hemoglobin. Over the next two weeks, your hemoglobin
levels will continue to rise, allowing your blood to carry 
even more oxygen per milliliter. Paired with your high heart rate, this new hemoglobin-rich blood efficiently
distributes oxygen throughout your body. So much so that the volume of blood 
being pumped with each heartbeat can return to normal levels. Over this same time, your breathing 
also increases even further in a process called 
ventilatory acclimatization. After this several weeks 
of extended acclimatization, your body has made enough significant
changes to climb even higher. However, you’ll still have to spend
additional time acclimating along the way, often climbing back down to recover 
before ascending even higher. Because the summit of Everest
isn't just high, it’s the highest place on Earth. And at altitudes above 3,500 meters, 
our bodies are under incredible stress. Arteries and veins in the brain
dilate to speed up blood flow, But our smallest blood vessels,
called capillaries, remain the same size. This increased pressure can cause
blood vessels to leak, and fluid to build up in the brain. A similar issue can occur in the lungs, where low oxygen causes blood vessels 
to constrict, leading to more leaking vessels
and fluid buildup. These two conditions— 
known as HACE and HAPE, respectively— are incredibly rare, but can be life-threatening 
if not dealt with quickly. Some Tibetans and South Americans 
with family histories of living at high altitude have genetic advantages that can 
prevent minor altitude sickness, but even they aren’t immune
to these severe conditions. Yet despite these risks, 
climbers over the last century have proved people can go higher 
than scientists ever thought possible. Pushing past their body’s limitations, these climbers have redefined
what humanity can adapt to.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: What is the name of the adaptation that occurs when your body produces more hemoglobin in response to high altitude? Options: A. Ventilatory acclimatization, B. Hemoglobin adaptation, C. Oxygen deprivation, D. High-altitude adaptation.

However, the options provided in Question 7 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a question that explicitly states the increase in hemoglobin levels.

A closer match can be inferred from Question 2: What happens to the volume of plasma in your blood within the first few days above 1,500 meters? Options: A. It increases, B. It remains the same, C. It decreases, D. It has no effect. 

Although Question 2 does not directly address the increase in hemoglobin levels, the transcript explains that the decrease in plasma volume leads to an increase in hemoglobin concentration.

Since none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the closest match based on the provided information would be Question 2 or Question 7, with the understanding that the options would need to be adjusted to accurately reflect the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose one index, I would choose Question 7 as the closest match.

**Transcript**:
If someone teleported from sea level
to the top of Mt. Everest, things would go bad fast. At an altitude of 8,848 meters, barometric pressure is approximately
33% of what it is at sea level. This means there's significantly
less oxygen in the air, and our teleported individual would
likely suffocate in minutes. However, for people that make this same
journey over the course of a month, it's possible to survive
at the peak for hours. So what can happen to our bodies 
in just one month that allows us to endure
this incredible altitude? Let’s imagine you’re one 
of the 5.8 billion people living less than 500 meters 
above sea level. When you take a breath at this altitude, your lungs fill up with air composed
of numerous gases and compounds. Most important among these 
are oxygen molecules, which bind to the hemoglobin 
in your red blood cells. Blood then circulates 
throughout your body, bringing essential oxygen
to all your cells. But as altitude increases, 
the air starts to get thinner. The relative amounts of each compound
remain the same well into the upper atmosphere, but overall, there is less oxygen 
for our bodies to absorb. And if you ascend to altitudes
above 2,500 meters, the resulting oxygen deprivation can cause
a form of altitude sickness known as AMS, often causing headaches,
fatigue and nausea. Fortunately, AMS only happens
when we ascend too fast, because our bodies have numerous ways
of adapting to high altitudes. Within minutes or even seconds 
of reaching altitudes of 1,500 meters, carotid chemoreceptors in your neck
sense your blood’s low oxygen pressure. This triggers a response that increases 
the rate and depth of your breathing to counteract the lack of oxygen. Your heart rate also increases and your heart contracts more tightly 
to pump additional blood with each beat, quickly moving oxygenated
blood around your body. All these changes happen relatively fast,
and if you were to keep ascending, your heart rate and breathing
would speed up accordingly. But if you stayed at this altitude

this is the british museum it's the world's largest world history museum and it draws millions of visitors every year inside it holds more than eight million cultural and historical artifacts from all over the world which cover 2 million years of human history if you follow the museum's recommended list of don't miss items you'll see its star pieces like this easter island sculpture that's about a thousand years old or this bronze sculpture of the hindu god shiva [Music] but there's a problem hidden in the museum and we can see an example of it along this route out of those 12 pieces nearly half have disputed ownership the british museum claims those pieces belong there on display for the world to see but in recent years many have been fighting to get them back to where they came from the list of disputed museum treasures keeps on growing should cultural artifacts return to their home countries or be left in western museums the subject of intense debate as to who should now own them let's start with some context in the late 1600s the british empire began expanding across several continents it became the largest empire in history controlling about a quarter of the world's land and population during its centuries-long role the empire took precious resources and wealth from countries all over the world including cultural and historical artifacts many of which ended up here in the british museum which was founded in 1753 and kept growing to accommodate all the new pieces in its collection lots of the items in the museum were legally acquired and are completely undisputed like this one a two thousand year old roman base sold to the museum by a duke in 1945. the problem is with the pieces that are disputed like the first item you see as soon as you walk in the rosetta stone taken by british troops from the french in what is now egypt or further in the parthenon sculptures removed from the acropolis in athens by a british lord and sent to the british museum or over here on the floor dedicated to african art the benin bronzes some of the most contentious items in the museum the benin bronzes are kind of hard to categorize because they include such a huge range of items from engraved ivory tusks to brass sculptures to plaques but they were all produced here in the kingdom of benin in present-day nigeria this wealthy and industrious kingdom produced thousands of objects and art pieces starting in the 1500s a lot of the items adorned palace walls and were used for religious rituals but they weren't just decorative there were visual archives of the kingdom in a society that did not develop a written script as we know them that's professor chika okekeyagulu an art historian and professor from nigeria who teaches at princeton university they told their history how they narrated the histories of kingship of the kingdom its political and social life but in 1897 benin would lose thousands of these cultural pieces at the time european colonial powers were expanding south in what was called the scramble for africa they split up the continent into spheres of influence for financial exploitation all these pink areas were the british ones benin over here was in britain's sphere of influence but the kingdom didn't comply with britain's trade demands and in january of 1897 it led to what was called the benin disaster where benin guards killed seven british emissaries plus their many guides and servants in response 1 200 british troops embarked on a mission called the benin punitive expedition the british wanted revenge but the mission was about more than just that there were reports of these vast treasures in the palace of the king of the name and that if they could retrieve these treasures sales from it could offset the cost of the invasion this was all well planned and so the punitive expedition in other words was also an economic enterprise the british soldiers armed with machine guns conquered the city and burned it to the ground but not before carefully taking thousands of artifacts they piled them up neatly photographed them and even labeled them loot this photo taken at the benin palace after the raid shows soldiers with the dismantled plaques that were brought to the british museum and sold all over the world and after hundreds of years the once prosperous kingdom was gone the region fell under full british colonial control until 1960 when nigeria including the city of benin gained independence but even though they were finally free their historical artifacts were still spread all over the world locked up in western institutions like the leipzig museum of ethnology in germany and the que brandle museum in paris and of course the british museum [Music] 1995 in london that was my first time of seeing an original uh ancient benin artwork was yes at the british museum being in the presence of these magnificent objects and knowing that i had to travel all the way from nigeria to see for the first time in these objects it was a mixture of pride in the achievement of these ancient artists and and mixed with a sense of loss at what could have been if i only had to travel a few hundred miles but at this point you're limited to those uh privileged like me who could get a visa to travel all the way from nigeria to england um to encounter these objects most nigerians will never see them [Music] in march 2000 benin's royal family tried to change that they officially requested all cultural property illegally taken be returned to the rightful owner but for the most part the british museum has ignored any requests the museum is restricted by a government act that prevents it from returning objects but it has also made its stance clear in july of 2020 the british museum told vox we don't restitute but we are absolutely committed to lending as widely as possible including to nigeria the museum's foundational value resides in its breadth scale complexity and unity and as such is a true library of the world chica doesn't see it that way the british museum still behaves like a colonial museum you cannot claim to be an encyclopedic collector of stolen objects but some are starting to reckon with this history in 2014 the grandson of this british soldier from the 1897 benin punitive expedition returned these two items he had inherited to the benin royal family and in 2007 the benin dialogue group was formed western museums that hold the bronzes and nigerian government representatives have been discussing potential solutions ever since but as of today none of the bronzes have been returned but this is just one story this legacy is bigger than the bannon bronzes there are hundreds of contested items in the british museum with their own rich histories and with original owners trying to retrieve them but the problem is even bigger than the british museum it's a legacy of centuries of colonial power that repeats itself again and again with different artifacts in different museums because these requests aren't just about items they are also about cultural and historical identity and who gets to own it this is a long term project it may last beyond my own

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the time period when the British Empire began its global expansion. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about this topic, Question 3 mentions an event in 1897 that is related to the British Empire's expansion.

However, a more relevant question is not present among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, but it's not a good match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: **None** (or **3**, but with the caveat that it's not a good match).

To provide a better match, I would suggest generating a new MCQ that directly asks about the time period of the British Empire's expansion, such as:

Question: When did the British Empire begin its expansion across several continents?
Options: A. 1400s, B. 1600s, C. 1800s, D. 1900s

This new MCQ would be a better match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
this is the british museum it's the world's largest world history museum and it draws millions of visitors every year inside it holds more than eight million cultural and historical artifacts from all over the world which cover 2 million years of human history if you follow the museum's recommended list of don't miss items you'll see its star pieces like this easter island sculpture that's about a thousand years old or this bronze sculpture of the hindu god shiva [Music] but there's a problem hidden in the museum and we can see an example of it along this route out of those 12 pieces nearly half have disputed ownership the british museum claims those pieces belong there on display for the world to see but in recent years many have been fighting to get them back to where they came from the list of disputed museum treasures keeps on growing should cultural artifacts return to their home countries or be left in western museums the subject of intense debate as to who should now own them let's start with some context in the late 1600s the british empire began expanding across several continents it became the largest empire in history controlling about a quarter of the world's land and population during its centuries-long role the empire took precious resources and wealth from countries all over the world including cultural and historical artifacts many of which ended up here in the british museum which was founded in 1753 and kept growing to accommodate all the new pieces in its collection lots of the items in the museum were legally acquired and are completely undisputed like this one a two thousand year old roman base sold to the museum by a duke in 1945. the problem is with the pieces that are disputed like the first item you see as soon as you walk in the rosetta stone taken by british troops from the french in what is now egypt or further in the parthenon sculptures removed from the acropolis in athens by a british lord and sent to the british museum or over here on the floor dedicated to african art the benin bronzes some of the most contentious items in the museum the benin bronzes are kind of hard to categorize because they include such a huge range of items from engraved ivory tusks to brass sculptures to plaques but they were all produced here in the kingdom of benin in present-day nigeria this wealthy and industrious kingdom produced thousands of objects and art pieces starting in the 1500s a lot of the items adorned palace walls and were used for religious rituals but they weren't just decorative there were visual archives of the kingdom in a society that did not develop a written script as we know them that's professor chika okekeyagulu an art historian and professor from nigeria who teaches at princeton university they told their history how they narrated the histories of kingship of the kingdom its political and social life but in 1897 benin would lose thousands of these cultural pieces at the time european colonial powers were expanding south in what was called the scramble for africa they split up the continent into spheres of influence for financial exploitation all these pink areas were the british ones benin over here was in britain's sphere of influence but the kingdom didn't comply with britain's trade demands and in january of 1897 it led to what was called the benin disaster where benin guards killed seven british emissaries plus their many guides and servants in response 1 200 british troops embarked on a mission called the benin punitive expedition the british wanted revenge but the mission was about more than just that there were reports of these vast treasures in the palace of the king of the name and that if they could retrieve these treasures sales from it could offset the cost of the invasion this was all well planned and so the punitive expedition in other words was also an economic enterprise the british soldiers armed with machine guns conquered the city and burned it to the ground but not before carefully taking thousands of artifacts they piled them up neatly photographed them and even labeled them loot this photo taken at the benin palace after the raid shows soldiers with the dismantled plaques that were brought to the british museum and sold all over the world and after hundreds of years the once prosperous kingdom was gone the region fell under full british colonial control until 1960 when nigeria including the city of benin gained independence but even though they were finally free their historical artifacts were still spread all over the world locked up in western institutions like the leipzig museum of ethnology in germany and the que brandle museum in paris and of course the british museum [Music] 1995 in london that was my first time of seeing an original uh ancient benin artwork was yes at the british museum being in the presence of these magnificent objects and knowing that i had to travel all the way from nigeria to see for the first time in these objects it was a mixture of pride in the achievement of these ancient artists and and mixed with a sense of loss at what could have been if i only had to travel a few hundred miles but at this point you're limited to those uh privileged like me who could get a visa to travel all the way from nigeria to england um to encounter these objects most nigerians will never see them [Music] in march 2000 benin's royal family tried to change that they officially requested all cultural property illegally taken be returned to the rightful owner but for the most part the british museum has ignored any requests the museum is restricted by a government act that prevents it from returning objects but it has also made its stance clear in july of 2020 the british museum told vox we don't restitute but we are absolutely committed to lending as widely as possible including to nigeria the museum's foundational value resides in its breadth scale complexity and unity and as such is a true library of the world chica doesn't see it that way the british museum still behaves like a colonial museum you cannot claim to be an encyclopedic collector of stolen objects but some are starting to reckon with this history in 2014 the grandson of this british soldier from the 1897 benin punitive expedition returned these two items he had inherited to the benin royal family and in 2007 the benin dialogue group was formed western museums that hold the bronzes and nigerian government representatives have been discussing potential solutions ever since but as of today none of the bronzes have been returned but this is just one story this legacy is bigger than the bannon bronzes there are hundreds of contested items in the british museum with their own rich histories and with original owners trying to retrieve them but the problem is even bigger than the british museum it's a legacy of centuries of colonial power that repeats itself again and again with different artifacts in different museums because these requests aren't just about items they are also about cultural and historical identity and who gets to own it this is a long term project it may last beyond my own lifetime but the point is that it's now to start that process we cannot wait any longer for a next generation to even begin the necessary task and project of cultural [Music] reconstitution [Music]

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a possible match.

The ground truth MCQ asks about an item that is NOT disputed, and the correct option is the Portland Vase. Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the closest match, as it discusses the main issue with some of the items in the British Museum's collection, which is related to disputed ownership. However, the options in Question 2 do not include specific items like the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match, but it's not a perfect match. A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about a specific item that is NOT disputed, with options including the Rosetta Stone, Portland Vase, Parthenon Sculptures, and Benin Bronzes.

Index: 2 (with the caveat that it's not a perfect match)

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In 2010, a parrot that spoke 
with the same British accent as his owner went missing. They were reunited four years later, but the intervening time left
a conspicuous mark: the parrot had lost its British accent and was instead chattering
away in Spanish. Parrots and several other birds are
the only other animals that produce human speech. And some parrots do it almost 
uncannily well. How is this possible? Most wild parrots are highly social. They use vocalizations for mating
and territorial displays and to coordinate group movements. Some species have flocks 
that continuously split and fuse, meaning individual parrots must be able
to communicate with many others. Parrots use contact calls to interact and stay in touch when others
are out of sight. But how exactly they use these calls
depends on the species and the size of their flocks. Monk parakeets, for example,
live in large colonies and have individualized contact calls 
that help them stand out. Yellow-naped Amazon parrots, 
on the other hand, forage in smaller groups that learn
and share highly similar contact calls. This need for sophisticated mimicry may
partially explain why yellow-naped Amazons and some other parrots can 
closely imitate a wide range of sounds— including the human voice. So, how does a parrot actually declare
that “Polly wants a cracker”? A person would string these sounds
together using their larynx, the organ at the top of their windpipe. It consists of rings of muscles 
and a vibrating membrane that controls airflow. They’d finely shape the vocalization 
into enunciated words using their tongue and lips. For a parrot, however, the sound
would originate in its syrinx, located at the base of its windpipe. Many other birds have two vibrating
membranes within this organ. But parrots, like us, have just one. As sounds leave the airway, parrots shape
them using their tongues and beaks. They can do this because they have
especially flexible, powerful tongues that help them manipulate seeds and nuts. And while parrots’ beaks are rigid, 
they have very flexible jaw joints, giving them a lot of control
over how wide and how quickly they open their beaks. Like other animals 
with learned vocalizations, parrot brains contain interconnected
regions that allow them to hear, remember, modify, 
and produce complex sounds. But while songbirds have just one
song system in their brains, almost all parrots seem to have
an additional circuit. Scientists think that this might give 
them extra flexibility when it comes to learning the calls 
of their own species— and ours. With this specialized anatomy, parrots can bark, scream, curse, 
and recite factoids. One intrepid lost parrot managed 
to get back home after repeating his full name 
and address to helpful strangers. But these impressive abilities 
raise another question: do parrots actually understand 
what they’re saying? When most captive parrots talk, they’re likely attempting to form social
bonds in the absence of their own species. Many probably have associations
with words and may be drawn to ones 
that elicit certain responses— hence their capacity for profanity. But, especially after training, parrots have been observed to say things
in the appropriate contexts and assign meaning to words— 
saying “goodnight” at the end of the day, asking for certain treats, 
or counting and picking objects. One extensively trained 
African grey parrot named Alex became the first non-human animal 
to pose an existential question when he asked what color he was. Whether they’re belting Beyoncé,
head-banging to classic rock, or rattling off cuss words at zoo-goers, parrots are constantly astounding us—
as they have been for millennia. But our fascination with parrots has
also made them vulnerable. Sought by poachers and pet traders, while losing their habitats
to deforestation, wild populations have decreased
dramatically. To truly understand parrots, we need 
to preserve and study them in the wild.

**Transcript**:
In 2010, a parrot that spoke 
with the same British accent as his owner went missing. They were reunited four years later, but the intervening time left
a conspicuous mark: the parrot had lost its British accent and was instead chattering
away in Spanish. Parrots and several other birds are
the only other animals that produce human speech. And some parrots do it almost 
uncannily well. How is this possible? Most wild parrots are highly social. They use vocalizations for mating
and territorial displays and to coordinate group movements. Some species have flocks 
that continuously split and fuse, meaning individual parrots must be able
to communicate with many others. Parrots use contact calls to interact and stay in touch when others
are out of sight. But how exactly they use these calls
depends on the species and the size of their flocks. Monk parakeets, for example,
live in large colonies and have individualized contact calls 
that help them stand out. Yellow-naped Amazon parrots, 
on the other hand, forage in smaller groups that learn
and share highly similar contact calls. This need for sophisticated mimicry may
partially explain why yellow-naped Amazons and some other parrots can 
closely imitate a wide range of sounds— including the human voice. So, how does a parrot actually declare
that “Polly wants a cracker”? A person would string these sounds
together using their larynx, the organ at the top of their windpipe. It consists of rings of muscles 
and a vibrating membrane that controls airflow. They’d finely shape the vocalization 
into enunciated words using their tongue and lips. For a parrot, however, the sound
would originate in its syrinx, located at the base of its windpipe. Many other birds have two vibrating
membranes within this organ. But parrots, like us, have just one. As sounds leave the airway, parrots shape
them using their tongues and beaks. They can do this because they have
especially flexible, powerful tongues that help them manipulate seeds and nuts. And while parrots’ beaks are rigid, 
they have very flexible jaw joints, giving them a lot of control
over how wide and how quickly they open their beaks. Like other animals 
with learned vocalizations, parrot brains contain interconnected
regions that allow them to hear, remember, modify, 
and produce complex sounds. But while songbirds have just one
song system in their brains, almost all parrots seem to have
an additional circuit. Scientists think that this might give 
them extra flexibility when it comes to learning the calls 
of their own species— and ours. With this specialized anatomy, parrots can bark, scream, curse, 
and recite factoids. One intrepid lost parrot managed 
to get back home after repeating his full name 
and address to helpful strangers. But these impressive abilities 
raise another question: do parrots actually understand 
what they’re saying? When most captive parrots talk, they’re likely attempting to form social
bonds in the absence of their own species. Many probably have associations
with words and may be drawn to ones 
that elicit certain responses— hence their capacity for profanity. But, especially after training, parrots have been observed to say things
in the appropriate contexts and assign meaning to words— 
saying “goodnight” at the end of the day, asking for certain treats, 
or counting and picking objects. One extensively trained 
African grey parrot named Alex became the first non-human animal 
to pose an existential question when he asked what color he was. Whether they’re belting Beyoncé,
head-banging to classic rock, or rattling off cuss words at zoo-goers, parrots are constantly astounding us—
as they have been for millennia. But our fascination with parrots has
also made them vulnerable. Sought by poachers and pet traders, while losing their habitats
to deforestation, wild populations have decreased
dramatically. To truly understand parrots, we need 
to preserve and study them in the wild.

**Transcript**:
In the 7th century CE, 
one man started a chain of events that would change
the world order for good. The prophet Muhammad united the people
of the Arabian Peninsula through the formation of Islam. These people included both 
nomadic Bedouin tribes and the inhabitants of oasis cities
like Mecca and Medina. Until Muhammad’s time, the region 
hadn’t been considered a serious match for the powerful neighboring 
Persian and Byzantine empires. But the alliance Muhammad formed 
was political as well as religious, an empire with Medina 
as its political heart and a force to be reckoned with. Muhammad was a one-of-a-kind leader. He had been a member of the Quraysh,
the tribe that controlled Mecca. After Muhammad’s death, those close to him deliberated
who should succeed him— a contentious question. Abū Bakr, Muhammad’s father-in-law, emerged victorious and became 
the new caliph, or successor. Over the next 30 years, four caliphs,
all from Muhammad's tribe, conquered vast areas beyond Arabia, including their mighty neighbors, 
the Persians and the Byzantines. But as the empire expanded, 
dissent within it grew and a civil war erupted. The fourth caliph, Ali, was assassinated. Afterwards, the Umayyad Dynasty
came to power. The Umayyads were from the same tribe
as Muhammad, but from a different, rival clan. They extended the empire’s reach
from present-day Spain to India and made Damascus their capital. But an empire this vast, 
full of many different peoples, was at risk of conflict and fracture. The Umayyads stabilized it by replacing
the ruling elite in conquered territories with Muslim officials, while largely allowing the day-to-day
customs of local populations— including their religious preferences—
to continue. Arabic was used 
as the administrative language, unifying political affairs
across the empire, but people continued to speak and write
local languages, too. Still, many in the empire were
dissatisfied with Umayyad rule and questioned the dynasty's legitimacy. The Abbasid family capitalized
on these sentiments, promoting themselves as more direct
descendants of the prophet, though their actual relation to Muhammad
was more tenuous than they claimed. They overthrew the Umayyad caliphate
in 750 CE, becoming the second great dynasty
of the Islamic Empire. To establish themselves as the new rulers, they relocated the capital once more, this time building a new city: Baghdad. Under Abbasid rule, the elite 
enjoyed a lifestyle of luxury, thanks to extensive trade networks
that brought both products and people from all over the known world to Baghdad. Byzantine, Persian, Indian and Arab
cultures and knowledge intermingled, leading to artistic and scientific
advancement. The caliph was wealthy and powerful
beyond imagination. But there was never a clear line 
of succession dictating who would become
the next caliph. Any male relative of the former caliph 
was eligible, so brothers, nephews, and uncles 
fought to gain power. Within the court, army officers, wives, 
concubines, and government officials all demanded their share of the treasury. Because the caliph depended 
on his entourage to stay in power, each transition of rulership opened
the doors for favoritism and corruption. Outside the court, many questioned the legitimacy
of the caliph, noting that the caliph’s religious duty
to moral excellence was at odds with the court’s 
decadent displays of wealth. In 1258 CE, the Mongols
approached Baghdad. They encountered little resistance 
as they thoroughly destroyed the city. Legend has it that they rolled
the caliph in a rug and had horses trample him to death, and that the Tigris River ran
black from the ink of the manuscripts that were thrown into it. The siege of Baghdad laid bare
a longstanding reality: for centuries, the caliphs had
ruled mostly symbolically. Local leaders throughout the empire
had grown more powerful, and they refused to pay taxes, spending the money on their own courts
instead. The time of one united Islamic Empire
was over, but its influence 
through written and spoken Arabic, Islam, and the ideas 
of its greatest intellectuals, left a lasting mark on the world.

**Transcript**:
In the 7th century CE, 
one man started a chain of events that would change
the world order for good. The prophet Muhammad united the people
of the Arabian Peninsula through the formation of Islam. These people included both 
nomadic Bedouin tribes and the inhabitants of oasis cities
like Mecca and Medina. Until Muhammad’s time, the region 
hadn’t been considered a serious match for the powerful neighboring 
Persian and Byzantine empires. But the alliance Muhammad formed 
was political as well as religious, an empire with Medina 
as its political heart and a force to be reckoned with. Muhammad was a one-of-a-kind leader. He had been a member of the Quraysh,
the tribe that controlled Mecca. After Muhammad’s death, those close to him deliberated
who should succeed him— a contentious question. Abū Bakr, Muhammad’s father-in-law, emerged victorious and became 
the new caliph, or successor. Over the next 30 years, four caliphs,
all from Muhammad's tribe, conquered vast areas beyond Arabia, including their mighty neighbors, 
the Persians and the Byzantines. But as the empire expanded, 
dissent within it grew and a civil war erupted. The fourth caliph, Ali, was assassinated. Afterwards, the Umayyad Dynasty
came to power. The Umayyads were from the same tribe
as Muhammad, but from a different, rival clan. They extended the empire’s reach
from present-day Spain to India and made Damascus their capital. But an empire this vast, 
full of many different peoples, was at risk of conflict and fracture. The Umayyads stabilized it by replacing
the ruling elite in conquered territories with Muslim officials, while largely allowing the day-to-day
customs of local populations— including their religious preferences—
to continue. Arabic was used 
as the administrative language, unifying political affairs
across the empire, but people continued to speak and write
local languages, too. Still, many in the empire were
dissatisfied with Umayyad rule and questioned the dynasty's legitimacy. The Abbasid family capitalized
on these sentiments, promoting themselves as more direct
descendants of the prophet, though their actual relation to Muhammad
was more tenuous than they claimed. They overthrew the Umayyad caliphate
in 750 CE, becoming the second great dynasty
of the Islamic Empire. To establish themselves as the new rulers, they relocated the capital once more, this time building a new city: Baghdad. Under Abbasid rule, the elite 
enjoyed a lifestyle of luxury, thanks to extensive trade networks
that brought both products and people from all over the known world to Baghdad. Byzantine, Persian, Indian and Arab
cultures and knowledge intermingled, leading to artistic and scientific
advancement. The caliph was wealthy and powerful
beyond imagination. But there was never a clear line 
of succession dictating who would become
the next caliph. Any male relative of the former caliph 
was eligible, so brothers, nephews, and uncles 
fought to gain power. Within the court, army officers, wives, 
concubines, and government officials all demanded their share of the treasury. Because the caliph depended 
on his entourage to stay in power, each transition of rulership opened
the doors for favoritism and corruption. Outside the court, many questioned the legitimacy
of the caliph, noting that the caliph’s religious duty
to moral excellence was at odds with the court’s 
decadent displays of wealth. In 1258 CE, the Mongols
approached Baghdad. They encountered little resistance 
as they thoroughly destroyed the city. Legend has it that they rolled
the caliph in a rug and had horses trample him to death, and that the Tigris River ran
black from the ink of the manuscripts that were thrown into it. The siege of Baghdad laid bare
a longstanding reality: for centuries, the caliphs had
ruled mostly symbolically. Local leaders throughout the empire
had grown more powerful, and they refused to pay taxes, spending the money on their own courts
instead. The time of one united Islamic Empire
was over, but its influence 
through written and spoken Arabic, Islam, and the ideas 
of its greatest intellectuals, left a lasting mark on the world.

**Transcript**:
These paintings are in peril. All three have been defaced, some in ways that are almost impossible
to see with the naked eye. Can you guess how they've been altered? You might be surprised. When a museum curator 
inspected this portrait, attributed to the 16th century 
Italian painter Bronzino, they suspected it was a modern fake. However, closely examining the cracks
on its surface, an art conservator discovered
that it was from that era— It had just undergone drastic changes
in recent centuries. Using x-ray technology, they peered 
under the outer surface of paint and saw the countenance 
of a completely different woman. Essential parts of the painting
had been modified during a 19th century restoration. Prior to the mid-20th century, art restorers took a more
heavy-handed approach, often believing they were improving art. Nowadays, they focus on keeping
the original work intact with minimal intervention. When they need to fix something up, they usually make their markings visually
and chemically distinct from the original, so they can be harmlessly removed. But the work of past restorers is a threat
they regularly contend with— as was the case with this portrait. To recover the original, the conservator began removing
the outer varnish coat. Varnish is commonly used to protect
paintings from debris and make their colors pop. But the natural varnishes past restorers
applied eventually darkened, which is what gives older paintings 
that aged, yellowy look. Slowly dissolving the varnish, the conservator uncovered
crisp colors below. Taking small samples from the added
and original paint layers, they analyzed the compositions of each. Then, they decided which solvents
could dissolve the overpainting while minimally affecting the original. Carefully dabbing the canvas with them, they removed the overpainting’s 
dainty hands and idealized face. The true painting underneath revealed
Isabella of the Italian Medici dynasty. The portrait isn’t Bronzino’s, but it is from around 1570,
and may have been painted by one of his students. Its Victorian makeover was likely done
to boost sales because the original subject wasn’t
considered attractive. But now, Isabella is back, 
meeting her viewer’s gaze directly. This painting, 
“An Allegory with Venus and Cupid,” is actually Bronzino’s, 
and it was completed around 1545. It centers on a kiss between Venus
and her son Cupid– but it’s been subtly altered. When London’s National Gallery
acquired it in 1860, the Gallery’s director deemed it 
too risqué for Victorian England. So, he commissioned a restorer to obscure
Venus’s tongue and nipple. A century after this modification, art conservators analyzed and removed
the overpainting with select solvents. In the process, they also realized 
that the veil covering Venus’s crotch and the branch hiding Cupid’s posterior
were other add-ons. Removing two layers of censorship
from the painting, it was finally free to boast
its provocative original details. This massive painting called 
“The Night Watch” was completed by Rembrandt in 1642. Since then, it’s endured one
dramatic amputation, two stabbings, an acid attack, and centuries of grime. A museum guard immediately neutralized
the acid with water. Restorers lifted the grime, revealing that the painting was
not set at night, and healed the slashes using adhesive
and extra canvas backing. But they faced an even trickier problem. In 1715, strips were removed
from all sides of the canvas, including two whole feet from the left,
to fit it inside Amsterdam’s Town Hall. They've been lost ever since. But a multi-year conservation project that began in 2019 
replaced the missing pieces. They managed this by training
an artificial intelligence to digitally paint in Rembrandt’s style. Then, using another artist’s rendering
of the original, the program recreated and printed
the painting’s lost sections. Finally, the team returned 
“The Night Watch” to its full size, with AI-generated best guesses
to fill in the blanks. All of these paintings had been altered,
but none of them were irrevocably ruined. With painstaking scientific analysis
and technical skill, art conservators immortalize
priceless artifacts. They counteract sudden damage
and creeping threats— and sometimes, they perform near miracles. This video was made possible with support

**Transcript**:
These paintings are in peril. All three have been defaced, some in ways that are almost impossible
to see with the naked eye. Can you guess how they've been altered? You might be surprised. When a museum curator 
inspected this portrait, attributed to the 16th century 
Italian painter Bronzino, they suspected it was a modern fake. However, closely examining the cracks
on its surface, an art conservator discovered
that it was from that era— It had just undergone drastic changes
in recent centuries. Using x-ray technology, they peered 
under the outer surface of paint and saw the countenance 
of a completely different woman. Essential parts of the painting
had been modified during a 19th century restoration. Prior to the mid-20th century, art restorers took a more
heavy-handed approach, often believing they were improving art. Nowadays, they focus on keeping
the original work intact with minimal intervention. When they need to fix something up, they usually make their markings visually
and chemically distinct from the original, so they can be harmlessly removed. But the work of past restorers is a threat
they regularly contend with— as was the case with this portrait. To recover the original, the conservator began removing
the outer varnish coat. Varnish is commonly used to protect
paintings from debris and make their colors pop. But the natural varnishes past restorers
applied eventually darkened, which is what gives older paintings 
that aged, yellowy look. Slowly dissolving the varnish, the conservator uncovered
crisp colors below. Taking small samples from the added
and original paint layers, they analyzed the compositions of each. Then, they decided which solvents
could dissolve the overpainting while minimally affecting the original. Carefully dabbing the canvas with them, they removed the overpainting’s 
dainty hands and idealized face. The true painting underneath revealed
Isabella of the Italian Medici dynasty. The portrait isn’t Bronzino’s, but it is from around 1570,
and may have been painted by one of his students. Its Victorian makeover was likely done
to boost sales because the original subject wasn’t
considered attractive. But now, Isabella is back, 
meeting her viewer’s gaze directly. This painting, 
“An Allegory with Venus and Cupid,” is actually Bronzino’s, 
and it was completed around 1545. It centers on a kiss between Venus
and her son Cupid– but it’s been subtly altered. When London’s National Gallery
acquired it in 1860, the Gallery’s director deemed it 
too risqué for Victorian England. So, he commissioned a restorer to obscure
Venus’s tongue and nipple. A century after this modification, art conservators analyzed and removed
the overpainting with select solvents. In the process, they also realized 
that the veil covering Venus’s crotch and the branch hiding Cupid’s posterior
were other add-ons. Removing two layers of censorship
from the painting, it was finally free to boast
its provocative original details. This massive painting called 
“The Night Watch” was completed by Rembrandt in 1642. Since then, it’s endured one
dramatic amputation, two stabbings, an acid attack, and centuries of grime. A museum guard immediately neutralized
the acid with water. Restorers lifted the grime, revealing that the painting was
not set at night, and healed the slashes using adhesive
and extra canvas backing. But they faced an even trickier problem. In 1715, strips were removed
from all sides of the canvas, including two whole feet from the left,
to fit it inside Amsterdam’s Town Hall. They've been lost ever since. But a multi-year conservation project that began in 2019 
replaced the missing pieces. They managed this by training
an artificial intelligence to digitally paint in Rembrandt’s style. Then, using another artist’s rendering
of the original, the program recreated and printed
the painting’s lost sections. Finally, the team returned 
“The Night Watch” to its full size, with AI-generated best guesses
to fill in the blanks. All of these paintings had been altered,
but none of them were irrevocably ruined. With painstaking scientific analysis
and technical skill, art conservators immortalize
priceless artifacts. They counteract sudden damage
and creeping threats— and sometimes, they perform near miracles. This video was made possible with support

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Beginning in the 3rd century,
before the coming era, the Romans conquered
the Iberian Peninsula. This period gave rise to several regional
languages in the area that's now Spain, including Castilian, Catalan and Galician. One of these would become Spanish—
but not for another 1,500 years. Those years tell the origin story 
of what’s become a global modern language. During the Roman occupation, colloquial spoken Latin, 
often called “Vulgar Latin,” mixed with Indigenous languages. Approximately 75% of modern Spanish comes
from Latin, including syntactic rules. For instance, verbs are conjugated
in a similar way as in Latin. And like other Roman languages, 
nouns have gender: el sol, the sun, is masculine, 
whereas la luna, the moon, is feminine. After the Roman Empire collapsed, a series of other powers conquered 
the region. First came the Visigoths starting 
in the 5th century of the common era. They spoke an eastern Germanic language that would eventually become 
part of German and lent a few words to the language
that would become Spanish. Then the Umayyad Caliphate
ousted the Visigoths. They spoke Arabic, which left 
a strong mark on modern Spanish: over a thousand words come from Arabic. These often have a starting 
“a” or “z” sound, and sometimes include an “h.” In 1492, the Catholic Church consolidated
its power through two monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand, expelling Muslims and Jews, combining the distinct regional kingdoms
into one nation, and adopting one of the local languages 
as the official state language. That language was Castellano,
or Castilian, from the Kingdom of Castile, which was centrally located in Spain
and home to Madrid. Thereafter Castellano became Español,
or Spanish. But the Spanish of 1492 was Old Spanish,
very different from Spanish today. That same year, Christopher Columbus
sailed across the Atlantic Ocean, marking the start of the Spanish conquest
of the Americas. The Indigenous population of the Americas spoke an estimated 
2,000 different languages. Over the next few decades, most of them were forced to adopt Spanish
at the expense of their own languages. Still, words from Indigenous languages
became part of Spanish. From Nahuatl, 
the language of the Aztec Empire, came words with “ch” and “y”
like “chapulin” and “coyote.” From Quechua, 
a language spoken in the Peruvian Andes, came words with “ch”
like “cancha,” “chullo,” and “poncho.” Some of these words describe things that hadn’t existed in the Spanish lexicon
before, while others replaced existing
Spanish words even in Spain. By the time Miguel de Cervantes published
the first part of “Don Quixote” in 1605, the language was arguably more similar 
to modern Spanish than plays of one of his contemporaries, 
William Shakespeare, were to modern English. Starting in the 18th century, French language and culture were
extremely fashionable in Spain, and later Hispanic America. While the two languages already had
commonalities from their shared roots in Latin, Spanish gained new words from French
during this period. In the 19th century, 
all over Central and South America, people revolted to gain independence 
from Spain. In the newly sovereign nations, people continued to speak the language
of their former oppressors. Today, there are approximately 415 million
inhabitants of Hispanic America. Spanish is the official language 
of 21 countries and Puerto Rico. As of 2021, only English, Mandarin,
and Hindi have more speakers. How does a language with so many
speakers around the world not break apart into new languages
the way Vulgar Latin did? There's no easy answer to this question. Other languages that spread 
through colonialism, like French, have mixed with Indigenous languages 
to form entirely new ones. Some would argue that Spanglish,
a mixture of Spanish and English, is a distinct language 
or on its way to becoming one. But although a person in Buenos Aires
occasionally might use words that aren’t fully intelligible to someone
in Bogotá or Mexico City, Spanish retains enough unity 
of syntax, grammar, and vocabulary to remain one language.

**Transcript**:
In 2010, South Korea experienced
a particularly cold winter. People couldn't activate their smartphones
while wearing gloves, so they began wielding snack sausages— causing one company to see 
a 40% rise in sausage sales. So, what could sausages do
that gloves couldn’t? In other words, 
how do touchscreens actually work? In 1965, the first ever touchscreen 
was invented to help British air traffic controllers
efficiently update flight plans. However, the technology was too unwieldy
and expensive for widespread use. Over the following decades, engineers further developed
this technology and experimented with alternative
kinds of touchscreens. Soon, resistive touchscreens
dominated the market. But then, in 2007, Apple released
the first iPhone. It was a breakthrough, yet it functioned
using the same principle as the first touchscreen: capacitance. Nowadays, capacitive and resistive 
touchscreens are two of the most common types. Both use an external input 
to complete their electric circuits. In conductive materials, 
electrons flow around atoms, forming an electric current. In contrast to insulators, the electrons in conductors are
weakly bound and flow easily. A resistive touchscreen has two layers. The top is a clear, flexible material—
usually plastic— while the bottom is something rigid,
like glass. These layers are coated 
with a conductive substance and separated by a thin gap. When something pushes
hard enough, the layers connect, completing the electric circuit. This causes a change in voltage 
that the machine’s software reacts to. Resistive touchscreens can
be a little unresponsive, but they're generally cheap and durable, so they're favored for industrial
or mass use. A vast majority of the touchscreens
produced in 2007 were resistive. But in the years following 
the iPhone’s release, most became capacitive. Individual models vary, 
but smartphone touchscreens today typically consist of a protective, 
insulating glass exterior and an LCD screen at the bottom 
that produces the images you see. Between the glass exterior 
and the LCD screen are several sheets. One is lined with rows of a transparent,
conductive material that carry an alternating 
electric current. A thin insulating layer separates these
conductive lines from others that are arranged as columns. One on top of the other, 
the lines form a grid. The points where they intersect
are called nodes. The phone's battery draws electrons
along the first layer of lines, and some electrons accumulate 
at every node, creating a small electric field. These screens are called 
capacitive touchscreens because the nodes act like capacitors
by storing charge. They’re generally easier to use
than resistive touchscreens because they interact directly with your
finger without the application of force. Your body is a great conductor and is
constantly transmitting electric currents. Why? Because about 60% of you is water. Now, while chemically pure water 
is an insulator, most water is impure. The water inside you is loaded with ions— atoms or molecules that have
a net electrical charge. So when you click on an app, your finger
functions like a third electrical line. It interacts with the existing
electric field, which induces a weak electric current
that travels through your finger and eventually back into the phone. This changes the amount of charge
at the affected nodes. And voltage measurements along
the second layer of lines tell the phone’s microprocessor which
part of the screen is being touched. However, if you try using a smartphone
while your hands are wet or gloved, you'll probably have some trouble. Both interrupt the electrical connection
between your finger and phone. If water is splashed across the screen,
it might trigger many underlying nodes, and the phone could act like you’ve 
touched it in multiple places at once. On the other hand, gloves are insulators,
so the charge has nowhere to go. Meanwhile, objects that conduct
electricity about as well as your finger— like banana peels 
and certain processed meats— can all activate the screen— knowledge that can come in clutch,
when you’re in a pickle.

**Transcript**:
In 2010, South Korea experienced
a particularly cold winter. People couldn't activate their smartphones
while wearing gloves, so they began wielding snack sausages— causing one company to see 
a 40% rise in sausage sales. So, what could sausages do
that gloves couldn’t? In other words, 
how do touchscreens actually work? In 1965, the first ever touchscreen 
was invented to help British air traffic controllers
efficiently update flight plans. However, the technology was too unwieldy
and expensive for widespread use. Over the following decades, engineers further developed
this technology and experimented with alternative
kinds of touchscreens. Soon, resistive touchscreens
dominated the market. But then, in 2007, Apple released
the first iPhone. It was a breakthrough, yet it functioned
using the same principle as the first touchscreen: capacitance. Nowadays, capacitive and resistive 
touchscreens are two of the most common types. Both use an external input 
to complete their electric circuits. In conductive materials, 
electrons flow around atoms, forming an electric current. In contrast to insulators, the electrons in conductors are
weakly bound and flow easily. A resistive touchscreen has two layers. The top is a clear, flexible material—
usually plastic— while the bottom is something rigid,
like glass. These layers are coated

**Transcript**:
In the middle of Florida’s 
Apalachicola National Forest, a bizarre, almost magical scene 
is unraveling. Sliding a metal strip over a wooden stake, a master summoner is sending deep croaking
noises reverberating through the area. And, as if in a trance, hundreds of earthworms 
begin emerging from the soil. This is worm grunting, also called
worm charming or fiddling. It’s a tradition that’s been practiced
for more than a century, but its inner workings were 
a mystery until only recently. Worms collectively undertaking
an underground exodus seems especially unbelievable when you
consider how vulnerable this makes them. So why is surfacing worth the risk? Over the years, people have proposed
a number of imaginative hypotheses. One was that worms were somehow
charmed by the noise, like the rats from the medieval
Pied Piper legend. Okay, sounds fun, but how would 
the worms actually become bewitched? Another hypothesis was that worm grunting
tickled their bodies, so they emerged to end the aggravation. Whimsical! But worm grunting vibrates
the ground’s surface. If worms were evading the vibrations,
wouldn't they burrow deeper instead? Perhaps the most popular hypothesis was
that worm grunting mimicked falling rain and the worms fled to avoid drowning. In 2008, biologist Kenneth Catania
tested this hypothesis, setting up three arenas filled with soil and 300 individuals of the large species 
of earthworm found in the Florida Panhandle. After an hour of rain, 
water had pooled at the surface, but only two earthworms emerged. The rest remained buried and healthy. So, unlike those containers, 
this hypothesis just didn’t hold water. Catania decided to explore
another route of inquiry. In 1881, Charles Darwin published
his final work, a bestseller that rivaled his
most well-known books at the time: “The Formation of Vegetable Mould,
Through the Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits.” Yes, it was literally called that— and it was the culmination of 40 years
of earthworm investigations. Within it, Darwin noted that worms
sometimes left their burrows when the ground trembled 
and mentioned an interesting hypothesis: maybe they flee because they believe
they’re being pursued by moles. Catania got to work testing
this hypothesis himself. He found that Eastern moles had
astounding tracking abilities, could eat their weight in worms every day, and were abundant 
in the Florida Panhandle. When Catania released a single mole 
into worm- and soil-filled arenas, about 30% of the worms crawled 
to the surface in the first hour— a markedly different result 
from the control and rain trials. And when he recorded 
the vibrations produced by worm grunters and moles digging, their frequencies 
overlapped substantially. This was it. Over hundreds of thousands of years, these earthworms evolved a behavior
that helped them escape a top predator. Aboveground, they were immune
to the moles, which usually stayed subterranean. But then humans came along. And, funnily enough, we aren’t even
the only ones that take advantage of this behavior. Herring gulls and wood turtles also 
sometimes drum their feet on the earth to summon worms. So then why does this behavior persist? Scientists think it’s beneficial 
for a prey species to maintain its adaptations 
against a more frequent predator, even if it makes it more vulnerable 
to a rarer one. Many insects, for example, 
use flight to avoid predation. But painted redstarts take
advantage of this: they boldly flash their colorful tail 
and wing feathers to elicit this response, then catch the insects 
as they try to fly away. It seems the prey species’ response 
remains simply because it’s beneficial 
most of the time. For over a century, humans
in the southern US, the UK, and elsewhere have been unknowingly exploiting 
the worm’s escape response. The current world record 
for “most worms charmed” was set by a 10-year-old 
British girl in 2009. Wiggling a fork in the ground 
and hitting it with a stick, she made 567 worms surface 
in just 30 minutes. Charming, really.

the worms actually become bewitched? Another hypothesis was that worm grunting
tickled their bodies, so they emerged to end the aggravation. Whimsical! But worm grunting vibrates
the ground’s surface. If worms were evading the vibrations,
wouldn't they burrow deeper instead? Perhaps the most popular hypothesis was
that worm grunting mimicked falling rain and the worms fled to avoid drowning. In 2008, biologist Kenneth Catania
tested this hypothesis, setting up three arenas filled with soil and 300 individuals of the large species 
of earthworm found in the Florida Panhandle. After an hour of rain, 
water had pooled at the surface, but only two earthworms emerged. The rest remained buried and healthy. So, unlike those containers, 
this hypothesis just didn’t hold water. Catania decided to explore
another route of inquiry. In 1881, Charles Darwin published
his final work, a bestseller that rivaled his
most well-known books at the time: “The Formation of Vegetable Mould,
Through the Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits.” Yes, it was literally called that— and it was the culmination of 40 years
of earthworm investigations. Within it, Darwin noted that worms
sometimes left their burrows when the ground trembled 
and mentioned an interesting hypothesis: maybe they flee because they believe
they’re being pursued by moles. Catania got to work testing
this hypothesis himself. He found that Eastern moles had
astounding tracking abilities, could eat their weight in worms every day, and were abundant 
in the Florida Panhandle. When Catania released a single mole 
into worm- and soil-filled arenas, about 30% of the worms crawled 
to the surface in the first hour— a markedly different result 
from the control and rain trials. And when he recorded 
the vibrations produced by worm grunters and moles digging, their frequencies 
overlapped substantially. This was it. Over hundreds of thousands of years, these earthworms evolved a behavior
that helped them escape a top predator. Aboveground, they were immune
to the moles, which usually stayed subterranean. But then humans came along. And, funnily enough, we aren’t even
the only ones that take advantage of this behavior. Herring gulls and wood turtles also 
sometimes drum their feet on the earth to summon worms. So then why does this behavior persist? Scientists think it’s beneficial 
for a prey species to maintain its adaptations 
against a more frequent predator, even if it makes it more vulnerable 
to a rarer one. Many insects, for example, 
use flight to avoid predation. But painted redstarts take
advantage of this: they boldly flash their colorful tail 
and wing feathers to elicit this response, then catch the insects 
as they try to fly away. It seems the prey species’ response 
remains simply because it’s beneficial 
most of the time. For over a century, humans
in the southern US, the UK, and elsewhere have been unknowingly exploiting 
the worm’s escape response. The current world record 
for “most worms charmed” was set by a 10-year-old 
British girl in 2009. Wiggling a fork in the ground 
and hitting it with a stick, she made 567 worms surface 
in just 30 minutes. Charming, really.

**Transcript**:
Gold is one of Earth’s most
valuable resources, with one kilogram regularly valued
at over 55,000 US dollars. In 2020, Mali produced an estimated
71.2 tons of gold. But Mali only saw $850 million 
from gold in 2020, when that amount is worth billions, not to mention that the country likely 
produced much more than the reported 71.2 tons. The situation isn’t unique: a number of other gold-rich countries
in Africa, including Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, 
Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Niger also aren’t seeing the income they should,
given the price of gold. The force behind this is greed on an individual, corporate, 
and national scale, and a corrupt system 
that perpetuates itself. Although Mali has abundant gold, the country lacks the infrastructure
to mine and export it. So the government allows multinational
corporations to apply for licenses to mine gold in exchange
for taxes paid to Mali’s government. These taxes should, theoretically,
finance development, like building the infrastructure 
to mine gold, improve the economy, and provide citizens with public goods
like healthcare and education. Tax money alone isn’t enough
to do these things, of course: a government also has to be invested 
in its people’s well-being, and government corruption
can prevent progress. But without adequate funds, even the best intentioned government 
doesn’t stand a chance of improving circumstances 
for its citizens. Foreign corporations exploit 
Mali’s need for tax revenue to get the government to sign on to very
unfavorable yet perfectly legal contracts. For example, one such contract stated 
that no corporate taxes would be owed for the first five years, 
costing Mali millions in tax revenue. Meanwhile, mining licenses sometimes allow
these corporations to take samples of gold out of the country 
without registering them or paying taxes on them. These should be small amounts of gold 
used to test for quality, but the license doesn’t limit
the size of samples, so this creates a loophole where corporations export large
amounts of gold without paying any tax. The multinational corporations are 
also evading taxes they are legally required to pay. They filter profits through a labyrinth 
of tax havens that’s difficult to trace. Or they exaggerate their expenses 
so they end up owing very little in taxes. For instance, a corporation in Mali uses
a subsidiary in Ireland to manage its operations
and another subsidiary in the Netherlands to license its brand name. The corporation in Mali pays 
management fees to the Irish subsidiary and pays intellectual property license
fees to the Dutch company, all for enormous sums. These costs are deducted 
from overall profits, leaving the amount subject 
to taxes at a bare minimum. These companies also buy gold
on the black market. Local, small-scale miners often operate
without a license, so the government is unaware
of how much gold they mine. Corporations buy gold from these miners, avoiding the cost of mining 
the gold themselves, and pay the miners far below market value. Then they turn around and tell
the government they incurred huge expenses 
mining gold they didn’t mine at all. There’s no way for Mali’s revenue 
authority to verify this information, causing the country to lose
even more tax money. Similarly, corporations pay corrupt
government officials to help them smuggle gold across borders,
primarily to the United Arab Emirates, rather than operating 
through legal channels. In 2016, Mali reported around $200 million
of exported gold, but the UAE reported receiving slightly
over $1.5 billion of imported gold from Mali that same year. The gold is then sold to European, 
American, and Asian markets from the UAE, with no questions asked about its origins. Similar patterns can be seen 
with gold-rich countries across Africa, indicating that gold smuggling 
is happening on a massive scale, without ever being subject to taxes. All of this creates a vicious cycle, forcing a continued reliance on the corporations that helped create
the situation in the first place. More than half of Mali’s citizens live 
below the international poverty line, while their nation’s wealth lines
the pockets of foreign corporations and corrupt officials.

American, and Asian markets from the UAE, with no questions asked about its origins. Similar patterns can be seen 
with gold-rich countries across Africa, indicating that gold smuggling

**Transcript**:
Gold is one of Earth’s most
valuable resources, with one kilogram regularly valued
at over 55,000 US dollars. In 2020, Mali produced an estimated
71.2 tons of gold. But Mali only saw $850 million 
from gold in 2020, when that amount is worth billions, not to mention that the country likely 
produced much more than the reported 71.2 tons. The situation isn’t unique: a number of other gold-rich countries
in Africa, including Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, 
Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Niger also aren’t seeing the income they should,
given the price of gold. The force behind this is greed on an individual, corporate, 
and national scale, and a corrupt system 
that perpetuates itself. Although Mali has abundant gold, the country lacks the infrastructure
to mine and export it. So the government allows multinational
corporations to apply for licenses to mine gold in exchange
for taxes paid to Mali’s government. These taxes should, theoretically,
finance development, like building the infrastructure 
to mine gold, improve the economy, and provide citizens with public goods
like healthcare and education. Tax money alone isn’t enough
to do these things, of course: a government also has to be invested 
in its people’s well-being, and government corruption
can prevent progress. But without adequate funds, even the best intentioned government 
doesn’t stand a chance of improving circumstances 
for its citizens. Foreign corporations exploit 
Mali’s need for tax revenue to get the government to sign on to very
unfavorable yet perfectly legal contracts. For example, one such contract stated 
that no corporate taxes would be owed for the first five years, 
costing Mali millions in tax revenue. Meanwhile, mining licenses sometimes allow
these corporations to take samples of gold out of the country 
without registering them or paying taxes on them. These should be small amounts of gold 
used to test for quality, but the license doesn’t limit
the size of samples, so this creates a loophole where corporations export large
amounts of gold without paying any tax. The multinational corporations are 
also evading taxes they are legally required to pay. They filter profits through a labyrinth 
of tax havens that’s difficult to trace. Or they exaggerate their expenses 
so they end up owing very little in taxes. For instance, a corporation in Mali uses
a subsidiary in Ireland to manage its operations
and another subsidiary in the Netherlands to license its brand name. The corporation in Mali pays 
management fees to the Irish subsidiary and pays intellectual property license
fees to the Dutch company, all for enormous sums. These costs are deducted 
from overall profits, leaving the amount subject 
to taxes at a bare minimum. These companies also buy gold
on the black market. Local, small-scale miners often operate
without a license, so the government is unaware
of how much gold they mine. Corporations buy gold from these miners, avoiding the cost of mining 
the gold themselves, and pay the miners far below market value. Then they turn around and tell
the government they incurred huge expenses 
mining gold they didn’t mine at all. There’s no way for Mali’s revenue 
authority to verify this information, causing the country to lose
even more tax money. Similarly, corporations pay corrupt
government officials to help them smuggle gold across borders,
primarily to the United Arab Emirates, rather than operating 
through legal channels. In 2016, Mali reported around $200 million
of exported gold, but the UAE reported receiving slightly
over $1.5 billion of imported gold from Mali that same year. The gold is then sold to European, 
American, and Asian markets from the UAE, with no questions asked about its origins. Similar patterns can be seen 
with gold-rich countries across Africa, indicating that gold smuggling 
is happening on a massive scale, without ever being subject to taxes. All of this creates a vicious cycle, forcing a continued reliance on the corporations that helped create
the situation in the first place. More than half of Mali’s citizens live 
below the international poverty line, while their nation’s wealth lines

**Transcript**:
In January of 1995, Russia detected
a nuclear missile headed its way. The alert went all the way
to the president, who was deciding whether to strike back when another system contradicted
the initial warning. What they thought was the first missile
in a massive attack was actually a research rocket
studying the Northern Lights. This incident happened 
after the end of the Cold War, but was nevertheless one of the closest
calls we’ve had to igniting a global nuclear war. With the invention of the atomic bomb, humanity gained the power to destroy
itself for the first time in our history. Since then, our existential risk— risk of either extinction or the unrecoverable collapse 
of human civilization— has steadily increased. It’s well within our power
to reduce this risk, but in order to do so, we have to understand which 
of our activities pose existential threats now, 
and which might in the future. So far, our species has survived
2,000 centuries, each with some extinction risk
from natural causes— asteroid impacts, supervolcanoes,
and the like. Assessing existential risk is 
an inherently uncertain business because usually when we try to figure out
how likely something is, we check how often it's happened before. But the complete destruction of humanity
has never happened before. While there’s no perfect method to
determine our risk from natural threats, experts estimate it’s about 
1 in 10,000 per century. Nuclear weapons were our first
addition to that baseline. While there are many risks associated
with nuclear weapons, the existential risk comes
from the possibility of a global nuclear war that leads
to a nuclear winter, where soot from burning cities
blocks out the sun for years, causing the crops that humanity
depends on to fail. We haven't had a nuclear war yet, but our track record is too short to tell
if they’re inherently unlikely or we’ve simply been lucky. We also can’t say for sure whether a global nuclear war
would cause a nuclear winter so severe it would pose an existential threat
to humanity. The next major addition to our existential
risk was climate change. Like nuclear war, 
climate change could result in a lot of terrible scenarios 
that we should be working hard to avoid, but that would stop short of causing
extinction or unrecoverable collapse. We expect a few degrees
Celsius of warming, but can’t yet completely 
rule out 6 or even 10 degrees, which would cause a calamity of possibly
unprecedented proportions. Even in this worst-case scenario, it’s not clear whether warming would pose
a direct existential risk, but the disruption it would cause
would likely make us more vulnerable to other existential risks. The greatest risks may come 
from technologies that are still emerging. Take engineered pandemics. The biggest catastrophes in human history
have been from pandemics. And biotechnology is enabling
us to modify and create germs that could be much more deadly
than naturally occurring ones. Such germs could cause pandemics 
through biowarfare and research accidents. Decreased costs of genome sequencing
and modification, along with increased availability
of potentially dangerous information like the published genomes 
of deadly viruses, also increase the number of people
and groups who could potentially create
such pathogens. Another concern is unaligned AI. Most AI researchers think this will be
the century where we develop artificial intelligence
that surpasses human abilities across the board. If we cede this advantage, we place
our future in the hands of the systems we create. Even if created solely with humanity’s 
best interests in mind, superintelligent AI could pose 
an existential risk if it isn’t perfectly aligned 
with human values— a task scientists are finding
extremely difficult. Based on what we know at this point, some experts estimate the anthropogenic
existential risk is more than 100 times higher 
than the background rate of natural risk. But these odds depend heavily
on human choices. Because most of the risk is from human
action, and it’s within human control. If we treat safeguarding humanity's future
as the defining issue of our time, we can reduce this risk. Whether humanity fulfils its potential— or not— is in our hands.

**Transcript**:
In January of 1995, Russia detected
a nuclear missile headed its way. The alert went all the way
to the president, who was deciding whether to strike back when another system contradicted
the initial warning. What they thought was the first missile
in a massive attack was actually a research rocket
studying the Northern Lights. This incident happened 
after the end of the Cold War, but was nevertheless one of the closest
calls we’ve had to igniting a global nuclear war. With the invention of the atomic bomb, humanity gained the power to destroy
itself for the first time in our history. Since then, our existential risk— risk of either extinction or the unrecoverable collapse 
of human civilization— has steadily increased. It’s well within our power
to reduce this risk, but in order to do so, we have to understand which 
of our activities pose existential threats now, 
and which might in the future. So far, our species has survived
2,000 centuries, each with some extinction risk
from natural causes— asteroid impacts, supervolcanoes,
and the like. Assessing existential risk is 
an inherently uncertain business because usually when we try to figure out
how likely something is, we check how often it's happened before. But the complete destruction of humanity
has never happened before. While there’s no perfect method to
determine our risk from natural threats, experts estimate it’s about 
1 in 10,000 per century. Nuclear weapons were our first
addition to that baseline. While there are many risks associated
with nuclear weapons, the existential risk comes
from the possibility of a global nuclear war that leads
to a nuclear winter, where soot from burning cities
blocks out the sun for years, causing the crops that humanity
depends on to fail. We haven't had a nuclear war yet, but our track record is too short to tell
if they’re inherently unlikely or we’ve simply been lucky. We also can’t say for sure whether a global nuclear war
would cause a nuclear winter so severe it would pose an existential threat
to humanity. The next major addition to our existential
risk was climate change. Like nuclear war, 
climate change could result in a lot of terrible scenarios 
that we should be working hard to avoid, but that would stop short of causing
extinction or unrecoverable collapse. We expect a few degrees
Celsius of warming, but can’t yet completely 
rule out 6 or even 10 degrees, which would cause a calamity of possibly
unprecedented proportions. Even in this worst-case scenario, it’s not clear whether warming would pose
a direct existential risk, but the disruption it would cause
would likely make us more vulnerable to other existential risks. The greatest risks may come 
from technologies that are still emerging. Take engineered pandemics. The biggest catastrophes in human history
have been from pandemics. And biotechnology is enabling
us to modify and create germs that could be much more deadly
than naturally occurring ones. Such germs could cause pandemics 
through biowarfare and research accidents. Decreased costs of genome sequencing
and modification, along with increased availability
of potentially dangerous information like the published genomes 
of deadly viruses, also increase the number of people
and groups who could potentially create
such pathogens. Another concern is unaligned AI. Most AI researchers think this will be
the century where we develop artificial intelligence
that surpasses human abilities across the board. If we cede this advantage, we place
our future in the hands of the systems we create. Even if created solely with humanity’s 
best interests in mind, superintelligent AI could pose 
an existential risk if it isn’t perfectly aligned 
with human values— a task scientists are finding
extremely difficult. Based on what we know at this point, some experts estimate the anthropogenic
existential risk is more than 100 times higher 
than the background rate of natural risk. But these odds depend heavily
on human choices. Because most of the risk is from human
action, and it’s within human control. If we treat safeguarding humanity's future
as the defining issue of our time, we can reduce this risk. Whether humanity fulfils its potential— or not— is in our hands.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The vagina harbors hundreds of different
kinds of microorganisms. Some tend to be especially prevalent,
like Lactobacilli. These bacteria produce an acid 
that lowers the vagina’s pH, limiting what can survive there and
preventing against certain infections. Candida yeasts are also usually present
in small quantities. Most of the time, 
these fungi are harmless. The body’s immune system keeps them 
in check while other microorganisms, like Lactobacilli, combat and outcompete
them for nutrients and territory. But under certain conditions, 
Candida yeasts can cause infections. One species in particular,
called Candida albicans, is the usual culprit of vaginal thrush
or yeast infections, which affect 3 out of every 4 people 
with a vagina. So, how exactly does a yeast
infection happen? Candida albicans yeasts are shapeshifters. And when the balance within the vagina
is disrupted— like the pH increases or there are 
fewer microbes to compete with— Candida albicans may assume 
their disease-causing forms. They multiply and metamorphose— substituting their rounded structures for elongated thread-like forms 
called hyphae. Then, they secrete enzymes that degrade
the epithelial cells lining the vagina and permeate the tissue. Immune cells rush to the site, generating some of the most recognizable
symptoms of yeast infections: itching, burning, swelling, and redness. These may also be accompanied
by a change in vaginal discharge, the fluid that’s frequently flushed from
the vagina to keep it healthy and clean. During a yeast infection,
discharge may become thicker and whiter because the vagina is shedding 
more epithelial and Candida cells. A few major factors, like 
antibiotic treatments and lower immunity, can make people more susceptible 
to vaginal yeast infections. When someone’s immune system is
compromised, from illness or otherwise, their body may be unable to control
Candida effectively. And in treating bacterial infections,
antibiotics kill harmful bacteria, but they can also wipe out beneficial 
ones, like Lactobacilli, allowing Candida to multiply more easily. Many other factors also help set
the stage for yeast infections. Hormonal changes and diet alter
the vaginal microbiome. Semen is relatively basic, 
so it can disrupt the vagina’s pH. Tight, non-breathable, and wet garments
incubate moisture and are thought to facilitate
a more Candida-friendly environment. Soaps can damage the protective
mucus that coats the vagina, making it easier for Candida to permeate. That’s why many doctors recommend
just gently washing the vulva with water. And it’s important to wipe 
from front to back to avoid introducing more Candida as well 
as other potentially harmful microbes to the vagina. Most yeast infections are mild 
and clear up within two weeks. Antifungal medications usually offer
dependable treatments by reducing the number of Candida cells, allowing the immune system and 
other microorganisms to regain control. And interestingly, the solution 
to treating some yeast infections could be more yeasts. Preliminary studies with probiotics 
containing the harmless yeasts we use in brewing and baking have shown 
promise in keeping Candida in check while reducing inflammation. But some yeast infections
require more extensive therapies. About 5 to 10% of people with vaginas experience at least 4 yeast infections 
a year. For some of those, 
the cause seems to be genetic. Some people have gene variants that make
it harder for their immune systems to recognize and regulate Candida cells. But why many others have recurrent
infections is currently unclear— and requires a lot more research. In fact, so does basically everything
we've just talked about. We don’t know nearly enough 
about the vaginal microbiome. This is probably because of stigma
and underfunding when it comes to topics that traditionally
fall under the umbrella of “women’s health.” For instance, while erectile dysfunction
affects a much smaller percentage of people than vaginal yeast infections, there’s about 6 times more
research on the subject. Hopefully, we’ll soon have
a better understanding of the many microorganismal multitudes 
we contain— and how best to keep them in balance.

infections is currently unclear— and requires a lot more research. In fact, so does basically everything
we've just talked about. We don’t know nearly enough 
about the vaginal microbiome. This is probably because of stigma
and underfunding when it comes to topics that traditionally

affects a much smaller percentage of people than vaginal yeast infections, there’s about 6 times more
research on the subject. Hopefully, we’ll soon have
a better understanding of the many microorganismal multitudes 
we contain— and how best to keep them in balance.

**Transcript**:
The vagina harbors hundreds of different
kinds of microorganisms. Some tend to be especially prevalent,
like Lactobacilli. These bacteria produce an acid 
that lowers the vagina’s pH, limiting what can survive there and
preventing against certain infections. Candida yeasts are also usually present
in small quantities. Most of the time, 
these fungi are harmless. The body’s immune system keeps them 
in check while other microorganisms, like Lactobacilli, combat and outcompete
them for nutrients and territory. But under certain conditions, 
Candida yeasts can cause infections. One species in particular,
called Candida albicans, is the usual culprit of vaginal thrush
or yeast infections, which affect 3 out of every 4 people 
with a vagina. So, how exactly does a yeast
infection happen? Candida albicans yeasts are shapeshifters. And when the balance within the vagina
is disrupted— like the pH increases or there are 
fewer microbes to compete with— Candida albicans may assume 
their disease-causing forms. They multiply and metamorphose— substituting their rounded structures for elongated thread-like forms 
called hyphae. Then, they secrete enzymes that degrade
the epithelial cells lining the vagina and permeate the tissue. Immune cells rush to the site, generating some of the most recognizable
symptoms of yeast infections: itching, burning, swelling, and redness. These may also be accompanied
by a change in vaginal discharge, the fluid that’s frequently flushed from
the vagina to keep it healthy and clean. During a yeast infection,
discharge may become thicker and whiter because the vagina is shedding 
more epithelial and Candida cells. A few major factors, like 
antibiotic treatments and lower immunity, can make people more susceptible 
to vaginal yeast infections. When someone’s immune system is
compromised, from illness or otherwise, their body may be unable to control
Candida effectively. And in treating bacterial infections,
antibiotics kill harmful bacteria, but they can also wipe out beneficial 
ones, like Lactobacilli, allowing Candida to multiply more easily. Many other factors also help set
the stage for yeast infections. Hormonal changes and diet alter
the vaginal microbiome. Semen is relatively basic, 
so it can disrupt the vagina’s pH. Tight, non-breathable, and wet garments
incubate moisture and are thought to facilitate
a more Candida-friendly environment. Soaps can damage the protective
mucus that coats the vagina, making it easier for Candida to permeate. That’s why many doctors recommend
just gently washing the vulva with water. And it’s important to wipe 
from front to back to avoid introducing more Candida as well 
as other potentially harmful microbes to the vagina. Most yeast infections are mild 
and clear up within two weeks. Antifungal medications usually offer
dependable treatments by reducing the number of Candida cells, allowing the immune system and 
other microorganisms to regain control. And interestingly, the solution 
to treating some yeast infections could be more yeasts. Preliminary studies with probiotics 
containing the harmless yeasts we use in brewing and baking have shown 
promise in keeping Candida in check while reducing inflammation. But some yeast infections
require more extensive therapies. About 5 to 10% of people with vaginas experience at least 4 yeast infections 
a year. For some of those, 
the cause seems to be genetic. Some people have gene variants that make
it harder for their immune systems to recognize and regulate Candida cells. But why many others have recurrent
infections is currently unclear— and requires a lot more research. In fact, so does basically everything

**Transcript**:
As the truck screeched to a halt,
one of its containers slid off, hit an approaching Prius 
and spilled its contents. Those contents happened to be thousands
of kilograms of live hagfish, also known as slime eels. The result of this 2017 car accident 
was an absolute mess: the highway was littered 
with wriggling fish and coated in a thick slime that took 
the fire department 7 hours to clear. Astonishingly good looks aside, the standout strength of all hagfishes
is their slime. In fact, they’re probably 
Earth’s slimiest animals. But why be so slimy? Watch and learn. This hagfish has detected a dead fish
using its keen sense of smell and the tastebud-like organs 
dotting its skin. Revealing imposing rows of toothlike
structures, it takes the first bite. A shark glides on to the scene
and suddenly lunges. Being caught in the shark’s powerful jaws
may seem like a guaranteed death sentence, but the hagfish has some tricks 
up its sleeve. The shark’s teeth clench down
but there are no bones to crush— only flexible cartilage. And because the hagfish’s skin is so 
loosely attached to the rest of its body, the pressure from the bite causes the hagfish’s essential organs
to slip out of the way, avoiding damage. This is where being a noodle 
in a baggy wetsuit really pays off. Meanwhile, the hagfish also actively
repels the shark by spewing a stupendous supply of slime. Around a hundred slime glands
line each side of the hagfish’s body. Within them are mucus and thread cells. The mucus cells are packed with hundreds
of vesicles of condensed mucus while each thread cell contains 
an intricately coiled protein fiber. The hagfish contracts the muscles
surrounding some of its slime glands, causing the cells to eject their contents
into the seawater. In a fraction of a second, 
the mucus vesicles swell and burst, and the protein fibers unravel. Together, they expand to 10,000 times
their original volume, instantly creating liters of slime. Because the substance is composed of mucus and reinforced with numerous superfine 
and strong silk-like fibers, the slime is incredibly soft yet tough. It lodges in the shark’s delicate gills, and as the shark chokes 
and tries to clear the slime, it releases the hagfish. Now, the hagfish is free 
from the jaws of death. But it’s in a dilemma of its own doing, trapped in a cloud of its own
suffocating slime. So what does it do? Well, it ties itself in a knot, of course. Starting at its tail 
and passing its body through, the hagfish effectively wipes away
its own slime. Apparently unfazed by the whole encounter, it returns to its meal. When it gets to a tougher part 
of the carcass... Voila! The hagfish ties itself 
in yet another knot to gain leverage and yank off the meat. The hagfish’s slime is so remarkable
that people are trying to emulate it. Currently, a lot of athletic 
and safety gear is made from non-renewable
petroleum-based fibers. But hagfish slime threads rival 
the properties of materials like nylon. And fibers modeled after those 
in hagfish slime may present a much more sustainable alternative. Meanwhile, hagfish slime is also being 
explored in military contexts as a non-lethal weapon that could be used
to stop boats by sliming up their propellers. In addition to mastering
the art of slime and knot-tying, hagfish have four little hearts and can survive 36 hours 
without oxygen unscathed. Oh, and they also clean the seafloor and cycle essential nutrients 
in the deep sea. Proto-hagfish were navigating
the ocean’s depths more than 300 million years ago— before dinosaurs roamed 
and back when Pangea was still a thing. Having persisted through multiple
mass extinction events, hagfish have just about seen it all. And it would appear that they’re still
having a wonderful slime.

**Transcript**:
As the truck screeched to a halt,
one of its containers slid off, hit an approaching Prius 
and spilled its contents. Those contents happened to be thousands
of kilograms of live hagfish, also known as slime eels. The result of this 2017 car accident 
was an absolute mess: the highway was littered 
with wriggling fish and coated in a thick slime that took 
the fire department 7 hours to clear. Astonishingly good looks aside, the standout strength of all hagfishes
is their slime. In fact, they’re probably 
Earth’s slimiest animals. But why be so slimy? Watch and learn. This hagfish has detected a dead fish
using its keen sense of smell and the tastebud-like organs 
dotting its skin. Revealing imposing rows of toothlike
structures, it takes the first bite. A shark glides on to the scene
and suddenly lunges. Being caught in the shark’s powerful jaws
may seem like a guaranteed death sentence, but the hagfish has some tricks 
up its sleeve. The shark’s teeth clench down
but there are no bones to crush— only flexible cartilage. And because the hagfish’s skin is so 
loosely attached to the rest of its body, the pressure from the bite causes the hagfish’s essential organs
to slip out of the way, avoiding damage. This is where being a noodle 
in a baggy wetsuit really pays off. Meanwhile, the hagfish also actively
repels the shark by spewing a stupendous supply of slime. Around a hundred slime glands
line each side of the hagfish’s body. Within them are mucus and thread cells. The mucus cells are packed with hundreds
of vesicles of condensed mucus while each thread cell contains 
an intricately coiled protein fiber. The hagfish contracts the muscles
surrounding some of its slime glands, causing the cells to eject their contents
into the seawater. In a fraction of a second, 
the mucus vesicles swell and burst, and the protein fibers unravel. Together, they expand to 10,000 times
their original volume, instantly creating liters of slime. Because the substance is composed of mucus and reinforced with numerous superfine 
and strong silk-like fibers, the slime is incredibly soft yet tough. It lodges in the shark’s delicate gills, and as the shark chokes 
and tries to clear the slime, it releases the hagfish. Now, the hagfish is free 
from the jaws of death. But it’s in a dilemma of its own doing, trapped in a cloud of its own
suffocating slime. So what does it do? Well, it ties itself in a knot, of course. Starting at its tail 
and passing its body through, the hagfish effectively wipes away
its own slime. Apparently unfazed by the whole encounter, it returns to its meal. When it gets to a tougher part 
of the carcass... Voila! The hagfish ties itself 
in yet another knot to gain leverage and yank off the meat. The hagfish’s slime is so remarkable
that people are trying to emulate it. Currently, a lot of athletic 
and safety gear is made from non-renewable
petroleum-based fibers. But hagfish slime threads rival 
the properties of materials like nylon. And fibers modeled after those 
in hagfish slime may present a much more sustainable alternative. Meanwhile, hagfish slime is also being 
explored in military contexts as a non-lethal weapon that could be used
to stop boats by sliming up their propellers. In addition to mastering
the art of slime and knot-tying, hagfish have four little hearts and can survive 36 hours 
without oxygen unscathed. Oh, and they also clean the seafloor and cycle essential nutrients 
in the deep sea. Proto-hagfish were navigating
the ocean’s depths more than 300 million years ago— before dinosaurs roamed 
and back when Pangea was still a thing. Having persisted through multiple
mass extinction events, hagfish have just about seen it all. And it would appear that they’re still
having a wonderful slime.

**Transcript**:
What’s the best country 
in the world to live in? Is it the one with the best food?
The longest life expectancy? The best weather? For the past 70 years, most governments 
have relied heavily on a single number to answer that question. This number influences elections, 
the stock market, and government policy. But it was never intended
for its current purpose; and some would argue that the world 
is addicted to making it grow... forever. This number is called 
the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, and it was invented by the economist
Simon Kuznets in the 1930s, to try and gauge the size of an economy
in a single, easy to understand number. GDP is the total monetary value 
of everything a country produces and sells on the market. To this day, GDP per capita, which is just the total GDP divided by the
number of people living in that country, is widely seen as a measure of well-being. But GDP doesn’t actually say anything
direct about well-being, because it doesn't take into account
what a country produces or who has access to it. A million dollars of weapons contributes 
the exact same amount to a country’s GDP as a million dollars of vaccines or food. The value society derives from things
like public school or firefighters isn’t counted in GDP at all, because those
services aren’t sold on the market. And if a country has a lot of wealth, but most of it is controlled
by relatively few people, GDP per capita gives a distorted picture
of how much money a typical person has. Despite all that, for a long time, higher GDP did correlate closely
to a higher quality of life for people in many countries. From 1945 to 1970, as GDP doubled,
tripled or even quadrupled in some western economies, people’s wages often grew proportionally. By the 1980s, this changed. Countries continued to grow richer, but wages stopped keeping pace 
with GDP growth, or in some cases, even declined, and most of the benefits went to an 
ever-smaller percentage of the population. Still, the idea of capturing
a nation’s well-being in a single number had powerful appeal. In 1972, King Jigme Singye Wangchuk
of Bhutan came up with the idea 
of Gross National Happiness as an alternative 
to Gross Domestic Product. Gross National Happiness is a metric 
that factors in matters like health, education, 
strong communities, and living standards, having citizens answer questions like, “How happy do you think your family
members are at the moment?” “What is your knowledge of names of plants
and wild animals in your area?” and “What type of day was yesterday?” The United Nations’ Human Development
Index is a more widely used metric; it takes into account health
and education, as well as income per capita 
to estimate overall well-being. Meanwhile, a metric called
the Sustainable Development Index factors in both well-being and the 
environmental burdens of economic growth, again, boiling all this down
to a single number. Though no country has been able to meet the basic needs of its people while also using resources 
fully sustainably, Costa Rica currently comes the closest. Over the past few decades, it’s managed to grow its economy
and improve living standards substantially without drastically increasing 
its emissions. Other countries,
like Colombia and Jordan, have made notable progress. Costa Rica now has better well-being
outcomes like life expectancy than some of the world’s 
richest countries. Ultimately, there are limits 
to any approach that boils the quality of life in a country 
down to a single number. Increasingly, experts favor a dashboard
approach that lays out all the factors a single number obscures. This approach makes even more sense given 
that people have different priorities, and the answer to which country 
is best to live in depends on who’s asking the question. So what if that were you designing 
your countries well-being metric? What do you value, 
and what would you measure?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is GDP?
Options: A. Total value of everything that is bought in a country, B. The total value of everything sold in a country, C. Total monetary value of everything a country produces and sells on the market, D. The total value of an entire country's infrastructure
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the main difference between GDP and Gross National Happiness?
Options: A. GDP takes into account education, while Gross National Happiness does not, B. GDP takes into account health, while Gross National Happiness does not, C. GDP does not take into account what a country produces or who has access to it, while Gross National Happiness does, D. GDP is calculated by dividing the total GDP by the number of people living in a country, while Gross National Happiness is calculated by multiplying the total GDP by the number of people living in a country

**Transcript**:
What’s the best country 
in the world to live in? Is it the one with the best food?
The longest life expectancy? The best weather? For the past 70 years, most governments 
have relied heavily on a single number to answer that question. This number influences elections, 
the stock market, and government policy. But it was never intended
for its current purpose; and some would argue that the world 
is addicted to making it grow... forever. This number is called 
the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, and it was invented by the economist
Simon Kuznets in the 1930s, to try and gauge the size of an economy
in a single, easy to understand number. GDP is the total monetary value 
of everything a country produces and sells on the market. To this day, GDP per capita, which is just the total GDP divided by the
number of people living in that country, is widely seen as a measure of well-being. But GDP doesn’t actually say anything
direct about well-being, because it doesn't take into account
what a country produces or who has access to it. A million dollars of weapons contributes 
the exact same amount to a country’s GDP as a million dollars of vaccines or food. The value society derives from things
like public school or firefighters isn’t counted in GDP at all, because those
services aren’t sold on the market. And if a country has a lot of wealth, but most of it is controlled
by relatively few people, GDP per capita gives a distorted picture
of how much money a typical person has. Despite all that, for a long time, higher GDP did correlate closely
to a higher quality of life for people in many countries. From 1945 to 1970, as GDP doubled,
tripled or even quadrupled in some western economies, people’s wages often grew proportionally. By the 1980s, this changed. Countries continued to grow richer, but wages stopped keeping pace 
with GDP growth, or in some cases, even declined, and most of the benefits went to an 
ever-smaller percentage of the population. Still, the idea of capturing
a nation’s well-being in a single number had powerful appeal. In 1972, King Jigme Singye Wangchuk
of Bhutan came up with the idea 
of Gross National Happiness as an alternative 
to Gross Domestic Product. Gross National Happiness is a metric 
that factors in matters like health, education, 
strong communities, and living standards, having citizens answer questions like, “How happy do you think your family
members are at the moment?” “What is your knowledge of names of plants
and wild animals in your area?” and “What type of day was yesterday?” The United Nations’ Human Development
Index is a more widely used metric; it takes into account health
and education, as well as income per capita 
to estimate overall well-being. Meanwhile, a metric called
the Sustainable Development Index factors in both well-being and the 
environmental burdens of economic growth, again, boiling all this down
to a single number. Though no country has been able to meet the basic needs of its people while also using resources

**Transcript**:
If someone teleported from sea level
to the top of Mt. Everest, things would go bad fast. At an altitude of 8,848 meters, barometric pressure is approximately
33% of what it is at sea level. This means there's significantly
less oxygen in the air, and our teleported individual would
likely suffocate in minutes. However, for people that make this same
journey over the course of a month, it's possible to survive
at the peak for hours. So what can happen to our bodies 
in just one month that allows us to endure
this incredible altitude? Let’s imagine you’re one 
of the 5.8 billion people living less than 500 meters 
above sea level. When you take a breath at this altitude, your lungs fill up with air composed
of numerous gases and compounds. Most important among these 
are oxygen molecules, which bind to the hemoglobin 
in your red blood cells. Blood then circulates 
throughout your body, bringing essential oxygen
to all your cells. But as altitude increases, 
the air starts to get thinner. The relative amounts of each compound
remain the same well into the upper atmosphere, but overall, there is less oxygen 
for our bodies to absorb. And if you ascend to altitudes
above 2,500 meters, the resulting oxygen deprivation can cause
a form of altitude sickness known as AMS, often causing headaches,
fatigue and nausea. Fortunately, AMS only happens
when we ascend too fast, because our bodies have numerous ways
of adapting to high altitudes. Within minutes or even seconds 
of reaching altitudes of 1,500 meters, carotid chemoreceptors in your neck
sense your blood’s low oxygen pressure. This triggers a response that increases 
the rate and depth of your breathing to counteract the lack of oxygen. Your heart rate also increases and your heart contracts more tightly 
to pump additional blood with each beat, quickly moving oxygenated
blood around your body. All these changes happen relatively fast,
and if you were to keep ascending, your heart rate and breathing
would speed up accordingly. But if you stayed at this altitude
for several weeks, you could reap the benefits 
of some longer-term adaptations. Within the first few days 
above 1,500 meters, the volume of plasma 
in your blood decreases, which increases the concentration
of hemoglobin. Over the next two weeks, your hemoglobin
levels will continue to rise, allowing your blood to carry 
even more oxygen per milliliter. Paired with your high heart rate, this new hemoglobin-rich blood efficiently
distributes oxygen throughout your body. So much so that the volume of blood 
being pumped with each heartbeat can return to normal levels. Over this same time, your breathing 
also increases even further in a process called 
ventilatory acclimatization. After this several weeks 
of extended acclimatization, your body has made enough significant
changes to climb even higher. However, you’ll still have to spend
additional time acclimating along the way, often climbing back down to recover 
before ascending even higher. Because the summit of Everest
isn't just high, it’s the highest place on Earth. And at altitudes above 3,500 meters, 
our bodies are under incredible stress. Arteries and veins in the brain
dilate to speed up blood flow, But our smallest blood vessels,
called capillaries, remain the same size. This increased pressure can cause
blood vessels to leak, and fluid to build up in the brain. A similar issue can occur in the lungs, where low oxygen causes blood vessels 
to constrict, leading to more leaking vessels
and fluid buildup. These two conditions— 
known as HACE and HAPE, respectively— are incredibly rare, but can be life-threatening 
if not dealt with quickly. Some Tibetans and South Americans 
with family histories of living at high altitude have genetic advantages that can 
prevent minor altitude sickness, but even they aren’t immune
to these severe conditions. Yet despite these risks, 
climbers over the last century have proved people can go higher 
than scientists ever thought possible. Pushing past their body’s limitations, these climbers have redefined
what humanity can adapt to.

**Transcript**:
If someone teleported from sea level
to the top of Mt. Everest, things would go bad fast. At an altitude of 8,848 meters, barometric pressure is approximately
33% of what it is at sea level. This means there's significantly
less oxygen in the air, and our teleported individual would
likely suffocate in minutes. However, for people that make this same
journey over the course of a month, it's possible to survive
at the peak for hours. So what can happen to our bodies 
in just one month that allows us to endure
this incredible altitude? Let’s imagine you’re one 
of the 5.8 billion people living less than 500 meters 
above sea level. When you take a breath at this altitude, your lungs fill up with air composed
of numerous gases and compounds. Most important among these 
are oxygen molecules, which bind to the hemoglobin 
in your red blood cells. Blood then circulates 
throughout your body, bringing essential oxygen
to all your cells. But as altitude increases, 
the air starts to get thinner. The relative amounts of each compound
remain the same well into the upper atmosphere, but overall, there is less oxygen 
for our bodies to absorb. And if you ascend to altitudes
above 2,500 meters, the resulting oxygen deprivation can cause
a form of altitude sickness known as AMS, often causing headaches,
fatigue and nausea. Fortunately, AMS only happens
when we ascend too fast, because our bodies have numerous ways
of adapting to high altitudes. Within minutes or even seconds 
of reaching altitudes of 1,500 meters, carotid chemoreceptors in your neck
sense your blood’s low oxygen pressure. This triggers a response that increases 
the rate and depth of your breathing to counteract the lack of oxygen. Your heart rate also increases and your heart contracts more tightly 
to pump additional blood with each beat, quickly moving oxygenated
blood around your body. All these changes happen relatively fast,
and if you were to keep ascending, your heart rate and breathing
would speed up accordingly. But if you stayed at this altitude
for several weeks, you could reap the benefits 
of some longer-term adaptations. Within the first few days 
above 1,500 meters, the volume of plasma 
in your blood decreases, which increases the concentration
of hemoglobin. Over the next two weeks, your hemoglobin
levels will continue to rise, allowing your blood to carry 
even more oxygen per milliliter. Paired with your high heart rate, this new hemoglobin-rich blood efficiently
distributes oxygen throughout your body. So much so that the volume of blood 
being pumped with each heartbeat can return to normal levels. Over this same time, your breathing 
also increases even further in a process called 
ventilatory acclimatization. After this several weeks 
of extended acclimatization, your body has made enough significant
changes to climb even higher. However, you’ll still have to spend
additional time acclimating along the way, often climbing back down to recover 
before ascending even higher. Because the summit of Everest
isn't just high, it’s the highest place on Earth. And at altitudes above 3,500 meters, 
our bodies are under incredible stress. Arteries and veins in the brain
dilate to speed up blood flow, But our smallest blood vessels,
called capillaries, remain the same size. This increased pressure can cause
blood vessels to leak, and fluid to build up in the brain. A similar issue can occur in the lungs, where low oxygen causes blood vessels 
to constrict, leading to more leaking vessels
and fluid buildup. These two conditions— 
known as HACE and HAPE, respectively— are incredibly rare, but can be life-threatening 
if not dealt with quickly. Some Tibetans and South Americans 
with family histories of living at high altitude have genetic advantages that can 
prevent minor altitude sickness, but even they aren’t immune
to these severe conditions. Yet despite these risks, 
climbers over the last century have proved people can go higher 
than scientists ever thought possible. Pushing past their body’s limitations, these climbers have redefined
what humanity can adapt to.

**Transcript**:
this is the british museum it's the world's largest world history museum and it draws millions of visitors every year inside it holds more than eight million cultural and historical artifacts from all over the world which cover 2 million years of human history if you follow the museum's recommended list of don't miss items you'll see its star pieces like this easter island sculpture that's about a thousand years old or this bronze sculpture of the hindu god shiva [Music] but there's a problem hidden in the museum and we can see an example of it along this route out of those 12 pieces nearly half have disputed ownership the british museum claims those pieces belong there on display for the world to see but in recent years many have been fighting to get them back to where they came from the list of disputed museum treasures keeps on growing should cultural artifacts return to their home countries or be left in western museums the subject of intense debate as to who should now own them let's start with some context in the late 1600s the british empire began expanding across several continents it became the largest empire in history controlling about a quarter of the world's land and population during its centuries-long role the empire took precious resources and wealth from countries all over the world including cultural and historical artifacts many of which ended up here in the british museum which was founded in 1753 and kept growing to accommodate all the new pieces in its collection lots of the items in the museum were legally acquired and are completely undisputed like this one a two thousand year old roman base sold to the museum by a duke in 1945. the problem is with the pieces that are disputed like the first item you see as soon as you walk in the rosetta stone taken by british troops from the french in what is now egypt or further in the parthenon sculptures removed from the acropolis in athens by a british lord and sent to the british museum or over here on the floor dedicated to african art the benin bronzes some of the most contentious items in the museum the benin bronzes are kind of hard to categorize because they include such a huge range of items from engraved ivory tusks to brass sculptures to plaques but they were all produced here in the kingdom of benin in present-day nigeria this wealthy and industrious kingdom produced thousands of objects and art pieces starting in the 1500s a lot of the items adorned palace walls and were used for religious rituals but they weren't just decorative there were visual archives of the kingdom in a society that did not develop a written script as we know them that's professor chika okekeyagulu an art historian and professor from nigeria who teaches at princeton university they told their history how they narrated the histories of kingship of the kingdom its political and social life but in 1897 benin would lose thousands of these cultural pieces at the time european colonial powers were expanding south in what was called the scramble for africa they split up the continent into spheres of influence for financial exploitation all these pink areas were the british ones benin over here was in britain's sphere of influence but the kingdom didn't comply with britain's trade demands and in january of 1897 it led to what was called the benin disaster where benin guards killed seven british emissaries plus their many guides and servants in response 1 200 british troops embarked on a mission called the benin punitive expedition the british wanted revenge but the mission was about more than just that there were reports of these vast treasures in the palace of the king of the name and that if they could retrieve these treasures sales from it could offset the cost of the invasion this was all well planned and so the punitive expedition in other words was also an economic enterprise the british soldiers armed with machine guns conquered the city and burned it to the ground but not before carefully taking thousands of artifacts they piled them up neatly photographed them and even labeled them loot this photo taken at the benin palace after the raid shows soldiers with the dismantled plaques that were brought to the british museum and sold all over the world and after hundreds of years the once prosperous kingdom was gone the region fell under full british colonial control until 1960 when nigeria including the city of benin gained independence but even though they were finally free their historical artifacts were still spread all over the world locked up in western institutions like the leipzig museum of ethnology in germany and the que brandle museum in paris and of course the british museum [Music] 1995 in london that was my first time of seeing an original uh ancient benin artwork was yes at the british museum being in the presence of these magnificent objects and knowing that i had to travel all the way from nigeria to see for the first time in these objects it was a mixture of pride in the achievement of these ancient artists and and mixed with a sense of loss at what could have been if i only had to travel a few hundred miles but at this point you're limited to those uh privileged like me who could get a visa to travel all the way from nigeria to england um to encounter these objects most nigerians will never see them [Music] in march 2000 benin's royal family tried to change that they officially requested all cultural property illegally taken be returned to the rightful owner but for the most part the british museum has ignored any requests the museum is restricted by a government act that prevents it from returning objects but it has also made its stance clear in july of 2020 the british museum told vox we don't restitute but we are absolutely committed to lending as widely as possible including to nigeria the museum's foundational value resides in its breadth scale complexity and unity and as such is a true library of the world chica doesn't see it that way the british museum still behaves like a colonial museum you cannot claim to be an encyclopedic collector of stolen objects but some are starting to reckon with this history in 2014 the grandson of this british soldier from the 1897 benin punitive expedition returned these two items he had inherited to the benin royal family and in 2007 the benin dialogue group was formed western museums that hold the bronzes and nigerian government representatives have been discussing potential solutions ever since but as of today none of the bronzes have been returned but this is just one story this legacy is bigger than the bannon bronzes there are hundreds of contested items in the british museum with their own rich histories and with original owners trying to retrieve them but the problem is even bigger than the british museum it's a legacy of centuries of colonial power that repeats itself again and again with different artifacts in different museums because these requests aren't just about items they are also about cultural and historical identity and who gets to own it this is a long term project it may last beyond my own lifetime but the point is that it's now to start that process we cannot wait any longer for a next generation to even begin the necessary task and project of cultural [Music] reconstitution [Music]

this is the british museum it's the world's largest world history museum and it draws millions of visitors every year inside it holds more than eight million cultural and historical artifacts from all over the world which cover 2 million years of human history if you follow the museum's recommended list of don't miss items you'll see its star pieces like this easter island sculpture that's about a thousand years old or this bronze sculpture of the hindu god shiva [Music] but there's a problem hidden in the museum and we can see an example of it along this route out of those 12 pieces nearly half have disputed ownership the british museum claims those pieces belong there on display for the world to see but in recent years many have been fighting to get them back to where they came from the list of disputed museum treasures keeps on growing should cultural artifacts return to their home countries or be left in western museums the subject of intense debate as to who should now own them let's start with some context in the late 1600s the british empire began expanding across several continents it became the largest empire in history controlling about a quarter of the world's land and population during its centuries-long role the empire took precious resources and wealth from countries all over the world including cultural and historical artifacts many of which ended up here in the british museum which was founded in 1753 and kept growing to accommodate all the new pieces in its collection lots of the items in the museum were legally acquired and are completely undisputed like this one a two thousand year old roman base sold to the museum by a duke in 1945. the problem is with the pieces that are disputed like the first item you see as soon as you walk in the rosetta stone taken by british troops from the french in what is now egypt or further in the parthenon sculptures removed from the acropolis in athens by a british lord and sent to the british museum or over here on the floor dedicated to african art the benin bronzes some of the most contentious items in the museum the benin bronzes are kind of hard to categorize because they include such a huge range of items from engraved ivory tusks to brass sculptures to plaques but they were all produced here in the kingdom of benin in present-day nigeria this wealthy and industrious kingdom produced thousands of objects and art pieces starting in the 1500s a lot of the items adorned palace walls and were used for religious rituals but they weren't just decorative there were visual archives of the kingdom in a society that did not develop a written script as we know them that's professor chika okekeyagulu an art historian and professor from nigeria who teaches at princeton university they told their history how they narrated the histories of kingship of the kingdom its political and social life but in 1897 benin would lose thousands of these cultural pieces at the time european colonial powers were expanding south in what was called the scramble for africa they split up the continent into spheres of influence for financial exploitation all these pink areas were the british ones benin over here was in britain's sphere of influence but the kingdom didn't comply with britain's trade demands and in january of 1897 it led to what was called the benin disaster where benin guards killed seven british emissaries plus their many guides and servants in response 1 200 british troops embarked on a mission called the benin punitive expedition the british wanted revenge but the mission was about more than just that there were reports of these vast treasures in the palace of the king of the name and that if they could retrieve these treasures sales from it could offset the cost of the invasion this was all well planned and so the punitive expedition in other words was also an economic enterprise the british soldiers armed with machine guns conquered the city and burned it to the ground but not before carefully taking thousands of artifacts they piled them up neatly photographed them and even labeled them loot this photo taken at the benin palace after the raid shows soldiers with the dismantled plaques that were brought to the british museum and sold all over the world and after hundreds of years the once prosperous kingdom was gone the region fell under full british colonial control until 1960 when nigeria including the city of benin gained independence but even though they were finally free their historical artifacts were still spread all over the world locked up in western institutions like the leipzig museum of ethnology in germany and the que brandle museum in paris and of course the british museum [Music] 1995 in london that was my first time of seeing an original uh ancient benin artwork was yes at the british museum being in the presence of these magnificent objects and knowing that i had to travel all the way from nigeria to see for the first time in these objects it was a mixture of pride in the achievement of these ancient artists and and mixed with a sense of loss at what could have been if i only had to travel a few hundred miles but at this point you're limited to those uh privileged like me who could get a visa to travel all the way from nigeria to england um to encounter these objects most nigerians will never see them [Music] in march 2000 benin's royal family tried to change that they officially requested all cultural property illegally taken be returned to the rightful owner but for the most part the british museum has ignored any requests the museum is restricted by a government act that prevents it from returning objects but it has also made its stance clear in july of 2020 the british museum told vox we don't restitute but we are absolutely committed to lending as widely as possible including to nigeria the museum's foundational value resides in its breadth scale complexity and unity and as such is a true library of the world chica doesn't see it that way the british museum still behaves like a colonial museum you cannot claim to be an encyclopedic collector of stolen objects but some are starting to reckon with this history in 2014 the grandson of this british soldier from the 1897 benin punitive expedition returned these two items he had inherited to the benin royal family and in 2007 the benin dialogue group was formed western museums that hold the bronzes and nigerian government representatives have been discussing potential solutions ever since but as of today none of the bronzes have been returned but this is just one story this legacy is bigger than the bannon bronzes there are hundreds of contested items in the british museum with their own rich histories and with original owners trying to retrieve them but the problem is even bigger than the british museum it's a legacy of centuries of colonial power that repeats itself again and again with different artifacts in different museums because these requests aren't just about items they are also about cultural and historical identity and who gets to own it this is a long term project it may last beyond my own lifetime but the point is that it's now to start that process we cannot wait any longer for a next generation to even begin the necessary task and project of cultural [Music] reconstitution [Music]

see for the first time in these objects it was a mixture of pride in the achievement of these ancient artists and and mixed with a sense of loss at what could have been if i only had to travel a few hundred miles but at this point you're limited to those uh privileged like me who could get a visa to travel all the way from nigeria to england um to encounter these objects most nigerians will never see them [Music] in march 2000 benin's royal family tried to change that they officially requested all cultural property illegally taken be returned to the rightful owner but for the most part the british museum has ignored any requests the museum is restricted by a government act that prevents it from returning objects but it has also made its stance clear in july of 2020 the british museum told vox we don't restitute but we are absolutely committed to lending as widely as possible including to nigeria the museum's foundational value resides in its breadth scale complexity and unity and as such is a true library of the world chica doesn't see it that way the british museum still behaves like a colonial museum you cannot claim to be an encyclopedic collector of stolen objects but some are starting to reckon with this history in 2014 the grandson of this british soldier from the 1897 benin punitive expedition returned these two items he had inherited to the benin royal family and in 2007 the benin dialogue group was formed western museums that hold the bronzes and nigerian government representatives have been discussing potential solutions ever since but as of today none of the bronzes have been returned but this is just one story this legacy is bigger than the bannon bronzes there are hundreds of contested items in the british museum with their own rich histories and with original owners trying to retrieve them but the problem is even bigger than the british museum it's a legacy of centuries of colonial power that repeats itself again and again with different artifacts in different museums because these requests aren't just about items they are also about cultural and historical identity and who gets to own it this is a long term project it may last beyond my own lifetime but the point is that it's now to start that process we cannot wait any longer for a next generation to even begin the necessary task and project of cultural [Music] reconstitution [Music]

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2010, a parrot that spoke 
with the same British accent as his owner went missing. They were reunited four years later, but the intervening time left
a conspicuous mark: the parrot had lost its British accent and was instead chattering
away in Spanish. Parrots and several other birds are
the only other animals that produce human speech. And some parrots do it almost 
uncannily well. How is this possible? Most wild parrots are highly social. They use vocalizations for mating
and territorial displays and to coordinate group movements. Some species have flocks 
that continuously split and fuse, meaning individual parrots must be able
to communicate with many others. Parrots use contact calls to interact and stay in touch when others
are out of sight. But how exactly they use these calls
depends on the species and the size of their flocks. Monk parakeets, for example,
live in large colonies and have individualized contact calls 
that help them stand out. Yellow-naped Amazon parrots, 
on the other hand, forage in smaller groups that learn
and share highly similar contact calls. This need for sophisticated mimicry may
partially explain why yellow-naped Amazons and some other parrots can 
closely imitate a wide range of sounds— including the human voice. So, how does a parrot actually declare
that “Polly wants a cracker”? A person would string these sounds
together using their larynx, the organ at the top of their windpipe. It consists of rings of muscles 
and a vibrating membrane that controls airflow. They’d finely shape the vocalization 
into enunciated words using their tongue and lips. For a parrot, however, the sound
would originate in its syrinx, located at the base of its windpipe. Many other birds have two vibrating
membranes within this organ. But parrots, like us, have just one. As sounds leave the airway, parrots shape
them using their tongues and beaks. They can do this because they have
especially flexible, powerful tongues that help them manipulate seeds and nuts. And while parrots’ beaks are rigid, 
they have very flexible jaw joints, giving them a lot of control
over how wide and how quickly they open their beaks. Like other animals 
with learned vocalizations, parrot brains contain interconnected
regions that allow them to hear, remember, modify, 
and produce complex sounds. But while songbirds have just one
song system in their brains, almost all parrots seem to have
an additional circuit. Scientists think that this might give 
them extra flexibility when it comes to learning the calls 
of their own species— and ours. With this specialized anatomy, parrots can bark, scream, curse, 
and recite factoids. One intrepid lost parrot managed 
to get back home after repeating his full name 
and address to helpful strangers. But these impressive abilities 
raise another question: do parrots actually understand 
what they’re saying? When most captive parrots talk, they’re likely attempting to form social
bonds in the absence of their own species. Many probably have associations
with words and may be drawn to ones 
that elicit certain responses— hence their capacity for profanity. But, especially after training, parrots have been observed to say things
in the appropriate contexts and assign meaning to words— 
saying “goodnight” at the end of the day, asking for certain treats, 
or counting and picking objects. One extensively trained 
African grey parrot named Alex became the first non-human animal 
to pose an existential question when he asked what color he was. Whether they’re belting Beyoncé,
head-banging to classic rock, or rattling off cuss words at zoo-goers, parrots are constantly astounding us—
as they have been for millennia. But our fascination with parrots has
also made them vulnerable. Sought by poachers and pet traders, while losing their habitats
to deforestation, wild populations have decreased
dramatically. To truly understand parrots, we need 
to preserve and study them in the wild.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: The parrot brain contains one neural circuit linked to vocal mimicry.
Options: A. True. Parrots and songbirds share the same neuroanatomy, B. False. Parrot brains contain two of these neural circuits
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is unique about a parrot's brain compared to other birds?
Options: A. It has a single song system., B. It has an additional circuit that allows for extra flexibility when learning calls., C. It is smaller than other birds., D. It is less developed than other birds.
Correct Option: None (However, based on the transcript, the correct answer should be B)

**Scores**:
- Relevance Score: 0.9000 (The generated question is closely related to the ground truth question, but it's phrased differently and doesn't directly address the number of neural circuits.)
- Correct Answer Matching Score: 0.8000 (Although the generated question doesn't have a designated correct answer, option B aligns with the correct answer in the ground truth question. However, the generated question's format and options don't exactly match the ground truth question.)
- Distractor Plausibility Score: 0.6000 (Options A, C, and D in the generated question are plausible but not directly related to the unique aspect of parrot brains mentioned in the transcript. Option A is actually the opposite of what the transcript states.)

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2010, a parrot that spoke 
with the same British accent as his owner went missing. They were reunited four years later, but the intervening time left
a conspicuous mark: the parrot had lost its British accent and was instead chattering
away in Spanish. Parrots and several other birds are
the only other animals that produce human speech. And some parrots do it almost 
uncannily well. How is this possible? Most wild parrots are highly social. They use vocalizations for mating
and territorial displays and to coordinate group movements. Some species have flocks 
that continuously split and fuse, meaning individual parrots must be able
to communicate with many others. Parrots use contact calls to interact and stay in touch when others
are out of sight. But how exactly they use these calls
depends on the species and the size of their flocks. Monk parakeets, for example,
live in large colonies and have individualized contact calls 
that help them stand out. Yellow-naped Amazon parrots, 
on the other hand, forage in smaller groups that learn
and share highly similar contact calls. This need for sophisticated mimicry may
partially explain why yellow-naped Amazons and some other parrots can 
closely imitate a wide range of sounds— including the human voice. So, how does a parrot actually declare
that “Polly wants a cracker”? A person would string these sounds
together using their larynx, the organ at the top of their windpipe. It consists of rings of muscles 
and a vibrating membrane that controls airflow. They’d finely shape the vocalization 
into enunciated words using their tongue and lips. For a parrot, however, the sound
would originate in its syrinx, located at the base of its windpipe. Many other birds have two vibrating
membranes within this organ. But parrots, like us, have just one. As sounds leave the airway, parrots shape
them using their tongues and beaks. They can do this because they have
especially flexible, powerful tongues that help them manipulate seeds and nuts. And while parrots’ beaks are rigid, 
they have very flexible jaw joints, giving them a lot of control
over how wide and how quickly they open their beaks. Like other animals 
with learned vocalizations, parrot brains contain interconnected
regions that allow them to hear, remember, modify, 
and produce complex sounds. But while songbirds have just one
song system in their brains, almost all parrots seem to have
an additional circuit. Scientists think that this might give 
them extra flexibility when it comes to learning the calls 
of their own species— and ours. With this specialized anatomy, parrots can bark, scream, curse, 
and recite factoids. One intrepid lost parrot managed 
to get back home after repeating his full name 
and address to helpful strangers. But these impressive abilities 
raise another question: do parrots actually understand 
what they’re saying? When most captive parrots talk, they’re likely attempting to form social
bonds in the absence of their own species. Many probably have associations
with words and may be drawn to ones 
that elicit certain responses— hence their capacity for profanity. But, especially after training, parrots have been observed to say things
in the appropriate contexts and assign meaning to words— 
saying “goodnight” at the end of the day, asking for certain treats, 
or counting and picking objects. One extensively trained 
African grey parrot named Alex became the first non-human animal 
to pose an existential question when he asked what color he was. Whether they’re belting Beyoncé,
head-banging to classic rock, or rattling off cuss words at zoo-goers, parrots are constantly astounding us—
as they have been for millennia. But our fascination with parrots has
also made them vulnerable. Sought by poachers and pet traders, while losing their habitats
to deforestation, wild populations have decreased
dramatically. To truly understand parrots, we need 
to preserve and study them in the wild.
