**Transcript**:
In the 4th century BCE, a banker’s son threw the city of Sinope 
into scandal by counterfeiting coins. When the dust finally settled, 
the young man, Diogenes of Sinope, had been stripped of his citizenship, 
his money, and all his possessions. At least, that’s how the story goes. While many of the details 
of Diogenes’ life are shadowy, the philosophical ideas 
born out of his disgrace survive today. In exile, Diogenes decided 
that by rejecting the opinions of others and societal measures of success, 
he could be truly free. He would live self-sufficiently, 
close to nature, without materialism, vanity, or conformity. In practice, this meant he spent years 
wandering around Greek cities with nothing but a cloak, staff, 
and knapsack— outdoors year-round, forgoing technology, 
baths, and cooked food. He didn’t go about this new existence 
quietly, but is said to have teased passers-by 
and mocked the powerful, eating, urinating 
and even masturbating in public. The citizens called him a kyôn— 
a barking dog. Though meant as an insult, dogs were actually a good symbol 
for his philosophy— they’re happy creatures, free from abstractions 
like wealth or reputation. Diogenes and his growing number 
of followers became known as “dog philosophers,” 
or kynikoi, a designation 
that eventually became the word “Cynic.” These early Cynics were a carefree bunch, drawn to the freedom 
of a wandering lifestyle. As Diogenes’ reputation grew, 
others tried to challenge his commitment. Alexander the Great 
offered him anything he desired. But instead of asking for material goods, Diogenes only asked Alexander 
to get out of his sunshine. After Diogenes’ death, adherents to his philosophy 
continued to call themselves Cynics for about 900 years, until 500 CE. Some Greek philosophers, like the Stoics, thought everyone 
should follow Diogenes’ example. They also attempted to tone down 
his philosophy to be more acceptable 
to conventional society— which, of course, was fundamentally at odds 
with his approach. Others viewed the Cynics less charitably. In the Roman province of Syria 
in the 2nd century CE, the satirist Lucian described the Cynics 
of his own time as unprincipled, materialistic, self-promoting hypocrites, who only preached 
what Diogenes had once actually practiced. Reading Lucian’s texts centuries later, Renaissance and Reformation writers 
called their rivals cynics as an insult— meaning people who criticized others 
without having anything worthwhile to say. This usage eventually laid the groundwork 
for the modern meaning of the word “cynic:" a person who thinks everyone else 
is acting out of pure self-interest, even if they claim a higher motive. Still, the philosophy of cynicism 
had admirers, especially among those 
who wished to question the state of society. The 18th-century French philosopher 
Jean-Jacques Rousseau was called the “new Diogenes” when he argued 
that the arts, sciences, and technology, corrupt people. In 1882, Friedrich Nietzsche 
reimagined a story in which Diogenes 
went into the Athenian marketplace with a lantern, searching in vain 
for a single honest person. In Nietszche’s version, a so-called madman
rushes into a town square to proclaim that “God is dead.” This was Nietzsche’s way 
of calling for a “revaluation of values,” and rejecting 
the dominant Christian and Platonic idea of universal, spiritual insights 
beyond the physical world. Nietzsche admired Diogenes 
for sticking stubbornly to the here-and-now. More recently, the hippies of the 1960s 
have been compared with Diogenes as counter-cultural rebels. Diogenes’ ideas 
have been adopted and reimagined 
over and over again. The original cynics 
might not have approved of these fresh takes: they believed 
that their values of rejecting custom and living closely with nature 
were the only true values. Whether or not you agree with that, 
or with any of the later incarnations, all have one thing in common: 
they questioned the status quo. And that’s an example 
we can still follow: not to blindly follow 
conventional or majority views, but to think hard 
about what is truly valuable.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2: What was the name given to Diogenes and his followers due to their rejection of materialism and their association with dogs? 

However, the options provided in Question 2 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that directly asks about the meaning or origin of the word "kynikos" or "Cynic". 

Since there isn't a direct match, I will choose the closest related question. 

The closest related question is Question 2. However, I must note that Question 2 does not directly ask about the origin of the word "kynikos" but rather the name given to Diogenes and his followers.

A more suitable question would be one that directly asks about the origin or meaning of the word "kynikos". Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 1 is the most similar in terms of content, as it mentions Diogenes of Sinope. Nevertheless, it does not ask about the city from which Diogenes was exiled.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the information provided, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible match based on the content.

A possible match could be Question 1, but it would need to be modified to match the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match, but with a very low similarity score.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the closest match would be a question that is not present in the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose from the generated MCQs, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match, but it's still not similar to the ground truth MCQ. Question 2 asks about the name given to Diogenes and his followers, while the ground truth MCQ asks about the recommendation of the ancient Cynics.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the values or practices of the ancient Cynics, such as:

* What did the ancient Cynics value most in their way of life?
* How did the ancient Cynics recommend living in order to achieve freedom?
* What was the core principle of the ancient Cynics' philosophy?

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. Therefore, I cannot provide an index of the most similar generated MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the 4th century BCE, a banker’s son threw the city of Sinope 
into scandal by counterfeiting coins. When the dust finally settled, 
the young man, Diogenes of Sinope, had been stripped of his citizenship, 
his money, and all his possessions. At least, that’s how the story goes. While many of the details 
of Diogenes’ life are shadowy, the philosophical ideas 
born out of his disgrace survive today. In exile, Diogenes decided 
that by rejecting the opinions of others and societal measures of success, 
he could be truly free. He would live self-sufficiently, 
close to nature, without materialism, vanity, or conformity. In practice, this meant he spent years 
wandering around Greek cities with nothing but a cloak, staff, 
and knapsack— outdoors year-round, forgoing technology, 
baths, and cooked food. He didn’t go about this new existence 
quietly, but is said to have teased passers-by 
and mocked the powerful, eating, urinating 
and even masturbating in public. The citizens called him a kyôn— 
a barking dog. Though meant as an insult, dogs were actually a good symbol 
for his philosophy— they’re happy creatures, free from abstractions 
like wealth or reputation. Diogenes and his growing number 
of followers became known as “dog philosophers,” 
or kynikoi, a designation 
that eventually became the word “Cynic.” These early Cynics were a carefree bunch, drawn to the freedom 
of a wandering lifestyle. As Diogenes’ reputation grew, 
others tried to challenge his commitment. Alexander the Great 
offered him anything he desired. But instead of asking for material goods, Diogenes only asked Alexander 
to get out of his sunshine. After Diogenes’ death, adherents to his philosophy 
continued to call themselves Cynics for about 900 years, until 500 CE. Some Greek philosophers, like the Stoics, thought everyone 
should follow Diogenes’ example. They also attempted to tone down 
his philosophy to be more acceptable 
to conventional society— which, of course, was fundamentally at odds 
with his approach. Others viewed the Cynics less charitably. In the Roman province of Syria 
in the 2nd century CE, the satirist Lucian described the Cynics 
of his own time as unprincipled, materialistic, self-promoting hypocrites, who only preached 
what Diogenes had once actually practiced. Reading Lucian’s texts centuries later, Renaissance and Reformation writers 
called their rivals cynics as an insult— meaning people who criticized others 
without having anything worthwhile to say. This usage eventually laid the groundwork 
for the modern meaning of the word “cynic:" a person who thinks everyone else 
is acting out of pure self-interest, even if they claim a higher motive. Still, the philosophy of cynicism 
had admirers, especially among those 
who wished to question the state of society. The 18th-century French philosopher 
Jean-Jacques Rousseau was called the “new Diogenes” when he argued 
that the arts, sciences, and technology, corrupt people. In 1882, Friedrich Nietzsche 
reimagined a story in which Diogenes 
went into the Athenian marketplace with a lantern, searching in vain 
for a single honest person. In Nietszche’s version, a so-called madman
rushes into a town square to proclaim that “God is dead.” This was Nietzsche’s way 
of calling for a “revaluation of values,” and rejecting 
the dominant Christian and Platonic idea of universal, spiritual insights 
beyond the physical world. Nietzsche admired Diogenes 
for sticking stubbornly to the here-and-now. More recently, the hippies of the 1960s 
have been compared with Diogenes as counter-cultural rebels. Diogenes’ ideas 
have been adopted and reimagined 
over and over again. The original cynics 
might not have approved of these fresh takes: they believed 
that their values of rejecting custom and living closely with nature 
were the only true values. Whether or not you agree with that, 
or with any of the later incarnations, all have one thing in common: 
they questioned the status quo. And that’s an example 
we can still follow: not to blindly follow 
conventional or majority views, but to think hard 
about what is truly valuable.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although the question content is not identical, both questions involve the interaction between Diogenes and Alexander the Great. The ground truth MCQ asks what Diogenes said to Alexander, while Question 4 asks who offered Diogenes anything he desired but was rejected by Diogenes. However, the correct answer to Question 4 (A. Alexander the Great) is closely related to the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ (D. "Stand out of my sunshine!"), which is what Diogenes said to Alexander.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 4.

**Transcript**:
A mother and her son trek 
across an endless desert. Wearing special skin-tight suits 
to dissipate heat and recycle moisture, the travelers aren’t worried 
about dying of thirst. Their fears are much greater. The pair try to walk without rhythm, letting the vibrations of their footsteps 
blend into the shifting sands. But soon, the sound of the desert 
is drowned out by a louder hissing. As a mound of sand races towards them, the pair’s unnatural gait 
turns into a sprint. The two clamber into a nearby rock face, as a sandworm 400 meters long 
bursts from the desert floor. This is the world of "Dune." Written by Frank Herbert 
and published in 1965, "Dune" takes place 
in a far-flung future, where humanity rules the stars 
in a giant feudal empire. This medieval motif goes beyond 
just the government. Unlike most interstellar sci-fi, Herbert's humans conquered 
the stars without any computers. Following an ancient war with robots, humanity has forbidden 
the construction of any machine “in the likeness of a human mind.” But rather than stifling their expansion, this edict forced humans 
to evolve in startling ways— becoming biological computers, psychic 
witches, and prescient space pilots. Members of these super-powered factions are regularly employed 
by various noble houses, all competing for power and new planets 
to add to their kingdoms. But almost all these superhuman skills 
rely on the same precious resource: the spice. This mystical crop also known as “melange”
is essential for all space travel, making it the cornerstone 
of the galactic economy. And it only grows 
on the desert planet Arrakis, a dangerous and inhospitable world 
whose native inhabitants have long rebelled against the empire. Arrakis, also called Dune, 
is the setting for Herbert’s novel, which follows Paul 
of the noble House Atreides. The book begins with Paul’s family
being assigned control of Dune as part of an elaborate plot 
by their sworn enemies: the sadistic slave drivers 
of House Harkonnen. The conflict between these houses upends 
the delicate political balance on Arrakis. Soon, Paul is catapulted
into the middle of a planetary revolution, where he must prove himself capable 
of leading— and surviving— on this hostile desert world. But Arrakis is not simply 
an endless sea of sand. Herbert was an avid environmentalist, who spent over five years creating 
Dune’s complex ecosystem. The planet is checkered with climate 
belts and wind tunnels that have shaped its rocky topography. Different temperate zones produce 
varying desert flora. And almost every element of Dune’s 
ecosystem works together to produce the planet’s essential export. Herbert’s world building also includes 
a rich web of philosophy and religion. Paul’s mother Jessica, is a member 
of the Bene Gesserit, an ancient cult 
of spice-assisted psychics. Sometimes called “witches” 
for their mysterious powers, the Bene Gesserit have operated 
as a shadow government for millennia in an effort to guide society 
towards enlightenment. Similarly ancient are the Mentats— human computers capable 
of processing incredible amounts of data. While the Mentats are bastions 
of logic and reason, their results are not mere calculations, but rather, streams of constantly 
shifting possibilities. However, no group is more central 
to "Dune" than the Fremen. Natives of Arrakis, they are the keepers 
of the planet’s many secrets. Paul’s journey takes him deep 
into the Fremen’s exclusive brotherhood, where he must prove himself trustworthy in a series of increasingly 
deadly challenges. All these factions have deep histories 
that pervade the text, and Herbert also incorporates that 
sense of scale into the book’s structure. Each chapter begins with a quote 
from a future history book, recalling elements of the events 
that are about to unfold. The book also contains in-universe 
appendices that further explore the Empire’s history; alongside a glossary of words like 
“Gom jabbar” and “Shai-Hulud." Dune’s epic story continues to unfold 
over a six-book saga that spans millennia. But every story of Arrakis’ 
future begins here: as Paul pursues a path 
that is dangerous, demanding, and always on the verge of being 
consumed by the oncoming storm.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

Although the wording of the question is different, the content and intent of Question 6 are similar to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the status of computers and robots in "Dune," while Question 6 asks about the reason why humans have forbidden the construction of machines in the likeness of a human mind. However, the correct answer to Question 6 (Option C) implies that computers and robots are outlawed, which is the same as the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ (Option D). 

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 6.

**Transcript**:
A mother and her son trek 
across an endless desert. Wearing special skin-tight suits 
to dissipate heat and recycle moisture, the travelers aren’t worried 
about dying of thirst. Their fears are much greater. The pair try to walk without rhythm, letting the vibrations of their footsteps 
blend into the shifting sands. But soon, the sound of the desert 
is drowned out by a louder hissing. As a mound of sand races towards them, the pair’s unnatural gait 
turns into a sprint. The two clamber into a nearby rock face, as a sandworm 400 meters long 
bursts from the desert floor. This is the world of "Dune." Written by Frank Herbert 
and published in 1965, "Dune" takes place 
in a far-flung future, where humanity rules the stars 
in a giant feudal empire. This medieval motif goes beyond 
just the government. Unlike most interstellar sci-fi, Herbert's humans conquered 
the stars without any computers. Following an ancient war with robots, humanity has forbidden 
the construction of any machine “in the likeness of a human mind.” But rather than stifling their expansion, this edict forced humans 
to evolve in startling ways— becoming biological computers, psychic 
witches, and prescient space pilots. Members of these super-powered factions are regularly employed 
by various noble houses, all competing for power and new planets 
to add to their kingdoms. But almost all these superhuman skills 
rely on the same precious resource: the spice. This mystical crop also known as “melange”
is essential for all space travel, making it the cornerstone 
of the galactic economy. And it only grows 
on the desert planet Arrakis, a dangerous and inhospitable world 
whose native inhabitants have long rebelled against the empire. Arrakis, also called Dune, 
is the setting for Herbert’s novel, which follows Paul 
of the noble House Atreides. The book begins with Paul’s family
being assigned control of Dune as part of an elaborate plot 
by their sworn enemies: the sadistic slave drivers 
of House Harkonnen. The conflict between these houses upends 
the delicate political balance on Arrakis. Soon, Paul is catapulted
into the middle of a planetary revolution, where he must prove himself capable 
of leading— and surviving— on this hostile desert world. But Arrakis is not simply 
an endless sea of sand. Herbert was an avid environmentalist, who spent over five years creating 
Dune’s complex ecosystem. The planet is checkered with climate 
belts and wind tunnels that have shaped its rocky topography. Different temperate zones produce 
varying desert flora. And almost every element of Dune’s 
ecosystem works together to produce the planet’s essential export. Herbert’s world building also includes 
a rich web of philosophy and religion. Paul’s mother Jessica, is a member 
of the Bene Gesserit, an ancient cult 
of spice-assisted psychics. Sometimes called “witches” 
for their mysterious powers, the Bene Gesserit have operated 
as a shadow government for millennia in an effort to guide society 
towards enlightenment. Similarly ancient are the Mentats— human computers capable 
of processing incredible amounts of data. While the Mentats are bastions 
of logic and reason, their results are not mere calculations, but rather, streams of constantly 
shifting possibilities. However, no group is more central 
to "Dune" than the Fremen. Natives of Arrakis, they are the keepers 
of the planet’s many secrets. Paul’s journey takes him deep 
into the Fremen’s exclusive brotherhood, where he must prove himself trustworthy in a series of increasingly 
deadly challenges. All these factions have deep histories 
that pervade the text, and Herbert also incorporates that 
sense of scale into the book’s structure. Each chapter begins with a quote 
from a future history book, recalling elements of the events 
that are about to unfold. The book also contains in-universe 
appendices that further explore the Empire’s history; alongside a glossary of words like 
“Gom jabbar” and “Shai-Hulud." Dune’s epic story continues to unfold 
over a six-book saga that spans millennia. But every story of Arrakis’ 
future begins here: as Paul pursues a path 
that is dangerous, demanding, and always on the verge of being 
consumed by the oncoming storm.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a faction that does NOT exist in the world of "Dune." The most similar generated MCQ is Question 4, which asks about the name of the ancient cult of spice-assisted psychics in the novel "Dune." Although the question intent is different, the options provided in Question 4 include some of the factions mentioned in the ground truth MCQ, such as Bene Gesserit and Fremen.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that Question 6 is a better match. Question 6 asks about the reason why humans have forbidden the construction of machines in the likeness of a human mind, and one of the options (C) mentions the ancient war with robots, which is related to the absence of a specific faction (e.g., robots or artificial intelligence) in the world of "Dune."

But since none of the generated MCQs directly ask about a non-existent faction, I must rely on the context and intent of the questions. In this case, I would argue that Question 6 is still not a perfect match, but it is the closest one.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Frank Herbert's focus when creating Arrakis, with options related to planetary ecology, historical context, and fictional language.

While there isn't a direct match, Question 2 is somewhat related to the topic of Arrakis, but it doesn't match the ground truth MCQ's intent or options.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match. However, I can suggest that a new generated MCQ that asks about Frank Herbert's focus when creating Arrakis, with options related to planetary ecology, historical context, and fictional language, would be a good match.

That being said, if I had to choose an index from the provided generated MCQs, I would say that Question 2 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

**Transcript**:
In her Auntie An-mei’s home, Jing-Mei reluctantly takes her seat at the eastern corner 
of the mahjong table. At the north, south, and west 
corners are her aunties, long-time members of the Joy Luck Club. This group of immigrant families 
comes together weekly to trade gossip, feast on wonton and sweet chaswei, 
and play mahjong. However, the club’s founder, Jing-Mei’s 
mother Suyuan, has recently passed away. At first, Jing-Mei struggles 
to fill her place at the table. But when her aunties reveal a deeply 
buried secret about Suyuan’s life, Jing-Mei realizes she still has a lot 
to learn about her mother, and herself. In Amy Tan’s 1989 debut novel, 
"The Joy Luck Club," this gathering at the mahjong table 
is the point of departure for a series of interconnected vignettes. The book itself is loosely structured 
to imitate the format of the Chinese game. Just as mahjong is played over four 
rounds with at least four hands each, the book is divided into four parts, 
each with four chapters. Alternately set in China 
or San Francisco, each chapter narrates a single 
story from one of the four matriarchs of the Joy Luck Club 
or their American-born daughters. These stories take the reader through 
war zones and villages of rural China, 
and into modern marriages and tense gatherings 
around the dinner table. They touch upon themes of survival 
and loss, love and the lack of it, ambitions and their unsatisfied reality. In one, Auntie Lin plots an escape 
from the hostile family of her promised husband, ultimately leading 
to her arrival in America. In another, the Hsu family’s all-American 
day at the beach turns dire when Rose is overwhelmed by the 
responsibility her mother assigns to her. The resulting tragedy traumatizes 
the family for years to come. These tales illustrate the common 
divides that can form between generations and cultures, 
especially in immigrant families. The mothers have all experienced great 
hardships during their lives in China, and they’ve worked tirelessly 
to give their children better opportunities in America. But their daughters feel weighed down 
by their parent’s unfulfilled hopes and high expectations. Jing-Mei feels this pressure as she plays 
mahjong with her mother’s friends. She worries, “In me, they see 
their own daughters, just as ignorant, just as unmindful of all the truths 
and hopes they have brought to America.” Time and again, the mothers strive to remind their 
daughters of their history and heritage. Meanwhile, their daughters 
struggle to reconcile their mothers’ perception of them 
with who they really are. "Does my daughter know me?" 
some of the stories ask. "Why doesn’t my mother understand?" 
others respond. In her interrogation of these questions, Tan speaks to anxieties 
that plague many immigrants, who often feel both alienated 
from their homeland and disconnected 
from their adopted country. But by weaving the tales of these 
four mothers and daughters together, Tan makes it clear that Jing-Mei and her peers find strength to tackle 
their present-day problems through the values their mothers 
passed on to them. When "The Joy Luck Club" 
was first published, Tan expected minimal success. But against her predictions, 
the book was a massive critical and commercial achievement. Today, these characters 
still captivate readers worldwide. Not only for the way they speak 
to Chinese American and immigrant experiences, but also for uncovering a deeper truth: the need to be seen and understood 
by the ones you love.

**Transcript**:
In her Auntie An-mei’s home, Jing-Mei reluctantly takes her seat at the eastern corner 
of the mahjong table. At the north, south, and west 
corners are her aunties, long-time members of the Joy Luck Club. This group of immigrant families 
comes together weekly to trade gossip, feast on wonton and sweet chaswei, 
and play mahjong. However, the club’s founder, Jing-Mei’s 
mother Suyuan, has recently passed away. At first, Jing-Mei struggles 
to fill her place at the table. But when her aunties reveal a deeply 
buried secret about Suyuan’s life, Jing-Mei realizes she still has a lot 
to learn about her mother, and herself. In Amy Tan’s 1989 debut novel, 
"The Joy Luck Club," this gathering at the mahjong table 
is the point of departure for a series of interconnected vignettes. The book itself is loosely structured 
to imitate the format of the Chinese game. Just as mahjong is played over four 
rounds with at least four hands each, the book is divided into four parts, 
each with four chapters. Alternately set in China 
or San Francisco, each chapter narrates a single 
story from one of the four matriarchs of the Joy Luck Club 
or their American-born daughters. These stories take the reader through 
war zones and villages of rural China, 
and into modern marriages and tense gatherings 
around the dinner table. They touch upon themes of survival 
and loss, love and the lack of it, ambitions and their unsatisfied reality. In one, Auntie Lin plots an escape 
from the hostile family of her promised husband, ultimately leading 
to her arrival in America. In another, the Hsu family’s all-American 
day at the beach turns dire when Rose is overwhelmed by the 
responsibility her mother assigns to her. The resulting tragedy traumatizes 
the family for years to come. These tales illustrate the common 
divides that can form between generations and cultures, 
especially in immigrant families. The mothers have all experienced great 
hardships during their lives in China, and they’ve worked tirelessly 
to give their children better opportunities in America. But their daughters feel weighed down 
by their parent’s unfulfilled hopes and high expectations. Jing-Mei feels this pressure as she plays 
mahjong with her mother’s friends. She worries, “In me, they see 
their own daughters, just as ignorant, just as unmindful of all the truths 
and hopes they have brought to America.” Time and again, the mothers strive to remind their 
daughters of their history and heritage. Meanwhile, their daughters 
struggle to reconcile their mothers’ perception of them 
with who they really are. "Does my daughter know me?" 
some of the stories ask. "Why doesn’t my mother understand?" 
others respond. In her interrogation of these questions, Tan speaks to anxieties 
that plague many immigrants, who often feel both alienated 
from their homeland and disconnected 
from their adopted country. But by weaving the tales of these 
four mothers and daughters together, Tan makes it clear that Jing-Mei and her peers find strength to tackle 
their present-day problems through the values their mothers 
passed on to them. When "The Joy Luck Club" 
was first published, Tan expected minimal success. But against her predictions, 
the book was a massive critical and commercial achievement. Today, these characters 
still captivate readers worldwide. Not only for the way they speak 
to Chinese American and immigrant experiences, but also for uncovering a deeper truth: the need to be seen and understood 
by the ones you love.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the main characters of "The Joy Luck Club," and the correct option is "Four Chinese immigrant mothers and their American-born daughters." Question 5 asks about a common challenge faced by the daughters of the Joy Luck Club, and while it does not directly ask about the main characters, it implies that the main characters are the mothers and daughters.

However, a more relevant question that matches the ground truth MCQ is not present among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 5, but with the understanding that it is not an exact match.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 8 is the closest, but it is still not similar. Question 8 asks about Amy Tan's intention in writing "The Joy Luck Club", which is not related to the publication year.

Since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I would recommend generating new MCQs that include a question about the publication year of "The Joy Luck Club".

However, if I really had to choose an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not available, but if I had to choose from the given options, I would say that the index is "None" or "Not Available".

**Transcript**:
In her Auntie An-mei’s home, Jing-Mei reluctantly takes her seat at the eastern corner 
of the mahjong table. At the north, south, and west 
corners are her aunties, long-time members of the Joy Luck Club. This group of immigrant families 
comes together weekly to trade gossip, feast on wonton and sweet chaswei, 
and play mahjong. However, the club’s founder, Jing-Mei’s 
mother Suyuan, has recently passed away. At first, Jing-Mei struggles 
to fill her place at the table. But when her aunties reveal a deeply 
buried secret about Suyuan’s life, Jing-Mei realizes she still has a lot 
to learn about her mother, and herself. In Amy Tan’s 1989 debut novel, 
"The Joy Luck Club," this gathering at the mahjong table 
is the point of departure for a series of interconnected vignettes. The book itself is loosely structured 
to imitate the format of the Chinese game. Just as mahjong is played over four 
rounds with at least four hands each, the book is divided into four parts, 
each with four chapters. Alternately set in China 
or San Francisco, each chapter narrates a single 
story from one of the four matriarchs of the Joy Luck Club 
or their American-born daughters. These stories take the reader through 
war zones and villages of rural China, 
and into modern marriages and tense gatherings 
around the dinner table. They touch upon themes of survival 
and loss, love and the lack of it, ambitions and their unsatisfied reality. In one, Auntie Lin plots an escape 
from the hostile family of her promised husband, ultimately leading 
to her arrival in America. In another, the Hsu family’s all-American 
day at the beach turns dire when Rose is overwhelmed by the 
responsibility her mother assigns to her. The resulting tragedy traumatizes 
the family for years to come. These tales illustrate the common 
divides that can form between generations and cultures, 
especially in immigrant families. The mothers have all experienced great 
hardships during their lives in China, and they’ve worked tirelessly 
to give their children better opportunities in America. But their daughters feel weighed down 
by their parent’s unfulfilled hopes and high expectations. Jing-Mei feels this pressure as she plays 
mahjong with her mother’s friends. She worries, “In me, they see 
their own daughters, just as ignorant, just as unmindful of all the truths 
and hopes they have brought to America.” Time and again, the mothers strive to remind their 
daughters of their history and heritage. Meanwhile, their daughters 
struggle to reconcile their mothers’ perception of them 
with who they really are. "Does my daughter know me?" 
some of the stories ask. "Why doesn’t my mother understand?" 
others respond. In her interrogation of these questions, Tan speaks to anxieties 
that plague many immigrants, who often feel both alienated 
from their homeland and disconnected 
from their adopted country. But by weaving the tales of these 
four mothers and daughters together, Tan makes it clear that Jing-Mei and her peers find strength to tackle 
their present-day problems through the values their mothers 
passed on to them. When "The Joy Luck Club" 
was first published, Tan expected minimal success. But against her predictions, 
the book was a massive critical and commercial achievement. Today, these characters 
still captivate readers worldwide. Not only for the way they speak 
to Chinese American and immigrant experiences, but also for uncovering a deeper truth: the need to be seen and understood 
by the ones you love.

**Transcript**:
During World War I, one of the 
horrors of trench warfare was a poisonous yellow cloud 
called mustard gas. For those unlucky enough to be exposed, it made the air impossible to breathe, 
burned their eyes, and caused huge blisters on exposed skin. Scientists tried desperately to develop an
antidote to this vicious weapon of war. In the process they discovered the gas 
was irrevocably damaging the bone marrow of affected soldiers— halting its 
ability to make blood cells. Despite these awful effects, 
it gave scientists an idea. Cancer cells share a characteristic with 
bone marrow: both replicate rapidly. So could one of the atrocities of war become a champion in the 
fight against cancer? Researchers in the 1930s 
investigated this idea by injecting compounds derived 
from mustard gas into the veins of cancer patients. It took time and trial and error to find 
treatments that did more good than harm, but by the end of World War II, they discovered what became known 
as the first chemotherapy drugs. Today, there are more than 100. Chemotherapy drugs are delivered 
through pills and injections and use "cytotoxic agents," which means 
compounds that are toxic to living cells. Essentially, these medicines cause some 
level of harm to all cells in the body— even healthy ones. But they reserve their most powerful 
effects for rapidly-dividing cells, which is precisely the hallmark of cancer. Take, for example, those first 
chemotherapy drugs, which are still used today and 
are called alkylating agents. They’re injected into the bloodstream, which delivers them to 
cells all over the body. Once inside, when the cell exposes 
its DNA in order to copy it, they damage the building blocks of 
DNA’s double helix structure, which can lead to cell death unless 
the damage is repaired. Because cancer cells multiply rapidly, they take in a high concentration 
of alkylating agents, and their DNA is frequently exposed 
and rarely repaired. So they die off more often 
than most other cells, which have time to fix damaged DNA and don’t accumulate the same 
concentrations of alkylating agents. Another form of chemotherapy involves 
compounds called microtubule stabilizers. Cells have small tubes that assemble 
to help with cell division and DNA replication, then break back down. When microtubule stabilizers 
get inside a cell, they keep those tiny tubes 
from disassembling. That prevents the cell from completing 
its replication, leading to its death. These are just two examples of the six 
classes of chemotherapy drugs we use to treat cancer today. But despite its huge benefits, 
chemotherapy has one big disadvantage: it affects other healthy cells in the body
that naturally have to renew rapidly. Hair follicles, the cells of the mouth, 
the gastrointestinal lining, the reproductive system, and bone marrow 
are hit nearly as hard as cancer. Similar to cancer cells, the rapid 
production of these normal cells means that they’re reaching for 
resources more frequently— and are therefore more exposed to 
the effects of chemo drugs. That leads to several common side 
effects of chemotherapy, including hair loss, fatigue, infertility,
nausea, and vomiting. Doctors commonly prescribe options 
to help manage these side-effects, such as strong anti-nausea medications. For hair loss, devices called cold caps 
can help lower the temperature around the head and 
constrict blood vessels, limiting the amount of chemotherapy 
drugs that reach hair follicles. And once a course of chemo 
treatment is over, the healthy tissues that’ve been badly 
affected by the drug will recover and begin to renew as usual. In 2018 alone, over 17 million people 
world-wide received a cancer diagnosis. But chemotherapy and other treatments 
have changed the outlook for so many. Just take the fact that up to 95% of 
individuals with testicular cancer survive it, thanks to advances 
in treatment. Even in people with acute myeloid 
leukemia— an aggressive blood cancer— chemotherapy puts an estimated 
60% of patients under 60 into remission following their 
first phase of treatment. Researchers are still developing 
more precise interventions that only target the intended 
cancer cells. That’ll help improve survival rates 
while leaving healthy tissues with reduced harm, making one of the best tools we have 
in the fight against cancer even better.

investigated this idea by injecting compounds derived 
from mustard gas into the veins of cancer patients. It took time and trial and error to find 
treatments that did more good than harm, but by the end of World War II, they discovered what became known 
as the first chemotherapy drugs. Today, there are more than 100. Chemotherapy drugs are delivered 
through pills and injections and use "cytotoxic agents," which means 
compounds that are toxic to living cells. Essentially, these medicines cause some 
level of harm to all cells in the body— even healthy ones. But they reserve their most powerful 
effects for rapidly-dividing cells, which is precisely the hallmark of cancer. Take, for example, those first 
chemotherapy drugs, which are still used today and 
are called alkylating agents. They’re injected into the bloodstream, which delivers them to 
cells all over the body. Once inside, when the cell exposes 
its DNA in order to copy it, they damage the building blocks of 
DNA’s double helix structure, which can lead to cell death unless 
the damage is repaired. Because cancer cells multiply rapidly, they take in a high concentration 
of alkylating agents, and their DNA is frequently exposed 
and rarely repaired. So they die off more often 
than most other cells, which have time to fix damaged DNA and don’t accumulate the same 
concentrations of alkylating agents. Another form of chemotherapy involves 
compounds called microtubule stabilizers. Cells have small tubes that assemble 
to help with cell division and DNA replication, then break back down. When microtubule stabilizers 
get inside a cell, they keep those tiny tubes 
from disassembling. That prevents the cell from completing 
its replication, leading to its death. These are just two examples of the six 
classes of chemotherapy drugs we use to treat cancer today. But despite its huge benefits, 
chemotherapy has one big disadvantage: it affects other healthy cells in the body
that naturally have to renew rapidly. Hair follicles, the cells of the mouth, 
the gastrointestinal lining, the reproductive system, and bone marrow 
are hit nearly as hard as cancer. Similar to cancer cells, the rapid 
production of these normal cells means that they’re reaching for 
resources more frequently— and are therefore more exposed to 
the effects of chemo drugs. That leads to several common side 
effects of chemotherapy, including hair loss, fatigue, infertility,
nausea, and vomiting. Doctors commonly prescribe options 
to help manage these side-effects, such as strong anti-nausea medications. For hair loss, devices called cold caps 
can help lower the temperature around the head and 
constrict blood vessels, limiting the amount of chemotherapy 
drugs that reach hair follicles. And once a course of chemo 
treatment is over, the healthy tissues that’ve been badly 
affected by the drug will recover and begin to renew as usual. In 2018 alone, over 17 million people 
world-wide received a cancer diagnosis. But chemotherapy and other treatments 
have changed the outlook for so many. Just take the fact that up to 95% of 
individuals with testicular cancer survive it, thanks to advances 
in treatment. Even in people with acute myeloid 
leukemia— an aggressive blood cancer— chemotherapy puts an estimated 
60% of patients under 60 into remission following their 
first phase of treatment. Researchers are still developing 
more precise interventions that only target the intended 
cancer cells. That’ll help improve survival rates 
while leaving healthy tissues with reduced harm, making one of the best tools we have 
in the fight against cancer even better.

During World War I, one of the 
horrors of trench warfare was a poisonous yellow cloud 
called mustard gas. For those unlucky enough to be exposed, it made the air impossible to breathe, 
burned their eyes, and caused huge blisters on exposed skin. Scientists tried desperately to develop an

**Transcript**:
In 1970, marijuana was classified 
as a schedule 1 drug in the United States: the strictest designation possible, meaning it was completely illegal 
and had no recognized medical uses. For decades, this view persisted and set back research 
on the drug's mechanisms and effects. Today, marijuana’s therapeutic benefits 
are widely acknowledged, and some nations 
have legalized medical use or are moving in that direction. But a growing recognition 
for marijuana’s medical value doesn’t answer the question: is recreational marijuana use 
bad for your brain? Marijuana acts 
on the body’s cannabinoid system, which has receptors 
all over the brain and body. Molecules native to the body, 
called endocannabinoids, also act on these receptors. We don’t totally understand 
the cannabinoid system, but it has one feature 
that provides a big clue to its function. Most neurotransmitters 
travel from one neuron to the next through a synapse to propagate a message. But endocannabinoids 
travel in the opposite direction. When a message passes 
from the one neuron to the next, the receiving neuron 
releases endocannabinoids. Those endocannabinoids 
travel backward to influence the sending neuron— essentially giving it feedback 
from the receiving neuron. This leads scientists 
to believe that the endocannabinoid system serves primarily 
to modulate other kinds of signals— amplifying some and diminishing others. Feedback from endocannabinoids 
slows down rates of neural signaling. That doesn’t necessarily mean it slows down behavior 
or perception, though. For example, 
slowing down a signal that inhibits smell could actually make smells more intense. Marijuana contains 
two main active compounds, tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, 
and cannabidiol, or CBD. THC is thought to be primarily responsible
for marijuana’s psychoactive effects on behavior, cognition, and perception, while CBD is responsible 
for the non-psychoactive effects. Like endocannabinoids, THC slows down signaling 
by binding to cannabinoid receptors. But it binds to receptors 
all over this sprawling, diffuse system at once, whereas endocannabinoids 
are released in a specific place in response to a specific stimulus. This widespread activity 
coupled with the fact that the cannabinoid system
indirectly affects many other systems, means that each person’s 
particular brain chemistry, genetics, and previous life experience largely determine 
how they experience the drug. That’s true much more so with marijuana 
than with other drugs that produce their effects 
through one or a few specific pathways. So the harmful effects, if any, 
vary considerably from person to person. And while we don’t know 
how exactly how marijuana produces specific harmful effects, there are clear risk factors 
that can increase peoples’ likelihood of experiencing them. The clearest risk factor is age. In people younger than 25, cannabinoid receptors 
are more concentrated in the white matter than in people over 25. The white matter 
is involved in communication, learning, memory, and emotions. Frequent marijuana use can disrupt the development 
of white matter tracts, and also affect the brain’s ability 
to grow new connections. This may damage long-term learning ability
and problem solving. For now, it’s unclear 
how severe this damage can be or whether it’s reversible. And even among young people, the risk is higher the younger someone is— much higher for a 15 year old 
than a 22 year old, for instance. Marijuana can also cause hallucinations 
or paranoid delusions. Known as marijuana-induced psychosis, these symptoms usually subside 
when a person stops using marijuana. But in rare cases, 
psychosis doesn’t subside, instead unmasking 
a persistent psychotic disorder. A family history of psychotic disorders, 
like schizophrenia, is the clearest, though not the only, 
risk factor for this effect. Marijuana-induced psychosis 
is also more common among young adults, though it’s worth noting 
that psychotic disorders usually surface in this age range anyway. What’s unclear in these cases 
is whether the psychotic disorder would have appeared 
without marijuana use— whether marijuana use triggers it early, is a catalyst for a tipping point 
that wouldn’t have been crossed otherwise, or whether the reaction 
to marijuana is merely an indication of an underlying disorder. In all likelihood, marijuana’s role 
varies from person to person. At any age, as with many other drugs, the brain and body become less sensitive 
to marijuana after repeated uses, meaning it takes more 
to achieve the same effects. Fortunately, unlike many other drugs, there’s no risk of fatal overdose 
from marijuana, and even heavy use 
doesn’t lead to debilitating or life-threatening 
withdrawal symptoms if use stops. There are more subtle forms 
of marijuana withdrawal, though, including sleep disturbances, 
irritability, and depressed mood, which pass 
within a few weeks of stopping use. So is marijuana bad for your brain? It depends who you are. But while some risk factors 
are easy to identify, others aren’t well understood— which means there’s still some possibility
of experiencing negative effects, even if you don’t have 
any of the known risk factors.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the active compounds in marijuana, and the correct answer is THC and CBD.

A generated MCQ that is somewhat related to this topic is Question 3: What is the effect of THC on the brain? Options: A. It speeds up neural signaling., B. It slows down rates of neural signaling., C. It has no effect on neural signaling., D. It increases the production of endocannabinoids.

However, this question does not ask about the active compounds in marijuana, but rather about the effect of THC on the brain.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ. But if I had to choose one that is somewhat related, I would say Question 3.

In 1970, marijuana was classified 
as a schedule 1 drug in the United States: the strictest designation possible, meaning it was completely illegal 
and had no recognized medical uses. For decades, this view persisted and set back research 
on the drug's mechanisms and effects. Today, marijuana’s therapeutic benefits 
are widely acknowledged, and some nations 
have legalized medical use or are moving in that direction. But a growing recognition 
for marijuana’s medical value doesn’t answer the question: is recreational marijuana use 
bad for your brain? Marijuana acts 
on the body’s cannabinoid system, which has receptors 
all over the brain and body. Molecules native to the body, 
called endocannabinoids, also act on these receptors. We don’t totally understand 
the cannabinoid system, but it has one feature 
that provides a big clue to its function. Most neurotransmitters 
travel from one neuron to the next through a synapse to propagate a message. But endocannabinoids 
travel in the opposite direction. When a message passes 
from the one neuron to the next, the receiving neuron 
releases endocannabinoids. Those endocannabinoids 
travel backward to influence the sending neuron— essentially giving it feedback 
from the receiving neuron. This leads scientists 
to believe that the endocannabinoid system serves primarily 
to modulate other kinds of signals— amplifying some and diminishing others. Feedback from endocannabinoids 
slows down rates of neural signaling. That doesn’t necessarily mean it slows down behavior 
or perception, though. For example, 
slowing down a signal that inhibits smell could actually make smells more intense. Marijuana contains 
two main active compounds, tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, 
and cannabidiol, or CBD. THC is thought to be primarily responsible
for marijuana’s psychoactive effects on behavior, cognition, and perception, while CBD is responsible 
for the non-psychoactive effects. Like endocannabinoids, THC slows down signaling 
by binding to cannabinoid receptors. But it binds to receptors 
all over this sprawling, diffuse system at once, whereas endocannabinoids 
are released in a specific place in response to a specific stimulus. This widespread activity 
coupled with the fact that the cannabinoid system
indirectly affects many other systems, means that each person’s 
particular brain chemistry, genetics, and previous life experience largely determine 
how they experience the drug. That’s true much more so with marijuana 
than with other drugs that produce their effects 
through one or a few specific pathways. So the harmful effects, if any, 
vary considerably from person to person. And while we don’t know 
how exactly how marijuana produces specific harmful effects, there are clear risk factors 
that can increase peoples’ likelihood of experiencing them. The clearest risk factor is age. In people younger than 25, cannabinoid receptors 
are more concentrated in the white matter than in people over 25. The white matter 
is involved in communication, learning, memory, and emotions. Frequent marijuana use can disrupt the development 
of white matter tracts, and also affect the brain’s ability 
to grow new connections. This may damage long-term learning ability
and problem solving. For now, it’s unclear 
how severe this damage can be or whether it’s reversible. And even among young people, the risk is higher the younger someone is— much higher for a 15 year old 
than a 22 year old, for instance. Marijuana can also cause hallucinations 
or paranoid delusions. Known as marijuana-induced psychosis, these symptoms usually subside 
when a person stops using marijuana. But in rare cases, 
psychosis doesn’t subside, instead unmasking 
a persistent psychotic disorder. A family history of psychotic disorders, 
like schizophrenia, is the clearest, though not the only, 
risk factor for this effect. Marijuana-induced psychosis 
is also more common among young adults, though it’s worth noting 
that psychotic disorders usually surface in this age range anyway. What’s unclear in these cases 
is whether the psychotic disorder would have appeared 
without marijuana use— whether marijuana use triggers it early, is a catalyst for a tipping point 
that wouldn’t have been crossed otherwise, or whether the reaction 
to marijuana is merely an indication of an underlying disorder. In all likelihood, marijuana’s role 
varies from person to person. At any age, as with many other drugs, the brain and body become less sensitive 
to marijuana after repeated uses, meaning it takes more 
to achieve the same effects. Fortunately, unlike many other drugs, there’s no risk of fatal overdose 
from marijuana, and even heavy use 
doesn’t lead to debilitating or life-threatening 
withdrawal symptoms if use stops. There are more subtle forms 
of marijuana withdrawal, though, including sleep disturbances, 
irritability, and depressed mood, which pass 
within a few weeks of stopping use. So is marijuana bad for your brain? It depends who you are. But while some risk factors 
are easy to identify, others aren’t well understood— which means there’s still some possibility
of experiencing negative effects, even if you don’t have 
any of the known risk factors.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: What is the primary risk factor for experiencing negative effects from marijuana use? Options: A. Age., B. Family history of psychotic disorders., C. Frequent marijuana use., D. All of the above.**

Although the options are not identical, the question intent and content are similar to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the age at which cannabinoid receptors are more concentrated in the white matter, while the generated MCQ asks about the primary risk factor for experiencing negative effects from marijuana use, which is related to age.

However, a more similar question is not available in the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar, but it's not a perfect match.

If I had to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

**Question: At what age are cannabinoid receptors more concentrated in the white matter? Options: A. 18, B. 25, C. 14, D. 40**

This question is not available in the generated MCQs, but it would be a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ.

Since I have to choose from the available generated MCQs, I will select Question 4 as the most similar, but please note that it's not a perfect match.

are easy to identify, others aren’t well understood— which means there’s still some possibility
of experiencing negative effects, even if you don’t have 
any of the known risk factors.

**Transcript**:
Meet Lucy. She was a math major in college, and aced all her courses in probability 
and statistics. Which do you think is more likely: that 
Lucy is a portrait artist, or that Lucy is a portrait artist 
who also plays poker? In studies of similar questions, up to 80 
percent of participants chose the equivalent 
of the second statement: that Lucy is a portrait artist 
who also plays poker. After all, nothing we know about Lucy 
suggests an affinity for art, but statistics and probability 
are useful in poker. And yet, this is the wrong answer. Look at the options again. How do we know the first statement 
is more likely to be true? Because it’s a less specific version 
of the second statement. Saying that Lucy is a portrait artist 
doesn’t make any claims about what else she might or might not do. But even though it’s far easier to imagine
her playing poker than making art based on the background information, the second statement is only true if she 
does both of these things. However counterintuitive it seems 
to imagine Lucy as an artist, the second scenario adds another condition
on top of that, making it less likely. For any possible set of events, the 
likelihood of A occurring will always be greater than the likelihood
of A and B both occurring. If we took a random sample of a million 
people who majored in math, the subset who are portrait artists might 
be relatively small. But it will necessarily be bigger than the subset who are portrait artists 
and play poker. Anyone who belongs to the second group 
will also belong to the first– but not vice versa. The more conditions there are, 
the less likely an event becomes. So why do statements with more conditions
sometimes seem more believable? This is a phenomenon known as 
the conjunction fallacy. When we’re asked to make quick decisions, 
we tend to look for shortcuts. In this case, we look for what seems 
plausible rather than what is statistically 
most probable. On its own, Lucy being an artist doesn’t 
match the expectations formed by the preceding information. The additional detail about 
her playing poker gives us a narrative that resonates 
with our intuitions— it makes it seem more plausible. And we choose the option that seems more
representative of the overall picture, regardless of its actual probability. This effect has been observed 
across multiple studies, including ones with participants 
who understood statistics well– from students betting on 
sequences of dice rolls, to foreign policy experts predicting 
the likelihood of a diplomatic crisis. The conjunction fallacy isn’t just a 
problem in hypothetical situations. Conspiracy theories and false news stories often rely on a version of the conjunction
fallacy to seem credible– the more resonant details are added 
to an outlandish story, the more plausible it begins to seem. But ultimately, the likelihood 
a story is true can never be greater than the probability 
that its least likely component is true.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Here's why:

- Question intent: Both the ground truth MCQ and Question 3 are asking about the likelihood of two statements regarding Lucy's occupation and hobbies.
- Options: Although the options are not identical, Question 3's options address the same concept as the ground truth MCQ, which is the comparison of the likelihood of two statements about Lucy.
- Content: Question 3 is the only generated MCQ that directly addresses the concept of specificity and its relation to the likelihood of a statement, which is the main idea behind the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that Question 3's options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ's options, and the correct answer is not explicitly stated. Nevertheless, among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 5: What happens when we look for shortcuts when making quick decisions?**

Although the question stem is not an exact match, the intent and content of this generated MCQ are closest to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the reasons for the conjunction fallacy, and one of the correct reasons is "Making snap judgments based on believability rather than calculation" (Option A). Similarly, Question 5 asks about what happens when we look for shortcuts when making quick decisions, and the correct answer is "We look for what seems plausible" (Option B), which is related to making snap judgments based on believability.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 5, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Meet Lucy. She was a math major in college, and aced all her courses in probability 
and statistics. Which do you think is more likely: that 
Lucy is a portrait artist, or that Lucy is a portrait artist 
who also plays poker? In studies of similar questions, up to 80 
percent of participants chose the equivalent 
of the second statement: that Lucy is a portrait artist 
who also plays poker. After all, nothing we know about Lucy 
suggests an affinity for art, but statistics and probability 
are useful in poker. And yet, this is the wrong answer. Look at the options again. How do we know the first statement 
is more likely to be true? Because it’s a less specific version 
of the second statement. Saying that Lucy is a portrait artist 
doesn’t make any claims about what else she might or might not do. But even though it’s far easier to imagine
her playing poker than making art based on the background information, the second statement is only true if she 
does both of these things. However counterintuitive it seems 
to imagine Lucy as an artist, the second scenario adds another condition
on top of that, making it less likely. For any possible set of events, the 
likelihood of A occurring will always be greater than the likelihood
of A and B both occurring. If we took a random sample of a million 
people who majored in math, the subset who are portrait artists might 
be relatively small. But it will necessarily be bigger than the subset who are portrait artists 
and play poker. Anyone who belongs to the second group 
will also belong to the first– but not vice versa. The more conditions there are, 
the less likely an event becomes. So why do statements with more conditions
sometimes seem more believable? This is a phenomenon known as 
the conjunction fallacy. When we’re asked to make quick decisions, 
we tend to look for shortcuts. In this case, we look for what seems 
plausible rather than what is statistically 
most probable. On its own, Lucy being an artist doesn’t 
match the expectations formed by the preceding information. The additional detail about 
her playing poker gives us a narrative that resonates 
with our intuitions— it makes it seem more plausible. And we choose the option that seems more
representative of the overall picture, regardless of its actual probability. This effect has been observed 
across multiple studies, including ones with participants 
who understood statistics well– from students betting on 
sequences of dice rolls, to foreign policy experts predicting 
the likelihood of a diplomatic crisis. The conjunction fallacy isn’t just a 
problem in hypothetical situations. Conspiracy theories and false news stories often rely on a version of the conjunction
fallacy to seem credible– the more resonant details are added 
to an outlandish story, the more plausible it begins to seem. But ultimately, the likelihood 
a story is true can never be greater than the probability 
that its least likely component is true.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 7: According to the transcript, what is the likelihood of A occurring compared to the likelihood of A and B both occurring? Options: A. The likelihood of A and B both occurring is greater, B. The likelihood of A and B both occurring is the same, C. The likelihood of A is greater, D. The likelihood of A and B both occurring is less**

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it:

1. Deals with the concept of likelihood and probability.
2. Compares the likelihood of A occurring with the likelihood of A and B both occurring.
3. Has options that reflect the correct relationship between the likelihood of A and A and B (i.e., the likelihood of A is greater).

However, it's worth noting that Question 7 is not an exact match to the ground truth MCQ, as it doesn't explicitly ask which statement does NOT explain why A is always more likely than A and B. Nevertheless, it's the closest match among the generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
In 1948, Spanish ophthalmologist 
Jose Ignacio Barraquer Moner was fed up with glasses. He wanted a solution for blurry 
vision that fixed the eye itself, without relying on external aids. But the surgery he eventually devised 
was not for the faint of heart. Barraquer began by slicing off the front
of a patient’s cornea and dunking it in liquid nitrogen. Using a miniature lathe, he ground the 
frozen cornea into the precise shape necessary to focus
the patient’s vision. Then he thawed the disc, and sewed 
it back on. Barraquer called this procedure 
keratomileusis, from the Greek words for “carving” 
and “cornea.” And though it might sound grisly, 
his technique produced reliable results. So how did Barraquer’s surgery work? Keratomileusis corrects what are called 
refractive errors: imperfections in the way the eye focuses 
incoming light. Ideally, the cornea and lens work 
together to focus light on the surface of the retina, but several kinds of refractive errors 
can impair this delicate system. In people with myopia, 
or short-sightedness, a steep cornea focuses light just short 
of the retina. Those with hyperopia, or far-sightedness, 
have the opposite problem: light is focused too far 
beyond the retina. And in people with astigmatism, 
the cornea has two different curvatures which focus light at two distances and 
produce blurry vision. Even those with perfect vision will 
eventually suffer from presbyopia, or “aging eyes.” As the proteins in the lens age, they 
slowly increase its size. By an adult’s mid-40’s, the lens is too
large to easily change shape and shift focus. Glasses and contact lenses bend light 
to compensate for these refractive errors. But, as Barraquer’s procedure shows, we can also alter the shape 
of the cornea itself; moving the focal point backwards, 
forwards, or pulling a divided image together. And thankfully, modern eye surgeons can 
sculpt the cornea with far less invasive tools. In corrective laser eye surgery, surgeons 
rely on excimer lasers. These tools are accurate enough to etch 
words into a human hair. To safely accomplish these 
ultra-fine incisions, they use a technique called photoablation. This allows the laser to essentially 
evaporate organic tissue without overheating 
surrounding eye tissue. So how does laser eye surgery 
actually work? The first step is to separate a thin layer
from the front of the cornea. This can be done with either a flat, 
wide blade, or a femto-second laser that produces millions of tiny plasma 
bubbles to create a plane beneath 
the corneal surface. Surgeons then lift the flap to expose the 
inside of the cornea. Guided by the refractive error and the 
shape of the cornea, the excimer laser robotically sculpts the
exposed corneal bed into the correct shape. This process usually takes less than 30 
seconds for each eye. Finally, the flap is closed, and its edges reseal themselves 
in just a few hours. Because the lasering is done on 
the eyeball itself, it’s described as “in situ,” or “on site.” Its complete name is “laser in-situ 
keratomileusis” – but you probably know it as LASIK. Essentially, this technique carves a 
patient’s contact lens prescription onto their cornea. Like any surgical procedure, LASIK comes with certain risks. Some patients experience slightly blurred
vision that can’t be corrected by glasses. But the technique is currently about 
as likely to damage your eyes as wearing daily disposable contact 
lenses for one year. Today, a technique called SMILE enables 
surgeons to sculpt the cornea through even smaller incisions – further reducing recovery time. And lasers aren’t just correcting the 
three types of refractive errors – this technology can also 
restore aging eyes. In a technique called Laser 
Blended Vision, surgeons adjust one eye to be slightly 
better at distance vision and the other to be better 
at close range vision. The difference between the two eyes is 
small enough that most patients can merge their vision, allowing both eyes to work 
together at all distances. Advances in laser technology continue 
to make vision correction surgery more effective and accessible. One day soon, Barraquer’s vision of a 
world without glasses may finally come true.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ's intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the conditions that LASIK can treat, in addition to far-sightedness and short-sightedness. The correct answer is "All of the above," which includes astigmatism, age-related decreased reading ability, myopia, and hyperopia.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 partially matches the ground truth MCQ's content, as it asks about the term for the condition where the proteins in the lens age and increase its size, making it difficult to focus. However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ's intent, as it only asks about one specific condition (presbyopia).

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ's intent and content. Therefore, I must conclude that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 9, which is about presbyopia, a condition that is mentioned in the ground truth MCQ's options.

Jose Ignacio Barraquer Moner was fed up with glasses. He wanted a solution for blurry 
vision that fixed the eye itself, without relying on external aids. But the surgery he eventually devised 
was not for the faint of heart. Barraquer began by slicing off the front
of a patient’s cornea and dunking it in liquid nitrogen. Using a miniature lathe, he ground the 
frozen cornea into the precise shape necessary to focus
the patient’s vision. Then he thawed the disc, and sewed 
it back on. Barraquer called this procedure 
keratomileusis, from the Greek words for “carving” 
and “cornea.” And though it might sound grisly, 
his technique produced reliable results. So how did Barraquer’s surgery work? Keratomileusis corrects what are called 
refractive errors: imperfections in the way the eye focuses 
incoming light. Ideally, the cornea and lens work 
together to focus light on the surface of the retina, but several kinds of refractive errors 
can impair this delicate system. In people with myopia, 
or short-sightedness, a steep cornea focuses light just short 
of the retina. Those with hyperopia, or far-sightedness, 
have the opposite problem: light is focused too far 
beyond the retina. And in people with astigmatism, 
the cornea has two different curvatures which focus light at two distances and 
produce blurry vision. Even those with perfect vision will 
eventually suffer from presbyopia, or “aging eyes.” As the proteins in the lens age, they 
slowly increase its size. By an adult’s mid-40’s, the lens is too
large to easily change shape and shift focus. Glasses and contact lenses bend light 
to compensate for these refractive errors. But, as Barraquer’s procedure shows, we can also alter the shape 
of the cornea itself; moving the focal point backwards, 
forwards, or pulling a divided image together. And thankfully, modern eye surgeons can 
sculpt the cornea with far less invasive tools. In corrective laser eye surgery, surgeons 
rely on excimer lasers. These tools are accurate enough to etch 
words into a human hair. To safely accomplish these 
ultra-fine incisions, they use a technique called photoablation. This allows the laser to essentially 
evaporate organic tissue without overheating 
surrounding eye tissue. So how does laser eye surgery 
actually work? The first step is to separate a thin layer
from the front of the cornea. This can be done with either a flat, 
wide blade, or a femto-second laser that produces millions of tiny plasma 
bubbles to create a plane beneath 
the corneal surface. Surgeons then lift the flap to expose the 
inside of the cornea. Guided by the refractive error and the 
shape of the cornea, the excimer laser robotically sculpts the
exposed corneal bed into the correct shape. This process usually takes less than 30 
seconds for each eye. Finally, the flap is closed, and its edges reseal themselves 
in just a few hours. Because the lasering is done on 
the eyeball itself, it’s described as “in situ,” or “on site.” Its complete name is “laser in-situ 
keratomileusis” – but you probably know it as LASIK. Essentially, this technique carves a 
patient’s contact lens prescription onto their cornea. Like any surgical procedure, LASIK comes with certain risks. Some patients experience slightly blurred
vision that can’t be corrected by glasses. But the technique is currently about 
as likely to damage your eyes as wearing daily disposable contact 
lenses for one year. Today, a technique called SMILE enables 
surgeons to sculpt the cornea through even smaller incisions – further reducing recovery time. And lasers aren’t just correcting the 
three types of refractive errors – this technology can also 
restore aging eyes. In a technique called Laser 
Blended Vision, surgeons adjust one eye to be slightly 
better at distance vision and the other to be better 
at close range vision. The difference between the two eyes is 
small enough that most patients can merge their vision, allowing both eyes to work 
together at all distances. Advances in laser technology continue 
to make vision correction surgery more effective and accessible. One day soon, Barraquer’s vision of a 
world without glasses may finally come true.

**Transcript**:
Asgard, a realm of wonders, was where 
the Norse Gods made their home. There Odin’s great hall of Valhalla 
towered above the mountains and Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, 
anchored itself. But though their domain was magnificent, it stood undefended from the giants 
and trolls of Jotunheim, who despised the gods and 
sought to destroy them. One day when Thor, strongest of the 
gods, was off fighting these foes, a stranger appeared, 
riding a powerful gray horse. The visitor made the gods 
an astonishing offer. He would build them the greatest 
wall they’d ever seen, higher than any giant could climb 
and stronger than any troll could break. All he asked in return was the beautiful 
goddess Freya’s hand in marriage— along with the sun and moon from the sky. The gods balked at this request 
and were ready to send him away. But the trickster Loki 
concocted a devious plan. He told the gods they should 
accept the stranger’s offer, but set such strict conditions that he 
would fail to complete the wall in time. That way, they would lose nothing, while 
getting most of the wall built for free. Freya didn’t like this idea at all, but Odin and the other 
gods were convinced and came to an agreement 
with the builder. He would only have one winter 
to complete the wall. If any part was unfinished by 
the first day of summer, he would receive no payment. And he could have no help 
from any other people. The gods sealed the deal with solemn oaths and swore the mason would come 
to no harm in Asgard. In the morning, the stranger began to dig 
the foundations at an astonishing speed, and at nightfall he set off towards the 
mountains to obtain the building stones. But it was only the next morning, 
when they saw him returning, that the gods began to worry. As agreed, no other people 
were helping the mason. But his horse Svadilfari was hauling 
a load of stones so massive it left trenches in the ground 
behind them. Winter came and went. The stranger kept building, 
Svadilfari kept hauling, and neither snow nor rain could 
slow their progress. With only three days left until summer, 
the wall stood high and impenetrable, with only the gate left to be built. Horrified, the gods realized that not 
only would they lose their fertility goddess forever, but without the sun and moon the world 
would be plunged into eternal darkness. They wondered why they’d made 
such a foolish wager— and then remembered Loki 
and his terrible advice. Suddenly, Loki didn’t feel so clever. All of his fellow gods threatened him 
with an unimaginably painful death if he didn’t find some way to prevent 
the builder from getting his payment. So Loki promised to take care of the 
situation, and dashed away. Outside, night had fallen, and the builder prepared to set off 
to retrieve the final load of stones. But just as he called Svadilfari to him, 
a mare appeared in the field. She was so beautiful that 
Svadilfari ignored his master and broke free of his reins. The mason tried to catch him, but the mare ran deep into the 
woods and Svadilfari followed. The stranger was furious. He knew that the gods were behind 
this and confronted them: no longer as a mild-mannered mason, but in his true form as a terrifying 
mountain giant. This was a big mistake. Thor had just returned to Asgard, and now that the gods knew 
a giant was in their midst, they disregarded their oaths. The only payment the 
builder would receive— and the last thing he would ever see— was the swing of Thor’s 
mighty hammer Mjolnir. As they set the final stones into the 
wall, the gods celebrated their victory. Loki was not among them, however. Several months would pass 
before he finally returned, followed by a beautiful gray 
foal with eight legs. The foal would grow into a magnificent 
steed named Sleipnir and become Odin’s mount, a horse 
that could outrun the wind itself. But exactly where he had come from was 
something Loki preferred not to discuss.

and trolls of Jotunheim, who despised the gods and 
sought to destroy them. One day when Thor, strongest of the 
gods, was off fighting these foes, a stranger appeared, 
riding a powerful gray horse. The visitor made the gods 
an astonishing offer. He would build them the greatest 
wall they’d ever seen, higher than any giant could climb 
and stronger than any troll could break. All he asked in return was the beautiful 
goddess Freya’s hand in marriage— along with the sun and moon from the sky. The gods balked at this request 
and were ready to send him away. But the trickster Loki 
concocted a devious plan. He told the gods they should 
accept the stranger’s offer, but set such strict conditions that he 
would fail to complete the wall in time. That way, they would lose nothing, while 
getting most of the wall built for free. Freya didn’t like this idea at all, but Odin and the other 
gods were convinced and came to an agreement 
with the builder. He would only have one winter 
to complete the wall. If any part was unfinished by 
the first day of summer, he would receive no payment. And he could have no help 
from any other people. The gods sealed the deal with solemn oaths and swore the mason would come 
to no harm in Asgard. In the morning, the stranger began to dig 
the foundations at an astonishing speed, and at nightfall he set off towards the 
mountains to obtain the building stones. But it was only the next morning, 
when they saw him returning, that the gods began to worry. As agreed, no other people 
were helping the mason. But his horse Svadilfari was hauling 
a load of stones so massive it left trenches in the ground 
behind them. Winter came and went. The stranger kept building, 
Svadilfari kept hauling, and neither snow nor rain could 
slow their progress. With only three days left until summer, 
the wall stood high and impenetrable, with only the gate left to be built. Horrified, the gods realized that not 
only would they lose their fertility goddess forever, but without the sun and moon the world 
would be plunged into eternal darkness. They wondered why they’d made 
such a foolish wager— and then remembered Loki 
and his terrible advice. Suddenly, Loki didn’t feel so clever. All of his fellow gods threatened him 
with an unimaginably painful death if he didn’t find some way to prevent 
the builder from getting his payment. So Loki promised to take care of the 
situation, and dashed away. Outside, night had fallen, and the builder prepared to set off 
to retrieve the final load of stones. But just as he called Svadilfari to him, 
a mare appeared in the field. She was so beautiful that 
Svadilfari ignored his master and broke free of his reins. The mason tried to catch him, but the mare ran deep into the 
woods and Svadilfari followed. The stranger was furious. He knew that the gods were behind 
this and confronted them: no longer as a mild-mannered mason, but in his true form as a terrifying 
mountain giant. This was a big mistake. Thor had just returned to Asgard, and now that the gods knew 
a giant was in their midst, they disregarded their oaths. The only payment the 
builder would receive— and the last thing he would ever see— was the swing of Thor’s 
mighty hammer Mjolnir. As they set the final stones into the 
wall, the gods celebrated their victory. Loki was not among them, however. Several months would pass 
before he finally returned, followed by a beautiful gray 
foal with eight legs. The foal would grow into a magnificent 
steed named Sleipnir and become Odin’s mount, a horse 
that could outrun the wind itself. But exactly where he had come from was 
something Loki preferred not to discuss.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: What did the stranger offer to build for the Norse Gods in exchange for Freya's hand in marriage and the sun and moon?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the goddess the builder asked to marry, while Question 4 mentions Freya as part of the exchange offered by the stranger.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 4, but with the understanding that it is not an exact match.

You know that little pink thing nestled 
in the corner of your eye? It’s actually the remnant 
of a third eyelid. Known as the “plica semilunaris,” it’s much more prominent in birds 
and a few mammals, and functions like a windshield wiper 
to keep dust and debris out of their eyes. But in humans, it doesn’t work. It’s vestigial, meaning it no longer 
serves its original purpose. There are several other vestigial 
structures like the plica semilunaris in the human body. Most of these became vestigial long 
before homo sapiens existed, quietly riding along from one of 
our ancestor species to the next. But why have they stuck 
around for so long? To answer this question, it helps to 
understand natural selection. Natural selection simply means that traits which help an organism survive and 
reproduce in a given environment are more likely to make it to the 
next generation. As the environment changes, traits 
that were once useful can become harmful. Those traits are often selected against, meaning they gradually disappear 
from the population. But if a trait isn’t actively harmful, 
it might not get selected against, and stick around even 
though it isn’t useful. Take the tailbone. Evolutionary biologists think that as the 
climate got drier and grasslands popped up, our tail-bearing ancestors left the trees 
and started walking on land. The tails that had helped them 
in the trees began to disrupt their ability 
to walk on land. So individuals with mutations that reduced
the length of their tails became more successful at life on land, surviving long enough to pass their short 
tails on to the next generation. The change was likely gradual over 
millions of years until, about 20 million years ago, our ancestors’ external tails disappeared 
altogether. Today, we know human embryos have tails
that dissolve as the embryo develops. But the stubby tailbone sticks around, probably because it doesn’t 
cause any harm— in fact, it serves a more minor function as the anchor point for certain 
other muscles. Up to 85% of people have a vestigial 
muscle called the “palmaris longus.” To see if you do, put your hand down on a flat surface 
and touch your pinkie to your thumb. If you see a little band pop up in the 
middle of your wrist, that’s the tendon that attaches to this 
now-defunct muscle. In this case, the fact that not everyone 
has it has helped us trace its function. Vestigial traits can persist when there’s 
no incentive to lose them— but since there’s also no incentive 
to keep them, random mutations will sometimes still
eliminate them from part of the population. Looking at our primate relatives, we can see that the palmaris longus 
is sometimes absent in those that spend more time on the land, but always present in those that spend 
more time in trees. So we think it used to help us swing 
from branch to branch, and became unnecessary when 
we moved down to land. The appendix, meanwhile, may once have 
been part of the intestinal system our ancestors used for digesting 
plant materials. As their diets changed, those parts of the
intestinal system began to shrink. Unlike other vestigial structures, though,
the appendix isn’t always harmless— it can become dangerously inflamed. For most of human history, a burst 
appendix could be a death sentence. So why did it stick around? It’s possible that it was very slowly on 
its way out, or that mutations simply hadn’t arisen 
to make it smaller. Or maybe it has other benefits— for example, it might still be a reservoir
of bacteria that helps us break down food. But the fact is, we’re not really sure why
the appendix persists. Evolution is an imperfect process. Human beings are the result of millions of
years of trial, error, and random chance— and we’re full of evolutionary relics 
to remind us of that.

climate got drier and grasslands popped up, our tail-bearing ancestors left the trees 
and started walking on land. The tails that had helped them 
in the trees began to disrupt their ability 
to walk on land. So individuals with mutations that reduced
the length of their tails became more successful at life on land, surviving long enough to pass their short 
tails on to the next generation. The change was likely gradual over 
millions of years until, about 20 million years ago, our ancestors’ external tails disappeared 
altogether. Today, we know human embryos have tails
that dissolve as the embryo develops. But the stubby tailbone sticks around, probably because it doesn’t 
cause any harm— in fact, it serves a more minor function as the anchor point for certain 
other muscles. Up to 85% of people have a vestigial 
muscle called the “palmaris longus.” To see if you do, put your hand down on a flat surface 
and touch your pinkie to your thumb. If you see a little band pop up in the 
middle of your wrist, that’s the tendon that attaches to this 
now-defunct muscle. In this case, the fact that not everyone 
has it has helped us trace its function. Vestigial traits can persist when there’s 
no incentive to lose them— but since there’s also no incentive 
to keep them, random mutations will sometimes still
eliminate them from part of the population. Looking at our primate relatives, we can see that the palmaris longus 
is sometimes absent in those that spend more time on the land, but always present in those that spend 
more time in trees. So we think it used to help us swing 
from branch to branch, and became unnecessary when 
we moved down to land. The appendix, meanwhile, may once have 
been part of the intestinal system our ancestors used for digesting 
plant materials. As their diets changed, those parts of the
intestinal system began to shrink. Unlike other vestigial structures, though,
the appendix isn’t always harmless— it can become dangerously inflamed. For most of human history, a burst 
appendix could be a death sentence. So why did it stick around? It’s possible that it was very slowly on 
its way out, or that mutations simply hadn’t arisen 
to make it smaller. Or maybe it has other benefits— for example, it might still be a reservoir
of bacteria that helps us break down food. But the fact is, we’re not really sure why
the appendix persists. Evolution is an imperfect process. Human beings are the result of millions of
years of trial, error, and random chance— and we’re full of evolutionary relics 
to remind us of that.

**Transcript**:
You know that little pink thing nestled 
in the corner of your eye? It’s actually the remnant 
of a third eyelid. Known as the “plica semilunaris,” it’s much more prominent in birds 
and a few mammals, and functions like a windshield wiper 
to keep dust and debris out of their eyes. But in humans, it doesn’t work. It’s vestigial, meaning it no longer 
serves its original purpose. There are several other vestigial 
structures like the plica semilunaris in the human body. Most of these became vestigial long 
before homo sapiens existed, quietly riding along from one of 
our ancestor species to the next. But why have they stuck 
around for so long? To answer this question, it helps to 
understand natural selection. Natural selection simply means that traits which help an organism survive and 
reproduce in a given environment are more likely to make it to the 
next generation. As the environment changes, traits 
that were once useful can become harmful. Those traits are often selected against, meaning they gradually disappear 
from the population. But if a trait isn’t actively harmful, 
it might not get selected against, and stick around even 
though it isn’t useful. Take the tailbone. Evolutionary biologists think that as the 
climate got drier and grasslands popped up, our tail-bearing ancestors left the trees

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4: Why did the external tails of human ancestors disappear?

Although this question does not directly ask when humans lost their tails, one of its options (C) mentions that individuals with shorter tails became more successful, which is related to the process of losing tails. Moreover, the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ (20 million years ago) is mentioned in the transcript as the time when human ancestors' external tails disappeared.

However, a more relevant question would be one that directly asks about the time when humans lost their tails. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the given options, I would choose Question 4, but with the understanding that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A few months ago we posed a challenge 
to our community. We asked everyone: given a range of 
integers from 0 to 100, guess the whole number closest to 2/3 
of the average of all numbers guessed. So if the average of all guesses is 60, 
the correct guess will be 40. What number do you think was the 
correct guess at 2/3 of the average? Let’s see if we can try and reason 
our way to the answer. This game is played under conditions known
to game theorists as common knowledge. Not only does every player have 
the same information — they also know that everyone else does, and that everyone else knows that 
everyone else does, and so on, infinitely. Now, the highest possible average would 
occur if every person guessed 100. In that case, 2/3 of the average 
would be 66.66. Since everyone can figure this out, it wouldn’t make sense to guess 
anything higher than 67. If everyone playing comes to 
this same conclusion, no one will guess higher than 67. Now 67 is the new highest 
possible average, so no reasonable guess should be 
higher than ⅔ of that, which is 44. This logic can be extended further 
and further. With each step, the highest possible 
logical answer keeps getting smaller. So it would seem sensible to guess the 
lowest number possible. And indeed, if everyone chose zero, the game would reach what’s known 
as a Nash Equilibrium. This is a state where every player has 
chosen the best possible strategy for themselves given 
everyone else playing, and no individual player can benefit 
by choosing differently. But, that’s not what happens 
in the real world. People, as it turns out, either aren’t 
perfectly rational, or don’t expect each other 
to be perfectly rational. Or, perhaps, it’s some combination 
of the two. When this game is played in 
real-world settings, the average tends to be somewhere 
between 20 and 35. Danish newspaper Politiken ran the game 
with over 19,000 readers participating, resulting in an average of roughly 22, 
making the correct answer 14. For our audience, the average was 31.3. So if you guessed 21 as 2/3 of 
the average, well done. Economic game theorists have a 
way of modeling this interplay between rationality and practicality 
called k-level reasoning. K stands for the number of times a 
cycle of reasoning is repeated. A person playing at k-level 0 would 
approach our game naively, guessing a number at random without 
thinking about the other players. At k-level 1, a player would assume 
everyone else was playing at level 0, resulting in an average of 50, 
and thus guess 33. At k-level 2, they’d assume that everyone 
else was playing at level 1, leading them to guess 22. It would take 12 k-levels to reach 0. The evidence suggests that most 
people stop at 1 or 2 k-levels. And that’s useful to know, because k-level thinking comes into 
play in high-stakes situations. For example, stock traders evaluate stocks
not only based on earnings reports, but also on the value that others 
place on those numbers. And during penalty kicks in soccer, both the shooter and the goalie decide 
whether to go right or left based on what they think the other 
person is thinking. Goalies often memorize the patterns of 
their opponents ahead of time, but penalty shooters know that 
and can plan accordingly. In each case, participants must weigh 
their own understanding of the best course of action against how 
well they think other participants understand the situation. But 1 or 2 k-levels is by no means 
a hard and fast rule— simply being conscious of this tendency 
can make people adjust their expectations. For instance, what would happen 
if people played the 2/3 game after understanding the difference between
the most logical approach and the most common? Submit your own guess at what 2/3 
of the new average will be by using the form below, and we’ll find out.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the concept of k-level reasoning and the idea of playing at a certain level, I identified a generated MCQ that is related to the concept, but not an exact match.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 8: What is the average that a player would guess if they are playing at k-level 1? Options: A. 50, B. 33, C. 22, D. 14

However, this question does not directly address the concept of playing at a level higher than the opponents, as stated in the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ's intent would be:

"If you think your opponents are playing at level-3, then you want to play at level:"

Unfortunately, this question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Given the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one based on the concept of k-level reasoning, I would select Question 8, but with the understanding that it's not a direct match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 8 (with the caveat that it's not a direct match)

**Transcript**:
A few months ago we posed a challenge 
to our community. We asked everyone: given a range of 
integers from 0 to 100, guess the whole number closest to 2/3 
of the average of all numbers guessed. So if the average of all guesses is 60, 
the correct guess will be 40. What number do you think was the 
correct guess at 2/3 of the average? Let’s see if we can try and reason 
our way to the answer. This game is played under conditions known
to game theorists as common knowledge. Not only does every player have 
the same information — they also know that everyone else does, and that everyone else knows that 
everyone else does, and so on, infinitely. Now, the highest possible average would 
occur if every person guessed 100. In that case, 2/3 of the average 
would be 66.66. Since everyone can figure this out, it wouldn’t make sense to guess 
anything higher than 67. If everyone playing comes to 
this same conclusion, no one will guess higher than 67. Now 67 is the new highest 
possible average, so no reasonable guess should be 
higher than ⅔ of that, which is 44. This logic can be extended further 
and further. With each step, the highest possible 
logical answer keeps getting smaller. So it would seem sensible to guess the 
lowest number possible. And indeed, if everyone chose zero, the game would reach what’s known 
as a Nash Equilibrium. This is a state where every player has 
chosen the best possible strategy for themselves given 
everyone else playing, and no individual player can benefit 
by choosing differently. But, that’s not what happens 
in the real world. People, as it turns out, either aren’t 
perfectly rational, or don’t expect each other

If I had to generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would create something like:

Question: You and your friend are trying to meet up at a concert, but you didn't specify which entrance to meet at. You know that your friend likes the main entrance, but you also know that she knows that you like the side entrance. Under what scenarios do you need to apply k-level reasoning to figure out which entrance to go to?

Options: A. Your friend told you that she will meet you at the main entrance., B. You know that your friend likes the main entrance, but you're not sure if she'll go there., C. You and your friend discussed the entrances last week, but you're not sure if she remembers., D. All of the above

Correct Option: D

This new MCQ is similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content, as it is asking about a scenario where k-level reasoning is applied to figure out what the other person is thinking.

would be 66.66. Since everyone can figure this out, it wouldn’t make sense to guess 
anything higher than 67. If everyone playing comes to 
this same conclusion, no one will guess higher than 67. Now 67 is the new highest 
possible average, so no reasonable guess should be 
higher than ⅔ of that, which is 44. This logic can be extended further 
and further. With each step, the highest possible 
logical answer keeps getting smaller. So it would seem sensible to guess the 
lowest number possible. And indeed, if everyone chose zero, the game would reach what’s known 
as a Nash Equilibrium. This is a state where every player has 
chosen the best possible strategy for themselves given 
everyone else playing, and no individual player can benefit 
by choosing differently. But, that’s not what happens 
in the real world. People, as it turns out, either aren’t 
perfectly rational, or don’t expect each other 
to be perfectly rational. Or, perhaps, it’s some combination 
of the two. When this game is played in 
real-world settings, the average tends to be somewhere 
between 20 and 35. Danish newspaper Politiken ran the game 
with over 19,000 readers participating, resulting in an average of roughly 22, 
making the correct answer 14. For our audience, the average was 31.3. So if you guessed 21 as 2/3 of 
the average, well done. Economic game theorists have a 
way of modeling this interplay between rationality and practicality 
called k-level reasoning. K stands for the number of times a 
cycle of reasoning is repeated. A person playing at k-level 0 would 
approach our game naively, guessing a number at random without 
thinking about the other players. At k-level 1, a player would assume 
everyone else was playing at level 0, resulting in an average of 50, 
and thus guess 33. At k-level 2, they’d assume that everyone 
else was playing at level 1, leading them to guess 22. It would take 12 k-levels to reach 0. The evidence suggests that most 
people stop at 1 or 2 k-levels. And that’s useful to know, because k-level thinking comes into 
play in high-stakes situations. For example, stock traders evaluate stocks
not only based on earnings reports, but also on the value that others 
place on those numbers. And during penalty kicks in soccer, both the shooter and the goalie decide 
whether to go right or left based on what they think the other 
person is thinking. Goalies often memorize the patterns of 
their opponents ahead of time, but penalty shooters know that 
and can plan accordingly. In each case, participants must weigh 
their own understanding of the best course of action against how 
well they think other participants understand the situation. But 1 or 2 k-levels is by no means 
a hard and fast rule— simply being conscious of this tendency 
can make people adjust their expectations. For instance, what would happen 
if people played the 2/3 game after understanding the difference between
the most logical approach and the most common? Submit your own guess at what 2/3 
of the new average will be by using the form below, and we’ll find out.

**Transcript**:
Before the world of humans began, there was the world of the gods, 
made of fields, plains and gardens. Four brothers wandered this 
celestial realm. They had no family other 
than each other— they didn’t even know who 
their parents were. One of the brothers, Deminan, 
looked different from the others. His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone had 
been marked with this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit 
Yaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers snuck 
into Yaya’s house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted
a giant gourd hanging in the corner. But as they tried to look inside 
the gourd, they dropped it. The gourd broke apart, releasing a deluge 
that swept the brothers away, separating them from the 
celestial lands forever. The waters from the gourd 
formed a new world. This realm was covered in seas, 
which didn’t exist in the gods’ world. The waters were full of fish 
and other creatures, and dotted with islands and caves. This world of seas was also cut off 
completely from the celestial realm, and the brothers wandered aimlessly, even more lost than they had been before. One day, three of the brothers 
stumbled upon a house. In the house lived an elder named 
Bayamanacao, and he invited them in. When Deminan caught up slightly later, 
he followed them into the house. Bayamanacao told the brothers 
he was their grandfather and gave them a gift of special 
cassava bread. He revealed their family lineage to them: their mother had been the Earth Mother 
Goddess Itibi Cahubaba and had died when they were born. The brothers were grateful for his 
hospitality and insight into their past. But then Bayamanacao turned on Deminan, blowing tobacco spittle from his nose 
onto Deminan’s back. The spot where the spittle landed 
immediately began to swell and sting. Soon Deminan was delirious and his back was so swollen his 
brothers feared he would die. Not knowing what else to do, 
they cut open the welt. A turtle emerged from the 
wound and swam away, alternating easily between sea 
and land as she went. When Deminan recovered from his delirium, he finally understood what the 
curse of his disease meant: he was a caracaracol, 
able to communicate with the gods. He was the link between the celestial 
realm and the earthly realm. Deminan was the first in a long 
lineage of caracaracols. The world of seas he and his brothers 
had created when they dropped the gourd became the world of humans, where the caracaracols who followed 
Deminan maintained the delicate balance between people and gods. But their unique power came at a price: Deminan and all the caracaracols 
who followed him continued to suffer from the illness that 
had first marked Deminan as special. Represented in Taino carvings 
and figurines with a swollen back and emaciated arms, the caracaracol is both cursed and blessed
to be a conduit between worlds.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the most similar generated MCQ would be Question 5: What did Deminan learn was the meaning of his disease after he recovered? 

However, this question does not directly address the physical difference between Deminan and his brothers as stated in the ground truth MCQ. But among the provided options, Question 5 is the closest in terms of discussing Deminan's disease, which is related to his physical difference (scabby skin).

If I had to choose an index, I would say Question 5 is the closest match, but with a note that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Before the world of humans began, there was the world of the gods, 
made of fields, plains and gardens. Four brothers wandered this 
celestial realm. They had no family other 
than each other— they didn’t even know who 
their parents were. One of the brothers, Deminan, 
looked different from the others. His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone had 
been marked with this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit 
Yaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers snuck 
into Yaya’s house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted
a giant gourd hanging in the corner. But as they tried to look inside 
the gourd, they dropped it. The gourd broke apart, releasing a deluge 
that swept the brothers away, separating them from the 
celestial lands forever. The waters from the gourd 
formed a new world. This realm was covered in seas, 
which didn’t exist in the gods’ world. The waters were full of fish 
and other creatures, and dotted with islands and caves. This world of seas was also cut off 
completely from the celestial realm, and the brothers wandered aimlessly, even more lost than they had been before. One day, three of the brothers 
stumbled upon a house. In the house lived an elder named 
Bayamanacao, and he invited them in. When Deminan caught up slightly later, 
he followed them into the house. Bayamanacao told the brothers 
he was their grandfather and gave them a gift of special 
cassava bread. He revealed their family lineage to them: their mother had been the Earth Mother 
Goddess Itibi Cahubaba and had died when they were born. The brothers were grateful for his 
hospitality and insight into their past. But then Bayamanacao turned on Deminan, blowing tobacco spittle from his nose 
onto Deminan’s back. The spot where the spittle landed 
immediately began to swell and sting. Soon Deminan was delirious and his back was so swollen his 
brothers feared he would die. Not knowing what else to do, 
they cut open the welt. A turtle emerged from the 
wound and swam away, alternating easily between sea 
and land as she went. When Deminan recovered from his delirium, he finally understood what the 
curse of his disease meant: he was a caracaracol, 
able to communicate with the gods. He was the link between the celestial 
realm and the earthly realm. Deminan was the first in a long 
lineage of caracaracols. The world of seas he and his brothers 
had created when they dropped the gourd became the world of humans, where the caracaracols who followed 
Deminan maintained the delicate balance between people and gods. But their unique power came at a price: Deminan and all the caracaracols 
who followed him continued to suffer from the illness that 
had first marked Deminan as special. Represented in Taino carvings 
and figurines with a swollen back and emaciated arms, the caracaracol is both cursed and blessed
to be a conduit between worlds.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: What did Deminan learn was the meaning of his disease after he recovered? Options: A. He was cursed by the gods, B. He was the first caracaracol, C. He was able to communicate with the gods, D. He was the Earth Mother Goddess.

This question is similar in intent and content to the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the special gift of a caracaracol. Both questions are related to the unique ability of Deminan and the caracaracols, which is to communicate with the gods. The correct option in Question 5 (C) is also similar to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (C).

However, it's worth noting that Question 5 is not an exact match to the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about what Deminan learned about his disease, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the special gift of a caracaracol. Nevertheless, Question 5 is the most similar generated MCQ in terms of intent and content.

**Transcript**:
The year was 1776. In Bavaria, new ideals of rationalism, 
religious freedom, and universal human rights competed with the Catholic church’s 
heavy influence over public affairs. Across the Atlantic, a new nation staked its claim for 
independence on the basis of these ideas. But back in Bavaria, law professor Adam Weishaupt’s 
attempts to teach secular philosophy continued to be frustrated. Weishaupt decided to spread his ideas 
through a secret society that would shine a light on the 
shortcomings of the Church’s ideology. He called his secret society 
the Illuminati. Weishaupt modelled aspects of his secret 
society off a group called the Freemasons. Originally an elite stoneworkers’ 
guild in the late Middle Ages, the Freemasons had gone from passing 
down the craft of masonry to more generally promoting ideals of 
knowledge and reason. Over time, they had grown into a 
semi-secret, exclusive order that included many wealthy and 
influential individuals, with elaborate, secret initiation rituals. Weishaupt created his parallel 
society while also joining the Freemasons and recruiting from their ranks. He adopted the code name 
Spartacus for himself, after the famed leader of the 
Roman slave revolt. Early members became the Illuminati’s 
ruling council, or Areopagus. One of these members, Baron Adolph 
Knigge, was also a freemason, and became an influential recruiter. With Knigge’s help, the Illuminati 
expanded their numbers, gained influence within 
several Masonic chapters, and incorporated Masonic rituals. By 1784, there were over 600 members, including influential scholars 
and politicians. As the Illuminati gained members, the American Revolution also 
gained momentum. Thomas Jefferson would later cite 
Weishaupt as an inspiration. European monarchs and clergy were fearful 
of similar revolts on their home soil. Meanwhile, the existence of the Illuminati
had become an open secret. Both the Illuminati and the Freemasons 
drew exclusively from society’s wealthy elite, which meant they were constantly 
rubbing shoulders with members of the religious and 
political establishment. Many in the government and church 
believed that both groups were determined to undermine the 
people’s religious faith. But these groups didn’t necessarily 
oppose religion— they just believed it should be kept 
separate from governance. Still, the suspicious Bavarian government 
started keeping records of alleged members of the Illuminati. Just as Illuminati members begun to secure
important positions in local governments and universities, a 1784 decree by Duke Karl Theodor 
of Bavaria banned all secret societies. While a public ban on something ostensibly
secret might seem difficult to enforce, in this case it worked. Only nine years after its founding, the group dissolved, 
their records were seized, and Weishaupt forced into exile. The Illuminati would become more 
notorious in their afterlife than they had ever been in 
their brief existence. A decade later, in the aftermath 
of the French Revolution, conservative authors claimed the 
Illuminati had survived their banishment and orchestrated the overthrow 
of the monarchy. In the United States, preacher Jedidiah Morse promoted 
similar ideas of an Illuminati conspiracy against the government. But though the idea of a secret group 
orchestrating political upheaval is still alive and well today, there is no
evidence that the Illuminati survived, reformed, or went underground. Their brief tenure is well-documented 
in Bavarian government records, the still-active Freemasons’s records, and particularly the overlap between 
these two sources, without a whisper since. In the spirit of rationalism the 
Illuminati embraced, one must conclude they no longer exist. But the ideas that spurred Weishaupt 
to found the illuminati still spread, becoming the basis for many Western 
governments today. These ideas didn’t start or end 
with the Illuminati— instead, it was one community that 
represented a wave of change that was already underway 
when it was founded and continued long after it ended.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme or topic.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the Illuminati's ruling council, which is a specific piece of information. Among the generated MCQs, none of them directly ask about the ruling council.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the Illuminati's organization or structure, I would suggest Question 2: "What was the name of Adam Weishaupt's code name?" Options: A. Spartacus, B. Weishaupt, C. Knigge, D. Illuminati. This question is not directly related to the ruling council, but it does ask about a specific aspect of the Illuminati's organization, namely the code name of its founder.

But since this question does not match the ground truth MCQ's intent, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ.

If you'd like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the question intent, which is to identify the founder of the Illuminati, I can suggest a generated MCQ that contains relevant information.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 2, which mentions Adam Weishaupt's code name. Although it does not directly ask about the founder, it implies that Adam Weishaupt is the founder by mentioning his code name.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the founder or the law professor who founded the Illuminati. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this criteria.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 7 is the closest in terms of intent, as it asks about an influential person related to the Illuminati, but it's not about the founder.

But since none of the questions directly match the ground truth MCQ, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ.

However, if you insist on an answer, I would say that the closest match is Question 7, with the understanding that it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
The year was 1776. In Bavaria, new ideals of rationalism, 
religious freedom, and universal human rights competed with the Catholic church’s 
heavy influence over public affairs. Across the Atlantic, a new nation staked its claim for 
independence on the basis of these ideas. But back in Bavaria, law professor Adam Weishaupt’s 
attempts to teach secular philosophy continued to be frustrated. Weishaupt decided to spread his ideas 
through a secret society that would shine a light on the 
shortcomings of the Church’s ideology. He called his secret society 
the Illuminati. Weishaupt modelled aspects of his secret 
society off a group called the Freemasons. Originally an elite stoneworkers’ 
guild in the late Middle Ages, the Freemasons had gone from passing 
down the craft of masonry to more generally promoting ideals of 
knowledge and reason. Over time, they had grown into a 
semi-secret, exclusive order that included many wealthy and 
influential individuals, with elaborate, secret initiation rituals. Weishaupt created his parallel 
society while also joining the Freemasons and recruiting from their ranks. He adopted the code name 
Spartacus for himself, after the famed leader of the 
Roman slave revolt. Early members became the Illuminati’s 
ruling council, or Areopagus. One of these members, Baron Adolph 
Knigge, was also a freemason, and became an influential recruiter. With Knigge’s help, the Illuminati 
expanded their numbers, gained influence within 
several Masonic chapters, and incorporated Masonic rituals. By 1784, there were over 600 members, including influential scholars 
and politicians. As the Illuminati gained members, the American Revolution also 
gained momentum. Thomas Jefferson would later cite 
Weishaupt as an inspiration. European monarchs and clergy were fearful 
of similar revolts on their home soil. Meanwhile, the existence of the Illuminati
had become an open secret. Both the Illuminati and the Freemasons 
drew exclusively from society’s wealthy elite, which meant they were constantly 
rubbing shoulders with members of the religious and 
political establishment. Many in the government and church 
believed that both groups were determined to undermine the 
people’s religious faith. But these groups didn’t necessarily 
oppose religion— they just believed it should be kept 
separate from governance. Still, the suspicious Bavarian government 
started keeping records of alleged members of the Illuminati. Just as Illuminati members begun to secure
important positions in local governments and universities, a 1784 decree by Duke Karl Theodor 
of Bavaria banned all secret societies. While a public ban on something ostensibly
secret might seem difficult to enforce, in this case it worked. Only nine years after its founding, the group dissolved, 
their records were seized, and Weishaupt forced into exile. The Illuminati would become more 
notorious in their afterlife than they had ever been in 
their brief existence. A decade later, in the aftermath 
of the French Revolution, conservative authors claimed the 
Illuminati had survived their banishment and orchestrated the overthrow 
of the monarchy. In the United States, preacher Jedidiah Morse promoted 
similar ideas of an Illuminati conspiracy against the government. But though the idea of a secret group 
orchestrating political upheaval is still alive and well today, there is no
evidence that the Illuminati survived, reformed, or went underground. Their brief tenure is well-documented 
in Bavarian government records, the still-active Freemasons’s records, and particularly the overlap between 
these two sources, without a whisper since. In the spirit of rationalism the 
Illuminati embraced, one must conclude they no longer exist. But the ideas that spurred Weishaupt 
to found the illuminati still spread, becoming the basis for many Western 
governments today. These ideas didn’t start or end 
with the Illuminati— instead, it was one community that 
represented a wave of change that was already underway 
when it was founded and continued long after it ended.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme or topic.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the Illuminati's ruling council, which is a specific piece of information. Among the generated MCQs, none of them directly ask about the ruling council.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the Illuminati's organization or structure, I would suggest Question 2: "What was the name of Adam Weishaupt's code name?" Options: A. Spartacus, B. Weishaupt, C. Knigge, D. Illuminati. This question is not directly related to the ruling council, but it does ask about a specific aspect of the Illuminati's organization, namely the code name of its founder.

But since this question does not match the ground truth MCQ's intent, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ.

If you'd like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although Question 8 does not directly ask about the Illuminati's intentions regarding people's faith, it does address the reaction of European monarchs and clergy to the Illuminati, which is related to the ground truth MCQ's topic of the Illuminati's supposed goal of undermining people's faith. However, a more suitable generated MCQ that directly addresses the topic is not available.

A more ideal generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the Illuminati's stance on people's faith, with options that include "undermining people's faith" and "separating religion from governance." Since such a generated MCQ is not available, Question 8 is the closest match.

However, another possible match could be Question 4, as it does address the main ideas promoted by the Illuminati, which could be related to their intentions regarding people's faith.

It is essential to note that the generated MCQs provided do not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would require generated MCQs that directly address the topic of the Illuminati's intentions regarding people's faith.

**Transcript**:
Consider the claw. Frequently found on four-limbed 
animals around the world, it’s one of nature’s most 
versatile tools. Bears use claws for digging 
as well as defense. An eagle’s needle-like talons can pierce 
the skulls of their prey. And lions can retract their massive claws 
for easy movement, before flicking them out to hunt. Even the ancestors of primates used to 
wield these impressive appendages, until their claws evolved into nails. So what in our evolutionary past led to 
this manicured adaptation, and what can nails do that their 
sharper cousins can’t? When nails first appeared in the fossil 
record around 55.8 million years ago, claws had already been present for 
over 260 million years in the ancestors of mammals and reptiles. But despite the gulf of time between 
their emergence, these adaptations are both part of the 
same evolutionary story. Both nails and claws are made of keratin— a tough, fibrous protein also found in 
horns, scales, hooves and hair. This protein is produced by a wedge of 
tissue called the keratin matrix. Rich in blood vessels and nutrients, this protein factory produces an 
endless stream of keratin, which is tightly packed into cells 
called keratinocytes. These high-density cells give nails and 
claws their trademark toughness. Since nails evolved from claws, both adaptations produce keratinocytes 
in the same way. The cells grow out from the matrix, emerging from the skin where they die 
and harden into a water-resistant sheath. The primary difference between the 
two keratin coverings is really just their shape, which depends on the shape of the bone 
at the end of the animal’s digits. In claws, the bed of keratinocytes 
conforms to a narrow finger bone, wrapping around the end of the digit 
and radiating outwards to form a cone-shaped structure. Animals with nails, on the other hand, 
have much broader digits, and keratinocytes only cover the top 
surface of their wide bones. It’s possible that nails have simply 
persisted as a side effect of primates evolving wider, 
more dexterous fingers. But given what we know about the 
habitats of our primate ancestors, it’s more likely that nails came with 
their own powerful advantages. High in the forest canopy where 
these primates lived, wide finger bones and expansive 
finger pads were ideal for gripping narrow branches. And nails improved that grip even further. By providing a rigid surface 
to press against, primates could splay out their pads to 
create even more contact with the trees. Additionally, nails improved the 
sensitivity of their digits by providing an extra surface to detect 
changes in pressure while climbing. This combination of sensitivity 
and dexterity gave our ancestors the precise motor 
control needed to snatch up insects, pinch berries and seeds, and keep a 
firm grip on slim branches. The evolution of nails and the evolution 
of opposable thumbs and toes are closely linked. And when our ancestors moved 
down from the trees, this flexible grasp enabled them to create
and wield complex tools. Even if it was possible for wide 
fingers to sport claws, their sharp points would’ve 
likely interfered with these primates’ regular tasks. Claws are ideal for piercing, 
puncturing, and hooking, but their points make grabbing difficult, 
and potentially dangerous. However, both claws and nails are 
used in some unexpected ways. Manatees use nails to grasp their food, and researchers think elephant toenails 
may sense vibrations in the ground to help them hear. Meanwhile, some primates, 
like the aye-ayes of Madagascar, have re-acquired claws. They use these extra-long appendages 
to tap branches and trunks, while listening for hollow sections 
with their bat-like ears. When they hear an opening, 
they burrow into the tree and skewer grubs with their needle-like 
middle finger. We’ve only scratched the surface of all 
the incredible ways nails and claws are used throughout the animal kingdom. But as for which of these 
adaptations is better? That’s an answer we may never nail down.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of relevance to the topic.

The ground truth MCQ asks about which finger structure appears first in the fossil record, with options A. Nails and B. Claws. 

While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 5 does discuss the evolutionary history of nails and claws, although it does not directly address the question of which structure appeared first in the fossil record.

However, a more relevant question is not present among the generated MCQs, but Question 5 is the closest one.

Therefore, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not a direct match.

animals around the world, it’s one of nature’s most 
versatile tools. Bears use claws for digging 
as well as defense. An eagle’s needle-like talons can pierce 
the skulls of their prey. And lions can retract their massive claws 
for easy movement, before flicking them out to hunt. Even the ancestors of primates used to 
wield these impressive appendages, until their claws evolved into nails. So what in our evolutionary past led to 
this manicured adaptation, and what can nails do that their 
sharper cousins can’t? When nails first appeared in the fossil 
record around 55.8 million years ago, claws had already been present for 
over 260 million years in the ancestors of mammals and reptiles. But despite the gulf of time between 
their emergence, these adaptations are both part of the 
same evolutionary story. Both nails and claws are made of keratin— a tough, fibrous protein also found in 
horns, scales, hooves and hair. This protein is produced by a wedge of 
tissue called the keratin matrix. Rich in blood vessels and nutrients, this protein factory produces an 
endless stream of keratin, which is tightly packed into cells 
called keratinocytes. These high-density cells give nails and 
claws their trademark toughness. Since nails evolved from claws, both adaptations produce keratinocytes 
in the same way. The cells grow out from the matrix, emerging from the skin where they die 
and harden into a water-resistant sheath. The primary difference between the 
two keratin coverings is really just their shape, which depends on the shape of the bone 
at the end of the animal’s digits. In claws, the bed of keratinocytes 
conforms to a narrow finger bone, wrapping around the end of the digit 
and radiating outwards to form a cone-shaped structure. Animals with nails, on the other hand, 
have much broader digits, and keratinocytes only cover the top 
surface of their wide bones. It’s possible that nails have simply 
persisted as a side effect of primates evolving wider, 
more dexterous fingers. But given what we know about the 
habitats of our primate ancestors, it’s more likely that nails came with 
their own powerful advantages. High in the forest canopy where 
these primates lived, wide finger bones and expansive 
finger pads were ideal for gripping narrow branches. And nails improved that grip even further. By providing a rigid surface 
to press against, primates could splay out their pads to 
create even more contact with the trees. Additionally, nails improved the 
sensitivity of their digits by providing an extra surface to detect 
changes in pressure while climbing. This combination of sensitivity 
and dexterity gave our ancestors the precise motor 
control needed to snatch up insects, pinch berries and seeds, and keep a 
firm grip on slim branches. The evolution of nails and the evolution 
of opposable thumbs and toes are closely linked. And when our ancestors moved 
down from the trees, this flexible grasp enabled them to create
and wield complex tools. Even if it was possible for wide 
fingers to sport claws, their sharp points would’ve 
likely interfered with these primates’ regular tasks. Claws are ideal for piercing, 
puncturing, and hooking, but their points make grabbing difficult, 
and potentially dangerous. However, both claws and nails are 
used in some unexpected ways. Manatees use nails to grasp their food, and researchers think elephant toenails 
may sense vibrations in the ground to help them hear. Meanwhile, some primates, 
like the aye-ayes of Madagascar, have re-acquired claws. They use these extra-long appendages 
to tap branches and trunks, while listening for hollow sections 
with their bat-like ears. When they hear an opening, 
they burrow into the tree and skewer grubs with their needle-like 
middle finger. We’ve only scratched the surface of all 
the incredible ways nails and claws are used throughout the animal kingdom. But as for which of these 
adaptations is better? That’s an answer we may never nail down.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 2: What is the name of the protein that makes up both claws and nails? Options: A. Collagen, B. Keratin, C. Elastin, D. Fibronectin.

Although the question is not an exact match, it is related to the content of the ground truth MCQ, which asks about structures made of keratin. The correct answer to the ground truth MCQ is "Finger bones (AKA phalanges)", which is not made of keratin. Similarly, Question 2 is asking about the protein that makes up claws and nails, which is keratin.

However, a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about structures that are not made of keratin. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 2, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

Imagine a future where nobody dies— instead, our minds are uploaded 
to a digital world. They might live on in a realistic,
simulated environment with avatar bodies, and could still call in and contribute 
to the biological world. Mind uploading has powerful appeal— but what would it actually take to scan a 
person’s brain and upload their mind? The main challenges are scanning a brain 
in enough detail to capture the mind and perfectly recreating 
that detail artificially. But first, we have to know what to scan. The human brain contains 
about 86 billion neurons, connected by at least a 
hundred trillion synapses. The pattern of connectivity 
among the brain’s neurons, that is, all of the neurons and 
all their connections to each other, is called the connectome. We haven’t yet mapped 
the connectome, and there’s also a lot more 
to neural signaling. There are hundreds, possibly thousands 
of different kinds of connections, or synapses. Each functions in a slightly 
different way. Some work faster, some slower. Some grow or shrink rapidly in 
the process of learning; some are more stable over time. And beyond the trillions of precise, 
1-to-1 connections between neurons, some neurons also spray out 
neurotransmitters that affect many other neurons at once. All of these different kinds of 
interactions would need to be mapped in order to 
copy a person’s mind. There are also a lot of influences on 
neural signaling that are poorly understood 
or undiscovered. To name just one example, patterns of activity between neurons are likely influenced by a type 
of cell called glia. Glia surround neurons and, 
according to some scientists, may even outnumber them 
by as many as ten to one. Glia were once thought to be purely 
for structural support, and their functions are still 
poorly understood, but at least some of them can generate 
their own signals that influence information processing. Our understanding of the brain isn’t good 
enough to determine what we’d need to scan in order 
to replicate the mind, but assuming our knowledge does 
advance to that point, how would we scan it? Currently, we can accurately scan a living
human brain with resolutions of about half a 
millimeter using our best non-invasive 
scanning method, MRI. To detect a synapse, we’ll need to scan 
at a resolution of about a micron— a thousandth of a millimeter. To distinguish the kind of synapse and 
precisely how strong each synapse is, we’ll need even better resolution. MRI depends on powerful magnetic fields. Scanning at the resolution required to determine the details of 
individual synapses would requires a field strength high 
enough to cook a person’s tissues. So this kind of leap in resolution would require fundamentally 
new scanning technology. It would be more feasible to scan a dead
brain using an electron microscope, but even that technology is nowhere 
near good enough– and requires killing the subject first. Assuming we eventually understand the 
brain well enough to know what to scan and develop the technology to safely 
scan at that resolution, the next challenge would be to recreate 
that information digitally. The main obstacles to doing so are 
computing power and storage space, both of which are improving every year. We’re actually much closer to attaining 
this technological capacity than we are to understanding or scanning 
our own minds. Artificial neural networks already run 
our internet search engines, digital assistants, self-driving cars, 
Wall Street trading algorithms, and smart phones. Nobody has yet built an artificial network
with 86 billion neurons, but as computing technology improves, it may be possible to keep track 
of such massive data sets. At every step in the scanning and 
uploading process, we’d have to be certain we were capturing 
all the necessary information accurately— or there’s no telling what ruined 
version of a mind might emerge. While mind uploading is 
theoretically possible, we’re likely hundreds of years away from the technology
and scientific understanding that would make it a reality. And that reality would come with ethical 
and philosophical considerations: who would have access to mind uploading? What rights would be accorded to 
uploaded minds? How could this technology be abused? Even if we can eventually upload 
our minds, whether we should remains 
an open question.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the definition of a synapse, and the correct answer is "All of the above" (a gap between two neurons, the contact through which two neurons communicate, sometimes inhibitory and sometimes excitatory).

Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is asking about the main challenge in scanning a brain to capture the mind, which is not directly related to the definition of a synapse. However, Question 5 is asking about the resolution required to detect a synapse, which is related to the concept of synapses.

But the most similar generated MCQ is actually Question 2, which is asking about the term for the pattern of connectivity among the brain's neurons. Although it's not directly asking about synapses, it's related to the concept of how neurons communicate with each other, which is relevant to the definition of a synapse.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 2

But please keep in mind that this is a very weak match, and it's not a good substitute for the ground truth MCQ.

at a resolution of about a micron— a thousandth of a millimeter. To distinguish the kind of synapse and 
precisely how strong each synapse is, we’ll need even better resolution. MRI depends on powerful magnetic fields. Scanning at the resolution required to determine the details of 
individual synapses would requires a field strength high 
enough to cook a person’s tissues. So this kind of leap in resolution would require fundamentally 
new scanning technology. It would be more feasible to scan a dead
brain using an electron microscope, but even that technology is nowhere 
near good enough– and requires killing the subject first. Assuming we eventually understand the 
brain well enough to know what to scan and develop the technology to safely 
scan at that resolution, the next challenge would be to recreate 
that information digitally. The main obstacles to doing so are 
computing power and storage space, both of which are improving every year. We’re actually much closer to attaining 
this technological capacity than we are to understanding or scanning 
our own minds. Artificial neural networks already run 
our internet search engines, digital assistants, self-driving cars, 
Wall Street trading algorithms, and smart phones. Nobody has yet built an artificial network
with 86 billion neurons, but as computing technology improves, it may be possible to keep track 
of such massive data sets. At every step in the scanning and 
uploading process, we’d have to be certain we were capturing 
all the necessary information accurately— or there’s no telling what ruined 
version of a mind might emerge. While mind uploading is 
theoretically possible, we’re likely hundreds of years away from the technology
and scientific understanding that would make it a reality. And that reality would come with ethical 
and philosophical considerations: who would have access to mind uploading? What rights would be accorded to 
uploaded minds? How could this technology be abused? Even if we can eventually upload 
our minds, whether we should remains 
an open question.

**Transcript**:
Hephaestus, god of technology, was hard at
work on his most ingenious invention yet. He was creating a new defense 
system for King Minos, who wanted fewer intruders on his 
island kingdom of Crete. But mortal guards and ordinary 
weapons wouldn’t suffice, so the visionary god devised an 
indomitable new defender. In the fires of his forge, Hephaestus cast his invention in 
the shape of a giant man. Made of gleaming bronze; endowed with 
superhuman strength, and powered by ichor, 
the life fluid of the gods, this automaton was unlike anything 
Hephaestus had forged before. The god named his creation Talos: 
the first robot. Three times a day, the bronze guardian 
marched around the island's perimeter searching for interlopers. When he identified ships 
approaching the coast, he hurled massive boulders 
into their path. If any survivors made it ashore, he would heat his metal body red-hot 
and crush victims to his chest. Talos was intended to fulfill his duties 
day after day, with no variation. But despite his robotic behavior, he possessed an internal life his victims 
could scarcely imagine. And soon, the behemoth would encounter a ship 
of invaders that would test his mettle. The bedraggled crew of Jason, Medea, 
and the Argonauts were returning from their hard-won quest 
to retrieve the Golden Fleece. Their adventure had taken 
many dark turns, and the weary sailors were desperate 
to rest in a safe harbor. They’d heard tales of Crete’s invulnerable
bronze colossus, and made for a sheltered cove. But before they could even drop anchor, 
Talos spotted them. While the Argonauts cowered at the 
approach of the awesome automaton, the sorceress Medea spotted a glinting 
bolt on the robot’s ankle— and devised a clever gambit. Medea offered Talos a bargain: she claimed that she could 
make Talos immortal in exchange for removing the bolt. Medea's promise resonated deep 
within his core. Unaware of his own mechanical nature, and human enough to long for 
eternal life, Talos agreed. While Medea muttered incantations, 
Jason removed the bolt. As Medea suspected, the bolt was a 
weak point in Hephaestus’ design. The ichor flowed out like molten lead, 
draining Talos of his power source. The robot collapsed with 
a thunderous crash, and the Argonauts were free 
to travel home. This story, first recorded in 
roughly 700 BCE, raises some familiar anxieties 
about artificial intelligence— and even provides an ancient 
blueprint for science fiction. But according to historians, ancient 
robots were more than just myths. By the 4th century BCE, Greek engineers began making 
actual automatons including robotic servants and 
flying models of birds. None of these creations were 
as famous as Talos, who appeared on Greek coins, vase 
paintings, public frescoes, and in theatrical performances. Even 2,500 years ago, Greeks had already begun to investigate 
the uncertain line between human and machine. And like many modern myths about 
artificial intelligence, Talos’ tale is as much about his robotic 
heart as it is about his robotic brain. Illustrating the demise of Talos on a 
vase of the fifth century BCE, one painter captured the dying 
automaton’s despair with a tear rolling down his bronze cheek.

**Transcript**:
Hephaestus, god of technology, was hard at
work on his most ingenious invention yet. He was creating a new defense 
system for King Minos, who wanted fewer intruders on his 
island kingdom of Crete. But mortal guards and ordinary 
weapons wouldn’t suffice, so the visionary god devised an 
indomitable new defender. In the fires of his forge, Hephaestus cast his invention in 
the shape of a giant man. Made of gleaming bronze; endowed with 
superhuman strength, and powered by ichor, 
the life fluid of the gods, this automaton was unlike anything 
Hephaestus had forged before. The god named his creation Talos: 
the first robot. Three times a day, the bronze guardian 
marched around the island's perimeter searching for interlopers. When he identified ships 
approaching the coast, he hurled massive boulders 
into their path. If any survivors made it ashore, he would heat his metal body red-hot 
and crush victims to his chest. Talos was intended to fulfill his duties 
day after day, with no variation. But despite his robotic behavior, he possessed an internal life his victims 
could scarcely imagine. And soon, the behemoth would encounter a ship 
of invaders that would test his mettle. The bedraggled crew of Jason, Medea, 
and the Argonauts were returning from their hard-won quest 
to retrieve the Golden Fleece. Their adventure had taken 
many dark turns, and the weary sailors were desperate 
to rest in a safe harbor. They’d heard tales of Crete’s invulnerable
bronze colossus, and made for a sheltered cove. But before they could even drop anchor, 
Talos spotted them. While the Argonauts cowered at the 
approach of the awesome automaton, the sorceress Medea spotted a glinting 
bolt on the robot’s ankle— and devised a clever gambit. Medea offered Talos a bargain: she claimed that she could 
make Talos immortal in exchange for removing the bolt. Medea's promise resonated deep 
within his core. Unaware of his own mechanical nature, and human enough to long for 
eternal life, Talos agreed. While Medea muttered incantations, 
Jason removed the bolt. As Medea suspected, the bolt was a 
weak point in Hephaestus’ design. The ichor flowed out like molten lead, 
draining Talos of his power source. The robot collapsed with 
a thunderous crash, and the Argonauts were free 
to travel home. This story, first recorded in 
roughly 700 BCE, raises some familiar anxieties 
about artificial intelligence— and even provides an ancient 
blueprint for science fiction. But according to historians, ancient 
robots were more than just myths. By the 4th century BCE, Greek engineers began making 
actual automatons including robotic servants and 
flying models of birds. None of these creations were 
as famous as Talos, who appeared on Greek coins, vase 
paintings, public frescoes, and in theatrical performances. Even 2,500 years ago, Greeks had already begun to investigate 
the uncertain line between human and machine. And like many modern myths about 
artificial intelligence, Talos’ tale is as much about his robotic 
heart as it is about his robotic brain. Illustrating the demise of Talos on a 
vase of the fifth century BCE, one painter captured the dying 
automaton’s despair with a tear rolling down his bronze cheek.

Scientists work on the boundaries of 
the unknown, where every new piece of knowledge 
forms a path into a void of uncertainty. And nothing is more uncertain– or potentially enlightening– 
than a paradox. Throughout history, paradoxes have threatened to 
undermine everything we know, and just as often, they’ve reshaped our 
understanding of the world. Today, one of the biggest paradoxes in 
the universe threatens to unravel the fields of general
relativity and quantum mechanics: the black hole information paradox. To understand this paradox, we first need to define what we mean
by "information." Typically, the information we talk about 
is visible to the naked eye. For example, this kind of information tells us that 
an apple is red, round, and shiny. But physicists are more concerned with 
quantum information. This refers to the quantum properties of 
all the particles that make up that apple, such as their position, velocity and spin. Every object in the universe is composed of particles with unique 
quantum properties. This idea is evoked most significantly 
in a vital law of physics: the total amount of quantum information
in the Universe must be conserved. Even if you destroy an object beyond 
recognition, its quantum information is never 
permanently deleted. And theoretically, knowledge of that 
information would allow us to recreate the object 
from its particle components. Conservation of information isn’t just an 
arbitrary rule, but a mathematical necessity, upon which 
much of modern science is built. But around black holes, 
those foundations get shaken. When an apple enters a black hole, it seems as though it leaves the universe, and all its quantum information 
becomes irretrievably lost. However, this doesn’t immediately 
break the laws of physics. The information is out of sight, but it might still exist within the 
black hole’s mysterious void. Alternatively, some theories suggest that information doesn’t even make it
inside the black hole at all. Seen from outside, it’s as if the apple’s 
quantum information is encoded on the surface layer of the
black hole, called the event horizon. As the black hole’s mass increases, the surface of the event horizon 
increases as well. So it’s possible that as a black hole 
swallows an object, it also grows large enough to conserve
the object’s quantum information. But whether information is conserved 
inside the black hole or on its surface, the laws of physics remain intact– until you account for Hawking Radiation. Discovered by Stephen Hawking in 1974, this phenomenon shows that black 
holes are gradually evaporating. Over incredibly long periods of time black holes lose mass as they shed 
particles away from their event horizons. Critically, it seems as though the 
evaporating particles are unrelated to the information 
the black hole encodes– suggesting that a black hole and all the
quantum information it contains could be completely erased. Does that quantum information 
truly disappear? If not, where does it go? While the evaporation process 
would take an incredibly long time, the questions it raises for physics 
are far more urgent. The destruction of information would force us to rewrite some of our most
fundamental scientific paradigms. But fortunately, in science, every paradox is an opportunity 
for new discoveries. Researchers are investigating a broad 
range of possible solutions to the Information Paradox. Some have theorized that information actually is encoded 
in the escaping radiation, in some way we can’t yet understand. Others have suggested the paradox is 
just a misunderstanding of how general relativity and 
quantum field theory interact. Respectively, these two theories describe the largest
and smallest physical phenomena, and they’re notoriously 
difficult to combine. Some researchers argue that a solution
to this and many other paradoxes will come naturally with a “unified 
theory of everything.” But perhaps the most mind-bending 
theory to come from exploring this paradox is the holographic principle. Expanding on the idea that the 2D 
surface of an event horizon can store quantum information, this principle suggests that the very 
boundary of the observable universe is also a 2D surface encoded 
with information about real, 3D objects. If this is true, it’s possible that 
reality as we know it is just a holographic 
projection of that information. If proven, any of these theories would 
open up new questions to explore, while still preserving our current 
models of the universe. But it’s also possible that those 
models are wrong! Either way, this paradox has already 
helped us take another step into the unknown.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the relationship between the mass of a black hole and the surface of its event horizon, which possibly encodes the quantum information of the added matter.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 4: What is the term for the surface layer of a black hole that marks the boundary beyond which nothing, including light, can escape? Options: A. Event horizon, B. Singularity, C. Black hole boundary, D. Quantum surface.

Although this question does not directly address the relationship between the mass of a black hole and the surface of its event horizon, it does mention the event horizon, which is a key concept in the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose an index, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to pick one that is somewhat related, I would say Question 4.

**Transcript**:
Scientists work on the boundaries of 
the unknown, where every new piece of knowledge 
forms a path into a void of uncertainty. And nothing is more uncertain– or potentially enlightening– 
than a paradox. Throughout history, paradoxes have threatened to 
undermine everything we know, and just as often, they’ve reshaped our 
understanding of the world. Today, one of the biggest paradoxes in 
the universe threatens to unravel the fields of general
relativity and quantum mechanics: the black hole information paradox. To understand this paradox, we first need to define what we mean
by "information." Typically, the information we talk about 
is visible to the naked eye. For example, this kind of information tells us that 
an apple is red, round, and shiny. But physicists are more concerned with 
quantum information. This refers to the quantum properties of 
all the particles that make up that apple, such as their position, velocity and spin. Every object in the universe is composed of particles with unique 
quantum properties. This idea is evoked most significantly 
in a vital law of physics: the total amount of quantum information
in the Universe must be conserved. Even if you destroy an object beyond 
recognition, its quantum information is never 
permanently deleted. And theoretically, knowledge of that 
information would allow us to recreate the object 
from its particle components. Conservation of information isn’t just an 
arbitrary rule, but a mathematical necessity, upon which 
much of modern science is built. But around black holes, 
those foundations get shaken. When an apple enters a black hole, it seems as though it leaves the universe, and all its quantum information 
becomes irretrievably lost. However, this doesn’t immediately 
break the laws of physics. The information is out of sight, but it might still exist within the 
black hole’s mysterious void. Alternatively, some theories suggest that information doesn’t even make it
inside the black hole at all. Seen from outside, it’s as if the apple’s 
quantum information is encoded on the surface layer of the
black hole, called the event horizon. As the black hole’s mass increases, the surface of the event horizon 
increases as well. So it’s possible that as a black hole 
swallows an object, it also grows large enough to conserve
the object’s quantum information. But whether information is conserved 
inside the black hole or on its surface, the laws of physics remain intact– until you account for Hawking Radiation. Discovered by Stephen Hawking in 1974, this phenomenon shows that black 
holes are gradually evaporating. Over incredibly long periods of time black holes lose mass as they shed 
particles away from their event horizons. Critically, it seems as though the 
evaporating particles are unrelated to the information 
the black hole encodes– suggesting that a black hole and all the
quantum information it contains could be completely erased. Does that quantum information 
truly disappear? If not, where does it go? While the evaporation process 
would take an incredibly long time, the questions it raises for physics 
are far more urgent. The destruction of information would force us to rewrite some of our most
fundamental scientific paradigms. But fortunately, in science, every paradox is an opportunity 
for new discoveries. Researchers are investigating a broad 
range of possible solutions to the Information Paradox. Some have theorized that information actually is encoded 
in the escaping radiation, in some way we can’t yet understand. Others have suggested the paradox is 
just a misunderstanding of how general relativity and 
quantum field theory interact. Respectively, these two theories describe the largest
and smallest physical phenomena, and they’re notoriously 
difficult to combine. Some researchers argue that a solution
to this and many other paradoxes will come naturally with a “unified 
theory of everything.” But perhaps the most mind-bending 
theory to come from exploring this paradox is the holographic principle. Expanding on the idea that the 2D 
surface of an event horizon can store quantum information, this principle suggests that the very 
boundary of the observable universe is also a 2D surface encoded 
with information about real, 3D objects. If this is true, it’s possible that 
reality as we know it is just a holographic 
projection of that information. If proven, any of these theories would 
open up new questions to explore, while still preserving our current 
models of the universe. But it’s also possible that those 
models are wrong! Either way, this paradox has already 
helped us take another step into the unknown.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of relevance to the topic.

The ground truth MCQ is about the consequences of quantum information being erased, specifically what would change in the physical description of the world.

Among the generated MCQs, none directly address this question. However, Question 3 comes closest to discussing the concept of quantum information, but it's about the conservation of quantum information, not the consequences of its erasure.

If I had to choose, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

Index: 3 (but not a good match)

**Transcript**:
Chak Ek’ rose from the underworld 
to the surface of the eastern sea and on into the heavens. His brother K’in Ahaw followed. Though Chak Ek’ had risen first, 
K’in Ahaw outshone him, and the resentful Chak Ek’ descended back
to the underworld to plot against his brother. In Mayan mythology, Chak Ek’ represents 
Venus and K’in Ahaw represents the sun. Known as both the morning and the 
evening star, Venus moves through the sky, 
sometimes visible before sunrise, sometimes after sunset,
and occasionally not at all. The ancient Maya identified this roughly 
584 day cycle more than a thousand years ago and it still accurately predicts when and 
where Venus will appear in the sky around the world. Five of these cycles make up almost 
exactly eight years, and the Maya also recognized 
this larger cycle. They assigned Chak Ek’ five 
different forms, one for each cycle of Venus, 
that were repeated every eight years. Within the 584 day cycle, Venus is visible
in the evening sky for 250 days, then disappears for 8 days before 
reappearing as the Morning Star. The ancient Maya ascribed particular 
significance to this point in this cycle: the first time Venus appears before 
sunrise after being invisible. On this day, Chak Ek’ rose again from the 
underworld, wielding a spearthrower and darts. To bring discord to the world, he decided to attack his brother 
and his brother’s allies. His first target was K’awiil, god of 
sustenance and lightning. Rising in the late rainy season, Chak Ek’ 
aimed his spear and struck K’awiil, causing damage to the food and a 
period of chaos in the social order until K’awiil was reborn. 584 days after attacking K’awiil, Chak Ek’ turned his attention back to his 
brother, the Sun. Each night, the Sun took the form of 
jaguar and journeyed through the underworld. Chak Ek’ speared the jaguar sun as it rose
at dawn towards the end of the dry season. The Sun was wounded, plunging the 
world into a period of chaos and warfare. Chak Ek’s third victim 
was the god of maize, who provided sustenance for all humankind. Chak Ek’ speared him at the 
time of the harvest. He was buried in the underworld, 
and maize—the staple of life— was no longer available 
to Earth’s inhabitants. But the maize god emerged after three 
months in the place of new beginnings– the eastern cave known as Seven Water 
Place– bringing food once again to earth. When the turtle Ak Na'ak rose in the sky 
to mark the summer solstice, Chak Ek’ claimed his fourth victim. With the death of this good omen, 
the Sun, the food supply, and the people were buried within the earth, and the 
forces of chaos reigned. But out of the chaos rose a new order
established by Hun Ajaw, one of the hero twins known to all for having vanquished 
the lords of the underworld. A new race of humans was created, 
made from maize. This state of balance was not to last, 
however. Chak Ek’s fifth and final victim was a 
mysterious stranger from the west, and his death 
in the heart of the dry season shook the order established by Hun Ajaw. The gods, the lords, and the maize were 
buried in the underworld. But this victory for Chak Ek’ would also 
prove temporary. The two brothers, Venus and the Sun, 
were caught in an endless cycle as they battled for supremacy, re-enacting
the same five struggles, while the world alternated between order
and chaos with the rising of the Morning Star.

**Transcript**:
Chak Ek’ rose from the underworld 
to the surface of the eastern sea and on into the heavens. His brother K’in Ahaw followed. Though Chak Ek’ had risen first, 
K’in Ahaw outshone him, and the resentful Chak Ek’ descended back
to the underworld to plot against his brother. In Mayan mythology, Chak Ek’ represents 
Venus and K’in Ahaw represents the sun. Known as both the morning and the 
evening star, Venus moves through the sky, 
sometimes visible before sunrise, sometimes after sunset,
and occasionally not at all. The ancient Maya identified this roughly 
584 day cycle more than a thousand years ago and it still accurately predicts when and 
where Venus will appear in the sky around the world. Five of these cycles make up almost 
exactly eight years, and the Maya also recognized 
this larger cycle. They assigned Chak Ek’ five 
different forms, one for each cycle of Venus, 
that were repeated every eight years. Within the 584 day cycle, Venus is visible
in the evening sky for 250 days, then disappears for 8 days before 
reappearing as the Morning Star. The ancient Maya ascribed particular 
significance to this point in this cycle: the first time Venus appears before 
sunrise after being invisible. On this day, Chak Ek’ rose again from the 
underworld, wielding a spearthrower and darts. To bring discord to the world, he decided to attack his brother 
and his brother’s allies. His first target was K’awiil, god of 
sustenance and lightning. Rising in the late rainy season, Chak Ek’ 
aimed his spear and struck K’awiil, causing damage to the food and a 
period of chaos in the social order until K’awiil was reborn. 584 days after attacking K’awiil, Chak Ek’ turned his attention back to his 
brother, the Sun. Each night, the Sun took the form of 
jaguar and journeyed through the underworld. Chak Ek’ speared the jaguar sun as it rose
at dawn towards the end of the dry season. The Sun was wounded, plunging the 
world into a period of chaos and warfare. Chak Ek’s third victim 
was the god of maize, who provided sustenance for all humankind. Chak Ek’ speared him at the 
time of the harvest. He was buried in the underworld, 
and maize—the staple of life— was no longer available 
to Earth’s inhabitants. But the maize god emerged after three 
months in the place of new beginnings– the eastern cave known as Seven Water 
Place– bringing food once again to earth. When the turtle Ak Na'ak rose in the sky 
to mark the summer solstice, Chak Ek’ claimed his fourth victim. With the death of this good omen, 
the Sun, the food supply, and the people were buried within the earth, and the 
forces of chaos reigned. But out of the chaos rose a new order
established by Hun Ajaw, one of the hero twins known to all for having vanquished 
the lords of the underworld. A new race of humans was created, 
made from maize. This state of balance was not to last, 
however. Chak Ek’s fifth and final victim was a 
mysterious stranger from the west, and his death 
in the heart of the dry season shook the order established by Hun Ajaw. The gods, the lords, and the maize were 
buried in the underworld. But this victory for Chak Ek’ would also 
prove temporary. The two brothers, Venus and the Sun, 
were caught in an endless cycle as they battled for supremacy, re-enacting
the same five struggles, while the world alternated between order
and chaos with the rising of the Morning Star.

**Transcript**:
In the 4th century BCE, a banker’s son threw the city of Sinope 
into scandal by counterfeiting coins. When the dust finally settled, 
the young man, Diogenes of Sinope, had been stripped of his citizenship, 
his money, and all his possessions. At least, that’s how the story goes. While many of the details 
of Diogenes’ life are shadowy, the philosophical ideas 
born out of his disgrace survive today. In exile, Diogenes decided 
that by rejecting the opinions of others and societal measures of success, 
he could be truly free. He would live self-sufficiently, 
close to nature, without materialism, vanity, or conformity. In practice, this meant he spent years 
wandering around Greek cities with nothing but a cloak, staff, 
and knapsack— outdoors year-round, forgoing technology, 
baths, and cooked food. He didn’t go about this new existence 
quietly, but is said to have teased passers-by 
and mocked the powerful, eating, urinating 
and even masturbating in public. The citizens called him a kyôn— 
a barking dog. Though meant as an insult, dogs were actually a good symbol 
for his philosophy— they’re happy creatures, free from abstractions 
like wealth or reputation. Diogenes and his growing number 
of followers became known as “dog philosophers,” 
or kynikoi, a designation 
that eventually became the word “Cynic.” These early Cynics were a carefree bunch, drawn to the freedom 
of a wandering lifestyle. As Diogenes’ reputation grew, 
others tried to challenge his commitment. Alexander the Great 
offered him anything he desired. But instead of asking for material goods, Diogenes only asked Alexander 
to get out of his sunshine. After Diogenes’ death, adherents to his philosophy 
continued to call themselves Cynics for about 900 years, until 500 CE. Some Greek philosophers, like the Stoics, thought everyone 
should follow Diogenes’ example. They also attempted to tone down 
his philosophy to be more acceptable 
to conventional society— which, of course, was fundamentally at odds 
with his approach. Others viewed the Cynics less charitably. In the Roman province of Syria 
in the 2nd century CE, the satirist Lucian described the Cynics 
of his own time as unprincipled, materialistic, self-promoting hypocrites, who only preached 
what Diogenes had once actually practiced. Reading Lucian’s texts centuries later, Renaissance and Reformation writers 
called their rivals cynics as an insult— meaning people who criticized others 
without having anything worthwhile to say. This usage eventually laid the groundwork 
for the modern meaning of the word “cynic:" a person who thinks everyone else 
is acting out of pure self-interest, even if they claim a higher motive. Still, the philosophy of cynicism 
had admirers, especially among those 
who wished to question the state of society. The 18th-century French philosopher 
Jean-Jacques Rousseau was called the “new Diogenes” when he argued 
that the arts, sciences, and technology, corrupt people. In 1882, Friedrich Nietzsche 
reimagined a story in which Diogenes 
went into the Athenian marketplace with a lantern, searching in vain 
for a single honest person. In Nietszche’s version, a so-called madman
rushes into a town square to proclaim that “God is dead.” This was Nietzsche’s way 
of calling for a “revaluation of values,” and rejecting 
the dominant Christian and Platonic idea of universal, spiritual insights 
beyond the physical world. Nietzsche admired Diogenes 
for sticking stubbornly to the here-and-now. More recently, the hippies of the 1960s 
have been compared with Diogenes as counter-cultural rebels. Diogenes’ ideas 
have been adopted and reimagined 
over and over again. The original cynics 
might not have approved of these fresh takes: they believed 
that their values of rejecting custom and living closely with nature 
were the only true values. Whether or not you agree with that, 
or with any of the later incarnations, all have one thing in common: 
they questioned the status quo. And that’s an example 
we can still follow: not to blindly follow 
conventional or majority views, but to think hard 
about what is truly valuable.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the 4th century BCE, a banker’s son threw the city of Sinope 
into scandal by counterfeiting coins. When the dust finally settled, 
the young man, Diogenes of Sinope, had been stripped of his citizenship, 
his money, and all his possessions. At least, that’s how the story goes. While many of the details 
of Diogenes’ life are shadowy, the philosophical ideas 
born out of his disgrace survive today. In exile, Diogenes decided 
that by rejecting the opinions of others and societal measures of success, 
he could be truly free. He would live self-sufficiently, 
close to nature, without materialism, vanity, or conformity. In practice, this meant he spent years 
wandering around Greek cities with nothing but a cloak, staff, 
and knapsack— outdoors year-round, forgoing technology, 
baths, and cooked food. He didn’t go about this new existence 
quietly, but is said to have teased passers-by 
and mocked the powerful, eating, urinating 
and even masturbating in public. The citizens called him a kyôn— 
a barking dog. Though meant as an insult, dogs were actually a good symbol 
for his philosophy— they’re happy creatures, free from abstractions 
like wealth or reputation. Diogenes and his growing number 
of followers became known as “dog philosophers,” 
or kynikoi, a designation 
that eventually became the word “Cynic.” These early Cynics were a carefree bunch, drawn to the freedom 
of a wandering lifestyle. As Diogenes’ reputation grew, 
others tried to challenge his commitment. Alexander the Great 
offered him anything he desired. But instead of asking for material goods, Diogenes only asked Alexander 
to get out of his sunshine. After Diogenes’ death, adherents to his philosophy 
continued to call themselves Cynics for about 900 years, until 500 CE. Some Greek philosophers, like the Stoics, thought everyone 
should follow Diogenes’ example. They also attempted to tone down 
his philosophy to be more acceptable 
to conventional society— which, of course, was fundamentally at odds 
with his approach. Others viewed the Cynics less charitably. In the Roman province of Syria 
in the 2nd century CE, the satirist Lucian described the Cynics 
of his own time as unprincipled, materialistic, self-promoting hypocrites, who only preached 
what Diogenes had once actually practiced. Reading Lucian’s texts centuries later, Renaissance and Reformation writers 
called their rivals cynics as an insult— meaning people who criticized others 
without having anything worthwhile to say. This usage eventually laid the groundwork 
for the modern meaning of the word “cynic:" a person who thinks everyone else 
is acting out of pure self-interest, even if they claim a higher motive. Still, the philosophy of cynicism 
had admirers, especially among those 
who wished to question the state of society. The 18th-century French philosopher 
Jean-Jacques Rousseau was called the “new Diogenes” when he argued

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A mother and her son trek 
across an endless desert. Wearing special skin-tight suits 
to dissipate heat and recycle moisture, the travelers aren’t worried 
about dying of thirst. Their fears are much greater. The pair try to walk without rhythm, letting the vibrations of their footsteps 
blend into the shifting sands. But soon, the sound of the desert 
is drowned out by a louder hissing. As a mound of sand races towards them, the pair’s unnatural gait 
turns into a sprint. The two clamber into a nearby rock face, as a sandworm 400 meters long 
bursts from the desert floor. This is the world of "Dune." Written by Frank Herbert 
and published in 1965, "Dune" takes place 
in a far-flung future, where humanity rules the stars 
in a giant feudal empire. This medieval motif goes beyond 
just the government. Unlike most interstellar sci-fi, Herbert's humans conquered 
the stars without any computers. Following an ancient war with robots, humanity has forbidden 
the construction of any machine “in the likeness of a human mind.” But rather than stifling their expansion, this edict forced humans 
to evolve in startling ways— becoming biological computers, psychic 
witches, and prescient space pilots. Members of these super-powered factions are regularly employed 
by various noble houses, all competing for power and new planets 
to add to their kingdoms. But almost all these superhuman skills 
rely on the same precious resource: the spice. This mystical crop also known as “melange”
is essential for all space travel, making it the cornerstone 
of the galactic economy. And it only grows 
on the desert planet Arrakis, a dangerous and inhospitable world 
whose native inhabitants have long rebelled against the empire. Arrakis, also called Dune, 
is the setting for Herbert’s novel, which follows Paul 
of the noble House Atreides. The book begins with Paul’s family
being assigned control of Dune as part of an elaborate plot 
by their sworn enemies: the sadistic slave drivers 
of House Harkonnen. The conflict between these houses upends 
the delicate political balance on Arrakis. Soon, Paul is catapulted
into the middle of a planetary revolution, where he must prove himself capable 
of leading— and surviving— on this hostile desert world. But Arrakis is not simply 
an endless sea of sand. Herbert was an avid environmentalist, who spent over five years creating 
Dune’s complex ecosystem. The planet is checkered with climate 
belts and wind tunnels that have shaped its rocky topography. Different temperate zones produce 
varying desert flora. And almost every element of Dune’s 
ecosystem works together to produce the planet’s essential export. Herbert’s world building also includes 
a rich web of philosophy and religion. Paul’s mother Jessica, is a member 
of the Bene Gesserit, an ancient cult 
of spice-assisted psychics. Sometimes called “witches” 
for their mysterious powers, the Bene Gesserit have operated 
as a shadow government for millennia in an effort to guide society 
towards enlightenment. Similarly ancient are the Mentats— human computers capable 
of processing incredible amounts of data. While the Mentats are bastions 
of logic and reason, their results are not mere calculations, but rather, streams of constantly 
shifting possibilities. However, no group is more central 
to "Dune" than the Fremen. Natives of Arrakis, they are the keepers 
of the planet’s many secrets. Paul’s journey takes him deep 
into the Fremen’s exclusive brotherhood, where he must prove himself trustworthy in a series of increasingly 
deadly challenges. All these factions have deep histories 
that pervade the text, and Herbert also incorporates that 
sense of scale into the book’s structure. Each chapter begins with a quote 
from a future history book, recalling elements of the events 
that are about to unfold. The book also contains in-universe 
appendices that further explore the Empire’s history; alongside a glossary of words like 
“Gom jabbar” and “Shai-Hulud." Dune’s epic story continues to unfold 
over a six-book saga that spans millennia. But every story of Arrakis’ 
future begins here: as Paul pursues a path 
that is dangerous, demanding, and always on the verge of being 
consumed by the oncoming storm.

**Transcript**:
A mother and her son trek 
across an endless desert. Wearing special skin-tight suits 
to dissipate heat and recycle moisture, the travelers aren’t worried 
about dying of thirst. Their fears are much greater. The pair try to walk without rhythm, letting the vibrations of their footsteps 
blend into the shifting sands. But soon, the sound of the desert 
is drowned out by a louder hissing. As a mound of sand races towards them, the pair’s unnatural gait 
turns into a sprint. The two clamber into a nearby rock face, as a sandworm 400 meters long 
bursts from the desert floor. This is the world of "Dune." Written by Frank Herbert 
and published in 1965, "Dune" takes place 
in a far-flung future, where humanity rules the stars 
in a giant feudal empire. This medieval motif goes beyond 
just the government. Unlike most interstellar sci-fi, Herbert's humans conquered 
the stars without any computers. Following an ancient war with robots, humanity has forbidden 
the construction of any machine “in the likeness of a human mind.” But rather than stifling their expansion, this edict forced humans 
to evolve in startling ways— becoming biological computers, psychic 
witches, and prescient space pilots. Members of these super-powered factions are regularly employed 
by various noble houses, all competing for power and new planets 
to add to their kingdoms. But almost all these superhuman skills 
rely on the same precious resource: the spice. This mystical crop also known as “melange”
is essential for all space travel, making it the cornerstone 
of the galactic economy. And it only grows 
on the desert planet Arrakis, a dangerous and inhospitable world 
whose native inhabitants have long rebelled against the empire. Arrakis, also called Dune, 
is the setting for Herbert’s novel, which follows Paul 
of the noble House Atreides. The book begins with Paul’s family
being assigned control of Dune as part of an elaborate plot 
by their sworn enemies: the sadistic slave drivers 
of House Harkonnen. The conflict between these houses upends 
the delicate political balance on Arrakis. Soon, Paul is catapulted
into the middle of a planetary revolution, where he must prove himself capable 
of leading— and surviving— on this hostile desert world. But Arrakis is not simply 
an endless sea of sand. Herbert was an avid environmentalist, who spent over five years creating 
Dune’s complex ecosystem. The planet is checkered with climate 
belts and wind tunnels that have shaped its rocky topography. Different temperate zones produce 
varying desert flora. And almost every element of Dune’s 
ecosystem works together to produce the planet’s essential export. Herbert’s world building also includes 
a rich web of philosophy and religion. Paul’s mother Jessica, is a member 
of the Bene Gesserit, an ancient cult 
of spice-assisted psychics. Sometimes called “witches” 
for their mysterious powers, the Bene Gesserit have operated 
as a shadow government for millennia in an effort to guide society 
towards enlightenment. Similarly ancient are the Mentats— human computers capable 
of processing incredible amounts of data. While the Mentats are bastions 
of logic and reason, their results are not mere calculations, but rather, streams of constantly 
shifting possibilities. However, no group is more central 
to "Dune" than the Fremen. Natives of Arrakis, they are the keepers 
of the planet’s many secrets. Paul’s journey takes him deep 
into the Fremen’s exclusive brotherhood, where he must prove himself trustworthy in a series of increasingly 
deadly challenges. All these factions have deep histories 
that pervade the text, and Herbert also incorporates that 
sense of scale into the book’s structure. Each chapter begins with a quote 
from a future history book, recalling elements of the events 
that are about to unfold. The book also contains in-universe 
appendices that further explore the Empire’s history; alongside a glossary of words like 
“Gom jabbar” and “Shai-Hulud." Dune’s epic story continues to unfold 
over a six-book saga that spans millennia. But every story of Arrakis’ 
future begins here: as Paul pursues a path 
that is dangerous, demanding, and always on the verge of being 
consumed by the oncoming storm.

**Transcript**:
In her Auntie An-mei’s home, Jing-Mei reluctantly takes her seat at the eastern corner 
of the mahjong table. At the north, south, and west 
corners are her aunties, long-time members of the Joy Luck Club. This group of immigrant families 
comes together weekly to trade gossip, feast on wonton and sweet chaswei, 
and play mahjong. However, the club’s founder, Jing-Mei’s 
mother Suyuan, has recently passed away. At first, Jing-Mei struggles 
to fill her place at the table. But when her aunties reveal a deeply 
buried secret about Suyuan’s life, Jing-Mei realizes she still has a lot 
to learn about her mother, and herself. In Amy Tan’s 1989 debut novel, 
"The Joy Luck Club," this gathering at the mahjong table 
is the point of departure for a series of interconnected vignettes. The book itself is loosely structured 
to imitate the format of the Chinese game. Just as mahjong is played over four 
rounds with at least four hands each, the book is divided into four parts, 
each with four chapters. Alternately set in China 
or San Francisco, each chapter narrates a single 
story from one of the four matriarchs of the Joy Luck Club 
or their American-born daughters. These stories take the reader through 
war zones and villages of rural China, 
and into modern marriages and tense gatherings 
around the dinner table. They touch upon themes of survival 
and loss, love and the lack of it, ambitions and their unsatisfied reality. In one, Auntie Lin plots an escape 
from the hostile family of her promised husband, ultimately leading 
to her arrival in America. In another, the Hsu family’s all-American 
day at the beach turns dire when Rose is overwhelmed by the 
responsibility her mother assigns to her. The resulting tragedy traumatizes 
the family for years to come. These tales illustrate the common 
divides that can form between generations and cultures, 
especially in immigrant families. The mothers have all experienced great 
hardships during their lives in China, and they’ve worked tirelessly 
to give their children better opportunities in America. But their daughters feel weighed down 
by their parent’s unfulfilled hopes and high expectations. Jing-Mei feels this pressure as she plays 
mahjong with her mother’s friends. She worries, “In me, they see 
their own daughters, just as ignorant, just as unmindful of all the truths 
and hopes they have brought to America.” Time and again, the mothers strive to remind their 
daughters of their history and heritage. Meanwhile, their daughters 
struggle to reconcile their mothers’ perception of them 
with who they really are. "Does my daughter know me?" 
some of the stories ask. "Why doesn’t my mother understand?" 
others respond. In her interrogation of these questions, Tan speaks to anxieties 
that plague many immigrants, who often feel both alienated 
from their homeland and disconnected 
from their adopted country. But by weaving the tales of these 
four mothers and daughters together, Tan makes it clear that Jing-Mei and her peers find strength to tackle 
their present-day problems through the values their mothers 
passed on to them. When "The Joy Luck Club" 
was first published, Tan expected minimal success. But against her predictions, 
the book was a massive critical and commercial achievement. Today, these characters 
still captivate readers worldwide. Not only for the way they speak 
to Chinese American and immigrant experiences, but also for uncovering a deeper truth: the need to be seen and understood 
by the ones you love.

**Transcript**:
In her Auntie An-mei’s home, Jing-Mei reluctantly takes her seat at the eastern corner 
of the mahjong table. At the north, south, and west 
corners are her aunties, long-time members of the Joy Luck Club. This group of immigrant families 
comes together weekly to trade gossip, feast on wonton and sweet chaswei, 
and play mahjong. However, the club’s founder, Jing-Mei’s 
mother Suyuan, has recently passed away. At first, Jing-Mei struggles 
to fill her place at the table. But when her aunties reveal a deeply 
buried secret about Suyuan’s life, Jing-Mei realizes she still has a lot 
to learn about her mother, and herself. In Amy Tan’s 1989 debut novel, 
"The Joy Luck Club," this gathering at the mahjong table 
is the point of departure for a series of interconnected vignettes. The book itself is loosely structured 
to imitate the format of the Chinese game. Just as mahjong is played over four 
rounds with at least four hands each, the book is divided into four parts, 
each with four chapters. Alternately set in China 
or San Francisco, each chapter narrates a single 
story from one of the four matriarchs of the Joy Luck Club 
or their American-born daughters. These stories take the reader through 
war zones and villages of rural China, 
and into modern marriages and tense gatherings 
around the dinner table. They touch upon themes of survival 
and loss, love and the lack of it, ambitions and their unsatisfied reality. In one, Auntie Lin plots an escape 
from the hostile family of her promised husband, ultimately leading 
to her arrival in America. In another, the Hsu family’s all-American 
day at the beach turns dire when Rose is overwhelmed by the 
responsibility her mother assigns to her. The resulting tragedy traumatizes 
the family for years to come. These tales illustrate the common 
divides that can form between generations and cultures, 
especially in immigrant families. The mothers have all experienced great 
hardships during their lives in China, and they’ve worked tirelessly 
to give their children better opportunities in America. But their daughters feel weighed down 
by their parent’s unfulfilled hopes and high expectations. Jing-Mei feels this pressure as she plays 
mahjong with her mother’s friends. She worries, “In me, they see 
their own daughters, just as ignorant, just as unmindful of all the truths 
and hopes they have brought to America.” Time and again, the mothers strive to remind their 
daughters of their history and heritage. Meanwhile, their daughters 
struggle to reconcile their mothers’ perception of them 
with who they really are. "Does my daughter know me?" 
some of the stories ask. "Why doesn’t my mother understand?" 
others respond. In her interrogation of these questions, Tan speaks to anxieties 
that plague many immigrants, who often feel both alienated 
from their homeland and disconnected 
from their adopted country. But by weaving the tales of these 
four mothers and daughters together, Tan makes it clear that Jing-Mei and her peers find strength to tackle 
their present-day problems through the values their mothers 
passed on to them. When "The Joy Luck Club" 
was first published, Tan expected minimal success. But against her predictions, 
the book was a massive critical and commercial achievement. Today, these characters 
still captivate readers worldwide. Not only for the way they speak 
to Chinese American and immigrant experiences, but also for uncovering a deeper truth: the need to be seen and understood 
by the ones you love.

**Transcript**:
During World War I, one of the 
horrors of trench warfare was a poisonous yellow cloud 
called mustard gas. For those unlucky enough to be exposed, it made the air impossible to breathe, 
burned their eyes, and caused huge blisters on exposed skin. Scientists tried desperately to develop an
antidote to this vicious weapon of war. In the process they discovered the gas 
was irrevocably damaging the bone marrow of affected soldiers— halting its 
ability to make blood cells. Despite these awful effects, 
it gave scientists an idea. Cancer cells share a characteristic with 
bone marrow: both replicate rapidly. So could one of the atrocities of war become a champion in the 
fight against cancer? Researchers in the 1930s 
investigated this idea by injecting compounds derived 
from mustard gas into the veins of cancer patients. It took time and trial and error to find 
treatments that did more good than harm, but by the end of World War II, they discovered what became known 
as the first chemotherapy drugs. Today, there are more than 100. Chemotherapy drugs are delivered 
through pills and injections and use "cytotoxic agents," which means 
compounds that are toxic to living cells. Essentially, these medicines cause some 
level of harm to all cells in the body— even healthy ones. But they reserve their most powerful 
effects for rapidly-dividing cells, which is precisely the hallmark of cancer. Take, for example, those first 
chemotherapy drugs, which are still used today and 
are called alkylating agents. They’re injected into the bloodstream, which delivers them to 
cells all over the body. Once inside, when the cell exposes 
its DNA in order to copy it, they damage the building blocks of 
DNA’s double helix structure, which can lead to cell death unless 
the damage is repaired. Because cancer cells multiply rapidly, they take in a high concentration 
of alkylating agents, and their DNA is frequently exposed 
and rarely repaired. So they die off more often 
than most other cells, which have time to fix damaged DNA and don’t accumulate the same 
concentrations of alkylating agents. Another form of chemotherapy involves 
compounds called microtubule stabilizers. Cells have small tubes that assemble 
to help with cell division and DNA replication, then break back down. When microtubule stabilizers 
get inside a cell, they keep those tiny tubes 
from disassembling. That prevents the cell from completing 
its replication, leading to its death. These are just two examples of the six 
classes of chemotherapy drugs we use to treat cancer today. But despite its huge benefits, 
chemotherapy has one big disadvantage: it affects other healthy cells in the body
that naturally have to renew rapidly. Hair follicles, the cells of the mouth, 
the gastrointestinal lining, the reproductive system, and bone marrow 
are hit nearly as hard as cancer. Similar to cancer cells, the rapid 
production of these normal cells means that they’re reaching for 
resources more frequently— and are therefore more exposed to 
the effects of chemo drugs. That leads to several common side 
effects of chemotherapy, including hair loss, fatigue, infertility,
nausea, and vomiting. Doctors commonly prescribe options 
to help manage these side-effects, such as strong anti-nausea medications. For hair loss, devices called cold caps 
can help lower the temperature around the head and 
constrict blood vessels, limiting the amount of chemotherapy 
drugs that reach hair follicles. And once a course of chemo 
treatment is over, the healthy tissues that’ve been badly 
affected by the drug will recover and begin to renew as usual. In 2018 alone, over 17 million people 
world-wide received a cancer diagnosis. But chemotherapy and other treatments 
have changed the outlook for so many. Just take the fact that up to 95% of 
individuals with testicular cancer survive it, thanks to advances 
in treatment. Even in people with acute myeloid 
leukemia— an aggressive blood cancer— chemotherapy puts an estimated 
60% of patients under 60 into remission following their 
first phase of treatment. Researchers are still developing 
more precise interventions that only target the intended 
cancer cells. That’ll help improve survival rates 
while leaving healthy tissues with reduced harm, making one of the best tools we have 
in the fight against cancer even better.

During World War I, one of the 
horrors of trench warfare was a poisonous yellow cloud 
called mustard gas. For those unlucky enough to be exposed, it made the air impossible to breathe, 
burned their eyes, and caused huge blisters on exposed skin. Scientists tried desperately to develop an
antidote to this vicious weapon of war. In the process they discovered the gas 
was irrevocably damaging the bone marrow of affected soldiers— halting its 
ability to make blood cells. Despite these awful effects, 
it gave scientists an idea. Cancer cells share a characteristic with 
bone marrow: both replicate rapidly. So could one of the atrocities of war become a champion in the 
fight against cancer? Researchers in the 1930s 
investigated this idea by injecting compounds derived 
from mustard gas into the veins of cancer patients. It took time and trial and error to find 
treatments that did more good than harm, but by the end of World War II, they discovered what became known 
as the first chemotherapy drugs. Today, there are more than 100. Chemotherapy drugs are delivered 
through pills and injections and use "cytotoxic agents," which means 
compounds that are toxic to living cells. Essentially, these medicines cause some 
level of harm to all cells in the body— even healthy ones. But they reserve their most powerful 
effects for rapidly-dividing cells, which is precisely the hallmark of cancer. Take, for example, those first 
chemotherapy drugs, which are still used today and 
are called alkylating agents. They’re injected into the bloodstream, which delivers them to 
cells all over the body. Once inside, when the cell exposes 
its DNA in order to copy it, they damage the building blocks of 
DNA’s double helix structure, which can lead to cell death unless 
the damage is repaired. Because cancer cells multiply rapidly, they take in a high concentration 
of alkylating agents, and their DNA is frequently exposed 
and rarely repaired. So they die off more often 
than most other cells, which have time to fix damaged DNA and don’t accumulate the same 
concentrations of alkylating agents. Another form of chemotherapy involves 
compounds called microtubule stabilizers. Cells have small tubes that assemble 
to help with cell division and DNA replication, then break back down. When microtubule stabilizers 
get inside a cell, they keep those tiny tubes 
from disassembling. That prevents the cell from completing 
its replication, leading to its death. These are just two examples of the six 
classes of chemotherapy drugs we use to treat cancer today. But despite its huge benefits, 
chemotherapy has one big disadvantage: it affects other healthy cells in the body
that naturally have to renew rapidly. Hair follicles, the cells of the mouth, 
the gastrointestinal lining, the reproductive system, and bone marrow 
are hit nearly as hard as cancer. Similar to cancer cells, the rapid 
production of these normal cells means that they’re reaching for 
resources more frequently— and are therefore more exposed to 
the effects of chemo drugs. That leads to several common side 
effects of chemotherapy, including hair loss, fatigue, infertility,
nausea, and vomiting. Doctors commonly prescribe options 
to help manage these side-effects, such as strong anti-nausea medications. For hair loss, devices called cold caps 
can help lower the temperature around the head and 
constrict blood vessels, limiting the amount of chemotherapy 
drugs that reach hair follicles. And once a course of chemo 
treatment is over, the healthy tissues that’ve been badly 
affected by the drug will recover and begin to renew as usual. In 2018 alone, over 17 million people 
world-wide received a cancer diagnosis. But chemotherapy and other treatments 
have changed the outlook for so many. Just take the fact that up to 95% of 
individuals with testicular cancer survive it, thanks to advances 
in treatment. Even in people with acute myeloid 
leukemia— an aggressive blood cancer— chemotherapy puts an estimated 
60% of patients under 60 into remission following their 
first phase of treatment. Researchers are still developing 
more precise interventions that only target the intended 
cancer cells. That’ll help improve survival rates 
while leaving healthy tissues with reduced harm, making one of the best tools we have 
in the fight against cancer even better.

**Transcript**:
In 1970, marijuana was classified 
as a schedule 1 drug in the United States: the strictest designation possible, meaning it was completely illegal 
and had no recognized medical uses. For decades, this view persisted and set back research 
on the drug's mechanisms and effects. Today, marijuana’s therapeutic benefits 
are widely acknowledged, and some nations 
have legalized medical use or are moving in that direction. But a growing recognition 
for marijuana’s medical value doesn’t answer the question: is recreational marijuana use 
bad for your brain? Marijuana acts 
on the body’s cannabinoid system, which has receptors 
all over the brain and body. Molecules native to the body, 
called endocannabinoids, also act on these receptors. We don’t totally understand 
the cannabinoid system, but it has one feature 
that provides a big clue to its function. Most neurotransmitters 
travel from one neuron to the next through a synapse to propagate a message. But endocannabinoids 
travel in the opposite direction. When a message passes 
from the one neuron to the next, the receiving neuron 
releases endocannabinoids. Those endocannabinoids 
travel backward to influence the sending neuron— essentially giving it feedback 
from the receiving neuron. This leads scientists 
to believe that the endocannabinoid system serves primarily 
to modulate other kinds of signals— amplifying some and diminishing others. Feedback from endocannabinoids 
slows down rates of neural signaling. That doesn’t necessarily mean it slows down behavior 
or perception, though. For example, 
slowing down a signal that inhibits smell could actually make smells more intense. Marijuana contains 
two main active compounds, tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, 
and cannabidiol, or CBD. THC is thought to be primarily responsible
for marijuana’s psychoactive effects on behavior, cognition, and perception, while CBD is responsible 
for the non-psychoactive effects. Like endocannabinoids, THC slows down signaling 
by binding to cannabinoid receptors. But it binds to receptors 
all over this sprawling, diffuse system at once, whereas endocannabinoids 
are released in a specific place in response to a specific stimulus. This widespread activity 
coupled with the fact that the cannabinoid system
indirectly affects many other systems, means that each person’s 
particular brain chemistry, genetics, and previous life experience largely determine 
how they experience the drug. That’s true much more so with marijuana 
than with other drugs that produce their effects 
through one or a few specific pathways. So the harmful effects, if any, 
vary considerably from person to person. And while we don’t know 
how exactly how marijuana produces specific harmful effects, there are clear risk factors 
that can increase peoples’ likelihood of experiencing them. The clearest risk factor is age. In people younger than 25, cannabinoid receptors 
are more concentrated in the white matter than in people over 25. The white matter 
is involved in communication, learning, memory, and emotions. Frequent marijuana use can disrupt the development 
of white matter tracts, and also affect the brain’s ability 
to grow new connections. This may damage long-term learning ability
and problem solving. For now, it’s unclear 
how severe this damage can be or whether it’s reversible. And even among young people, the risk is higher the younger someone is— much higher for a 15 year old 
than a 22 year old, for instance. Marijuana can also cause hallucinations 
or paranoid delusions. Known as marijuana-induced psychosis, these symptoms usually subside 
when a person stops using marijuana. But in rare cases, 
psychosis doesn’t subside, instead unmasking 
a persistent psychotic disorder. A family history of psychotic disorders, 
like schizophrenia, is the clearest, though not the only, 
risk factor for this effect. Marijuana-induced psychosis 
is also more common among young adults, though it’s worth noting 
that psychotic disorders usually surface in this age range anyway. What’s unclear in these cases 
is whether the psychotic disorder would have appeared 
without marijuana use— whether marijuana use triggers it early, is a catalyst for a tipping point 
that wouldn’t have been crossed otherwise, or whether the reaction 
to marijuana is merely an indication of an underlying disorder. In all likelihood, marijuana’s role 
varies from person to person. At any age, as with many other drugs, the brain and body become less sensitive 
to marijuana after repeated uses, meaning it takes more 
to achieve the same effects. Fortunately, unlike many other drugs, there’s no risk of fatal overdose 
from marijuana, and even heavy use 
doesn’t lead to debilitating or life-threatening 
withdrawal symptoms if use stops. There are more subtle forms 
of marijuana withdrawal, though, including sleep disturbances, 
irritability, and depressed mood, which pass 
within a few weeks of stopping use. So is marijuana bad for your brain? It depends who you are. But while some risk factors 
are easy to identify, others aren’t well understood— which means there’s still some possibility
of experiencing negative effects, even if you don’t have 
any of the known risk factors.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1970, marijuana was classified 
as a schedule 1 drug in the United States: the strictest designation possible, meaning it was completely illegal 
and had no recognized medical uses. For decades, this view persisted and set back research 
on the drug's mechanisms and effects. Today, marijuana’s therapeutic benefits 
are widely acknowledged, and some nations 
have legalized medical use or are moving in that direction. But a growing recognition 
for marijuana’s medical value doesn’t answer the question: is recreational marijuana use 
bad for your brain? Marijuana acts 
on the body’s cannabinoid system, which has receptors 
all over the brain and body. Molecules native to the body, 
called endocannabinoids, also act on these receptors. We don’t totally understand 
the cannabinoid system, but it has one feature 
that provides a big clue to its function. Most neurotransmitters 
travel from one neuron to the next through a synapse to propagate a message. But endocannabinoids 
travel in the opposite direction. When a message passes 
from the one neuron to the next, the receiving neuron 
releases endocannabinoids. Those endocannabinoids 
travel backward to influence the sending neuron— essentially giving it feedback 
from the receiving neuron. This leads scientists 
to believe that the endocannabinoid system serves primarily 
to modulate other kinds of signals— amplifying some and diminishing others. Feedback from endocannabinoids 
slows down rates of neural signaling. That doesn’t necessarily mean it slows down behavior 
or perception, though. For example, 
slowing down a signal that inhibits smell could actually make smells more intense. Marijuana contains 
two main active compounds, tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, 
and cannabidiol, or CBD. THC is thought to be primarily responsible
for marijuana’s psychoactive effects on behavior, cognition, and perception, while CBD is responsible 
for the non-psychoactive effects. Like endocannabinoids, THC slows down signaling 
by binding to cannabinoid receptors. But it binds to receptors 
all over this sprawling, diffuse system at once, whereas endocannabinoids 
are released in a specific place in response to a specific stimulus. This widespread activity 
coupled with the fact that the cannabinoid system
indirectly affects many other systems, means that each person’s 
particular brain chemistry, genetics, and previous life experience largely determine 
how they experience the drug. That’s true much more so with marijuana 
than with other drugs that produce their effects 
through one or a few specific pathways. So the harmful effects, if any,

and cannabidiol, or CBD. THC is thought to be primarily responsible
for marijuana’s psychoactive effects on behavior, cognition, and perception, while CBD is responsible 
for the non-psychoactive effects. Like endocannabinoids, THC slows down signaling 
by binding to cannabinoid receptors. But it binds to receptors 
all over this sprawling, diffuse system at once, whereas endocannabinoids 
are released in a specific place in response to a specific stimulus. This widespread activity 
coupled with the fact that the cannabinoid system
indirectly affects many other systems, means that each person’s 
particular brain chemistry, genetics, and previous life experience largely determine 
how they experience the drug. That’s true much more so with marijuana 
than with other drugs that produce their effects 
through one or a few specific pathways. So the harmful effects, if any, 
vary considerably from person to person. And while we don’t know 
how exactly how marijuana produces specific harmful effects, there are clear risk factors 
that can increase peoples’ likelihood of experiencing them. The clearest risk factor is age. In people younger than 25, cannabinoid receptors 
are more concentrated in the white matter than in people over 25. The white matter 
is involved in communication, learning, memory, and emotions. Frequent marijuana use can disrupt the development 
of white matter tracts, and also affect the brain’s ability 
to grow new connections. This may damage long-term learning ability
and problem solving. For now, it’s unclear 
how severe this damage can be or whether it’s reversible. And even among young people, the risk is higher the younger someone is— much higher for a 15 year old 
than a 22 year old, for instance. Marijuana can also cause hallucinations 
or paranoid delusions. Known as marijuana-induced psychosis, these symptoms usually subside 
when a person stops using marijuana. But in rare cases, 
psychosis doesn’t subside, instead unmasking 
a persistent psychotic disorder. A family history of psychotic disorders, 
like schizophrenia, is the clearest, though not the only, 
risk factor for this effect. Marijuana-induced psychosis 
is also more common among young adults, though it’s worth noting 
that psychotic disorders usually surface in this age range anyway. What’s unclear in these cases 
is whether the psychotic disorder would have appeared 
without marijuana use— whether marijuana use triggers it early, is a catalyst for a tipping point 
that wouldn’t have been crossed otherwise, or whether the reaction 
to marijuana is merely an indication of an underlying disorder. In all likelihood, marijuana’s role 
varies from person to person. At any age, as with many other drugs, the brain and body become less sensitive 
to marijuana after repeated uses, meaning it takes more 
to achieve the same effects. Fortunately, unlike many other drugs, there’s no risk of fatal overdose 
from marijuana, and even heavy use 
doesn’t lead to debilitating or life-threatening 
withdrawal symptoms if use stops. There are more subtle forms 
of marijuana withdrawal, though, including sleep disturbances, 
irritability, and depressed mood, which pass 
within a few weeks of stopping use. So is marijuana bad for your brain? It depends who you are. But while some risk factors 
are easy to identify, others aren’t well understood— which means there’s still some possibility
of experiencing negative effects, even if you don’t have 
any of the known risk factors.

**Transcript**:
Meet Lucy. She was a math major in college, and aced all her courses in probability 
and statistics. Which do you think is more likely: that 
Lucy is a portrait artist, or that Lucy is a portrait artist 
who also plays poker? In studies of similar questions, up to 80 
percent of participants chose the equivalent 
of the second statement: that Lucy is a portrait artist 
who also plays poker. After all, nothing we know about Lucy 
suggests an affinity for art, but statistics and probability 
are useful in poker. And yet, this is the wrong answer. Look at the options again. How do we know the first statement 
is more likely to be true? Because it’s a less specific version 
of the second statement. Saying that Lucy is a portrait artist 
doesn’t make any claims about what else she might or might not do. But even though it’s far easier to imagine
her playing poker than making art based on the background information, the second statement is only true if she 
does both of these things. However counterintuitive it seems 
to imagine Lucy as an artist, the second scenario adds another condition
on top of that, making it less likely. For any possible set of events, the 
likelihood of A occurring will always be greater than the likelihood
of A and B both occurring. If we took a random sample of a million 
people who majored in math, the subset who are portrait artists might 
be relatively small. But it will necessarily be bigger than the subset who are portrait artists 
and play poker. Anyone who belongs to the second group 
will also belong to the first– but not vice versa. The more conditions there are, 
the less likely an event becomes. So why do statements with more conditions
sometimes seem more believable? This is a phenomenon known as 
the conjunction fallacy. When we’re asked to make quick decisions, 
we tend to look for shortcuts. In this case, we look for what seems 
plausible rather than what is statistically 
most probable. On its own, Lucy being an artist doesn’t 
match the expectations formed by the preceding information. The additional detail about 
her playing poker gives us a narrative that resonates 
with our intuitions— it makes it seem more plausible. And we choose the option that seems more
representative of the overall picture, regardless of its actual probability. This effect has been observed 
across multiple studies, including ones with participants 
who understood statistics well– from students betting on 
sequences of dice rolls, to foreign policy experts predicting 
the likelihood of a diplomatic crisis. The conjunction fallacy isn’t just a 
problem in hypothetical situations. Conspiracy theories and false news stories often rely on a version of the conjunction
fallacy to seem credible– the more resonant details are added 
to an outlandish story, the more plausible it begins to seem. But ultimately, the likelihood 
a story is true can never be greater than the probability 
that its least likely component is true.

who also plays poker. After all, nothing we know about Lucy 
suggests an affinity for art, but statistics and probability 
are useful in poker. And yet, this is the wrong answer. Look at the options again. How do we know the first statement 
is more likely to be true? Because it’s a less specific version 
of the second statement. Saying that Lucy is a portrait artist 
doesn’t make any claims about what else she might or might not do. But even though it’s far easier to imagine
her playing poker than making art based on the background information, the second statement is only true if she 
does both of these things. However counterintuitive it seems 
to imagine Lucy as an artist, the second scenario adds another condition
on top of that, making it less likely. For any possible set of events, the 
likelihood of A occurring will always be greater than the likelihood
of A and B both occurring. If we took a random sample of a million 
people who majored in math, the subset who are portrait artists might 
be relatively small. But it will necessarily be bigger than the subset who are portrait artists 
and play poker. Anyone who belongs to the second group 
will also belong to the first– but not vice versa. The more conditions there are, 
the less likely an event becomes. So why do statements with more conditions
sometimes seem more believable? This is a phenomenon known as 
the conjunction fallacy. When we’re asked to make quick decisions, 
we tend to look for shortcuts. In this case, we look for what seems 
plausible rather than what is statistically 
most probable. On its own, Lucy being an artist doesn’t 
match the expectations formed by the preceding information. The additional detail about 
her playing poker gives us a narrative that resonates 
with our intuitions— it makes it seem more plausible. And we choose the option that seems more
representative of the overall picture, regardless of its actual probability. This effect has been observed 
across multiple studies, including ones with participants 
who understood statistics well– from students betting on 
sequences of dice rolls, to foreign policy experts predicting 
the likelihood of a diplomatic crisis. The conjunction fallacy isn’t just a 
problem in hypothetical situations. Conspiracy theories and false news stories often rely on a version of the conjunction
fallacy to seem credible– the more resonant details are added 
to an outlandish story, the more plausible it begins to seem. But ultimately, the likelihood 
a story is true can never be greater than the probability 
that its least likely component is true.

**Transcript**:
In 1948, Spanish ophthalmologist 
Jose Ignacio Barraquer Moner was fed up with glasses. He wanted a solution for blurry 
vision that fixed the eye itself, without relying on external aids. But the surgery he eventually devised 
was not for the faint of heart. Barraquer began by slicing off the front
of a patient’s cornea and dunking it in liquid nitrogen. Using a miniature lathe, he ground the 
frozen cornea into the precise shape necessary to focus
the patient’s vision. Then he thawed the disc, and sewed 
it back on. Barraquer called this procedure 
keratomileusis, from the Greek words for “carving” 
and “cornea.” And though it might sound grisly, 
his technique produced reliable results. So how did Barraquer’s surgery work? Keratomileusis corrects what are called 
refractive errors: imperfections in the way the eye focuses 
incoming light. Ideally, the cornea and lens work 
together to focus light on the surface of the retina, but several kinds of refractive errors 
can impair this delicate system. In people with myopia, 
or short-sightedness, a steep cornea focuses light just short 
of the retina. Those with hyperopia, or far-sightedness, 
have the opposite problem: light is focused too far 
beyond the retina. And in people with astigmatism, 
the cornea has two different curvatures which focus light at two distances and 
produce blurry vision. Even those with perfect vision will 
eventually suffer from presbyopia, or “aging eyes.” As the proteins in the lens age, they 
slowly increase its size. By an adult’s mid-40’s, the lens is too
large to easily change shape and shift focus. Glasses and contact lenses bend light 
to compensate for these refractive errors. But, as Barraquer’s procedure shows, we can also alter the shape 
of the cornea itself; moving the focal point backwards, 
forwards, or pulling a divided image together. And thankfully, modern eye surgeons can 
sculpt the cornea with far less invasive tools. In corrective laser eye surgery, surgeons 
rely on excimer lasers. These tools are accurate enough to etch 
words into a human hair. To safely accomplish these 
ultra-fine incisions, they use a technique called photoablation. This allows the laser to essentially 
evaporate organic tissue without overheating 
surrounding eye tissue. So how does laser eye surgery 
actually work? The first step is to separate a thin layer
from the front of the cornea. This can be done with either a flat, 
wide blade, or a femto-second laser that produces millions of tiny plasma 
bubbles to create a plane beneath 
the corneal surface. Surgeons then lift the flap to expose the 
inside of the cornea. Guided by the refractive error and the 
shape of the cornea, the excimer laser robotically sculpts the
exposed corneal bed into the correct shape. This process usually takes less than 30 
seconds for each eye. Finally, the flap is closed, and its edges reseal themselves 
in just a few hours. Because the lasering is done on 
the eyeball itself, it’s described as “in situ,” or “on site.” Its complete name is “laser in-situ 
keratomileusis” – but you probably know it as LASIK. Essentially, this technique carves a 
patient’s contact lens prescription onto their cornea. Like any surgical procedure, LASIK comes with certain risks. Some patients experience slightly blurred
vision that can’t be corrected by glasses. But the technique is currently about 
as likely to damage your eyes as wearing daily disposable contact 
lenses for one year. Today, a technique called SMILE enables 
surgeons to sculpt the cornea through even smaller incisions – further reducing recovery time. And lasers aren’t just correcting the 
three types of refractive errors – this technology can also 
restore aging eyes. In a technique called Laser 
Blended Vision, surgeons adjust one eye to be slightly 
better at distance vision and the other to be better 
at close range vision. The difference between the two eyes is 
small enough that most patients can merge their vision, allowing both eyes to work 
together at all distances. Advances in laser technology continue 
to make vision correction surgery more effective and accessible. One day soon, Barraquer’s vision of a 
world without glasses may finally come true.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1948, Spanish ophthalmologist 
Jose Ignacio Barraquer Moner was fed up with glasses. He wanted a solution for blurry 
vision that fixed the eye itself, without relying on external aids. But the surgery he eventually devised 
was not for the faint of heart. Barraquer began by slicing off the front
of a patient’s cornea and dunking it in liquid nitrogen. Using a miniature lathe, he ground the 
frozen cornea into the precise shape necessary to focus
the patient’s vision. Then he thawed the disc, and sewed 
it back on. Barraquer called this procedure 
keratomileusis, from the Greek words for “carving” 
and “cornea.” And though it might sound grisly, 
his technique produced reliable results. So how did Barraquer’s surgery work? Keratomileusis corrects what are called 
refractive errors: imperfections in the way the eye focuses 
incoming light. Ideally, the cornea and lens work 
together to focus light on the surface of the retina, but several kinds of refractive errors 
can impair this delicate system. In people with myopia, 
or short-sightedness, a steep cornea focuses light just short 
of the retina. Those with hyperopia, or far-sightedness, 
have the opposite problem: light is focused too far 
beyond the retina. And in people with astigmatism, 
the cornea has two different curvatures which focus light at two distances and 
produce blurry vision. Even those with perfect vision will 
eventually suffer from presbyopia, or “aging eyes.” As the proteins in the lens age, they 
slowly increase its size. By an adult’s mid-40’s, the lens is too
large to easily change shape and shift focus. Glasses and contact lenses bend light 
to compensate for these refractive errors. But, as Barraquer’s procedure shows, we can also alter the shape 
of the cornea itself; moving the focal point backwards, 
forwards, or pulling a divided image together. And thankfully, modern eye surgeons can 
sculpt the cornea with far less invasive tools. In corrective laser eye surgery, surgeons 
rely on excimer lasers. These tools are accurate enough to etch 
words into a human hair. To safely accomplish these 
ultra-fine incisions, they use a technique called photoablation. This allows the laser to essentially 
evaporate organic tissue without overheating 
surrounding eye tissue. So how does laser eye surgery 
actually work? The first step is to separate a thin layer
from the front of the cornea. This can be done with either a flat, 
wide blade, or a femto-second laser that produces millions of tiny plasma 
bubbles to create a plane beneath 
the corneal surface. Surgeons then lift the flap to expose the 
inside of the cornea. Guided by the refractive error and the 
shape of the cornea, the excimer laser robotically sculpts the
exposed corneal bed into the correct shape. This process usually takes less than 30 
seconds for each eye. Finally, the flap is closed, and its edges reseal themselves 
in just a few hours. Because the lasering is done on 
the eyeball itself, it’s described as “in situ,” or “on site.” Its complete name is “laser in-situ 
keratomileusis” – but you probably know it as LASIK. Essentially, this technique carves a 
patient’s contact lens prescription onto their cornea. Like any surgical procedure, LASIK comes with certain risks. Some patients experience slightly blurred
vision that can’t be corrected by glasses. But the technique is currently about 
as likely to damage your eyes as wearing daily disposable contact 
lenses for one year. Today, a technique called SMILE enables 
surgeons to sculpt the cornea through even smaller incisions – further reducing recovery time. And lasers aren’t just correcting the 
three types of refractive errors – this technology can also 
restore aging eyes. In a technique called Laser 
Blended Vision, surgeons adjust one eye to be slightly 
better at distance vision and the other to be better 
at close range vision. The difference between the two eyes is 
small enough that most patients can merge their vision, allowing both eyes to work 
together at all distances. Advances in laser technology continue 
to make vision correction surgery more effective and accessible. One day soon, Barraquer’s vision of a 
world without glasses may finally come true.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Asgard, a realm of wonders, was where 
the Norse Gods made their home. There Odin’s great hall of Valhalla 
towered above the mountains and Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, 
anchored itself. But though their domain was magnificent, it stood undefended from the giants 
and trolls of Jotunheim, who despised the gods and 
sought to destroy them. One day when Thor, strongest of the 
gods, was off fighting these foes, a stranger appeared, 
riding a powerful gray horse. The visitor made the gods 
an astonishing offer. He would build them the greatest 
wall they’d ever seen, higher than any giant could climb 
and stronger than any troll could break. All he asked in return was the beautiful 
goddess Freya’s hand in marriage— along with the sun and moon from the sky. The gods balked at this request 
and were ready to send him away. But the trickster Loki 
concocted a devious plan. He told the gods they should 
accept the stranger’s offer, but set such strict conditions that he 
would fail to complete the wall in time. That way, they would lose nothing, while 
getting most of the wall built for free. Freya didn’t like this idea at all, but Odin and the other 
gods were convinced and came to an agreement 
with the builder. He would only have one winter 
to complete the wall. If any part was unfinished by 
the first day of summer, he would receive no payment. And he could have no help 
from any other people. The gods sealed the deal with solemn oaths and swore the mason would come 
to no harm in Asgard. In the morning, the stranger began to dig 
the foundations at an astonishing speed, and at nightfall he set off towards the 
mountains to obtain the building stones. But it was only the next morning, 
when they saw him returning, that the gods began to worry. As agreed, no other people 
were helping the mason. But his horse Svadilfari was hauling 
a load of stones so massive it left trenches in the ground 
behind them. Winter came and went. The stranger kept building, 
Svadilfari kept hauling, and neither snow nor rain could 
slow their progress. With only three days left until summer, 
the wall stood high and impenetrable, with only the gate left to be built. Horrified, the gods realized that not 
only would they lose their fertility goddess forever, but without the sun and moon the world 
would be plunged into eternal darkness. They wondered why they’d made 
such a foolish wager— and then remembered Loki 
and his terrible advice. Suddenly, Loki didn’t feel so clever. All of his fellow gods threatened him 
with an unimaginably painful death if he didn’t find some way to prevent 
the builder from getting his payment. So Loki promised to take care of the 
situation, and dashed away. Outside, night had fallen, and the builder prepared to set off 
to retrieve the final load of stones. But just as he called Svadilfari to him, 
a mare appeared in the field. She was so beautiful that 
Svadilfari ignored his master and broke free of his reins. The mason tried to catch him, but the mare ran deep into the 
woods and Svadilfari followed. The stranger was furious. He knew that the gods were behind 
this and confronted them: no longer as a mild-mannered mason, but in his true form as a terrifying 
mountain giant. This was a big mistake. Thor had just returned to Asgard, and now that the gods knew 
a giant was in their midst, they disregarded their oaths. The only payment the 
builder would receive— and the last thing he would ever see— was the swing of Thor’s 
mighty hammer Mjolnir. As they set the final stones into the 
wall, the gods celebrated their victory. Loki was not among them, however. Several months would pass 
before he finally returned, followed by a beautiful gray 
foal with eight legs. The foal would grow into a magnificent 
steed named Sleipnir and become Odin’s mount, a horse 
that could outrun the wind itself. But exactly where he had come from was 
something Loki preferred not to discuss.

**Transcript**:
Asgard, a realm of wonders, was where 
the Norse Gods made their home. There Odin’s great hall of Valhalla 
towered above the mountains and Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, 
anchored itself. But though their domain was magnificent, it stood undefended from the giants 
and trolls of Jotunheim, who despised the gods and 
sought to destroy them. One day when Thor, strongest of the 
gods, was off fighting these foes, a stranger appeared, 
riding a powerful gray horse. The visitor made the gods 
an astonishing offer. He would build them the greatest 
wall they’d ever seen, higher than any giant could climb 
and stronger than any troll could break. All he asked in return was the beautiful 
goddess Freya’s hand in marriage— along with the sun and moon from the sky. The gods balked at this request 
and were ready to send him away. But the trickster Loki 
concocted a devious plan. He told the gods they should 
accept the stranger’s offer, but set such strict conditions that he 
would fail to complete the wall in time. That way, they would lose nothing, while 
getting most of the wall built for free. Freya didn’t like this idea at all, but Odin and the other 
gods were convinced and came to an agreement 
with the builder. He would only have one winter 
to complete the wall. If any part was unfinished by 
the first day of summer, he would receive no payment. And he could have no help 
from any other people. The gods sealed the deal with solemn oaths and swore the mason would come 
to no harm in Asgard. In the morning, the stranger began to dig 
the foundations at an astonishing speed, and at nightfall he set off towards the 
mountains to obtain the building stones. But it was only the next morning, 
when they saw him returning, that the gods began to worry. As agreed, no other people 
were helping the mason. But his horse Svadilfari was hauling 
a load of stones so massive it left trenches in the ground 
behind them. Winter came and went. The stranger kept building, 
Svadilfari kept hauling, and neither snow nor rain could 
slow their progress. With only three days left until summer, 
the wall stood high and impenetrable, with only the gate left to be built. Horrified, the gods realized that not 
only would they lose their fertility goddess forever, but without the sun and moon the world 
would be plunged into eternal darkness. They wondered why they’d made 
such a foolish wager— and then remembered Loki 
and his terrible advice. Suddenly, Loki didn’t feel so clever. All of his fellow gods threatened him 
with an unimaginably painful death if he didn’t find some way to prevent 
the builder from getting his payment. So Loki promised to take care of the 
situation, and dashed away. Outside, night had fallen, and the builder prepared to set off 
to retrieve the final load of stones. But just as he called Svadilfari to him, 
a mare appeared in the field. She was so beautiful that 
Svadilfari ignored his master and broke free of his reins. The mason tried to catch him, but the mare ran deep into the 
woods and Svadilfari followed. The stranger was furious. He knew that the gods were behind 
this and confronted them: no longer as a mild-mannered mason, but in his true form as a terrifying 
mountain giant. This was a big mistake. Thor had just returned to Asgard, and now that the gods knew 
a giant was in their midst, they disregarded their oaths. The only payment the 
builder would receive— and the last thing he would ever see— was the swing of Thor’s 
mighty hammer Mjolnir. As they set the final stones into the 
wall, the gods celebrated their victory. Loki was not among them, however. Several months would pass 
before he finally returned, followed by a beautiful gray 
foal with eight legs. The foal would grow into a magnificent 
steed named Sleipnir and become Odin’s mount, a horse 
that could outrun the wind itself. But exactly where he had come from was 
something Loki preferred not to discuss.

**Transcript**:
You know that little pink thing nestled 
in the corner of your eye? It’s actually the remnant 
of a third eyelid. Known as the “plica semilunaris,” it’s much more prominent in birds 
and a few mammals, and functions like a windshield wiper 
to keep dust and debris out of their eyes. But in humans, it doesn’t work. It’s vestigial, meaning it no longer 
serves its original purpose. There are several other vestigial 
structures like the plica semilunaris in the human body. Most of these became vestigial long 
before homo sapiens existed, quietly riding along from one of 
our ancestor species to the next. But why have they stuck 
around for so long? To answer this question, it helps to 
understand natural selection. Natural selection simply means that traits which help an organism survive and 
reproduce in a given environment are more likely to make it to the 
next generation. As the environment changes, traits 
that were once useful can become harmful. Those traits are often selected against, meaning they gradually disappear 
from the population. But if a trait isn’t actively harmful, 
it might not get selected against, and stick around even 
though it isn’t useful. Take the tailbone. Evolutionary biologists think that as the 
climate got drier and grasslands popped up, our tail-bearing ancestors left the trees 
and started walking on land. The tails that had helped them 
in the trees began to disrupt their ability 
to walk on land. So individuals with mutations that reduced
the length of their tails became more successful at life on land, surviving long enough to pass their short 
tails on to the next generation. The change was likely gradual over 
millions of years until, about 20 million years ago, our ancestors’ external tails disappeared 
altogether. Today, we know human embryos have tails
that dissolve as the embryo develops. But the stubby tailbone sticks around, probably because it doesn’t 
cause any harm— in fact, it serves a more minor function as the anchor point for certain 
other muscles. Up to 85% of people have a vestigial 
muscle called the “palmaris longus.” To see if you do, put your hand down on a flat surface 
and touch your pinkie to your thumb. If you see a little band pop up in the 
middle of your wrist, that’s the tendon that attaches to this 
now-defunct muscle. In this case, the fact that not everyone 
has it has helped us trace its function. Vestigial traits can persist when there’s 
no incentive to lose them— but since there’s also no incentive 
to keep them, random mutations will sometimes still
eliminate them from part of the population. Looking at our primate relatives, we can see that the palmaris longus 
is sometimes absent in those that spend more time on the land, but always present in those that spend 
more time in trees. So we think it used to help us swing 
from branch to branch, and became unnecessary when 
we moved down to land. The appendix, meanwhile, may once have 
been part of the intestinal system our ancestors used for digesting 
plant materials. As their diets changed, those parts of the
intestinal system began to shrink. Unlike other vestigial structures, though,
the appendix isn’t always harmless— it can become dangerously inflamed. For most of human history, a burst 
appendix could be a death sentence. So why did it stick around? It’s possible that it was very slowly on 
its way out, or that mutations simply hadn’t arisen 
to make it smaller. Or maybe it has other benefits— for example, it might still be a reservoir
of bacteria that helps us break down food. But the fact is, we’re not really sure why
the appendix persists. Evolution is an imperfect process. Human beings are the result of millions of
years of trial, error, and random chance— and we’re full of evolutionary relics 
to remind us of that.

structures like the plica semilunaris in the human body. Most of these became vestigial long 
before homo sapiens existed, quietly riding along from one of 
our ancestor species to the next. But why have they stuck 
around for so long? To answer this question, it helps to 
understand natural selection. Natural selection simply means that traits which help an organism survive and 
reproduce in a given environment are more likely to make it to the 
next generation. As the environment changes, traits 
that were once useful can become harmful. Those traits are often selected against, meaning they gradually disappear 
from the population. But if a trait isn’t actively harmful, 
it might not get selected against, and stick around even 
though it isn’t useful. Take the tailbone. Evolutionary biologists think that as the 
climate got drier and grasslands popped up, our tail-bearing ancestors left the trees 
and started walking on land. The tails that had helped them 
in the trees began to disrupt their ability 
to walk on land. So individuals with mutations that reduced
the length of their tails became more successful at life on land, surviving long enough to pass their short 
tails on to the next generation. The change was likely gradual over 
millions of years until, about 20 million years ago, our ancestors’ external tails disappeared 
altogether. Today, we know human embryos have tails
that dissolve as the embryo develops. But the stubby tailbone sticks around, probably because it doesn’t 
cause any harm— in fact, it serves a more minor function as the anchor point for certain 
other muscles. Up to 85% of people have a vestigial 
muscle called the “palmaris longus.” To see if you do, put your hand down on a flat surface 
and touch your pinkie to your thumb. If you see a little band pop up in the 
middle of your wrist, that’s the tendon that attaches to this 
now-defunct muscle. In this case, the fact that not everyone 
has it has helped us trace its function. Vestigial traits can persist when there’s 
no incentive to lose them— but since there’s also no incentive 
to keep them, random mutations will sometimes still
eliminate them from part of the population. Looking at our primate relatives, we can see that the palmaris longus 
is sometimes absent in those that spend more time on the land, but always present in those that spend 
more time in trees. So we think it used to help us swing 
from branch to branch, and became unnecessary when 
we moved down to land. The appendix, meanwhile, may once have 
been part of the intestinal system our ancestors used for digesting 
plant materials. As their diets changed, those parts of the
intestinal system began to shrink. Unlike other vestigial structures, though,
the appendix isn’t always harmless— it can become dangerously inflamed. For most of human history, a burst 
appendix could be a death sentence. So why did it stick around? It’s possible that it was very slowly on 
its way out, or that mutations simply hadn’t arisen 
to make it smaller. Or maybe it has other benefits— for example, it might still be a reservoir
of bacteria that helps us break down food. But the fact is, we’re not really sure why
the appendix persists. Evolution is an imperfect process. Human beings are the result of millions of
years of trial, error, and random chance— and we’re full of evolutionary relics 
to remind us of that.

**Transcript**:
A few months ago we posed a challenge 
to our community. We asked everyone: given a range of 
integers from 0 to 100, guess the whole number closest to 2/3 
of the average of all numbers guessed. So if the average of all guesses is 60, 
the correct guess will be 40. What number do you think was the 
correct guess at 2/3 of the average? Let’s see if we can try and reason 
our way to the answer. This game is played under conditions known
to game theorists as common knowledge. Not only does every player have 
the same information — they also know that everyone else does, and that everyone else knows that 
everyone else does, and so on, infinitely. Now, the highest possible average would 
occur if every person guessed 100. In that case, 2/3 of the average 
would be 66.66. Since everyone can figure this out, it wouldn’t make sense to guess 
anything higher than 67. If everyone playing comes to 
this same conclusion, no one will guess higher than 67. Now 67 is the new highest 
possible average, so no reasonable guess should be 
higher than ⅔ of that, which is 44. This logic can be extended further 
and further. With each step, the highest possible 
logical answer keeps getting smaller. So it would seem sensible to guess the 
lowest number possible. And indeed, if everyone chose zero, the game would reach what’s known 
as a Nash Equilibrium. This is a state where every player has 
chosen the best possible strategy for themselves given 
everyone else playing, and no individual player can benefit 
by choosing differently. But, that’s not what happens 
in the real world. People, as it turns out, either aren’t 
perfectly rational, or don’t expect each other 
to be perfectly rational. Or, perhaps, it’s some combination 
of the two. When this game is played in 
real-world settings, the average tends to be somewhere 
between 20 and 35. Danish newspaper Politiken ran the game 
with over 19,000 readers participating, resulting in an average of roughly 22, 
making the correct answer 14. For our audience, the average was 31.3. So if you guessed 21 as 2/3 of 
the average, well done. Economic game theorists have a 
way of modeling this interplay between rationality and practicality 
called k-level reasoning. K stands for the number of times a 
cycle of reasoning is repeated. A person playing at k-level 0 would 
approach our game naively, guessing a number at random without 
thinking about the other players. At k-level 1, a player would assume 
everyone else was playing at level 0, resulting in an average of 50, 
and thus guess 33. At k-level 2, they’d assume that everyone 
else was playing at level 1, leading them to guess 22. It would take 12 k-levels to reach 0. The evidence suggests that most 
people stop at 1 or 2 k-levels. And that’s useful to know, because k-level thinking comes into 
play in high-stakes situations. For example, stock traders evaluate stocks
not only based on earnings reports, but also on the value that others 
place on those numbers. And during penalty kicks in soccer, both the shooter and the goalie decide 
whether to go right or left based on what they think the other 
person is thinking. Goalies often memorize the patterns of 
their opponents ahead of time, but penalty shooters know that 
and can plan accordingly. In each case, participants must weigh 
their own understanding of the best course of action against how 
well they think other participants understand the situation. But 1 or 2 k-levels is by no means 
a hard and fast rule— simply being conscious of this tendency 
can make people adjust their expectations. For instance, what would happen 
if people played the 2/3 game after understanding the difference between
the most logical approach and the most common? Submit your own guess at what 2/3 
of the new average will be by using the form below, and we’ll find out.

place on those numbers. And during penalty kicks in soccer, both the shooter and the goalie decide 
whether to go right or left based on what they think the other 
person is thinking. Goalies often memorize the patterns of 
their opponents ahead of time, but penalty shooters know that 
and can plan accordingly. In each case, participants must weigh 
their own understanding of the best course of action against how 
well they think other participants understand the situation. But 1 or 2 k-levels is by no means 
a hard and fast rule— simply being conscious of this tendency 
can make people adjust their expectations. For instance, what would happen

the most logical approach and the most common? Submit your own guess at what 2/3

**Transcript**:
A few months ago we posed a challenge 
to our community. We asked everyone: given a range of 
integers from 0 to 100, guess the whole number closest to 2/3 
of the average of all numbers guessed. So if the average of all guesses is 60, 
the correct guess will be 40. What number do you think was the 
correct guess at 2/3 of the average? Let’s see if we can try and reason 
our way to the answer. This game is played under conditions known
to game theorists as common knowledge. Not only does every player have 
the same information — they also know that everyone else does, and that everyone else knows that 
everyone else does, and so on, infinitely. Now, the highest possible average would 
occur if every person guessed 100. In that case, 2/3 of the average 
would be 66.66. Since everyone can figure this out, it wouldn’t make sense to guess 
anything higher than 67. If everyone playing comes to 
this same conclusion, no one will guess higher than 67. Now 67 is the new highest 
possible average, so no reasonable guess should be 
higher than ⅔ of that, which is 44. This logic can be extended further 
and further. With each step, the highest possible 
logical answer keeps getting smaller. So it would seem sensible to guess the 
lowest number possible. And indeed, if everyone chose zero, the game would reach what’s known 
as a Nash Equilibrium. This is a state where every player has 
chosen the best possible strategy for themselves given 
everyone else playing, and no individual player can benefit 
by choosing differently. But, that’s not what happens 
in the real world. People, as it turns out, either aren’t 
perfectly rational, or don’t expect each other 
to be perfectly rational. Or, perhaps, it’s some combination 
of the two. When this game is played in 
real-world settings, the average tends to be somewhere 
between 20 and 35. Danish newspaper Politiken ran the game 
with over 19,000 readers participating, resulting in an average of roughly 22, 
making the correct answer 14. For our audience, the average was 31.3. So if you guessed 21 as 2/3 of 
the average, well done. Economic game theorists have a 
way of modeling this interplay between rationality and practicality 
called k-level reasoning. K stands for the number of times a 
cycle of reasoning is repeated. A person playing at k-level 0 would 
approach our game naively, guessing a number at random without 
thinking about the other players. At k-level 1, a player would assume 
everyone else was playing at level 0, resulting in an average of 50, 
and thus guess 33. At k-level 2, they’d assume that everyone 
else was playing at level 1, leading them to guess 22. It would take 12 k-levels to reach 0. The evidence suggests that most 
people stop at 1 or 2 k-levels. And that’s useful to know, because k-level thinking comes into 
play in high-stakes situations. For example, stock traders evaluate stocks
not only based on earnings reports, but also on the value that others 
place on those numbers. And during penalty kicks in soccer, both the shooter and the goalie decide 
whether to go right or left based on what they think the other

**Transcript**:
Before the world of humans began, there was the world of the gods, 
made of fields, plains and gardens. Four brothers wandered this 
celestial realm. They had no family other 
than each other— they didn’t even know who 
their parents were. One of the brothers, Deminan, 
looked different from the others. His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone had 
been marked with this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit 
Yaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers snuck 
into Yaya’s house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted
a giant gourd hanging in the corner. But as they tried to look inside 
the gourd, they dropped it. The gourd broke apart, releasing a deluge 
that swept the brothers away, separating them from the 
celestial lands forever. The waters from the gourd 
formed a new world. This realm was covered in seas, 
which didn’t exist in the gods’ world. The waters were full of fish 
and other creatures, and dotted with islands and caves. This world of seas was also cut off 
completely from the celestial realm, and the brothers wandered aimlessly, even more lost than they had been before. One day, three of the brothers 
stumbled upon a house. In the house lived an elder named 
Bayamanacao, and he invited them in. When Deminan caught up slightly later, 
he followed them into the house. Bayamanacao told the brothers 
he was their grandfather and gave them a gift of special 
cassava bread. He revealed their family lineage to them: their mother had been the Earth Mother 
Goddess Itibi Cahubaba and had died when they were born. The brothers were grateful for his 
hospitality and insight into their past. But then Bayamanacao turned on Deminan, blowing tobacco spittle from his nose 
onto Deminan’s back. The spot where the spittle landed 
immediately began to swell and sting. Soon Deminan was delirious and his back was so swollen his 
brothers feared he would die. Not knowing what else to do, 
they cut open the welt. A turtle emerged from the 
wound and swam away, alternating easily between sea 
and land as she went. When Deminan recovered from his delirium, he finally understood what the 
curse of his disease meant: he was a caracaracol, 
able to communicate with the gods. He was the link between the celestial 
realm and the earthly realm. Deminan was the first in a long 
lineage of caracaracols. The world of seas he and his brothers 
had created when they dropped the gourd became the world of humans, where the caracaracols who followed 
Deminan maintained the delicate balance between people and gods. But their unique power came at a price: Deminan and all the caracaracols 
who followed him continued to suffer from the illness that 
had first marked Deminan as special. Represented in Taino carvings 
and figurines with a swollen back and emaciated arms, the caracaracol is both cursed and blessed
to be a conduit between worlds.

been marked with this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit 
Yaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers snuck 
into Yaya’s house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted
a giant gourd hanging in the corner. But as they tried to look inside 
the gourd, they dropped it. The gourd broke apart, releasing a deluge 
that swept the brothers away, separating them from the 
celestial lands forever. The waters from the gourd 
formed a new world. This realm was covered in seas, 
which didn’t exist in the gods’ world. The waters were full of fish 
and other creatures, and dotted with islands and caves. This world of seas was also cut off 
completely from the celestial realm, and the brothers wandered aimlessly, even more lost than they had been before. One day, three of the brothers 
stumbled upon a house. In the house lived an elder named 
Bayamanacao, and he invited them in. When Deminan caught up slightly later, 
he followed them into the house. Bayamanacao told the brothers 
he was their grandfather and gave them a gift of special 
cassava bread. He revealed their family lineage to them: their mother had been the Earth Mother 
Goddess Itibi Cahubaba and had died when they were born. The brothers were grateful for his 
hospitality and insight into their past. But then Bayamanacao turned on Deminan, blowing tobacco spittle from his nose 
onto Deminan’s back. The spot where the spittle landed 
immediately began to swell and sting. Soon Deminan was delirious and his back was so swollen his 
brothers feared he would die. Not knowing what else to do, 
they cut open the welt. A turtle emerged from the 
wound and swam away, alternating easily between sea 
and land as she went. When Deminan recovered from his delirium, he finally understood what the 
curse of his disease meant: he was a caracaracol, 
able to communicate with the gods. He was the link between the celestial 
realm and the earthly realm. Deminan was the first in a long 
lineage of caracaracols. The world of seas he and his brothers 
had created when they dropped the gourd became the world of humans, where the caracaracols who followed 
Deminan maintained the delicate balance between people and gods. But their unique power came at a price: Deminan and all the caracaracols 
who followed him continued to suffer from the illness that 
had first marked Deminan as special. Represented in Taino carvings 
and figurines with a swollen back and emaciated arms, the caracaracol is both cursed and blessed
to be a conduit between worlds.

**Transcript**:
The year was 1776. In Bavaria, new ideals of rationalism, 
religious freedom, and universal human rights competed with the Catholic church’s 
heavy influence over public affairs. Across the Atlantic, a new nation staked its claim for 
independence on the basis of these ideas. But back in Bavaria, law professor Adam Weishaupt’s 
attempts to teach secular philosophy continued to be frustrated. Weishaupt decided to spread his ideas 
through a secret society that would shine a light on the 
shortcomings of the Church’s ideology. He called his secret society 
the Illuminati. Weishaupt modelled aspects of his secret 
society off a group called the Freemasons. Originally an elite stoneworkers’ 
guild in the late Middle Ages, the Freemasons had gone from passing 
down the craft of masonry to more generally promoting ideals of 
knowledge and reason. Over time, they had grown into a 
semi-secret, exclusive order that included many wealthy and 
influential individuals, with elaborate, secret initiation rituals. Weishaupt created his parallel 
society while also joining the Freemasons and recruiting from their ranks. He adopted the code name 
Spartacus for himself, after the famed leader of the 
Roman slave revolt. Early members became the Illuminati’s 
ruling council, or Areopagus. One of these members, Baron Adolph 
Knigge, was also a freemason, and became an influential recruiter. With Knigge’s help, the Illuminati 
expanded their numbers, gained influence within 
several Masonic chapters, and incorporated Masonic rituals. By 1784, there were over 600 members, including influential scholars 
and politicians. As the Illuminati gained members, the American Revolution also 
gained momentum. Thomas Jefferson would later cite 
Weishaupt as an inspiration. European monarchs and clergy were fearful 
of similar revolts on their home soil. Meanwhile, the existence of the Illuminati
had become an open secret. Both the Illuminati and the Freemasons 
drew exclusively from society’s wealthy elite, which meant they were constantly 
rubbing shoulders with members of the religious and 
political establishment. Many in the government and church 
believed that both groups were determined to undermine the 
people’s religious faith. But these groups didn’t necessarily 
oppose religion— they just believed it should be kept 
separate from governance. Still, the suspicious Bavarian government 
started keeping records of alleged members of the Illuminati. Just as Illuminati members begun to secure
important positions in local governments and universities, a 1784 decree by Duke Karl Theodor 
of Bavaria banned all secret societies. While a public ban on something ostensibly
secret might seem difficult to enforce, in this case it worked. Only nine years after its founding, the group dissolved, 
their records were seized, and Weishaupt forced into exile. The Illuminati would become more 
notorious in their afterlife than they had ever been in 
their brief existence. A decade later, in the aftermath 
of the French Revolution, conservative authors claimed the 
Illuminati had survived their banishment and orchestrated the overthrow 
of the monarchy. In the United States, preacher Jedidiah Morse promoted 
similar ideas of an Illuminati conspiracy against the government. But though the idea of a secret group 
orchestrating political upheaval is still alive and well today, there is no
evidence that the Illuminati survived, reformed, or went underground. Their brief tenure is well-documented 
in Bavarian government records, the still-active Freemasons’s records, and particularly the overlap between 
these two sources, without a whisper since. In the spirit of rationalism the 
Illuminati embraced, one must conclude they no longer exist. But the ideas that spurred Weishaupt 
to found the illuminati still spread, becoming the basis for many Western 
governments today. These ideas didn’t start or end 
with the Illuminati— instead, it was one community that 
represented a wave of change that was already underway 
when it was founded and continued long after it ended.

**Transcript**:
The year was 1776. In Bavaria, new ideals of rationalism, 
religious freedom, and universal human rights competed with the Catholic church’s 
heavy influence over public affairs. Across the Atlantic, a new nation staked its claim for 
independence on the basis of these ideas. But back in Bavaria, law professor Adam Weishaupt’s 
attempts to teach secular philosophy continued to be frustrated. Weishaupt decided to spread his ideas 
through a secret society that would shine a light on the 
shortcomings of the Church’s ideology. He called his secret society 
the Illuminati. Weishaupt modelled aspects of his secret 
society off a group called the Freemasons. Originally an elite stoneworkers’ 
guild in the late Middle Ages, the Freemasons had gone from passing 
down the craft of masonry to more generally promoting ideals of 
knowledge and reason. Over time, they had grown into a 
semi-secret, exclusive order that included many wealthy and 
influential individuals, with elaborate, secret initiation rituals. Weishaupt created his parallel 
society while also joining the Freemasons and recruiting from their ranks. He adopted the code name 
Spartacus for himself, after the famed leader of the 
Roman slave revolt. Early members became the Illuminati’s 
ruling council, or Areopagus. One of these members, Baron Adolph 
Knigge, was also a freemason, and became an influential recruiter. With Knigge’s help, the Illuminati 
expanded their numbers, gained influence within 
several Masonic chapters, and incorporated Masonic rituals. By 1784, there were over 600 members, including influential scholars 
and politicians. As the Illuminati gained members, the American Revolution also 
gained momentum. Thomas Jefferson would later cite 
Weishaupt as an inspiration. European monarchs and clergy were fearful 
of similar revolts on their home soil. Meanwhile, the existence of the Illuminati
had become an open secret. Both the Illuminati and the Freemasons 
drew exclusively from society’s wealthy elite, which meant they were constantly 
rubbing shoulders with members of the religious and 
political establishment. Many in the government and church 
believed that both groups were determined to undermine the 
people’s religious faith. But these groups didn’t necessarily 
oppose religion— they just believed it should be kept 
separate from governance. Still, the suspicious Bavarian government 
started keeping records of alleged members of the Illuminati. Just as Illuminati members begun to secure
important positions in local governments and universities, a 1784 decree by Duke Karl Theodor 
of Bavaria banned all secret societies. While a public ban on something ostensibly
secret might seem difficult to enforce, in this case it worked. Only nine years after its founding, the group dissolved, 
their records were seized, and Weishaupt forced into exile. The Illuminati would become more 
notorious in their afterlife than they had ever been in 
their brief existence. A decade later, in the aftermath 
of the French Revolution, conservative authors claimed the 
Illuminati had survived their banishment and orchestrated the overthrow 
of the monarchy. In the United States, preacher Jedidiah Morse promoted 
similar ideas of an Illuminati conspiracy against the government. But though the idea of a secret group 
orchestrating political upheaval is still alive and well today, there is no
evidence that the Illuminati survived, reformed, or went underground. Their brief tenure is well-documented 
in Bavarian government records, the still-active Freemasons’s records, and particularly the overlap between 
these two sources, without a whisper since. In the spirit of rationalism the 
Illuminati embraced, one must conclude they no longer exist. But the ideas that spurred Weishaupt 
to found the illuminati still spread, becoming the basis for many Western 
governments today. These ideas didn’t start or end 
with the Illuminati— instead, it was one community that 
represented a wave of change that was already underway 
when it was founded and continued long after it ended.

**Transcript**:
Consider the claw. Frequently found on four-limbed 
animals around the world, it’s one of nature’s most 
versatile tools. Bears use claws for digging 
as well as defense. An eagle’s needle-like talons can pierce 
the skulls of their prey. And lions can retract their massive claws 
for easy movement, before flicking them out to hunt. Even the ancestors of primates used to 
wield these impressive appendages, until their claws evolved into nails. So what in our evolutionary past led to 
this manicured adaptation, and what can nails do that their 
sharper cousins can’t? When nails first appeared in the fossil 
record around 55.8 million years ago, claws had already been present for 
over 260 million years in the ancestors of mammals and reptiles. But despite the gulf of time between 
their emergence, these adaptations are both part of the 
same evolutionary story. Both nails and claws are made of keratin— a tough, fibrous protein also found in 
horns, scales, hooves and hair. This protein is produced by a wedge of 
tissue called the keratin matrix. Rich in blood vessels and nutrients, this protein factory produces an 
endless stream of keratin, which is tightly packed into cells 
called keratinocytes. These high-density cells give nails and 
claws their trademark toughness. Since nails evolved from claws, both adaptations produce keratinocytes 
in the same way. The cells grow out from the matrix, emerging from the skin where they die 
and harden into a water-resistant sheath. The primary difference between the 
two keratin coverings is really just their shape, which depends on the shape of the bone 
at the end of the animal’s digits. In claws, the bed of keratinocytes 
conforms to a narrow finger bone, wrapping around the end of the digit 
and radiating outwards to form a cone-shaped structure. Animals with nails, on the other hand, 
have much broader digits, and keratinocytes only cover the top 
surface of their wide bones. It’s possible that nails have simply 
persisted as a side effect of primates evolving wider, 
more dexterous fingers. But given what we know about the 
habitats of our primate ancestors, it’s more likely that nails came with 
their own powerful advantages. High in the forest canopy where 
these primates lived, wide finger bones and expansive 
finger pads were ideal for gripping narrow branches. And nails improved that grip even further. By providing a rigid surface 
to press against, primates could splay out their pads to 
create even more contact with the trees. Additionally, nails improved the 
sensitivity of their digits by providing an extra surface to detect 
changes in pressure while climbing. This combination of sensitivity 
and dexterity gave our ancestors the precise motor 
control needed to snatch up insects, pinch berries and seeds, and keep a 
firm grip on slim branches. The evolution of nails and the evolution 
of opposable thumbs and toes are closely linked. And when our ancestors moved 
down from the trees, this flexible grasp enabled them to create
and wield complex tools. Even if it was possible for wide 
fingers to sport claws, their sharp points would’ve 
likely interfered with these primates’ regular tasks. Claws are ideal for piercing, 
puncturing, and hooking, but their points make grabbing difficult, 
and potentially dangerous. However, both claws and nails are 
used in some unexpected ways. Manatees use nails to grasp their food, and researchers think elephant toenails 
may sense vibrations in the ground to help them hear. Meanwhile, some primates, 
like the aye-ayes of Madagascar, have re-acquired claws. They use these extra-long appendages 
to tap branches and trunks, while listening for hollow sections 
with their bat-like ears. When they hear an opening, 
they burrow into the tree and skewer grubs with their needle-like 
middle finger. We’ve only scratched the surface of all 
the incredible ways nails and claws are used throughout the animal kingdom. But as for which of these 
adaptations is better? That’s an answer we may never nail down.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 20, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 2
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Consider the claw. Frequently found on four-limbed 
animals around the world, it’s one of nature’s most 
versatile tools. Bears use claws for digging 
as well as defense. An eagle’s needle-like talons can pierce 
the skulls of their prey. And lions can retract their massive claws 
for easy movement, before flicking them out to hunt. Even the ancestors of primates used to 
wield these impressive appendages, until their claws evolved into nails. So what in our evolutionary past led to 
this manicured adaptation, and what can nails do that their 
sharper cousins can’t? When nails first appeared in the fossil 
record around 55.8 million years ago, claws had already been present for 
over 260 million years in the ancestors of mammals and reptiles. But despite the gulf of time between 
their emergence, these adaptations are both part of the 
same evolutionary story. Both nails and claws are made of keratin— a tough, fibrous protein also found in 
horns, scales, hooves and hair. This protein is produced by a wedge of 
tissue called the keratin matrix. Rich in blood vessels and nutrients, this protein factory produces an 
endless stream of keratin, which is tightly packed into cells 
called keratinocytes. These high-density cells give nails and 
claws their trademark toughness. Since nails evolved from claws, both adaptations produce keratinocytes 
in the same way. The cells grow out from the matrix, emerging from the skin where they die 
and harden into a water-resistant sheath. The primary difference between the 
two keratin coverings is really just their shape, which depends on the shape of the bone 
at the end of the animal’s digits. In claws, the bed of keratinocytes 
conforms to a narrow finger bone, wrapping around the end of the digit 
and radiating outwards to form a cone-shaped structure. Animals with nails, on the other hand, 
have much broader digits, and keratinocytes only cover the top 
surface of their wide bones. It’s possible that nails have simply 
persisted as a side effect of primates evolving wider, 
more dexterous fingers. But given what we know about the 
habitats of our primate ancestors, it’s more likely that nails came with 
their own powerful advantages. High in the forest canopy where 
these primates lived, wide finger bones and expansive 
finger pads were ideal for gripping narrow branches. And nails improved that grip even further. By providing a rigid surface 
to press against, primates could splay out their pads to 
create even more contact with the trees. Additionally, nails improved the 
sensitivity of their digits by providing an extra surface to detect 
changes in pressure while climbing. This combination of sensitivity 
and dexterity gave our ancestors the precise motor 
control needed to snatch up insects, pinch berries and seeds, and keep a 
firm grip on slim branches. The evolution of nails and the evolution

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 21, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 3
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine a future where nobody dies— instead, our minds are uploaded 
to a digital world. They might live on in a realistic,
simulated environment with avatar bodies, and could still call in and contribute 
to the biological world. Mind uploading has powerful appeal— but what would it actually take to scan a 
person’s brain and upload their mind? The main challenges are scanning a brain 
in enough detail to capture the mind and perfectly recreating 
that detail artificially. But first, we have to know what to scan. The human brain contains 
about 86 billion neurons, connected by at least a 
hundred trillion synapses. The pattern of connectivity 
among the brain’s neurons, that is, all of the neurons and 
all their connections to each other, is called the connectome. We haven’t yet mapped 
the connectome, and there’s also a lot more 
to neural signaling. There are hundreds, possibly thousands 
of different kinds of connections, or synapses. Each functions in a slightly 
different way. Some work faster, some slower. Some grow or shrink rapidly in 
the process of learning; some are more stable over time. And beyond the trillions of precise, 
1-to-1 connections between neurons, some neurons also spray out 
neurotransmitters that affect many other neurons at once. All of these different kinds of 
interactions would need to be mapped in order to 
copy a person’s mind. There are also a lot of influences on 
neural signaling that are poorly understood 
or undiscovered. To name just one example, patterns of activity between neurons are likely influenced by a type 
of cell called glia. Glia surround neurons and, 
according to some scientists, may even outnumber them 
by as many as ten to one. Glia were once thought to be purely 
for structural support, and their functions are still 
poorly understood, but at least some of them can generate 
their own signals that influence information processing. Our understanding of the brain isn’t good 
enough to determine what we’d need to scan in order 
to replicate the mind, but assuming our knowledge does 
advance to that point, how would we scan it? Currently, we can accurately scan a living
human brain with resolutions of about half a 
millimeter using our best non-invasive 
scanning method, MRI. To detect a synapse, we’ll need to scan 
at a resolution of about a micron— a thousandth of a millimeter. To distinguish the kind of synapse and 
precisely how strong each synapse is, we’ll need even better resolution. MRI depends on powerful magnetic fields. Scanning at the resolution required to determine the details of 
individual synapses would requires a field strength high 
enough to cook a person’s tissues. So this kind of leap in resolution would require fundamentally 
new scanning technology. It would be more feasible to scan a dead
brain using an electron microscope, but even that technology is nowhere 
near good enough– and requires killing the subject first. Assuming we eventually understand the 
brain well enough to know what to scan and develop the technology to safely 
scan at that resolution, the next challenge would be to recreate 
that information digitally. The main obstacles to doing so are 
computing power and storage space, both of which are improving every year. We’re actually much closer to attaining 
this technological capacity than we are to understanding or scanning 
our own minds. Artificial neural networks already run 
our internet search engines, digital assistants, self-driving cars, 
Wall Street trading algorithms, and smart phones. Nobody has yet built an artificial network
with 86 billion neurons, but as computing technology improves, it may be possible to keep track 
of such massive data sets. At every step in the scanning and 
uploading process, we’d have to be certain we were capturing 
all the necessary information accurately— or there’s no telling what ruined 
version of a mind might emerge. While mind uploading is 
theoretically possible, we’re likely hundreds of years away from the technology
and scientific understanding that would make it a reality. And that reality would come with ethical 
and philosophical considerations: who would have access to mind uploading? What rights would be accorded to 
uploaded minds? How could this technology be abused? Even if we can eventually upload 
our minds, whether we should remains 
an open question.

or undiscovered. To name just one example, patterns of activity between neurons are likely influenced by a type 
of cell called glia. Glia surround neurons and, 
according to some scientists, may even outnumber them 
by as many as ten to one. Glia were once thought to be purely 
for structural support, and their functions are still 
poorly understood, but at least some of them can generate 
their own signals that influence information processing. Our understanding of the brain isn’t good 
enough to determine what we’d need to scan in order 
to replicate the mind, but assuming our knowledge does 
advance to that point, how would we scan it? Currently, we can accurately scan a living
human brain with resolutions of about half a 
millimeter using our best non-invasive 
scanning method, MRI. To detect a synapse, we’ll need to scan 
at a resolution of about a micron— a thousandth of a millimeter. To distinguish the kind of synapse and 
precisely how strong each synapse is, we’ll need even better resolution. MRI depends on powerful magnetic fields. Scanning at the resolution required to determine the details of 
individual synapses would requires a field strength high 
enough to cook a person’s tissues. So this kind of leap in resolution would require fundamentally 
new scanning technology. It would be more feasible to scan a dead
brain using an electron microscope, but even that technology is nowhere 
near good enough– and requires killing the subject first. Assuming we eventually understand the 
brain well enough to know what to scan and develop the technology to safely 
scan at that resolution, the next challenge would be to recreate 
that information digitally. The main obstacles to doing so are 
computing power and storage space, both of which are improving every year. We’re actually much closer to attaining 
this technological capacity than we are to understanding or scanning 
our own minds. Artificial neural networks already run 
our internet search engines, digital assistants, self-driving cars, 
Wall Street trading algorithms, and smart phones. Nobody has yet built an artificial network
with 86 billion neurons, but as computing technology improves, it may be possible to keep track 
of such massive data sets. At every step in the scanning and 
uploading process, we’d have to be certain we were capturing 
all the necessary information accurately— or there’s no telling what ruined 
version of a mind might emerge. While mind uploading is 
theoretically possible, we’re likely hundreds of years away from the technology
and scientific understanding that would make it a reality. And that reality would come with ethical 
and philosophical considerations: who would have access to mind uploading? What rights would be accorded to 
uploaded minds? How could this technology be abused? Even if we can eventually upload 
our minds, whether we should remains 
an open question.

**Transcript**:
Hephaestus, god of technology, was hard at
work on his most ingenious invention yet. He was creating a new defense 
system for King Minos, who wanted fewer intruders on his 
island kingdom of Crete. But mortal guards and ordinary 
weapons wouldn’t suffice, so the visionary god devised an 
indomitable new defender. In the fires of his forge, Hephaestus cast his invention in 
the shape of a giant man. Made of gleaming bronze; endowed with 
superhuman strength, and powered by ichor, 
the life fluid of the gods, this automaton was unlike anything 
Hephaestus had forged before. The god named his creation Talos: 
the first robot. Three times a day, the bronze guardian 
marched around the island's perimeter searching for interlopers. When he identified ships 
approaching the coast, he hurled massive boulders 
into their path. If any survivors made it ashore, he would heat his metal body red-hot 
and crush victims to his chest. Talos was intended to fulfill his duties 
day after day, with no variation. But despite his robotic behavior, he possessed an internal life his victims 
could scarcely imagine. And soon, the behemoth would encounter a ship 
of invaders that would test his mettle. The bedraggled crew of Jason, Medea, 
and the Argonauts were returning from their hard-won quest 
to retrieve the Golden Fleece. Their adventure had taken 
many dark turns, and the weary sailors were desperate 
to rest in a safe harbor. They’d heard tales of Crete’s invulnerable
bronze colossus, and made for a sheltered cove. But before they could even drop anchor, 
Talos spotted them. While the Argonauts cowered at the 
approach of the awesome automaton, the sorceress Medea spotted a glinting 
bolt on the robot’s ankle— and devised a clever gambit. Medea offered Talos a bargain: she claimed that she could 
make Talos immortal in exchange for removing the bolt. Medea's promise resonated deep 
within his core. Unaware of his own mechanical nature, and human enough to long for 
eternal life, Talos agreed. While Medea muttered incantations, 
Jason removed the bolt. As Medea suspected, the bolt was a 
weak point in Hephaestus’ design. The ichor flowed out like molten lead, 
draining Talos of his power source. The robot collapsed with 
a thunderous crash, and the Argonauts were free 
to travel home. This story, first recorded in 
roughly 700 BCE, raises some familiar anxieties 
about artificial intelligence— and even provides an ancient 
blueprint for science fiction. But according to historians, ancient 
robots were more than just myths. By the 4th century BCE, Greek engineers began making 
actual automatons including robotic servants and 
flying models of birds. None of these creations were 
as famous as Talos, who appeared on Greek coins, vase 
paintings, public frescoes, and in theatrical performances. Even 2,500 years ago, Greeks had already begun to investigate 
the uncertain line between human and machine. And like many modern myths about 
artificial intelligence, Talos’ tale is as much about his robotic 
heart as it is about his robotic brain. Illustrating the demise of Talos on a 
vase of the fifth century BCE, one painter captured the dying 
automaton’s despair with a tear rolling down his bronze cheek.

**Transcript**:
Hephaestus, god of technology, was hard at
work on his most ingenious invention yet. He was creating a new defense 
system for King Minos, who wanted fewer intruders on his 
island kingdom of Crete. But mortal guards and ordinary 
weapons wouldn’t suffice, so the visionary god devised an 
indomitable new defender. In the fires of his forge, Hephaestus cast his invention in 
the shape of a giant man. Made of gleaming bronze; endowed with 
superhuman strength, and powered by ichor, 
the life fluid of the gods, this automaton was unlike anything 
Hephaestus had forged before. The god named his creation Talos: 
the first robot. Three times a day, the bronze guardian 
marched around the island's perimeter searching for interlopers. When he identified ships 
approaching the coast, he hurled massive boulders 
into their path. If any survivors made it ashore, he would heat his metal body red-hot 
and crush victims to his chest. Talos was intended to fulfill his duties 
day after day, with no variation. But despite his robotic behavior, he possessed an internal life his victims 
could scarcely imagine. And soon, the behemoth would encounter a ship 
of invaders that would test his mettle. The bedraggled crew of Jason, Medea, 
and the Argonauts were returning from their hard-won quest 
to retrieve the Golden Fleece. Their adventure had taken 
many dark turns, and the weary sailors were desperate 
to rest in a safe harbor. They’d heard tales of Crete’s invulnerable
bronze colossus, and made for a sheltered cove. But before they could even drop anchor, 
Talos spotted them. While the Argonauts cowered at the 
approach of the awesome automaton, the sorceress Medea spotted a glinting 
bolt on the robot’s ankle— and devised a clever gambit. Medea offered Talos a bargain: she claimed that she could 
make Talos immortal in exchange for removing the bolt. Medea's promise resonated deep 
within his core. Unaware of his own mechanical nature, and human enough to long for 
eternal life, Talos agreed. While Medea muttered incantations, 
Jason removed the bolt. As Medea suspected, the bolt was a 
weak point in Hephaestus’ design. The ichor flowed out like molten lead, 
draining Talos of his power source. The robot collapsed with 
a thunderous crash, and the Argonauts were free 
to travel home. This story, first recorded in 
roughly 700 BCE, raises some familiar anxieties 
about artificial intelligence— and even provides an ancient 
blueprint for science fiction. But according to historians, ancient 
robots were more than just myths. By the 4th century BCE, Greek engineers began making 
actual automatons including robotic servants and 
flying models of birds. None of these creations were 
as famous as Talos, who appeared on Greek coins, vase 
paintings, public frescoes, and in theatrical performances. Even 2,500 years ago, Greeks had already begun to investigate 
the uncertain line between human and machine. And like many modern myths about 
artificial intelligence, Talos’ tale is as much about his robotic 
heart as it is about his robotic brain. Illustrating the demise of Talos on a 
vase of the fifth century BCE, one painter captured the dying 
automaton’s despair with a tear rolling down his bronze cheek.

**Transcript**:
Scientists work on the boundaries of 
the unknown, where every new piece of knowledge 
forms a path into a void of uncertainty. And nothing is more uncertain– or potentially enlightening– 
than a paradox. Throughout history, paradoxes have threatened to 
undermine everything we know, and just as often, they’ve reshaped our 
understanding of the world. Today, one of the biggest paradoxes in 
the universe threatens to unravel the fields of general
relativity and quantum mechanics: the black hole information paradox. To understand this paradox, we first need to define what we mean
by "information." Typically, the information we talk about 
is visible to the naked eye. For example, this kind of information tells us that 
an apple is red, round, and shiny. But physicists are more concerned with 
quantum information. This refers to the quantum properties of 
all the particles that make up that apple, such as their position, velocity and spin. Every object in the universe is composed of particles with unique 
quantum properties. This idea is evoked most significantly 
in a vital law of physics: the total amount of quantum information
in the Universe must be conserved. Even if you destroy an object beyond 
recognition, its quantum information is never 
permanently deleted. And theoretically, knowledge of that 
information would allow us to recreate the object 
from its particle components. Conservation of information isn’t just an 
arbitrary rule, but a mathematical necessity, upon which 
much of modern science is built. But around black holes, 
those foundations get shaken. When an apple enters a black hole, it seems as though it leaves the universe, and all its quantum information 
becomes irretrievably lost. However, this doesn’t immediately 
break the laws of physics. The information is out of sight, but it might still exist within the 
black hole’s mysterious void. Alternatively, some theories suggest that information doesn’t even make it
inside the black hole at all. Seen from outside, it’s as if the apple’s 
quantum information is encoded on the surface layer of the
black hole, called the event horizon. As the black hole’s mass increases, the surface of the event horizon 
increases as well. So it’s possible that as a black hole 
swallows an object, it also grows large enough to conserve
the object’s quantum information. But whether information is conserved 
inside the black hole or on its surface, the laws of physics remain intact– until you account for Hawking Radiation. Discovered by Stephen Hawking in 1974, this phenomenon shows that black 
holes are gradually evaporating. Over incredibly long periods of time black holes lose mass as they shed 
particles away from their event horizons. Critically, it seems as though the 
evaporating particles are unrelated to the information 
the black hole encodes– suggesting that a black hole and all the
quantum information it contains could be completely erased. Does that quantum information 
truly disappear? If not, where does it go? While the evaporation process 
would take an incredibly long time, the questions it raises for physics 
are far more urgent. The destruction of information would force us to rewrite some of our most
fundamental scientific paradigms. But fortunately, in science, every paradox is an opportunity 
for new discoveries. Researchers are investigating a broad 
range of possible solutions to the Information Paradox. Some have theorized that information actually is encoded 
in the escaping radiation, in some way we can’t yet understand. Others have suggested the paradox is 
just a misunderstanding of how general relativity and 
quantum field theory interact. Respectively, these two theories describe the largest
and smallest physical phenomena, and they’re notoriously 
difficult to combine. Some researchers argue that a solution
to this and many other paradoxes will come naturally with a “unified 
theory of everything.” But perhaps the most mind-bending 
theory to come from exploring this paradox is the holographic principle. Expanding on the idea that the 2D 
surface of an event horizon can store quantum information, this principle suggests that the very 
boundary of the observable universe is also a 2D surface encoded 
with information about real, 3D objects. If this is true, it’s possible that 
reality as we know it is just a holographic 
projection of that information. If proven, any of these theories would 
open up new questions to explore, while still preserving our current 
models of the universe. But it’s also possible that those 
models are wrong! Either way, this paradox has already 
helped us take another step into the unknown.

evaporating particles are unrelated to the information 
the black hole encodes– suggesting that a black hole and all the
quantum information it contains could be completely erased. Does that quantum information 
truly disappear? If not, where does it go? While the evaporation process 
would take an incredibly long time, the questions it raises for physics 
are far more urgent. The destruction of information would force us to rewrite some of our most
fundamental scientific paradigms. But fortunately, in science, every paradox is an opportunity 
for new discoveries. Researchers are investigating a broad 
range of possible solutions to the Information Paradox. Some have theorized that information actually is encoded 
in the escaping radiation, in some way we can’t yet understand. Others have suggested the paradox is 
just a misunderstanding of how general relativity and 
quantum field theory interact. Respectively, these two theories describe the largest
and smallest physical phenomena, and they’re notoriously 
difficult to combine. Some researchers argue that a solution
to this and many other paradoxes will come naturally with a “unified 
theory of everything.” But perhaps the most mind-bending 
theory to come from exploring this paradox is the holographic principle. Expanding on the idea that the 2D 
surface of an event horizon can store quantum information, this principle suggests that the very 
boundary of the observable universe is also a 2D surface encoded 
with information about real, 3D objects. If this is true, it’s possible that 
reality as we know it is just a holographic 
projection of that information. If proven, any of these theories would 
open up new questions to explore, while still preserving our current 
models of the universe. But it’s also possible that those 
models are wrong! Either way, this paradox has already 
helped us take another step into the unknown.

**Transcript**:
Scientists work on the boundaries of 
the unknown, where every new piece of knowledge 
forms a path into a void of uncertainty. And nothing is more uncertain– or potentially enlightening– 
than a paradox. Throughout history, paradoxes have threatened to 
undermine everything we know, and just as often, they’ve reshaped our 
understanding of the world. Today, one of the biggest paradoxes in 
the universe threatens to unravel the fields of general
relativity and quantum mechanics: the black hole information paradox. To understand this paradox, we first need to define what we mean
by "information." Typically, the information we talk about 
is visible to the naked eye. For example, this kind of information tells us that 
an apple is red, round, and shiny. But physicists are more concerned with 
quantum information. This refers to the quantum properties of 
all the particles that make up that apple, such as their position, velocity and spin. Every object in the universe is composed of particles with unique 
quantum properties. This idea is evoked most significantly 
in a vital law of physics: the total amount of quantum information
in the Universe must be conserved. Even if you destroy an object beyond 
recognition, its quantum information is never 
permanently deleted. And theoretically, knowledge of that 
information would allow us to recreate the object 
from its particle components. Conservation of information isn’t just an 
arbitrary rule, but a mathematical necessity, upon which 
much of modern science is built. But around black holes, 
those foundations get shaken. When an apple enters a black hole, it seems as though it leaves the universe, and all its quantum information 
becomes irretrievably lost. However, this doesn’t immediately 
break the laws of physics. The information is out of sight, but it might still exist within the 
black hole’s mysterious void. Alternatively, some theories suggest that information doesn’t even make it
inside the black hole at all. Seen from outside, it’s as if the apple’s 
quantum information is encoded on the surface layer of the
black hole, called the event horizon. As the black hole’s mass increases, the surface of the event horizon 
increases as well. So it’s possible that as a black hole 
swallows an object, it also grows large enough to conserve
the object’s quantum information. But whether information is conserved 
inside the black hole or on its surface, the laws of physics remain intact– until you account for Hawking Radiation. Discovered by Stephen Hawking in 1974, this phenomenon shows that black 
holes are gradually evaporating. Over incredibly long periods of time black holes lose mass as they shed 
particles away from their event horizons. Critically, it seems as though the 
evaporating particles are unrelated to the information 
the black hole encodes– suggesting that a black hole and all the
quantum information it contains could be completely erased. Does that quantum information 
truly disappear? If not, where does it go? While the evaporation process 
would take an incredibly long time, the questions it raises for physics 
are far more urgent. The destruction of information would force us to rewrite some of our most
fundamental scientific paradigms. But fortunately, in science, every paradox is an opportunity

**Transcript**:
Chak Ek’ rose from the underworld 
to the surface of the eastern sea and on into the heavens. His brother K’in Ahaw followed. Though Chak Ek’ had risen first, 
K’in Ahaw outshone him, and the resentful Chak Ek’ descended back
to the underworld to plot against his brother. In Mayan mythology, Chak Ek’ represents 
Venus and K’in Ahaw represents the sun. Known as both the morning and the 
evening star, Venus moves through the sky, 
sometimes visible before sunrise, sometimes after sunset,
and occasionally not at all. The ancient Maya identified this roughly 
584 day cycle more than a thousand years ago and it still accurately predicts when and 
where Venus will appear in the sky around the world. Five of these cycles make up almost 
exactly eight years, and the Maya also recognized 
this larger cycle. They assigned Chak Ek’ five 
different forms, one for each cycle of Venus, 
that were repeated every eight years. Within the 584 day cycle, Venus is visible
in the evening sky for 250 days, then disappears for 8 days before 
reappearing as the Morning Star. The ancient Maya ascribed particular 
significance to this point in this cycle: the first time Venus appears before 
sunrise after being invisible. On this day, Chak Ek’ rose again from the 
underworld, wielding a spearthrower and darts. To bring discord to the world, he decided to attack his brother 
and his brother’s allies. His first target was K’awiil, god of 
sustenance and lightning. Rising in the late rainy season, Chak Ek’ 
aimed his spear and struck K’awiil, causing damage to the food and a 
period of chaos in the social order until K’awiil was reborn. 584 days after attacking K’awiil, Chak Ek’ turned his attention back to his 
brother, the Sun. Each night, the Sun took the form of 
jaguar and journeyed through the underworld. Chak Ek’ speared the jaguar sun as it rose
at dawn towards the end of the dry season. The Sun was wounded, plunging the 
world into a period of chaos and warfare. Chak Ek’s third victim 
was the god of maize, who provided sustenance for all humankind. Chak Ek’ speared him at the 
time of the harvest. He was buried in the underworld, 
and maize—the staple of life— was no longer available 
to Earth’s inhabitants. But the maize god emerged after three 
months in the place of new beginnings– the eastern cave known as Seven Water 
Place– bringing food once again to earth. When the turtle Ak Na'ak rose in the sky 
to mark the summer solstice, Chak Ek’ claimed his fourth victim. With the death of this good omen, 
the Sun, the food supply, and the people were buried within the earth, and the 
forces of chaos reigned. But out of the chaos rose a new order
established by Hun Ajaw, one of the hero twins known to all for having vanquished 
the lords of the underworld. A new race of humans was created, 
made from maize. This state of balance was not to last, 
however. Chak Ek’s fifth and final victim was a 
mysterious stranger from the west, and his death 
in the heart of the dry season shook the order established by Hun Ajaw. The gods, the lords, and the maize were 
buried in the underworld. But this victory for Chak Ek’ would also 
prove temporary. The two brothers, Venus and the Sun, 
were caught in an endless cycle as they battled for supremacy, re-enacting
the same five struggles, while the world alternated between order
and chaos with the rising of the Morning Star.

**Transcript**:
Chak Ek’ rose from the underworld 
to the surface of the eastern sea and on into the heavens. His brother K’in Ahaw followed. Though Chak Ek’ had risen first, 
K’in Ahaw outshone him, and the resentful Chak Ek’ descended back
to the underworld to plot against his brother. In Mayan mythology, Chak Ek’ represents 
Venus and K’in Ahaw represents the sun. Known as both the morning and the 
evening star, Venus moves through the sky, 
sometimes visible before sunrise, sometimes after sunset,
and occasionally not at all. The ancient Maya identified this roughly 
584 day cycle more than a thousand years ago and it still accurately predicts when and 
where Venus will appear in the sky around the world. Five of these cycles make up almost 
exactly eight years, and the Maya also recognized 
this larger cycle. They assigned Chak Ek’ five 
different forms, one for each cycle of Venus, 
that were repeated every eight years. Within the 584 day cycle, Venus is visible
in the evening sky for 250 days, then disappears for 8 days before 
reappearing as the Morning Star. The ancient Maya ascribed particular 
significance to this point in this cycle: the first time Venus appears before 
sunrise after being invisible. On this day, Chak Ek’ rose again from the 
underworld, wielding a spearthrower and darts. To bring discord to the world, he decided to attack his brother 
and his brother’s allies. His first target was K’awiil, god of 
sustenance and lightning. Rising in the late rainy season, Chak Ek’ 
aimed his spear and struck K’awiil, causing damage to the food and a 
period of chaos in the social order until K’awiil was reborn. 584 days after attacking K’awiil, Chak Ek’ turned his attention back to his 
brother, the Sun. Each night, the Sun took the form of 
jaguar and journeyed through the underworld. Chak Ek’ speared the jaguar sun as it rose
at dawn towards the end of the dry season. The Sun was wounded, plunging the 
world into a period of chaos and warfare. Chak Ek’s third victim 
was the god of maize, who provided sustenance for all humankind. Chak Ek’ speared him at the 
time of the harvest. He was buried in the underworld, 
and maize—the staple of life— was no longer available 
to Earth’s inhabitants. But the maize god emerged after three 
months in the place of new beginnings– the eastern cave known as Seven Water 
Place– bringing food once again to earth. When the turtle Ak Na'ak rose in the sky 
to mark the summer solstice, Chak Ek’ claimed his fourth victim. With the death of this good omen, 
the Sun, the food supply, and the people were buried within the earth, and the 
forces of chaos reigned. But out of the chaos rose a new order
established by Hun Ajaw, one of the hero twins known to all for having vanquished 
the lords of the underworld. A new race of humans was created, 
made from maize. This state of balance was not to last, 
however. Chak Ek’s fifth and final victim was a 
mysterious stranger from the west, and his death 
in the heart of the dry season shook the order established by Hun Ajaw. The gods, the lords, and the maize were 
buried in the underworld. But this victory for Chak Ek’ would also 
prove temporary. The two brothers, Venus and the Sun, 
were caught in an endless cycle as they battled for supremacy, re-enacting
the same five struggles, while the world alternated between order
and chaos with the rising of the Morning Star.
