**Transcript**:
So I'm here today to encourage
you to think about New York City, and not just as one
of humanity's greatest achievements, but as home to native wildlife that are subject to a grand
evolutionary experiment. So take this forested hillside
in Northern Manhattan, for example. This is one of the last areas
left in the city where there's clean spring water
seeping out of the ground. You could drink this
out of your hands and you'd be OK. These tiny little areas of seeping water contain huge populations
of northern dusky salamanders. These guys were common in the city
maybe 60 years ago, but now they're just stuck
on this single hillside and a few places in Staten Island. Not only do they suffer the indignity
of being stuck on this hillside, but we divided the hillside in two on two different occasions with bridges crossing
from the Bronx into Manhattan. But they're still there,
on either side of the bridges, where you see the red arrows --
about 180th Street, 167th Street. My lab has found that if you just take
a few segments of DNA from salamanders in those two locations, you can tell which side
of the bridge they came from. We built this single piece
of infrastructure that's changed their evolutionary history. We can go study these guys,
we just go to the hillside we know where they are,
we flip over rocks so we can catch them. There are a lot of other things
in New York City, though, that are not that easy to capture,
such as this guy, a coyote. We caught him on an automatic camera trap
in an undisclosed location; I'm not allowed to talk about it yet. But they're moving into New York City
for the first time. They're very flexible,
intelligent animals. This is one of this year's pups
checking out one of our cameras. And my colleagues and I
are very interested in understanding how they're going to spread
through the area, how they're going to survive here
and maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming
to a neighborhood near you, if they're not already there. Some things are too fast
to be caught by hand. We can't pick them up on the cameras, so we set up traps
around New York City and the parks. This is one of our most common activities. Here's some of my students
and collaborators getting the traps out and ready. This guy, we catch in almost
every forested area in New York City. This is the white-footed mouse -- not the mouse you find
running around your apartment. This is a native species,
been here long before humans. You find them in forests and meadows. Because they're so common
in forested areas in the city, we're using them as a model
to understand how species are adapting to urban environments. So if you think back 400 years ago, the five boroughs would've been covered
in forests and other types of vegetation. This mouse would've been everywhere
[in] huge populations that showed few genetic differences
across the landscape. But if you look at the situation today, they're just stuck in these little islands
of forest scattered around the city. Just using 18 short segments of DNA,
we can pretty much take a mouse somebody could give us a mouse,
not tell us where it was from, and we could determine
what park it came from. That's how different they've become. You'll notice in the middle
of this figure, there are some mixed-up colors. There are a few parks in the city
that are still connected to each other with strips of forest,
so the mice can run back and forth and spread their genes,
so they don't become different. But throughout the city, they're mostly
becoming different in the parks. So I'm telling you they're different,
but what does that mean? What's changing about their biology? To answer this question, we're sequencing thousands
of genes from our city mice and comparing those to thousands
of genes from the country mice, so, their ancestors
outside of New York City in these big, more wilderness areas. Now, genes are short segments of DNA
that code for amino acids. And amino acids are
the building blocks of proteins. If a single base pair changes in a gene, you can get a different amino acid, which will then change the shape
and structure of the protein. If you change the structure of a protein, you often change something
about what it does in the organism. Now if that change leads to a longer
life or more babies for a mouse, something evolutionary
biologists call fitness, then that single base-pair change
will spread quickly in an urban population. So this crazy figure
is called a Manhattan plot, because it kind of looks like a skyline. Each dot represents one gene, and the higher the dot is in the plot, the more different it is
between city and country mice. The ones kind of at the tips
of the skyscrapers are the most different, especially those above the red line. And these genes encode for things
like immune response to disease, because there might be more disease
in very dense, urban populations; metabolism, how the mice use energy; and heavy-metal tolerance. You guys can probably predict that New York City soils
are pretty contaminated with lead and chromium
and that sort of thing. And now our hard work is really starting. We're going back into the wilds
of New York City parks, following the lives of individual mice and seeing exactly
what these genes are doing for them. And I would encourage you guys
to try to look at your parks in a new way. I'm not going to be
the next Charles Darwin, but one of you guys might be,
so just keep your eyes open. Thank you. (Applause)

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about an animal moving into New York City for the first time. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 2 mentions the northern dusky salamanders being stuck on a single hillside, and Question 4 mentions the white-footed mouse being used as a model to understand how species are adapting to urban environments. However, neither of these questions directly addresses the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 2, as it discusses the impact of urbanization on a native species. However, please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be needed to truly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2 (weak match)

A better-generated MCQ would be:
Question: What animal is moving into New York City for the first time, according to the speaker?
Options: A. Red-tailed hawks, B. Coyotes, C. Snakehead fish, D. Black bears
Correct Option: B

This generated MCQ directly matches the ground truth MCQ.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although the wording is not identical, the intent and content of Question 4 are similar to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions focus on the significance of the white-footed mouse in understanding how species adapt to urban environments. The correct option for Question 4 (B. It is a native species that has been in the city for a long time) is not an exact match for the correct option of the ground truth MCQ (C. It illustrates how urbanization is affecting evolution), but it conveys a related idea.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

are very interested in understanding how they're going to spread
through the area, how they're going to survive here
and maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming
to a neighborhood near you, if they're not already there. Some things are too fast
to be caught by hand. We can't pick them up on the cameras, so we set up traps
around New York City and the parks. This is one of our most common activities. Here's some of my students
and collaborators getting the traps out and ready. This guy, we catch in almost
every forested area in New York City. This is the white-footed mouse -- not the mouse you find
running around your apartment. This is a native species,
been here long before humans. You find them in forests and meadows. Because they're so common
in forested areas in the city, we're using them as a model
to understand how species are adapting to urban environments. So if you think back 400 years ago, the five boroughs would've been covered
in forests and other types of vegetation. This mouse would've been everywhere
[in] huge populations that showed few genetic differences
across the landscape. But if you look at the situation today, they're just stuck in these little islands
of forest scattered around the city. Just using 18 short segments of DNA,
we can pretty much take a mouse somebody could give us a mouse,
not tell us where it was from, and we could determine
what park it came from. That's how different they've become. You'll notice in the middle
of this figure, there are some mixed-up colors. There are a few parks in the city
that are still connected to each other with strips of forest,
so the mice can run back and forth and spread their genes,
so they don't become different. But throughout the city, they're mostly
becoming different in the parks. So I'm telling you they're different,
but what does that mean? What's changing about their biology? To answer this question, we're sequencing thousands
of genes from our city mice and comparing those to thousands
of genes from the country mice, so, their ancestors
outside of New York City in these big, more wilderness areas. Now, genes are short segments of DNA
that code for amino acids. And amino acids are
the building blocks of proteins. If a single base pair changes in a gene, you can get a different amino acid, which will then change the shape
and structure of the protein. If you change the structure of a protein, you often change something
about what it does in the organism. Now if that change leads to a longer
life or more babies for a mouse, something evolutionary
biologists call fitness, then that single base-pair change
will spread quickly in an urban population. So this crazy figure
is called a Manhattan plot, because it kind of looks like a skyline. Each dot represents one gene, and the higher the dot is in the plot, the more different it is
between city and country mice. The ones kind of at the tips
of the skyscrapers are the most different, especially those above the red line. And these genes encode for things
like immune response to disease, because there might be more disease
in very dense, urban populations; metabolism, how the mice use energy; and heavy-metal tolerance. You guys can probably predict that New York City soils
are pretty contaminated with lead and chromium
and that sort of thing. And now our hard work is really starting. We're going back into the wilds
of New York City parks, following the lives of individual mice and seeing exactly
what these genes are doing for them. And I would encourage you guys
to try to look at your parks in a new way. I'm not going to be
the next Charles Darwin, but one of you guys might be,
so just keep your eyes open. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So I'm here today to encourage
you to think about New York City, and not just as one
of humanity's greatest achievements, but as home to native wildlife that are subject to a grand
evolutionary experiment. So take this forested hillside
in Northern Manhattan, for example. This is one of the last areas
left in the city where there's clean spring water
seeping out of the ground. You could drink this
out of your hands and you'd be OK. These tiny little areas of seeping water contain huge populations
of northern dusky salamanders. These guys were common in the city
maybe 60 years ago, but now they're just stuck
on this single hillside and a few places in Staten Island. Not only do they suffer the indignity
of being stuck on this hillside, but we divided the hillside in two on two different occasions with bridges crossing
from the Bronx into Manhattan. But they're still there,
on either side of the bridges, where you see the red arrows --
about 180th Street, 167th Street. My lab has found that if you just take
a few segments of DNA from salamanders in those two locations, you can tell which side
of the bridge they came from. We built this single piece
of infrastructure that's changed their evolutionary history. We can go study these guys,
we just go to the hillside we know where they are,
we flip over rocks so we can catch them. There are a lot of other things
in New York City, though, that are not that easy to capture,
such as this guy, a coyote. We caught him on an automatic camera trap
in an undisclosed location; I'm not allowed to talk about it yet. But they're moving into New York City
for the first time. They're very flexible,
intelligent animals. This is one of this year's pups
checking out one of our cameras. And my colleagues and I
are very interested in understanding how they're going to spread
through the area, how they're going to survive here
and maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming

(Music) Everything is everywhere these days. Check out the supermarket -- orange
juice from China, nuts from India, swordfish from Japan,
lagers from Czechoslovakia, scores of European cheeses. You name it, it's there.
Not when I was growing up. You'd never taste a range
of French cheeses or Bohemian lager beer. At least, you couldn't
unless you were very rich and could go anywhere when the fancy
took you. All that has changed. But it's not just foods. Got an iPhone? Everyone knows it was invented
and designed at Cupertino in California, but who knows where the complex bits and pieces of its
innards are made or assembled? Apple doesn't say. The industry credits China,
Japan, Germany, South Korea and, of course, the United States itself. Just think for a moment
of the trillions of parts and finished goods moving
cheaply around the world every second, a small portion by air, but most by sea. We call it globalization, but the man who basically made
globalization a reality in our lives is too little known. This is his story. The story of the man who makes your day. In the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of Americans were
out of work, worse than now, Malcolm McLean was a 24-year-old
truck driver. He got a job to take cotton bales from Fayetteville in North
Carolina all the way to a pier in Hoboken, New
Jersey for shipping overseas. He was glad of the work,
but when he arrived he got bored out of his mind,
sitting in his truck waiting and waiting
and waiting on the docks as the worker ants muscled crates
and bundles off other trucks and into slings that lifted the goods
into the hold of the ship. On board the ship itself, with much yelling and arm waving, the stevedores then unloaded each sling and saw its contents placed
in a designated position in the hold. Malcolm wasn't just bored, he was fuming. His income depended on getting
back to North Carolina to pick up more loads in his truck. Out of the frustration,
inspiration struck. Wouldn't it be great, he thought, if my trailer could be lifted and placed on the ship without its cotton bales being touched.
Yes, it would be great. It would be revolutionary. For centuries, general non-bulk cargo had been shipped
in the process he watched. It was called break bulk shipping. Boxes, bales, crates
handled piece by piece. What Malcolm envisaged
would have saved him only a day, but it would have saved everyone else something like two weeks
in loading and unloading the ship. On average, it was eight days to haul and distribute break
bulk shipments in the hold, plus another eight days at the other end to retrieve and distribute. All that time would have been saved if Malcolm McLean could have just
driven his truck onto the ship and at the other end, driven it off. Well, today that concept is a reality. The concept that occurred to Malcolm is known as containerization. It has done more than just
save a great deal of time. It's the reason why we have
a thriving global marketplace, offering us that infinite
variety of things, and it's the reason we can move cargo from remote parts
of the world at minimal cost. Malcolm had his idea in 1937. The 24-year-old truck driver
sitting in his truck in Hoboken was 40 before he did anything about it. By then, he'd built his one truck into a big trucking company.
He borrowed money from an enterprising vice president
at Citibank in New York, and set about designing the steel
boxes and the decks of the ships to carry them stacked
one on top of another. A lot of people thought he was crazy. Inventors always attract
armies of naysayers who can never remember
how critical they were. For our part, we should
remember Malcolm McLean. His first container ship, the Ideal X, sailed from Shed 154 at Marsh Street, Port Newark with 58 well-filled boxes. It was the beginning of the container era, shrinking our world and enlarging human choice.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what McLean wanted to ship overseas, and the correct answer is "Cotton Bales." While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 3 mentions the process of shipping goods before containerization was introduced, which is related to McLean's experience with shipping cotton bales.

However, a more relevant question is not present among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar, as it talks about the capacity of the Ideal X, which is related to McLean's idea of shipping goods. But it's not the same as the ground truth MCQ.

If I really had to choose one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. But if you insist on an index, I would say that Question 5 is the closest, with index 5.

**Transcript**:
(Music) Everything is everywhere these days. Check out the supermarket -- orange
juice from China, nuts from India, swordfish from Japan,
lagers from Czechoslovakia, scores of European cheeses. You name it, it's there.
Not when I was growing up. You'd never taste a range
of French cheeses or Bohemian lager beer. At least, you couldn't
unless you were very rich and could go anywhere when the fancy
took you. All that has changed. But it's not just foods. Got an iPhone? Everyone knows it was invented
and designed at Cupertino in California, but who knows where the complex bits and pieces of its
innards are made or assembled? Apple doesn't say. The industry credits China,
Japan, Germany, South Korea and, of course, the United States itself. Just think for a moment
of the trillions of parts and finished goods moving
cheaply around the world every second, a small portion by air, but most by sea. We call it globalization, but the man who basically made
globalization a reality in our lives is too little known. This is his story. The story of the man who makes your day. In the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of Americans were
out of work, worse than now, Malcolm McLean was a 24-year-old
truck driver. He got a job to take cotton bales from Fayetteville in North
Carolina all the way to a pier in Hoboken, New
Jersey for shipping overseas. He was glad of the work,
but when he arrived he got bored out of his mind,
sitting in his truck waiting and waiting
and waiting on the docks as the worker ants muscled crates
and bundles off other trucks and into slings that lifted the goods
into the hold of the ship. On board the ship itself, with much yelling and arm waving, the stevedores then unloaded each sling and saw its contents placed
in a designated position in the hold. Malcolm wasn't just bored, he was fuming. His income depended on getting
back to North Carolina to pick up more loads in his truck. Out of the frustration,
inspiration struck. Wouldn't it be great, he thought, if my trailer could be lifted and placed on the ship without its cotton bales being touched.
Yes, it would be great. It would be revolutionary. For centuries, general non-bulk cargo had been shipped
in the process he watched. It was called break bulk shipping. Boxes, bales, crates
handled piece by piece. What Malcolm envisaged
would have saved him only a day, but it would have saved everyone else something like two weeks
in loading and unloading the ship. On average, it was eight days to haul and distribute break
bulk shipments in the hold, plus another eight days at the other end to retrieve and distribute. All that time would have been saved if Malcolm McLean could have just
driven his truck onto the ship and at the other end, driven it off. Well, today that concept is a reality. The concept that occurred to Malcolm is known as containerization. It has done more than just
save a great deal of time. It's the reason why we have
a thriving global marketplace, offering us that infinite
variety of things, and it's the reason we can move cargo from remote parts
of the world at minimal cost. Malcolm had his idea in 1937. The 24-year-old truck driver
sitting in his truck in Hoboken was 40 before he did anything about it. By then, he'd built his one truck into a big trucking company.
He borrowed money from an enterprising vice president
at Citibank in New York, and set about designing the steel
boxes and the decks of the ships to carry them stacked
one on top of another. A lot of people thought he was crazy. Inventors always attract
armies of naysayers who can never remember
how critical they were. For our part, we should
remember Malcolm McLean. His first container ship, the Ideal X, sailed from Shed 154 at Marsh Street, Port Newark with 58 well-filled boxes. It was the beginning of the container era, shrinking our world and enlarging human choice.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: What was the purpose of containerization? 

Although the question phrasing is not identical, the intent and content of Question 7 align with the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the definition of containerization. The correct answer for Question 7, "To decrease the time it takes to load and unload ships," is a key aspect of containerization, as described in the transcript. This matches the essence of the correct option in the ground truth MCQ, "A process for loading and transporting things more efficiently in bulk."

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the question intent, which is to ask about a specific event or milestone in Malcolm McLean's life, I would say that Question 2: "In what year did Malcolm McLean have the idea for containerization?" is the most similar.

Although it does not ask about McLean's age, it does ask about the timing of an event in his life, which is similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ closely, I will not provide an index.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that the generated MCQs do not provide a direct match, but if I had to choose one, I would choose Question 2 as the most similar, so the index would be 2.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the speaker's use of language, specifically the appropriation of the language of an actual robbery. The closest generated MCQ that relates to this is Question 6: "What does the speaker compare the financial aid system to?" 

However, this question does not specifically address the language used by the speaker. A more suitable question would be one that asks about the speaker's tone, language, or approach in the given situation.

If I had to choose from the given options, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match, but it's still not a good match.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the speaker's use of simile, while the generated MCQs are asking about various other aspects of the speaker's message and tone.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match. This question asks about what the speaker says about their ancestors, and one of the options (B) mentions the speaker's ancestors fighting for the right to sit in a classroom, which is a phrase that is part of the ground truth MCQ.

But please note that this is a very loose match, and the generated MCQs do not accurately capture the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about historical references in Lissaint's performance, and the correct option is "The U.S. Constitution" (although it's not explicitly mentioned in the transcript, it's likely referring to the Thirteenth Amendment mentioned in the transcript).

Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 mentions Professor Willie Lynch, who is a historical figure mentioned in the transcript. While this question doesn't directly ask about historical references, it's the closest one that touches on a historical aspect.

Therefore, I would suggest that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4**: What does the speaker say about Professor Willie Lynch?

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and the generated MCQs do not directly address the historical references in Lissaint's performance.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 6: What does the speaker compare the financial aid system to? Options: A. A game, B. A way to get rich quick, C. A way to oppress people, D. A way to help people**

Although the question and options are not identical to the ground truth MCQ, the intent and content are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the term "financial aid" being ironic, implying that the speaker believes the system is not truly aiding them. Similarly, Question 6 asks about the speaker's comparison of the financial aid system, with options that include "a way to oppress people" (C), which aligns with the speaker's sentiment in the transcript.

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the term "financial aid" being euphemistic, ironic, sarcastic, or oxymoronic, I will provide an alternative answer.

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ's intent would be a question that asks about the speaker's tone or sentiment towards the financial aid system. In this case, I would recommend:

**Question 3: What is the speaker's attitude towards the financial aid system? Options: A. They are satisfied with it, B. They think it's fair, C. They believe it's unfair and oppressive, D. They don't care about it**

This question captures the speaker's sentiment towards the financial aid system, which is similar to the ground truth MCQ's focus on the term "financial aid" being ironic.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: **3** (or **6** as an alternative)

We all know the scene: Dorothy closes her eyes, and repeats the Good Witch's mantra, "No coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile." Only Dorothy doesn't say that. She says five one-syllable words, "There's no place like home." Each a word you probably learned in your first year of speaking, each perfectly concise. It's not that L. Frank Baum didn't have a thesaurus, it's that in most cases $10 words fail. Would Aerosmith have had a hit with "Ambulate This Direction?" Probably not. Would Patrick Henry have ignited a revolution by saying, "Provide me with liberty or bestow upon me fatality?" Unlikely. When it comes to words, bigger isn't always better. Ten-dollar words are rendered worthless if they're not understood. That's not to say every piece of literature should be written at a fourth-grade reading level, but it is important to know your audience. If you're a novelist, your audience is probably expecting 300 pages of vivid descriptors. At the very least, they're expecting you won't use the same 50 words to fill those pages. But most of us don't have the luxury of a captive audience. We're competing against a whole world of distractions and we're fighting for space in an attention span that continues to shrink across generations. So get to the point already. Variety may be the spice of life, but brevity is its bread and butter. So when it comes to $10 words, save your money and buy a Scrabble board.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 5: According to the passage, what is the effect of using expensive words that are not understood by the audience? Options: A. It makes the writer sound more intelligent., B. It makes the writing more engaging., C. It renders the words worthless., D. It has no impact on the audience.**

Although the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question intent and content are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks why $10 words are a bad idea, and one of the correct options is that they may not be understood by the audience. Question 5 asks about the effect of using expensive words that are not understood by the audience, which is a similar concept.

However, since the options do not exactly match, I also considered other generated MCQs. Question 9 is also similar, as it asks what the author suggests writers do with expensive words, and one of the options is to save their money and use simpler words instead. This is related to the ground truth MCQ, which states that $10 words are a bad idea because they may not be understood by the audience and are poor competitors against other media distractions.

But the most similar generated MCQ that captures the essence of both correct options (E) "Both A and B" of the ground truth MCQ is not present. 

However, if I had to choose one, I would choose **Question 5** as the most similar generated MCQ, with the understanding that it only partially captures the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: **5**

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, based on the context of the passage and the ground truth MCQ, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the list.

However, if I had to choose one from the list, I would say that Question 9 is the closest match. It talks about what the author is suggesting that writers do with expensive words, which is related to the idea presented in the passage using the Wizard of Oz quotation "There's no place like home" to drive the point home about the importance of simplicity in writing.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about a specific person mentioned in the passage, which is Patrick Henry. The generated MCQs do not have a direct question about Patrick Henry, but Question 6 mentions considering the audience's expectations of the writing style, and the passage does mention Patrick Henry in the context of audience expectations.

However, a more relevant question is Question 3's option "Use them to fill space in their writing," which contains a quote from Patrick Henry in the passage.

But the most relevant is Question 9's option "Save their money and use simpler words instead," which also contains the same quote from the passage that mentions Patrick Henry but is still not as similar as desired.

Given the options, the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ is not available, but if I had to choose, I would say Question 9 is the closest since it contains the context in which Patrick Henry was mentioned, but it still does not directly address the question of identifying the Founding Father mentioned in the passage.

However, since the instructions require providing the index of the most similar generated MCQ, I will provide it:

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

This question is asking about the comparison the author makes regarding the importance of brevity in writing, which is directly related to the ground truth MCQ. The options in Question 8 also closely match the intent of the ground truth MCQ, with option A mentioning "Variety in life", which is part of the quote mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that the options in Question 8 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a question with options that include "bread and butter" as the correct answer.

Since there isn't a more accurate match, I would recommend Question 8 as the closest match, but with the caveat that the options could be improved to more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Are you familiar with the word symbiosis? It's a fancy term for a partnership
between two different species, such as bees and flowers. In a symbiosis, both species
depend on each other. I want to tell you
about a remarkable symbiosis between a little bird,
the Clark's nutcracker, and a big tree, the whitebark pine. Whitebark grow in the mountains
of Wyoming, Montana and other western states. They have huge canopies
and lots of needles, which provide cover and shelter
for other plants and animals, and whitebark feed the forest. Their cones are packed with protein. Squirrels gnaw the cones
from the upper branches so they fall to the ground, and then race down to bury them
in piles, or middens. But they don't get to keep all of them; grizzlies and black bears
love finding middens. But there's more to a symbiosis
than one species feeding another. In the case of the Clark's nutcracker,
this bird gives back. While gathering its seeds,
it also replants the trees. Here's how it works:
using her powerful beak, the nutcracker picks apart
a cone in a treetop, pulling out the seeds. She can store up to 80 of them
in a pouch in her throat. Then she flies through the forest looking for a place to cache the seeds an inch under the soil
in piles of up to eight seeds. Nutcrackers can gather
up to 90,000 seeds in the autumn, which they return for
in the winter and spring. And these birds are smart. They remember where all those seeds are. They even use landmarks
on the landscape -- trees, stumps, rocks -- to triangulate to caches
buried deep under the snow. What they don't go back and get,
those seeds become whitebark. This symbiosis is
so important to both species that they've changed,
or evolved, to suit each other. Nutcrackers have developed
long, tough beaks for extracting seeds from cones, and whitebarks' branches all sweep upwards with the cones at the very ends, so they can offer them
to the nutcrackers as they fly by. That's a symbiosis: Two species cooperating to help
each other for the benefit of all.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 8: What is an example of how Clark's nutcrackers have evolved to suit their symbiosis with whitebark pine? Options: A. They have developed long, tough beaks for extracting seeds from cones., B. They have developed the ability to fly faster., C. They have developed the ability to climb trees., D. They have developed the ability to swim.

However, this question does not directly address the benefit of the symbiosis to the Whitebark Pine. A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that mentions the nutcracker's role in seed dispersal or planting, which is not present in the provided generated MCQs.

If I had to choose from the given options, I would say that Question 6 is the closest in terms of describing a process that is related to the benefit of the symbiosis (the nutcracker's ability to store seeds), but it does not directly address the benefit to the Whitebark Pine.

Therefore, I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that directly addresses the benefit of the symbiosis to the Whitebark Pine, such as: What is a key way in which Clark's nutcrackers help Whitebark Pines? Options: A. By planting their seeds, B. By eating insects that harm the trees, C. By providing shade for the trees, D. By competing with other birds for resources.

However, if I had to choose from the provided generated MCQs, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 6 or 8, with the caveat that neither of these questions directly addresses the benefit of the symbiosis to the Whitebark Pine.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, some generated MCQs share similarities with the ground truth MCQ in certain aspects.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the location where Whitebark Pine trees can be found. While none of the generated MCQs ask the exact same question, Question 3 mentions the whitebark pine cones providing food and shelter for other animals in the mountains, but it does not directly ask about the location of the trees.

However, the transcript does provide information about the location of Whitebark Pine trees. According to the transcript, Whitebark Pine trees grow in the mountains of Wyoming, Montana, and other western states.

Considering the question intent, options, and content, the closest match would be a question that asks about the whitebark pine or its relationship with its environment. Among the given options, Question 3 is the closest in terms of topic relevance.

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, it would be more accurate to say that there is no matching MCQ. If I had to choose the closest match based on topic relevance, I would choose Question 3, but with the understanding that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

(Music) Sometimes when I'm on a long plane flight, I gaze out at all those mountains and deserts and try to get my head around how vast our Earth is. And then I remember that there's an object we see every day that would literally fit one million Earths inside it. The sun seems impossibly big, but in the great scheme of things, it's a pinprick, one of about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which you can see on a clear night as a pale, white mist 
stretched across the sky. And it gets worse. There are maybe 100 billion galaxies detectable by our telescopes, so if each star was the size of a single grain of sand, just the Milky Way has enough stars to fill a 30 foot by 30 foot stretch of beach three feet deep with sand. And the entire Earth doesn't have enough beaches to represent the stars in the overall universe. Such a beach would continue for literally hundreds of millions of miles. Holy Stephen Hawking, that is a lot of stars. But he and other physicists now believe in a reality that is unimaginably bigger still. I mean, first of all, the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescopes are probably a minuscule fraction of the total. Space itself is expanding at an accelerating pace. The vast majority of the galaxies are separating from us so fast that light from them may never reach us. Still, our physical reality here on Earth is intimately connected to those distant, invisible galaxies. We can think of them as part of our universe. They make up a single, giant edifice, obeying the same physical laws and all made from the same types of atoms, electrons, protons, quarks, neutrinos that make up you and me. However, recent theories in physics, including one called string theory, are now telling us there could be countless other universes, built on different types of particles, with different properties, obeying different laws. Most of these universes could never support life, and might flash in and out of existence in a nanosecond, but nonetheless, combined they make up a vast multiverse of possible universes. in up to 11 dimensions, featuring wonders beyond our wildest imagination. And the leading version of string theory predicts a multiverse made of up to 10 to the 500 universes. That's a one followed by 500 zeroes, a number so vast that if every atom in our observable universe had its own universe and all of the atoms in all of those universes each had their own universe, and you repeated that for two more cycles, you'd still be at a tiny fraction of the total -- namely, one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillionth. But even that number is minuscule compared to another number: infinity. Some physicists think the space-time continuum is literally infinite, and that it contains an infinite number of so-called pocket universes with varying properties. How's your brain doing? But quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle. I mean, the theory's been proven true beyond all doubt, but interpreting it is baffling. And some physicists think you can only un-baffle it if you imagine that huge numbers of parallel universes are being spawned every moment, and many of these universes would actually be very like the world we're in, would include multiple copies of you. In one such universe, you'd graduate with honors and marry the person of your dreams. In another, not so much. There are still some scientists who would say, hogwash. The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universes there are is one, only one universe. And a few philosophers and mystics might argue that even our own universe is an illusion. So, as you can see, right now there is no agreement on this question, not even close. All we know is, the answer is somewhere between zero and infinity. Well, I guess we know one other thing: This is a pretty cool time to be studying physics. We just might be undergoing the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge that humanity has ever seen.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs are more focused on the topics of stars, galaxies, universes, dimensions, and theories in physics, whereas the ground truth MCQ is focused on the size of the sun relative to the Earth.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of scale and size, I would suggest Question 5, which deals with the estimated number of universes predicted by the leading version of string theory. However, this is still a very different question from the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 1: What is the approximate number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is related to the same topic (the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy). However, since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that would be a potential match if the options were rewritten to match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would choose **1**. However, please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQ would need to be rewritten to match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be:
Question: If a star was the size of a single grain of sand, the number of stars in the Milky Way would ____.
Options: A. Fill a small bucket, B. Create a beach about 10 ft by 10 ft in size, C. Create a beach about 30 ft by 30 ft in size, D. Be more than all the sand on all the beaches on Earth

This question is not present in the generated MCQs, but it would be a better match for the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although Question 5 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, it does relate to the same topic of estimating the number of universes predicted by string theory. The correct option in Question 5 (10^500) is mentioned in the transcript as the estimated number of universes predicted by the leading version of string theory, which is also referenced in the ground truth MCQ. 

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ presents a hypothetical scenario and asks for a comparison with the prediction of string theory, whereas Question 5 is a more straightforward question about the estimated number of universes predicted by string theory. 

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the provided options, I would choose Question 5, but I would recommend generating new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

That's a one followed by 500 zeroes, a number so vast that if every atom in our observable universe had its own universe and all of the atoms in all of those universes each had their own universe, and you repeated that for two more cycles, you'd still be at a tiny fraction of the total -- namely, one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillionth. But even that number is minuscule compared to another number: infinity. Some physicists think the space-time continuum is literally infinite, and that it contains an infinite number of so-called pocket universes with varying properties. How's your brain doing? But quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle. I mean, the theory's been proven true beyond all doubt, but interpreting it is baffling. And some physicists think you can only un-baffle it if you imagine that huge numbers of parallel universes are being spawned every moment, and many of these universes would actually be very like the world we're in, would include multiple copies of you. In one such universe, you'd graduate with honors and marry the person of your dreams. In another, not so much. There are still some scientists who would say, hogwash. The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universes there are is one, only one universe. And a few philosophers and mystics might argue that even our own universe is an illusion. So, as you can see, right now there is no agreement on this question, not even close. All we know is, the answer is somewhere between zero and infinity. Well, I guess we know one other thing: This is a pretty cool time to be studying physics. We just might be undergoing the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge that humanity has ever seen.

Translator: Jenny Zurawell One of the funny things
about owning a brain is that you have
no control over the things that it gathers and holds onto,
the facts and the stories. And as you get older, it only gets worse. Things stick around for years sometimes before you understand
why you're interested in them, before you understand their import to you. Here's three of mine. When Richard Feynman
was a young boy in Queens, he went for a walk with his dad
and his wagon and a ball. He noticed that when he pulled the wagon,
the ball went to the back of the wagon. He asked his dad, "Why does
the ball go to the back of the wagon?" And his dad said, "That's inertia." He said, "What's inertia?"
And his dad said, "Ah. Inertia is the name that scientists give to the phenomenon of the ball
going to the back of the wagon." (Laughter) "But in truth, nobody really knows." Feynman went on to earn degrees at MIT, Princeton, he solved
the Challenger disaster, he ended up winning
the Nobel Prize in Physics for his Feynman diagrams, describing
the movement of subatomic particles. And he credits that conversation
with his father as giving him a sense that the simplest questions could carry
you out to the edge of human knowledge, and that that's where he wanted to play. And play he did. Eratosthenes was the third librarian
at the great Library of Alexandria, and he made many contributions to science. But the one he is most remembered for began in a letter that he received
as the librarian, from the town of Swenet,
which was south of Alexandria. The letter included this fact
that stuck in Eratosthenes' mind, and the fact was that the writer said, at noon on the solstice,
when he looked down this deep well, he could see his reflection at the bottom, and he could also see
that his head was blocking the sun. I should tell you -- the idea
that Christopher Columbus discovered that the world
is spherical is total bull. It's not true at all. In fact, everyone who was educated
understood that the world was spherical since Aristotle's time. Aristotle had proved it
with a simple observation. He noticed that every time you saw
the Earth's shadow on the Moon, it was circular, and the only shape that constantly
creates a circular shadow is a sphere, Q.E.D. the Earth is round. But nobody knew how big it was until Eratosthenes got
this letter with this fact. So he understood that the sun
was directly above the city of Swenet, because looking down a well,
it was a straight line all the way down the well,
right past the guy's head up to the sun. Eratosthenes knew another fact. He knew that a stick stuck
in the ground in Alexandria at the same time
and the same day, at noon, the sun's zenith, on the solstice, the sun cast a shadow that showed
that it was 7.2 degrees off-axis. If you know the circumference of a circle,
and you have two points on it, all you need to know is the distance
between those two points, and you can extrapolate the circumference. 360 degrees divided by 7.2 equals 50. I know it's a little bit
of a round number, and it makes me suspicious
of this story too, but it's a good story,
so we'll continue with it. He needed to know the distance
between Swenet and Alexandria, which is good because Eratosthenes
was good at geography. In fact, he invented the word geography. (Laughter) The road between Swenet and Alexandria
was a road of commerce, and commerce needed to know
how long it took to get there. It needed to know the exact distance,
so he knew very precisely that the distance between
the two cities was 500 miles. Multiply that times 50, you get 25,000, which is within one percent
of the actual diameter of the Earth. He did this 2,200 years ago. Now, we live in an age where multi-billion-dollar pieces of machinery
are looking for the Higgs boson. We're discovering particles that may travel faster
than the speed of light, and all of these discoveries
are made possible by technology that's been developed
in the last few decades. But for most of human history, we had to discover these things using
our eyes and our ears and our minds. Armand Fizeau was
an experimental physicist in Paris. His specialty was actually refining
and confirming other people's results, and this might sound
like a bit of an also-ran, but in fact, this is the soul of science, because there is no such thing as a fact
that cannot be independently corroborated. And he was familiar
with Galileo's experiments in trying to determine
whether or not light had a speed. Galileo had worked out this
really wonderful experiment where he and his assistant had a lamp,
each one of them was holding a lamp. Galileo would open his lamp,
and his assistant would open his. They got the timing down really good. They just knew their timing. And then they stood at two hilltops, two miles distant,
and they did the same thing, on the assumption from Galileo
that if light had a discernible speed, he'd notice a delay in the light
coming back from his assistant's lamp. But light was too fast for Galileo. He was off by several orders
of magnitude when he assumed that light was roughly ten times
as fast as the speed of sound. Fizeau was aware of this experiment. He lived in Paris, and he set up
two experimental stations, roughly 5.5 miles distant, in Paris. And he solved this problem of Galileo's, and he did it with a really relatively
trivial piece of equipment. He did it with one of these. I'm going to put away
the clicker for a second because I want to engage
your brains in this. So this is a toothed wheel. It's got a bunch of notches
and it's got a bunch of teeth. This was Fizeau's solution
to sending discrete pulses of light. He put a beam behind one of these notches. If I point a beam
through this notch at a mirror, five miles away, that beam
is bouncing off the mirror and coming back to me through this notch. But something interesting happens
as he spins the wheel faster. He notices that it seems
like a door is starting to close on the light beam
that's coming back to his eye. Why is that? It's because the pulse
of light is not coming back through the same notch. It's actually hitting a tooth. And he spins the wheel fast enough
and he fully occludes the light. And then, based on the distance
between the two stations and the speed of his wheel
and the number of notches in the wheel, he calculates the speed of light
to within two percent of its actual value. And he does this in 1849. This is what really gets me
going about science. Whenever I'm having trouble
understanding a concept, I go back and I research
the people that discovered that concept. I look at the story of how
they came to understand it. What happens when you look at what the discoverers
were thinking about when they made their discoveries, is you understand that
they are not so different from us. We are all bags of meat and water.
We all start with the same tools. I love the idea that different branches
of science are called fields of study. Most people think of science
as a closed, black box, when in fact it is an open field. And we are all explorers. The people that made these discoveries
just thought a little bit harder about what they were looking at,
and they were a little bit more curious. And their curiosity changed the way
people thought about the world, and thus it changed the world. They changed the world, and so can you. Thank you. (Applause)

and the same day, at noon, the sun's zenith, on the solstice, the sun cast a shadow that showed
that it was 7.2 degrees off-axis. If you know the circumference of a circle,
and you have two points on it, all you need to know is the distance
between those two points, and you can extrapolate the circumference. 360 degrees divided by 7.2 equals 50. I know it's a little bit
of a round number, and it makes me suspicious
of this story too, but it's a good story,
so we'll continue with it. He needed to know the distance
between Swenet and Alexandria, which is good because Eratosthenes
was good at geography. In fact, he invented the word geography. (Laughter) The road between Swenet and Alexandria
was a road of commerce, and commerce needed to know
how long it took to get there. It needed to know the exact distance,
so he knew very precisely that the distance between
the two cities was 500 miles. Multiply that times 50, you get 25,000, which is within one percent
of the actual diameter of the Earth. He did this 2,200 years ago. Now, we live in an age where multi-billion-dollar pieces of machinery
are looking for the Higgs boson. We're discovering particles that may travel faster
than the speed of light, and all of these discoveries
are made possible by technology that's been developed
in the last few decades. But for most of human history, we had to discover these things using
our eyes and our ears and our minds. Armand Fizeau was
an experimental physicist in Paris. His specialty was actually refining
and confirming other people's results, and this might sound
like a bit of an also-ran, but in fact, this is the soul of science, because there is no such thing as a fact
that cannot be independently corroborated. And he was familiar
with Galileo's experiments in trying to determine
whether or not light had a speed. Galileo had worked out this
really wonderful experiment where he and his assistant had a lamp,
each one of them was holding a lamp. Galileo would open his lamp,
and his assistant would open his. They got the timing down really good. They just knew their timing. And then they stood at two hilltops, two miles distant,
and they did the same thing, on the assumption from Galileo
that if light had a discernible speed, he'd notice a delay in the light
coming back from his assistant's lamp. But light was too fast for Galileo. He was off by several orders
of magnitude when he assumed that light was roughly ten times
as fast as the speed of sound. Fizeau was aware of this experiment. He lived in Paris, and he set up
two experimental stations, roughly 5.5 miles distant, in Paris. And he solved this problem of Galileo's, and he did it with a really relatively
trivial piece of equipment. He did it with one of these. I'm going to put away
the clicker for a second because I want to engage
your brains in this. So this is a toothed wheel. It's got a bunch of notches
and it's got a bunch of teeth. This was Fizeau's solution
to sending discrete pulses of light. He put a beam behind one of these notches. If I point a beam
through this notch at a mirror, five miles away, that beam
is bouncing off the mirror and coming back to me through this notch. But something interesting happens
as he spins the wheel faster. He notices that it seems
like a door is starting to close on the light beam
that's coming back to his eye. Why is that? It's because the pulse
of light is not coming back through the same notch. It's actually hitting a tooth. And he spins the wheel fast enough
and he fully occludes the light. And then, based on the distance
between the two stations and the speed of his wheel
and the number of notches in the wheel, he calculates the speed of light
to within two percent of its actual value. And he does this in 1849. This is what really gets me
going about science. Whenever I'm having trouble
understanding a concept, I go back and I research
the people that discovered that concept. I look at the story of how
they came to understand it. What happens when you look at what the discoverers
were thinking about when they made their discoveries, is you understand that
they are not so different from us. We are all bags of meat and water.
We all start with the same tools. I love the idea that different branches
of science are called fields of study. Most people think of science
as a closed, black box, when in fact it is an open field. And we are all explorers. The people that made these discoveries
just thought a little bit harder about what they were looking at,
and they were a little bit more curious. And their curiosity changed the way
people thought about the world, and thus it changed the world. They changed the world, and so can you. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Translator: Jenny Zurawell One of the funny things
about owning a brain is that you have
no control over the things that it gathers and holds onto,
the facts and the stories. And as you get older, it only gets worse. Things stick around for years sometimes before you understand
why you're interested in them, before you understand their import to you. Here's three of mine. When Richard Feynman
was a young boy in Queens, he went for a walk with his dad
and his wagon and a ball. He noticed that when he pulled the wagon,
the ball went to the back of the wagon. He asked his dad, "Why does
the ball go to the back of the wagon?" And his dad said, "That's inertia." He said, "What's inertia?"
And his dad said, "Ah. Inertia is the name that scientists give to the phenomenon of the ball
going to the back of the wagon." (Laughter) "But in truth, nobody really knows." Feynman went on to earn degrees at MIT, Princeton, he solved
the Challenger disaster, he ended up winning
the Nobel Prize in Physics for his Feynman diagrams, describing
the movement of subatomic particles. And he credits that conversation
with his father as giving him a sense that the simplest questions could carry
you out to the edge of human knowledge, and that that's where he wanted to play. And play he did. Eratosthenes was the third librarian
at the great Library of Alexandria, and he made many contributions to science. But the one he is most remembered for began in a letter that he received
as the librarian, from the town of Swenet,
which was south of Alexandria. The letter included this fact
that stuck in Eratosthenes' mind, and the fact was that the writer said, at noon on the solstice,
when he looked down this deep well, he could see his reflection at the bottom, and he could also see
that his head was blocking the sun. I should tell you -- the idea
that Christopher Columbus discovered that the world
is spherical is total bull. It's not true at all. In fact, everyone who was educated
understood that the world was spherical since Aristotle's time. Aristotle had proved it
with a simple observation. He noticed that every time you saw
the Earth's shadow on the Moon, it was circular, and the only shape that constantly
creates a circular shadow is a sphere, Q.E.D. the Earth is round. But nobody knew how big it was until Eratosthenes got
this letter with this fact. So he understood that the sun
was directly above the city of Swenet, because looking down a well,
it was a straight line all the way down the well,
right past the guy's head up to the sun. Eratosthenes knew another fact. He knew that a stick stuck
in the ground in Alexandria at the same time
and the same day, at noon, the sun's zenith, on the solstice, the sun cast a shadow that showed
that it was 7.2 degrees off-axis. If you know the circumference of a circle,
and you have two points on it, all you need to know is the distance
between those two points, and you can extrapolate the circumference. 360 degrees divided by 7.2 equals 50. I know it's a little bit

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What was the name of the experimental physicist who refined and confirmed other people's results? 

However, the options provided in Question 4 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a question that asks about Armand Fizeau's contribution to science, specifically his improvement upon Galileo's work.

Among the provided options, Question 6 mentions Armand Fizeau's experiment, but it focuses on the result rather than the improvement upon Galileo's work.

Considering the available options, I would recommend Question 4 as the closest match, but with the understanding that it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
So I'm here today to encourage
you to think about New York City, and not just as one
of humanity's greatest achievements, but as home to native wildlife that are subject to a grand
evolutionary experiment. So take this forested hillside
in Northern Manhattan, for example. This is one of the last areas
left in the city where there's clean spring water
seeping out of the ground. You could drink this
out of your hands and you'd be OK. These tiny little areas of seeping water contain huge populations
of northern dusky salamanders. These guys were common in the city
maybe 60 years ago, but now they're just stuck
on this single hillside and a few places in Staten Island. Not only do they suffer the indignity
of being stuck on this hillside, but we divided the hillside in two on two different occasions with bridges crossing
from the Bronx into Manhattan. But they're still there,
on either side of the bridges, where you see the red arrows --
about 180th Street, 167th Street. My lab has found that if you just take
a few segments of DNA from salamanders in those two locations, you can tell which side
of the bridge they came from. We built this single piece
of infrastructure that's changed their evolutionary history. We can go study these guys,
we just go to the hillside we know where they are,
we flip over rocks so we can catch them. There are a lot of other things
in New York City, though, that are not that easy to capture,
such as this guy, a coyote. We caught him on an automatic camera trap
in an undisclosed location; I'm not allowed to talk about it yet. But they're moving into New York City
for the first time. They're very flexible,
intelligent animals. This is one of this year's pups
checking out one of our cameras. And my colleagues and I
are very interested in understanding how they're going to spread
through the area, how they're going to survive here
and maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming
to a neighborhood near you, if they're not already there. Some things are too fast
to be caught by hand. We can't pick them up on the cameras, so we set up traps
around New York City and the parks. This is one of our most common activities. Here's some of my students
and collaborators getting the traps out and ready. This guy, we catch in almost
every forested area in New York City. This is the white-footed mouse -- not the mouse you find
running around your apartment. This is a native species,
been here long before humans. You find them in forests and meadows. Because they're so common
in forested areas in the city, we're using them as a model
to understand how species are adapting to urban environments. So if you think back 400 years ago, the five boroughs would've been covered
in forests and other types of vegetation. This mouse would've been everywhere
[in] huge populations that showed few genetic differences
across the landscape. But if you look at the situation today, they're just stuck in these little islands
of forest scattered around the city. Just using 18 short segments of DNA,
we can pretty much take a mouse somebody could give us a mouse,
not tell us where it was from, and we could determine
what park it came from. That's how different they've become. You'll notice in the middle
of this figure, there are some mixed-up colors. There are a few parks in the city
that are still connected to each other with strips of forest,
so the mice can run back and forth and spread their genes,
so they don't become different. But throughout the city, they're mostly
becoming different in the parks. So I'm telling you they're different,
but what does that mean? What's changing about their biology? To answer this question, we're sequencing thousands
of genes from our city mice and comparing those to thousands
of genes from the country mice, so, their ancestors
outside of New York City in these big, more wilderness areas. Now, genes are short segments of DNA
that code for amino acids. And amino acids are
the building blocks of proteins. If a single base pair changes in a gene, you can get a different amino acid, which will then change the shape
and structure of the protein. If you change the structure of a protein, you often change something
about what it does in the organism. Now if that change leads to a longer
life or more babies for a mouse, something evolutionary
biologists call fitness, then that single base-pair change
will spread quickly in an urban population. So this crazy figure
is called a Manhattan plot, because it kind of looks like a skyline. Each dot represents one gene, and the higher the dot is in the plot, the more different it is
between city and country mice. The ones kind of at the tips
of the skyscrapers are the most different, especially those above the red line. And these genes encode for things
like immune response to disease, because there might be more disease
in very dense, urban populations; metabolism, how the mice use energy; and heavy-metal tolerance. You guys can probably predict that New York City soils
are pretty contaminated with lead and chromium
and that sort of thing. And now our hard work is really starting. We're going back into the wilds
of New York City parks, following the lives of individual mice and seeing exactly
what these genes are doing for them. And I would encourage you guys
to try to look at your parks in a new way. I'm not going to be
the next Charles Darwin, but one of you guys might be,
so just keep your eyes open. Thank you. (Applause)

not tell us where it was from, and we could determine
what park it came from. That's how different they've become. You'll notice in the middle
of this figure, there are some mixed-up colors. There are a few parks in the city
that are still connected to each other with strips of forest,
so the mice can run back and forth and spread their genes,
so they don't become different. But throughout the city, they're mostly
becoming different in the parks. So I'm telling you they're different,
but what does that mean? What's changing about their biology? To answer this question, we're sequencing thousands
of genes from our city mice and comparing those to thousands
of genes from the country mice, so, their ancestors
outside of New York City in these big, more wilderness areas. Now, genes are short segments of DNA
that code for amino acids. And amino acids are
the building blocks of proteins. If a single base pair changes in a gene, you can get a different amino acid, which will then change the shape
and structure of the protein. If you change the structure of a protein, you often change something
about what it does in the organism. Now if that change leads to a longer
life or more babies for a mouse, something evolutionary
biologists call fitness, then that single base-pair change
will spread quickly in an urban population. So this crazy figure
is called a Manhattan plot, because it kind of looks like a skyline. Each dot represents one gene, and the higher the dot is in the plot, the more different it is
between city and country mice. The ones kind of at the tips
of the skyscrapers are the most different, especially those above the red line. And these genes encode for things
like immune response to disease, because there might be more disease
in very dense, urban populations; metabolism, how the mice use energy; and heavy-metal tolerance. You guys can probably predict that New York City soils
are pretty contaminated with lead and chromium
and that sort of thing. And now our hard work is really starting. We're going back into the wilds
of New York City parks, following the lives of individual mice and seeing exactly
what these genes are doing for them. And I would encourage you guys
to try to look at your parks in a new way. I'm not going to be
the next Charles Darwin, but one of you guys might be,
so just keep your eyes open. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So I'm here today to encourage
you to think about New York City, and not just as one
of humanity's greatest achievements, but as home to native wildlife that are subject to a grand
evolutionary experiment. So take this forested hillside
in Northern Manhattan, for example. This is one of the last areas
left in the city where there's clean spring water
seeping out of the ground. You could drink this
out of your hands and you'd be OK. These tiny little areas of seeping water contain huge populations
of northern dusky salamanders. These guys were common in the city
maybe 60 years ago, but now they're just stuck
on this single hillside and a few places in Staten Island. Not only do they suffer the indignity
of being stuck on this hillside, but we divided the hillside in two on two different occasions with bridges crossing
from the Bronx into Manhattan. But they're still there,
on either side of the bridges, where you see the red arrows --
about 180th Street, 167th Street. My lab has found that if you just take
a few segments of DNA from salamanders in those two locations, you can tell which side
of the bridge they came from. We built this single piece
of infrastructure that's changed their evolutionary history. We can go study these guys,
we just go to the hillside we know where they are,
we flip over rocks so we can catch them. There are a lot of other things
in New York City, though, that are not that easy to capture,
such as this guy, a coyote. We caught him on an automatic camera trap
in an undisclosed location; I'm not allowed to talk about it yet. But they're moving into New York City
for the first time. They're very flexible,
intelligent animals. This is one of this year's pups
checking out one of our cameras. And my colleagues and I
are very interested in understanding how they're going to spread
through the area, how they're going to survive here
and maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming
to a neighborhood near you, if they're not already there. Some things are too fast
to be caught by hand. We can't pick them up on the cameras, so we set up traps
around New York City and the parks. This is one of our most common activities. Here's some of my students
and collaborators getting the traps out and ready. This guy, we catch in almost
every forested area in New York City. This is the white-footed mouse -- not the mouse you find
running around your apartment. This is a native species,
been here long before humans. You find them in forests and meadows. Because they're so common
in forested areas in the city, we're using them as a model
to understand how species are adapting to urban environments. So if you think back 400 years ago, the five boroughs would've been covered
in forests and other types of vegetation. This mouse would've been everywhere
[in] huge populations that showed few genetic differences
across the landscape. But if you look at the situation today, they're just stuck in these little islands
of forest scattered around the city. Just using 18 short segments of DNA,
we can pretty much take a mouse somebody could give us a mouse,
not tell us where it was from, and we could determine
what park it came from. That's how different they've become. You'll notice in the middle
of this figure, there are some mixed-up colors. There are a few parks in the city
that are still connected to each other with strips of forest,
so the mice can run back and forth and spread their genes,
so they don't become different. But throughout the city, they're mostly
becoming different in the parks. So I'm telling you they're different,
but what does that mean? What's changing about their biology? To answer this question, we're sequencing thousands

so just keep your eyes open. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
(Music) Everything is everywhere these days. Check out the supermarket -- orange
juice from China, nuts from India, swordfish from Japan,
lagers from Czechoslovakia, scores of European cheeses. You name it, it's there.
Not when I was growing up. You'd never taste a range
of French cheeses or Bohemian lager beer. At least, you couldn't
unless you were very rich and could go anywhere when the fancy
took you. All that has changed. But it's not just foods. Got an iPhone? Everyone knows it was invented
and designed at Cupertino in California, but who knows where the complex bits and pieces of its
innards are made or assembled? Apple doesn't say. The industry credits China,
Japan, Germany, South Korea and, of course, the United States itself. Just think for a moment
of the trillions of parts and finished goods moving
cheaply around the world every second, a small portion by air, but most by sea. We call it globalization, but the man who basically made
globalization a reality in our lives is too little known. This is his story. The story of the man who makes your day. In the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of Americans were
out of work, worse than now, Malcolm McLean was a 24-year-old
truck driver. He got a job to take cotton bales from Fayetteville in North
Carolina all the way to a pier in Hoboken, New
Jersey for shipping overseas. He was glad of the work,
but when he arrived he got bored out of his mind,
sitting in his truck waiting and waiting
and waiting on the docks as the worker ants muscled crates
and bundles off other trucks and into slings that lifted the goods
into the hold of the ship. On board the ship itself, with much yelling and arm waving, the stevedores then unloaded each sling and saw its contents placed
in a designated position in the hold. Malcolm wasn't just bored, he was fuming. His income depended on getting
back to North Carolina to pick up more loads in his truck. Out of the frustration,
inspiration struck. Wouldn't it be great, he thought, if my trailer could be lifted and placed on the ship without its cotton bales being touched.
Yes, it would be great. It would be revolutionary. For centuries, general non-bulk cargo had been shipped
in the process he watched. It was called break bulk shipping. Boxes, bales, crates
handled piece by piece. What Malcolm envisaged
would have saved him only a day, but it would have saved everyone else something like two weeks
in loading and unloading the ship. On average, it was eight days to haul and distribute break
bulk shipments in the hold, plus another eight days at the other end to retrieve and distribute. All that time would have been saved if Malcolm McLean could have just
driven his truck onto the ship and at the other end, driven it off. Well, today that concept is a reality. The concept that occurred to Malcolm is known as containerization. It has done more than just
save a great deal of time. It's the reason why we have
a thriving global marketplace, offering us that infinite
variety of things, and it's the reason we can move cargo from remote parts
of the world at minimal cost. Malcolm had his idea in 1937. The 24-year-old truck driver
sitting in his truck in Hoboken was 40 before he did anything about it. By then, he'd built his one truck into a big trucking company.
He borrowed money from an enterprising vice president
at Citibank in New York, and set about designing the steel
boxes and the decks of the ships to carry them stacked
one on top of another. A lot of people thought he was crazy. Inventors always attract
armies of naysayers who can never remember
how critical they were. For our part, we should
remember Malcolm McLean. His first container ship, the Ideal X, sailed from Shed 154 at Marsh Street, Port Newark with 58 well-filled boxes. It was the beginning of the container era, shrinking our world and enlarging human choice.

into the hold of the ship. On board the ship itself, with much yelling and arm waving, the stevedores then unloaded each sling and saw its contents placed
in a designated position in the hold. Malcolm wasn't just bored, he was fuming. His income depended on getting
back to North Carolina to pick up more loads in his truck. Out of the frustration,
inspiration struck. Wouldn't it be great, he thought, if my trailer could be lifted and placed on the ship without its cotton bales being touched.
Yes, it would be great. It would be revolutionary. For centuries, general non-bulk cargo had been shipped
in the process he watched. It was called break bulk shipping. Boxes, bales, crates
handled piece by piece. What Malcolm envisaged
would have saved him only a day, but it would have saved everyone else something like two weeks
in loading and unloading the ship. On average, it was eight days to haul and distribute break
bulk shipments in the hold, plus another eight days at the other end to retrieve and distribute. All that time would have been saved if Malcolm McLean could have just
driven his truck onto the ship and at the other end, driven it off. Well, today that concept is a reality. The concept that occurred to Malcolm is known as containerization. It has done more than just
save a great deal of time. It's the reason why we have
a thriving global marketplace, offering us that infinite
variety of things, and it's the reason we can move cargo from remote parts
of the world at minimal cost. Malcolm had his idea in 1937. The 24-year-old truck driver
sitting in his truck in Hoboken was 40 before he did anything about it. By then, he'd built his one truck into a big trucking company.
He borrowed money from an enterprising vice president
at Citibank in New York, and set about designing the steel
boxes and the decks of the ships to carry them stacked
one on top of another. A lot of people thought he was crazy. Inventors always attract
armies of naysayers who can never remember
how critical they were. For our part, we should
remember Malcolm McLean. His first container ship, the Ideal X, sailed from Shed 154 at Marsh Street, Port Newark with 58 well-filled boxes. It was the beginning of the container era, shrinking our world and enlarging human choice.

(Music) Everything is everywhere these days. Check out the supermarket -- orange
juice from China, nuts from India, swordfish from Japan,
lagers from Czechoslovakia, scores of European cheeses. You name it, it's there.
Not when I was growing up. You'd never taste a range
of French cheeses or Bohemian lager beer. At least, you couldn't
unless you were very rich and could go anywhere when the fancy
took you. All that has changed. But it's not just foods. Got an iPhone? Everyone knows it was invented
and designed at Cupertino in California, but who knows where the complex bits and pieces of its
innards are made or assembled? Apple doesn't say. The industry credits China,
Japan, Germany, South Korea and, of course, the United States itself. Just think for a moment
of the trillions of parts and finished goods moving
cheaply around the world every second, a small portion by air, but most by sea. We call it globalization, but the man who basically made
globalization a reality in our lives is too little known. This is his story. The story of the man who makes your day. In the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of Americans were
out of work, worse than now, Malcolm McLean was a 24-year-old
truck driver. He got a job to take cotton bales from Fayetteville in North
Carolina all the way to a pier in Hoboken, New
Jersey for shipping overseas. He was glad of the work,
but when he arrived he got bored out of his mind,
sitting in his truck waiting and waiting
and waiting on the docks as the worker ants muscled crates
and bundles off other trucks and into slings that lifted the goods
into the hold of the ship. On board the ship itself, with much yelling and arm waving, the stevedores then unloaded each sling and saw its contents placed
in a designated position in the hold. Malcolm wasn't just bored, he was fuming. His income depended on getting
back to North Carolina to pick up more loads in his truck. Out of the frustration,
inspiration struck. Wouldn't it be great, he thought, if my trailer could be lifted and placed on the ship without its cotton bales being touched.
Yes, it would be great. It would be revolutionary. For centuries, general non-bulk cargo had been shipped

We all know the scene: Dorothy closes her eyes, and repeats the Good Witch's mantra, "No coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile." Only Dorothy doesn't say that. She says five one-syllable words, "There's no place like home." Each a word you probably learned in your first year of speaking, each perfectly concise. It's not that L. Frank Baum didn't have a thesaurus, it's that in most cases $10 words fail. Would Aerosmith have had a hit with "Ambulate This Direction?" Probably not. Would Patrick Henry have ignited a revolution by saying, "Provide me with liberty or bestow upon me fatality?" Unlikely. When it comes to words, bigger isn't always better. Ten-dollar words are rendered worthless if they're not understood. That's not to say every piece of literature should be written at a fourth-grade reading level, but it is important to know your audience. If you're a novelist, your audience is probably expecting 300 pages of vivid descriptors. At the very least, they're expecting you won't use the same 50 words to fill those pages. But most of us don't have the luxury of a captive audience. We're competing against a whole world of distractions and we're fighting for space in an attention span that continues to shrink across generations. So get to the point already. Variety may be the spice of life, but brevity is its bread and butter. So when it comes to $10 words, save your money and buy a Scrabble board.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: This video makes the case that $10 words are a bad idea because they

We all know the scene: Dorothy closes her eyes, and repeats the Good Witch's mantra, "No coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile." Only Dorothy doesn't say that. She says five one-syllable words, "There's no place like home." Each a word you probably learned in your first year of speaking, each perfectly concise. It's not that L. Frank Baum didn't have a thesaurus, it's that in most cases $10 words fail. Would Aerosmith have had a hit with "Ambulate This Direction?" Probably not. Would Patrick Henry have ignited a revolution by saying, "Provide me with liberty or bestow upon me fatality?" Unlikely. When it comes to words, bigger isn't always better. Ten-dollar words are rendered worthless if they're not understood. That's not to say every piece of literature should be written at a fourth-grade reading level, but it is important to know your audience. If you're a novelist, your audience is probably expecting 300 pages of vivid descriptors. At the very least, they're expecting you won't use the same 50 words to fill those pages. But most of us don't have the luxury of a captive audience. We're competing against a whole world of distractions and we're fighting for space in an attention span that continues to shrink across generations. So get to the point already. Variety may be the spice of life, but brevity is its bread and butter. So when it comes to $10 words, save your money and buy a Scrabble board.

Are you familiar with the word symbiosis? It's a fancy term for a partnership
between two different species, such as bees and flowers. In a symbiosis, both species
depend on each other. I want to tell you
about a remarkable symbiosis between a little bird,
the Clark's nutcracker, and a big tree, the whitebark pine. Whitebark grow in the mountains
of Wyoming, Montana and other western states. They have huge canopies
and lots of needles, which provide cover and shelter
for other plants and animals, and whitebark feed the forest. Their cones are packed with protein. Squirrels gnaw the cones
from the upper branches so they fall to the ground, and then race down to bury them
in piles, or middens. But they don't get to keep all of them; grizzlies and black bears
love finding middens. But there's more to a symbiosis
than one species feeding another. In the case of the Clark's nutcracker,
this bird gives back. While gathering its seeds,
it also replants the trees. Here's how it works:
using her powerful beak, the nutcracker picks apart
a cone in a treetop, pulling out the seeds. She can store up to 80 of them
in a pouch in her throat. Then she flies through the forest looking for a place to cache the seeds an inch under the soil
in piles of up to eight seeds. Nutcrackers can gather
up to 90,000 seeds in the autumn, which they return for
in the winter and spring. And these birds are smart. They remember where all those seeds are. They even use landmarks
on the landscape -- trees, stumps, rocks -- to triangulate to caches
buried deep under the snow. What they don't go back and get,
those seeds become whitebark. This symbiosis is
so important to both species that they've changed,
or evolved, to suit each other. Nutcrackers have developed
long, tough beaks for extracting seeds from cones, and whitebarks' branches all sweep upwards with the cones at the very ends, so they can offer them
to the nutcrackers as they fly by. That's a symbiosis: Two species cooperating to help
each other for the benefit of all.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What’s a simple definition of symbiosis?

**Transcript**:
Are you familiar with the word symbiosis? It's a fancy term for a partnership
between two different species, such as bees and flowers. In a symbiosis, both species
depend on each other. I want to tell you
about a remarkable symbiosis between a little bird,
the Clark's nutcracker, and a big tree, the whitebark pine. Whitebark grow in the mountains
of Wyoming, Montana and other western states. They have huge canopies
and lots of needles, which provide cover and shelter
for other plants and animals, and whitebark feed the forest. Their cones are packed with protein. Squirrels gnaw the cones
from the upper branches so they fall to the ground, and then race down to bury them
in piles, or middens. But they don't get to keep all of them; grizzlies and black bears
love finding middens. But there's more to a symbiosis
than one species feeding another. In the case of the Clark's nutcracker,
this bird gives back. While gathering its seeds,
it also replants the trees. Here's how it works:
using her powerful beak, the nutcracker picks apart
a cone in a treetop, pulling out the seeds. She can store up to 80 of them
in a pouch in her throat. Then she flies through the forest looking for a place to cache the seeds an inch under the soil
in piles of up to eight seeds. Nutcrackers can gather
up to 90,000 seeds in the autumn, which they return for
in the winter and spring. And these birds are smart. They remember where all those seeds are. They even use landmarks
on the landscape -- trees, stumps, rocks -- to triangulate to caches
buried deep under the snow. What they don't go back and get,
those seeds become whitebark. This symbiosis is
so important to both species that they've changed,
or evolved, to suit each other. Nutcrackers have developed
long, tough beaks for extracting seeds from cones, and whitebarks' branches all sweep upwards with the cones at the very ends, so they can offer them
to the nutcrackers as they fly by. That's a symbiosis: Two species cooperating to help
each other for the benefit of all.

**Transcript**:
(Music) Sometimes when I'm on a long plane flight, I gaze out at all those mountains and deserts and try to get my head around how vast our Earth is. And then I remember that there's an object we see every day that would literally fit one million Earths inside it. The sun seems impossibly big, but in the great scheme of things, it's a pinprick, one of about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which you can see on a clear night as a pale, white mist 
stretched across the sky. And it gets worse. There are maybe 100 billion galaxies detectable by our telescopes, so if each star was the size of a single grain of sand, just the Milky Way has enough stars to fill a 30 foot by 30 foot stretch of beach three feet deep with sand. And the entire Earth doesn't have enough beaches to represent the stars in the overall universe. Such a beach would continue for literally hundreds of millions of miles. Holy Stephen Hawking, that is a lot of stars. But he and other physicists now believe in a reality that is unimaginably bigger still. I mean, first of all, the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescopes are probably a minuscule fraction of the total. Space itself is expanding at an accelerating pace. The vast majority of the galaxies are separating from us so fast that light from them may never reach us. Still, our physical reality here on Earth is intimately connected to those distant, invisible galaxies. We can think of them as part of our universe. They make up a single, giant edifice, obeying the same physical laws and all made from the same types of atoms, electrons, protons, quarks, neutrinos that make up you and me. However, recent theories in physics, including one called string theory, are now telling us there could be countless other universes, built on different types of particles, with different properties, obeying different laws. Most of these universes could never support life, and might flash in and out of existence in a nanosecond, but nonetheless, combined they make up a vast multiverse of possible universes. in up to 11 dimensions, featuring wonders beyond our wildest imagination. And the leading version of string theory predicts a multiverse made of up to 10 to the 500 universes. That's a one followed by 500 zeroes, a number so vast that if every atom in our observable universe had its own universe and all of the atoms in all of those universes each had their own universe, and you repeated that for two more cycles, you'd still be at a tiny fraction of the total -- namely, one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillionth. But even that number is minuscule compared to another number: infinity. Some physicists think the space-time continuum is literally infinite, and that it contains an infinite number of so-called pocket universes with varying properties. How's your brain doing? But quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle. I mean, the theory's been proven true beyond all doubt, but interpreting it is baffling. And some physicists think you can only un-baffle it if you imagine that huge numbers of parallel universes are being spawned every moment, and many of these universes would actually be very like the world we're in, would include multiple copies of you. In one such universe, you'd graduate with honors and marry the person of your dreams. In another, not so much. There are still some scientists who would say, hogwash. The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universes there are is one, only one universe. And a few philosophers and mystics might argue that even our own universe is an illusion. So, as you can see, right now there is no agreement on this question, not even close. All we know is, the answer is somewhere between zero and infinity. Well, I guess we know one other thing: This is a pretty cool time to be studying physics. We just might be undergoing the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge that humanity has ever seen.

**Transcript**:
(Music) Sometimes when I'm on a long plane flight, I gaze out at all those mountains and deserts and try to get my head around how vast our Earth is. And then I remember that there's an object we see every day that would literally fit one million Earths inside it. The sun seems impossibly big, but in the great scheme of things, it's a pinprick, one of about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which you can see on a clear night as a pale, white mist 
stretched across the sky. And it gets worse. There are maybe 100 billion galaxies detectable by our telescopes, so if each star was the size of a single grain of sand, just the Milky Way has enough stars to fill a 30 foot by 30 foot stretch of beach three feet deep with sand. And the entire Earth doesn't have enough beaches to represent the stars in the overall universe. Such a beach would continue for literally hundreds of millions of miles. Holy Stephen Hawking, that is a lot of stars. But he and other physicists now believe in a reality that is unimaginably bigger still. I mean, first of all, the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescopes are probably a minuscule fraction of the total. Space itself is expanding at an accelerating pace. The vast majority of the galaxies are separating from us so fast that light from them may never reach us. Still, our physical reality here on Earth is intimately connected to those distant, invisible galaxies. We can think of them as part of our universe. They make up a single, giant edifice, obeying the same physical laws and all made from the same types of atoms, electrons, protons, quarks, neutrinos that make up you and me. However, recent theories in physics, including one called string theory, are now telling us there could be countless other universes, built on different types of particles, with different properties, obeying different laws. Most of these universes could never support life, and might flash in and out of existence in a nanosecond, but nonetheless, combined they make up a vast multiverse of possible universes. in up to 11 dimensions, featuring wonders beyond our wildest imagination. And the leading version of string theory predicts a multiverse made of up to 10 to the 500 universes. That's a one followed by 500 zeroes, a number so vast that if every atom in our observable universe had its own universe and all of the atoms in all of those universes each had their own universe, and you repeated that for two more cycles, you'd still be at a tiny fraction of the total -- namely, one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillionth. But even that number is minuscule compared to another number: infinity. Some physicists think the space-time continuum is literally infinite, and that it contains an infinite number of so-called pocket universes with varying properties. How's your brain doing? But quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle. I mean, the theory's been proven true beyond all doubt, but interpreting it is baffling. And some physicists think you can only un-baffle it if you imagine that huge numbers of parallel universes are being spawned every moment, and many of these universes would actually be very like the world we're in, would include multiple copies of you. In one such universe, you'd graduate with honors and marry the person of your dreams. In another, not so much. There are still some scientists who would say, hogwash. The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universes there are is one, only one universe. And a few philosophers and mystics might argue that even our own universe is an illusion. So, as you can see, right now there is no agreement on this question, not even close. All we know is, the answer is somewhere between zero and infinity. Well, I guess we know one other thing: This is a pretty cool time to be studying physics. We just might be undergoing the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge that humanity has ever seen.

Translator: Jenny Zurawell One of the funny things
about owning a brain is that you have
no control over the things that it gathers and holds onto,
the facts and the stories. And as you get older, it only gets worse. Things stick around for years sometimes before you understand
why you're interested in them, before you understand their import to you. Here's three of mine. When Richard Feynman
was a young boy in Queens, he went for a walk with his dad
and his wagon and a ball. He noticed that when he pulled the wagon,
the ball went to the back of the wagon. He asked his dad, "Why does
the ball go to the back of the wagon?" And his dad said, "That's inertia." He said, "What's inertia?"
And his dad said, "Ah. Inertia is the name that scientists give to the phenomenon of the ball
going to the back of the wagon." (Laughter) "But in truth, nobody really knows." Feynman went on to earn degrees at MIT, Princeton, he solved
the Challenger disaster, he ended up winning
the Nobel Prize in Physics for his Feynman diagrams, describing
the movement of subatomic particles. And he credits that conversation
with his father as giving him a sense that the simplest questions could carry
you out to the edge of human knowledge, and that that's where he wanted to play. And play he did. Eratosthenes was the third librarian
at the great Library of Alexandria, and he made many contributions to science. But the one he is most remembered for began in a letter that he received
as the librarian, from the town of Swenet,
which was south of Alexandria. The letter included this fact
that stuck in Eratosthenes' mind, and the fact was that the writer said, at noon on the solstice,
when he looked down this deep well, he could see his reflection at the bottom, and he could also see
that his head was blocking the sun. I should tell you -- the idea
that Christopher Columbus discovered that the world
is spherical is total bull. It's not true at all. In fact, everyone who was educated
understood that the world was spherical since Aristotle's time. Aristotle had proved it
with a simple observation. He noticed that every time you saw
the Earth's shadow on the Moon, it was circular, and the only shape that constantly
creates a circular shadow is a sphere, Q.E.D. the Earth is round. But nobody knew how big it was until Eratosthenes got
this letter with this fact. So he understood that the sun
was directly above the city of Swenet, because looking down a well,
it was a straight line all the way down the well,
right past the guy's head up to the sun. Eratosthenes knew another fact. He knew that a stick stuck
in the ground in Alexandria at the same time
and the same day, at noon, the sun's zenith, on the solstice, the sun cast a shadow that showed
that it was 7.2 degrees off-axis. If you know the circumference of a circle,
and you have two points on it, all you need to know is the distance
between those two points, and you can extrapolate the circumference. 360 degrees divided by 7.2 equals 50. I know it's a little bit
of a round number, and it makes me suspicious
of this story too, but it's a good story,
so we'll continue with it. He needed to know the distance
between Swenet and Alexandria, which is good because Eratosthenes
was good at geography. In fact, he invented the word geography. (Laughter) The road between Swenet and Alexandria
was a road of commerce, and commerce needed to know
how long it took to get there. It needed to know the exact distance,
so he knew very precisely that the distance between
the two cities was 500 miles. Multiply that times 50, you get 25,000, which is within one percent
of the actual diameter of the Earth. He did this 2,200 years ago. Now, we live in an age where multi-billion-dollar pieces of machinery
are looking for the Higgs boson. We're discovering particles that may travel faster
than the speed of light, and all of these discoveries
are made possible by technology that's been developed
in the last few decades. But for most of human history, we had to discover these things using
our eyes and our ears and our minds. Armand Fizeau was
an experimental physicist in Paris. His specialty was actually refining
and confirming other people's results, and this might sound
like a bit of an also-ran, but in fact, this is the soul of science, because there is no such thing as a fact
that cannot be independently corroborated. And he was familiar
with Galileo's experiments in trying to determine
whether or not light had a speed. Galileo had worked out this
really wonderful experiment where he and his assistant had a lamp,
each one of them was holding a lamp. Galileo would open his lamp,
and his assistant would open his. They got the timing down really good. They just knew their timing. And then they stood at two hilltops, two miles distant,
and they did the same thing, on the assumption from Galileo
that if light had a discernible speed, he'd notice a delay in the light
coming back from his assistant's lamp. But light was too fast for Galileo. He was off by several orders
of magnitude when he assumed that light was roughly ten times
as fast as the speed of sound. Fizeau was aware of this experiment. He lived in Paris, and he set up
two experimental stations, roughly 5.5 miles distant, in Paris. And he solved this problem of Galileo's, and he did it with a really relatively
trivial piece of equipment. He did it with one of these. I'm going to put away
the clicker for a second because I want to engage
your brains in this. So this is a toothed wheel. It's got a bunch of notches
and it's got a bunch of teeth. This was Fizeau's solution
to sending discrete pulses of light. He put a beam behind one of these notches. If I point a beam
through this notch at a mirror, five miles away, that beam
is bouncing off the mirror and coming back to me through this notch. But something interesting happens
as he spins the wheel faster. He notices that it seems
like a door is starting to close on the light beam
that's coming back to his eye. Why is that? It's because the pulse
of light is not coming back through the same notch. It's actually hitting a tooth. And he spins the wheel fast enough
and he fully occludes the light. And then, based on the distance
between the two stations and the speed of his wheel
and the number of notches in the wheel, he calculates the speed of light
to within two percent of its actual value. And he does this in 1849. This is what really gets me
going about science. Whenever I'm having trouble
understanding a concept, I go back and I research
the people that discovered that concept. I look at the story of how
they came to understand it. What happens when you look at what the discoverers
were thinking about when they made their discoveries, is you understand that
they are not so different from us. We are all bags of meat and water.
We all start with the same tools. I love the idea that different branches
of science are called fields of study. Most people think of science
as a closed, black box, when in fact it is an open field. And we are all explorers. The people that made these discoveries
just thought a little bit harder about what they were looking at,
and they were a little bit more curious. And their curiosity changed the way
people thought about the world, and thus it changed the world. They changed the world, and so can you. Thank you. (Applause)

and the same day, at noon, the sun's zenith, on the solstice, the sun cast a shadow that showed
that it was 7.2 degrees off-axis. If you know the circumference of a circle,
and you have two points on it, all you need to know is the distance
between those two points, and you can extrapolate the circumference. 360 degrees divided by 7.2 equals 50. I know it's a little bit
of a round number, and it makes me suspicious
of this story too, but it's a good story,
so we'll continue with it. He needed to know the distance
between Swenet and Alexandria, which is good because Eratosthenes
was good at geography. In fact, he invented the word geography. (Laughter) The road between Swenet and Alexandria
was a road of commerce, and commerce needed to know
how long it took to get there. It needed to know the exact distance,
so he knew very precisely that the distance between
the two cities was 500 miles. Multiply that times 50, you get 25,000, which is within one percent
of the actual diameter of the Earth. He did this 2,200 years ago. Now, we live in an age where multi-billion-dollar pieces of machinery
are looking for the Higgs boson. We're discovering particles that may travel faster
than the speed of light, and all of these discoveries
are made possible by technology that's been developed
in the last few decades. But for most of human history, we had to discover these things using
our eyes and our ears and our minds. Armand Fizeau was
an experimental physicist in Paris. His specialty was actually refining
and confirming other people's results, and this might sound
like a bit of an also-ran, but in fact, this is the soul of science, because there is no such thing as a fact
that cannot be independently corroborated. And he was familiar
with Galileo's experiments in trying to determine
whether or not light had a speed. Galileo had worked out this
really wonderful experiment where he and his assistant had a lamp,
each one of them was holding a lamp. Galileo would open his lamp,
and his assistant would open his. They got the timing down really good. They just knew their timing. And then they stood at two hilltops, two miles distant,
and they did the same thing, on the assumption from Galileo
that if light had a discernible speed, he'd notice a delay in the light
coming back from his assistant's lamp. But light was too fast for Galileo. He was off by several orders
of magnitude when he assumed that light was roughly ten times
as fast as the speed of sound. Fizeau was aware of this experiment. He lived in Paris, and he set up
two experimental stations, roughly 5.5 miles distant, in Paris. And he solved this problem of Galileo's, and he did it with a really relatively
trivial piece of equipment. He did it with one of these. I'm going to put away
the clicker for a second because I want to engage
your brains in this. So this is a toothed wheel. It's got a bunch of notches
and it's got a bunch of teeth. This was Fizeau's solution
to sending discrete pulses of light. He put a beam behind one of these notches. If I point a beam
through this notch at a mirror, five miles away, that beam
is bouncing off the mirror and coming back to me through this notch. But something interesting happens
as he spins the wheel faster. He notices that it seems
like a door is starting to close on the light beam
that's coming back to his eye. Why is that? It's because the pulse
of light is not coming back through the same notch. It's actually hitting a tooth. And he spins the wheel fast enough
and he fully occludes the light. And then, based on the distance
between the two stations and the speed of his wheel
and the number of notches in the wheel, he calculates the speed of light
to within two percent of its actual value. And he does this in 1849. This is what really gets me
going about science. Whenever I'm having trouble
understanding a concept, I go back and I research
the people that discovered that concept. I look at the story of how
they came to understand it. What happens when you look at what the discoverers
were thinking about when they made their discoveries, is you understand that
they are not so different from us. We are all bags of meat and water.
We all start with the same tools. I love the idea that different branches
of science are called fields of study. Most people think of science
as a closed, black box, when in fact it is an open field. And we are all explorers. The people that made these discoveries
just thought a little bit harder about what they were looking at,
and they were a little bit more curious. And their curiosity changed the way
people thought about the world, and thus it changed the world. They changed the world, and so can you. Thank you. (Applause)

Translator: Jenny Zurawell One of the funny things
about owning a brain is that you have
no control over the things that it gathers and holds onto,
the facts and the stories. And as you get older, it only gets worse. Things stick around for years sometimes before you understand
why you're interested in them, before you understand their import to you. Here's three of mine. When Richard Feynman
was a young boy in Queens, he went for a walk with his dad
and his wagon and a ball. He noticed that when he pulled the wagon,
the ball went to the back of the wagon. He asked his dad, "Why does
the ball go to the back of the wagon?" And his dad said, "That's inertia." He said, "What's inertia?"
And his dad said, "Ah. Inertia is the name that scientists give to the phenomenon of the ball
going to the back of the wagon." (Laughter) "But in truth, nobody really knows." Feynman went on to earn degrees at MIT, Princeton, he solved
the Challenger disaster, he ended up winning
the Nobel Prize in Physics for his Feynman diagrams, describing
the movement of subatomic particles. And he credits that conversation
with his father as giving him a sense that the simplest questions could carry
you out to the edge of human knowledge, and that that's where he wanted to play. And play he did. Eratosthenes was the third librarian
at the great Library of Alexandria, and he made many contributions to science. But the one he is most remembered for began in a letter that he received
as the librarian, from the town of Swenet,
which was south of Alexandria. The letter included this fact
that stuck in Eratosthenes' mind, and the fact was that the writer said, at noon on the solstice,
when he looked down this deep well, he could see his reflection at the bottom, and he could also see
that his head was blocking the sun. I should tell you -- the idea
that Christopher Columbus discovered that the world
is spherical is total bull. It's not true at all. In fact, everyone who was educated
understood that the world was spherical since Aristotle's time. Aristotle had proved it
with a simple observation. He noticed that every time you saw
the Earth's shadow on the Moon, it was circular, and the only shape that constantly
creates a circular shadow is a sphere, Q.E.D. the Earth is round. But nobody knew how big it was until Eratosthenes got
this letter with this fact. So he understood that the sun
was directly above the city of Swenet, because looking down a well,
it was a straight line all the way down the well,
right past the guy's head up to the sun. Eratosthenes knew another fact. He knew that a stick stuck
in the ground in Alexandria at the same time
and the same day, at noon, the sun's zenith, on the solstice, the sun cast a shadow that showed

understood that the world was spherical since Aristotle's time. Aristotle had proved it
with a simple observation. He noticed that every time you saw
the Earth's shadow on the Moon, it was circular, and the only shape that constantly
creates a circular shadow is a sphere, Q.E.D. the Earth is round. But nobody knew how big it was until Eratosthenes got
this letter with this fact. So he understood that the sun
was directly above the city of Swenet, because looking down a well,
it was a straight line all the way down the well,
right past the guy's head up to the sun. Eratosthenes knew another fact. He knew that a stick stuck
in the ground in Alexandria at the same time
and the same day, at noon, the sun's zenith, on the solstice, the sun cast a shadow that showed
that it was 7.2 degrees off-axis. If you know the circumference of a circle,
and you have two points on it, all you need to know is the distance
between those two points, and you can extrapolate the circumference. 360 degrees divided by 7.2 equals 50. I know it's a little bit
of a round number, and it makes me suspicious
of this story too, but it's a good story,
so we'll continue with it. He needed to know the distance
between Swenet and Alexandria, which is good because Eratosthenes
was good at geography. In fact, he invented the word geography. (Laughter) The road between Swenet and Alexandria
was a road of commerce, and commerce needed to know
how long it took to get there. It needed to know the exact distance,
so he knew very precisely that the distance between
the two cities was 500 miles. Multiply that times 50, you get 25,000, which is within one percent
of the actual diameter of the Earth. He did this 2,200 years ago. Now, we live in an age where multi-billion-dollar pieces of machinery
are looking for the Higgs boson. We're discovering particles that may travel faster
than the speed of light, and all of these discoveries
are made possible by technology that's been developed
in the last few decades. But for most of human history, we had to discover these things using
our eyes and our ears and our minds. Armand Fizeau was
an experimental physicist in Paris. His specialty was actually refining
and confirming other people's results, and this might sound
like a bit of an also-ran, but in fact, this is the soul of science, because there is no such thing as a fact
that cannot be independently corroborated. And he was familiar
with Galileo's experiments in trying to determine
whether or not light had a speed. Galileo had worked out this
really wonderful experiment where he and his assistant had a lamp,
each one of them was holding a lamp. Galileo would open his lamp,
and his assistant would open his. They got the timing down really good. They just knew their timing. And then they stood at two hilltops, two miles distant,
and they did the same thing, on the assumption from Galileo
that if light had a discernible speed, he'd notice a delay in the light
coming back from his assistant's lamp. But light was too fast for Galileo. He was off by several orders
of magnitude when he assumed that light was roughly ten times
as fast as the speed of sound. Fizeau was aware of this experiment. He lived in Paris, and he set up
two experimental stations, roughly 5.5 miles distant, in Paris. And he solved this problem of Galileo's, and he did it with a really relatively
trivial piece of equipment. He did it with one of these. I'm going to put away
the clicker for a second because I want to engage
your brains in this. So this is a toothed wheel. It's got a bunch of notches
and it's got a bunch of teeth. This was Fizeau's solution
to sending discrete pulses of light. He put a beam behind one of these notches. If I point a beam
through this notch at a mirror, five miles away, that beam
is bouncing off the mirror and coming back to me through this notch. But something interesting happens
as he spins the wheel faster. He notices that it seems
like a door is starting to close on the light beam
that's coming back to his eye. Why is that? It's because the pulse
of light is not coming back through the same notch. It's actually hitting a tooth. And he spins the wheel fast enough
and he fully occludes the light. And then, based on the distance
between the two stations and the speed of his wheel
and the number of notches in the wheel, he calculates the speed of light
to within two percent of its actual value. And he does this in 1849. This is what really gets me
going about science. Whenever I'm having trouble
understanding a concept, I go back and I research
the people that discovered that concept. I look at the story of how
they came to understand it. What happens when you look at what the discoverers
were thinking about when they made their discoveries, is you understand that
they are not so different from us. We are all bags of meat and water.
We all start with the same tools. I love the idea that different branches
of science are called fields of study. Most people think of science
as a closed, black box, when in fact it is an open field. And we are all explorers. The people that made these discoveries
just thought a little bit harder about what they were looking at,
and they were a little bit more curious. And their curiosity changed the way
people thought about the world, and thus it changed the world. They changed the world, and so can you. Thank you. (Applause)
