Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that Question 3 is the closest match, as it deals with electron configuration and valence electrons, which are related to the topic of electron sub-levels.

But since none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the capacity of each sub-level (S, P, D, F), I must conclude that there is no matching generated MCQ.

If I had to choose, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: None

However, I would recommend generating new MCQs that directly address the topic of electron sub-levels and their capacities to match the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of valence electrons in Magnesium, while Question 3 asks about the difference between electron configuration and valence electrons. Although not identical, Question 3 is related to the concept of valence electrons and electron configuration, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the number of valence electrons in Magnesium. If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose Question 3, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby The ancient Greeks had a great idea: The universe is simple. In their minds, all you needed to make it were four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. As theories go, it's a beautiful one. It has simplicity and elegance. It says that by combining the four basic elements in different ways, you could produce all the wonderful diversity of the universe. Earth and fire, for example, give you things that are dry. Air and water, things that are wet. But as theories go, it had a problem. It didn't predict anything that could be measured, and measurement is the basis of experimental science. Worse still, the theory was wrong. But the Greeks were great scientists of the mind and in the 5th century B.C., Leucippus of Miletus came up with one of the most enduring scientific ideas ever. Everything we see is made up of tiny, indivisible bits of stuff called atoms. This theory is simple and elegant, and it has the advantage over the earth, air, fire, and water theory of being right. Centuries of scientific thought and experimentation have established that the real elements, things like hydrogen, carbon, and iron, can be broken down into atoms. In Leucippus's theory, the atom is the smallest, indivisible bit of stuff that's still recognizable as hydrogen, carbon, or iron. The only thing wrong with Leucippus's idea is that atoms are, in fact, divisible. Furthermore, his atoms idea turns out to explain just a small part of what the universe is made of. What appears to be the ordinary stuff of the universe is, in fact, quite rare. Leucippus's atoms, and the things they're made of, actually make up only about 5% of what we know to be there. Physicists know the rest of the universe, 95% of it, as the dark universe, made of dark matter and dark energy. How do we know this? Well, we know because we look at things and we see them. That might seem rather simplistic, but it's actually quite profound. All the stuff that's made of atoms is visible. Light bounces off it, and we can see it. When we look out into space, we see stars and galaxies. Some of them, like the one we live in, are beautiful, spiral shapes, spinning gracefully through space. When scientists first measured the motion of groups of galaxies in the 1930's and weighed the amount of matter they contained, they were in for a surprise. They found that there's not enough visible stuff in those groups to hold them together. Later measurements of individual galaxies confirmed this puzzling result. There's simply not enough visible stuff in galaxies to provide enough gravity to hold them together. From what we can see, they ought to fly apart, but they don't. So there must be stuff there that we can't see. We call that stuff dark matter. The best evidence for dark matter today comes from measurements of something called the cosmic microwave background, the afterglow of the Big Bang, but that's another story. All of the evidence we have says that dark matter is there and it accounts for much of the stuff in those beautiful spiral galaxies that fill the heavens. So where does that leave us? We've long known that the heavens do not revolve around us and that we're residents of a fairly ordinary planet, orbiting a fairly ordinary star, in the spiral arm of a fairly ordinary galaxy. The discovery of dark matter took us one step further away from the center of things. It told us that the stuff we're made of is only a small fraction of what makes up the universe. But there was more to come. Early this century, scientists studying the outer reaches of the universe confirmed that not only is everything moving apart from everything else, as you would expect in a universe that began in hot, dense big bang, but that the universe's expansion also seems to be accelerating. What's that about? Either there is some kind of energy pushing this acceleration, just like you provide energy to accelerate a car, or gravity does not behave exactly as we think. Most scientists think it's the former, that there's some kind of energy driving the acceleration, and they called it dark energy. Today's best measurements allow us to work out just how much of the universe is dark. It looks as if dark energy makes up about 68% of the universe and dark matter about 27%, leaving just 5% for us and everything else we can actually see. So what's the dark stuff made of? We don't know, but there's one theory, called supersymmetry, that could explain some of it. Supersymmetry, or SUSY for short, predicts a whole range of new particles, some of which could make up the dark matter. If we found evidence for SUSY, we could go from understanding 5% of our universe, the things we can actually see, to around a third. Not bad for a day's work. Dark energy would probably be harder to understand, but there are some speculative theories out there that might point the way. Among them are theories that go back to that first great idea of the ancient Greeks, the idea that we began with several minutes ago, the idea that the universe must be simple. These theories predict that there is just a single element from which all the universe's wonderful diversity stems, a vibrating string. The idea is that all the particles we know today are just different harmonics on the string. Unfortunately, string theories today are, as yet, untestable. But, with so much of the universe waiting to be explored, the stakes are high. Does all of this make you feel small? It shouldn't. Instead, you should marvel in the fact that, as far as we know, you are a member of the only species in the universe able even to begin to grasp its wonders, and you're living at the right time to see our understanding explode.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the four elements the ancient Greeks believed comprised the world and asks to identify which one was not part of those elements.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 1, which asks about the basic idea of the ancient Greek theory of the universe. Although it does not directly ask about the four elements, it mentions them in the options.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the four elements. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, although it's not a perfect match.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby The ancient Greeks had a great idea: The universe is simple. In their minds, all you needed to make it were four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. As theories go, it's a beautiful one. It has simplicity and elegance. It says that by combining the four basic elements in different ways, you could produce all the wonderful diversity of the universe. Earth and fire, for example, give you things that are dry. Air and water, things that are wet. But as theories go, it had a problem. It didn't predict anything that could be measured, and measurement is the basis of experimental science. Worse still, the theory was wrong. But the Greeks were great scientists of the mind and in the 5th century B.C., Leucippus of Miletus came up with one of the most enduring scientific ideas ever. Everything we see is made up of tiny, indivisible bits of stuff called atoms. This theory is simple and elegant, and it has the advantage over the earth, air, fire, and water theory of being right. Centuries of scientific thought and experimentation have established that the real elements, things like hydrogen, carbon, and iron, can be broken down into atoms. In Leucippus's theory, the atom is the smallest, indivisible bit of stuff that's still recognizable as hydrogen, carbon, or iron. The only thing wrong with Leucippus's idea is that atoms are, in fact, divisible. Furthermore, his atoms idea turns out to explain just a small part of what the universe is made of. What appears to be the ordinary stuff of the universe is, in fact, quite rare. Leucippus's atoms, and the things they're made of, actually make up only about 5% of what we know to be there. Physicists know the rest of the universe, 95% of it, as the dark universe, made of dark matter and dark energy. How do we know this? Well, we know because we look at things and we see them. That might seem rather simplistic, but it's actually quite profound. All the stuff that's made of atoms is visible. Light bounces off it, and we can see it. When we look out into space, we see stars and galaxies. Some of them, like the one we live in, are beautiful, spiral shapes, spinning gracefully through space. When scientists first measured the motion of groups of galaxies in the 1930's and weighed the amount of matter they contained, they were in for a surprise. They found that there's not enough visible stuff in those groups to hold them together. Later measurements of individual galaxies confirmed this puzzling result. There's simply not enough visible stuff in galaxies to provide enough gravity to hold them together. From what we can see, they ought to fly apart, but they don't. So there must be stuff there that we can't see. We call that stuff dark matter. The best evidence for dark matter today comes from measurements of something called the cosmic microwave background, the afterglow of the Big Bang, but that's another story. All of the evidence we have says that dark matter is there and it accounts for much of the stuff in those beautiful spiral galaxies that fill the heavens. So where does that leave us? We've long known that the heavens do not revolve around us and that we're residents of a fairly ordinary planet, orbiting a fairly ordinary star, in the spiral arm of a fairly ordinary galaxy. The discovery of dark matter took us one step further away from the center of things. It told us that the stuff we're made of is only a small fraction of what makes up the universe. But there was more to come. Early this century, scientists studying the outer reaches of the universe confirmed that not only is everything moving apart from everything else, as you would expect in a universe that began in hot, dense big bang, but that the universe's expansion also seems to be accelerating. What's that about? Either there is some kind of energy pushing this acceleration, just like you provide energy to accelerate a car, or gravity does not behave exactly as we think. Most scientists think it's the former, that there's some kind of energy driving the acceleration, and they called it dark energy. Today's best measurements allow us to work out just how much of the universe is dark. It looks as if dark energy makes up about 68% of the universe and dark matter about 27%, leaving just 5% for us and everything else we can actually see. So what's the dark stuff made of? We don't know, but there's one theory, called supersymmetry, that could explain some of it. Supersymmetry, or SUSY for short, predicts a whole range of new particles, some of which could make up the dark matter. If we found evidence for SUSY, we could go from understanding 5% of our universe, the things we can actually see, to around a third. Not bad for a day's work. Dark energy would probably be harder to understand, but there are some speculative theories out there that might point the way. Among them are theories that go back to that first great idea of the ancient Greeks, the idea that we began with several minutes ago, the idea that the universe must be simple. These theories predict that there is just a single element from which all the universe's wonderful diversity stems, a vibrating string. The idea is that all the particles we know today are just different harmonics on the string. Unfortunately, string theories today are, as yet, untestable. But, with so much of the universe waiting to be explored, the stakes are high. Does all of this make you feel small? It shouldn't. Instead, you should marvel in the fact that, as far as we know, you are a member of the only species in the universe able even to begin to grasp its wonders, and you're living at the right time to see our understanding explode.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Is it possible to create something out of nothing? Or, more precisely, can energy be made into matter? Yes, but only when it comes together with its twin, antimatter. And there's something pretty mysterious about antimatter: there's way less of it out there than there should be. Let's start with the most famous physics formula ever: E equals m c squared. It basically says that mass is concentrated energy, and mass and energy are exchangeable, like two currencies with a huge exchange rate. 90 trillion Joules of energy are equivalent to 1 gram of mass. But how do I actually transform energy into matter? The magic word is energy density. If you concentrate a huge amount of energy in a tiny space, new particles will come into existence. If we look closer, we see that these particles always come in pairs, like twins. That's because particles always have a counterpart, an antiparticle, and these are always produced in exactly equal amounts: 50/50. This might sound like science fiction, but it's the daily life of particle accelerators. In the collisions between two protons at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, billions of particles and antiparticles are produced every second. Consider, for example, the electron. It has a very small mass and negative electric charge. It's antiparticle, the positron, has exactly the same mass, but a positive electric charge. But, apart from the opposite charges, both particles are identical and perfectly stable. And the same is true for their heavy cousins, the proton and the antiproton. Therefore, scientists are convinced that a world made of antimatter would look, feel, and smell just like our world. In this antiworld, we may find antiwater, antigold, and, for example, an antimarble. Now imagine that a marble and an antimarble are brought together. These two apparently solid objects would completely disappear into a big flash of energy, equivalent to an atomic bomb. Because combining matter and antimatter would create so much energy, science fiction is full of ideas about harnessing the energy stored in antimatter, for example, to fuel spaceships like Star Trek. After all, the energy content of antimatter is a billion times higher than conventional fuel. The energy of one gram of antimatter would be enough for driving a car 1,000 times around the Earth, or to bring the space shuttle into orbit. So why don't we use antimatter for energy production? Well, antimatter isn't just sitting around, ready for us to harvest. We have to make antimatter before we can combust antimatter, and it takes a billion times more energy to make antimatter than you get back. But, what if there was some antimatter in outer space and we could dig it out one day from an antiplanet somewhere. A few decades ago, many scientists believed that this could actually be possible. Today, observations have shown that there is no significant amount of antimatter anywhere in the visible universe, which is weird because, like we said before, there should be just as much antimatter as there is matter in the universe. Since antiparticles and particles should exist in equal numbers, this missing antimatter? Now that is a real mystery. To understand what might be happening, we must go back to the Big Bang. In the instant the universe was created, a huge amount of energy was transformed into mass, and our initial universe contained equal amounts of matter and antimatter. But just a second later, most matter and all of the antimatter had destroyed one another, producing an enormous amount of radiation that can still be observed today. Just about 100 millionths of the original amount of matter stuck around and no antimatter whatsoever. "Now, wait!" you might say, "Why did all the antimatter disappear and only matter was left?" It seems that we were somehow lucky that a tiny asymmetry exists between matter and antimatter. Otherwise, there would be no particles at all anywhere in the universe and also no human beings. But what causes this asymmetry? Experiments at CERN are trying to find out the reason why something exists and why we don't live in a universe filled with radiation only? But, so far, we just don't know the answer.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Is it possible to create something out of nothing? Or, more precisely, can energy be made into matter? Yes, but only when it comes together with its twin, antimatter. And there's something pretty mysterious about antimatter: there's way less of it out there than there should be. Let's start with the most famous physics formula ever: E equals m c squared. It basically says that mass is concentrated energy, and mass and energy are exchangeable, like two currencies with a huge exchange rate. 90 trillion Joules of energy are equivalent to 1 gram of mass. But how do I actually transform energy into matter? The magic word is energy density. If you concentrate a huge amount of energy in a tiny space, new particles will come into existence. If we look closer, we see that these particles always come in pairs, like twins. That's because particles always have a counterpart, an antiparticle, and these are always produced in exactly equal amounts: 50/50. This might sound like science fiction, but it's the daily life of particle accelerators. In the collisions between two protons at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, billions of particles and antiparticles are produced every second. Consider, for example, the electron. It has a very small mass and negative electric charge. It's antiparticle, the positron, has exactly the same mass, but a positive electric charge. But, apart from the opposite charges, both particles are identical and perfectly stable. And the same is true for their heavy cousins, the proton and the antiproton. Therefore, scientists are convinced that a world made of antimatter would look, feel, and smell just like our world. In this antiworld, we may find antiwater, antigold, and, for example, an antimarble. Now imagine that a marble and an antimarble are brought together. These two apparently solid objects would completely disappear into a big flash of energy, equivalent to an atomic bomb. Because combining matter and antimatter would create so much energy, science fiction is full of ideas about harnessing the energy stored in antimatter, for example, to fuel spaceships like Star Trek. After all, the energy content of antimatter is a billion times higher than conventional fuel. The energy of one gram of antimatter would be enough for driving a car 1,000 times around the Earth, or to bring the space shuttle into orbit. So why don't we use antimatter for energy production? Well, antimatter isn't just sitting around, ready for us to harvest. We have to make antimatter before we can combust antimatter, and it takes a billion times more energy to make antimatter than you get back. But, what if there was some antimatter in outer space and we could dig it out one day from an antiplanet somewhere. A few decades ago, many scientists believed that this could actually be possible. Today, observations have shown that there is no significant amount of antimatter anywhere in the visible universe, which is weird because, like we said before, there should be just as much antimatter as there is matter in the universe. Since antiparticles and particles should exist in equal numbers, this missing antimatter? Now that is a real mystery. To understand what might be happening, we must go back to the Big Bang. In the instant the universe was created, a huge amount of energy was transformed into mass, and our initial universe contained equal amounts of matter and antimatter. But just a second later, most matter and all of the antimatter had destroyed one another, producing an enormous amount of radiation that can still be observed today. Just about 100 millionths of the original amount of matter stuck around and no antimatter whatsoever. "Now, wait!" you might say, "Why did all the antimatter disappear and only matter was left?" It seems that we were somehow lucky that a tiny asymmetry exists between matter and antimatter. Otherwise, there would be no particles at all anywhere in the universe and also no human beings. But what causes this asymmetry? Experiments at CERN are trying to find out the reason why something exists and why we don't live in a universe filled with radiation only? But, so far, we just don't know the answer.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Big data is an elusive concept. It represents an amount of digital information, which is uncomfortable to store, transport, or analyze. Big data is so voluminous that it overwhelms the technologies of the day and challenges us to create the next generation of data storage tools and techniques. So, big data isn't new. In fact, physicists at CERN have been rangling with the challenge of their ever-expanding big data for decades. Fifty years ago, CERN's data could be stored in a single computer. OK, so it wasn't your usual computer, this was a mainframe computer that filled an entire building. To analyze the data, physicists from around the world traveled to CERN to connect to the enormous machine. In the 1970's, our ever-growing big data was distributed across different sets of computers, which mushroomed at CERN. Each set was joined together in dedicated, homegrown networks. But physicists collaborated without regard for the boundaries between sets, hence needed to access data on all of these. So, we bridged the independent networks together in our own CERNET. In the 1980's, islands of similar networks speaking different dialects sprung up all over Europe and the States, making remote access possible but torturous. To make it easy for our physicists across the world to access the ever-expanding big data stored at CERN without traveling, the networks needed to be talking with the same language. We adopted the fledgling internet working standard from the States, followed by the rest of Europe, and we established the principal link at CERN between Europe and the States in 1989, and the truly global internet took off! Physicists could easily then access the terabytes of big data remotely from around the world, generate results, and write papers in their home institutes. Then, they wanted to share their findings with all their colleagues. To make this information sharing easy, we created the web in the early 1990's. Physicists no longer needed to know where the information was stored in order to find it and access it on the web, an idea which caught on across the world and has transformed the way we communicate in our daily lives. During the early 2000's, the continued growth of our big data outstripped our capability to analyze it at CERN, despite having buildings full of computers. We had to start distributing the petabytes of data to our collaborating partners in order to employ local computing and storage at hundreds of different institutes. In order to orchestrate these interconnected resources with their diverse technologies, we developed a computing grid, enabling the seamless sharing of computing resources around the globe. This relies on trust relationships and mutual exchange. But this grid model could not be transferred out of our community so easily, where not everyone has resources to share nor could companies be expected to have the same level of trust. Instead, an alternative, more business-like approach for accessing on-demand resources has been flourishing recently, called cloud computing, which other communities are now exploiting to analyzing their big data. It might seem paradoxical for a place like CERN, a lab focused on the study of the unimaginably small building blocks of matter, to be the source of something as big as big data. But the way we study the fundamental particles, as well as the forces by which they interact, involves creating them fleetingly, colliding protons in our accelerators and capturing a trace of them as they zoom off near light speed. To see those traces, our detector, with 150 million sensors, acts like a really massive 3-D camera, taking a picture of each collision event - that's up to 14 millions times per second. That makes a lot of data. But if big data has been around for so long, why do we suddenly keep hearing about it now? Well, as the old metaphor explains, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and this is no longer just science that is exploiting this. The fact that we can derive more knowledge by joining related information together and spotting correlations can inform and enrich numerous aspects of everyday life, either in real time, such as traffic or financial conditions, in short-term evolutions, such as medical or meteorological, or in predictive situations, such as business, crime, or disease trends. Virtually every field is turning to gathering big data, with mobile sensor networks spanning the globe, cameras on the ground and in the air, archives storing information published on the web, and loggers capturing the activities of Internet citizens the world over.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the concept of data size, which is the focus of the ground truth MCQ.

The generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 6: Why did CERN start distributing petabytes of data to collaborating partners in the early 2000s? Options: A. To improve data storage, B. To reduce the cost of computing, C. To analyze big data more efficiently, D. Because the data was too large to be stored on a single computer

Although this question does not directly ask about comparing data sizes, it does mention "petabytes of data," which is a large unit of data measurement. However, the question intent and options do not align with the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar, but with a low confidence level due to the significant differences in question content and options.

Index: 6 (with low confidence)

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Big data is an elusive concept. It represents an amount of digital information, which is uncomfortable to store, transport, or analyze. Big data is so voluminous that it overwhelms the technologies of the day and challenges us to create the next generation of data storage tools and techniques. So, big data isn't new. In fact, physicists at CERN have been rangling with the challenge of their ever-expanding big data for decades. Fifty years ago, CERN's data could be stored in a single computer. OK, so it wasn't your usual computer, this was a mainframe computer that filled an entire building. To analyze the data, physicists from around the world traveled to CERN to connect to the enormous machine. In the 1970's, our ever-growing big data was distributed across different sets of computers, which mushroomed at CERN. Each set was joined together in dedicated, homegrown networks. But physicists collaborated without regard for the boundaries between sets, hence needed to access data on all of these. So, we bridged the independent networks together in our own CERNET. In the 1980's, islands of similar networks speaking different dialects sprung up all over Europe and the States, making remote access possible but torturous. To make it easy for our physicists across the world to access the ever-expanding big data stored at CERN without traveling, the networks needed to be talking with the same language. We adopted the fledgling internet working standard from the States, followed by the rest of Europe, and we established the principal link at CERN between Europe and the States in 1989, and the truly global internet took off! Physicists could easily then access the terabytes of big data remotely from around the world, generate results, and write papers in their home institutes. Then, they wanted to share their findings with all their colleagues. To make this information sharing easy, we created the web in the early 1990's. Physicists no longer needed to know where the information was stored in order to find it and access it on the web, an idea which caught on across the world and has transformed the way we communicate in our daily lives. During the early 2000's, the continued growth of our big data outstripped our capability to analyze it at CERN, despite having buildings full of computers. We had to start distributing the petabytes of data to our collaborating partners in order to employ local computing and storage at hundreds of different institutes. In order to orchestrate these interconnected resources with their diverse technologies, we developed a computing grid, enabling the seamless sharing of computing resources around the globe. This relies on trust relationships and mutual exchange. But this grid model could not be transferred out of our community so easily, where not everyone has resources to share nor could companies be expected to have the same level of trust. Instead, an alternative, more business-like approach for accessing on-demand resources has been flourishing recently, called cloud computing, which other communities are now exploiting to analyzing their big data. It might seem paradoxical for a place like CERN, a lab focused on the study of the unimaginably small building blocks of matter, to be the source of something as big as big data. But the way we study the fundamental particles, as well as the forces by which they interact, involves creating them fleetingly, colliding protons in our accelerators and capturing a trace of them as they zoom off near light speed. To see those traces, our detector, with 150 million sensors, acts like a really massive 3-D camera, taking a picture of each collision event - that's up to 14 millions times per second. That makes a lot of data. But if big data has been around for so long, why do we suddenly keep hearing about it now? Well, as the old metaphor explains, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and this is no longer just science that is exploiting this. The fact that we can derive more knowledge by joining related information together and spotting correlations can inform and enrich numerous aspects of everyday life, either in real time, such as traffic or financial conditions, in short-term evolutions, such as medical or meteorological, or in predictive situations, such as business, crime, or disease trends. Virtually every field is turning to gathering big data, with mobile sensor networks spanning the globe, cameras on the ground and in the air, archives storing information published on the web, and loggers capturing the activities of Internet citizens the world over. The challenge is on to invent new tools and techniques to mine these vast stores, to inform decision making, to improve medical diagnosis, and otherwise to answer needs and desires of tomorrow's society in ways that are unimagined today.

But physicists collaborated without regard for the boundaries between sets, hence needed to access data on all of these. So, we bridged the independent networks together in our own CERNET. In the 1980's, islands of similar networks speaking different dialects sprung up all over Europe and the States, making remote access possible but torturous. To make it easy for our physicists across the world to access the ever-expanding big data stored at CERN without traveling, the networks needed to be talking with the same language. We adopted the fledgling internet working standard from the States, followed by the rest of Europe, and we established the principal link at CERN between Europe and the States in 1989, and the truly global internet took off! Physicists could easily then access the terabytes of big data remotely from around the world, generate results, and write papers in their home institutes. Then, they wanted to share their findings with all their colleagues. To make this information sharing easy, we created the web in the early 1990's. Physicists no longer needed to know where the information was stored in order to find it and access it on the web, an idea which caught on across the world and has transformed the way we communicate in our daily lives. During the early 2000's, the continued growth of our big data outstripped our capability to analyze it at CERN, despite having buildings full of computers. We had to start distributing the petabytes of data to our collaborating partners in order to employ local computing and storage at hundreds of different institutes. In order to orchestrate these interconnected resources with their diverse technologies, we developed a computing grid, enabling the seamless sharing of computing resources around the globe. This relies on trust relationships and mutual exchange. But this grid model could not be transferred out of our community so easily, where not everyone has resources to share nor could companies be expected to have the same level of trust. Instead, an alternative, more business-like approach for accessing on-demand resources has been flourishing recently, called cloud computing, which other communities are now exploiting to analyzing their big data. It might seem paradoxical for a place like CERN, a lab focused on the study of the unimaginably small building blocks of matter, to be the source of something as big as big data. But the way we study the fundamental particles, as well as the forces by which they interact, involves creating them fleetingly, colliding protons in our accelerators and capturing a trace of them as they zoom off near light speed. To see those traces, our detector, with 150 million sensors, acts like a really massive 3-D camera, taking a picture of each collision event - that's up to 14 millions times per second. That makes a lot of data. But if big data has been around for so long, why do we suddenly keep hearing about it now? Well, as the old metaphor explains, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and this is no longer just science that is exploiting this. The fact that we can derive more knowledge by joining related information together and spotting correlations can inform and enrich numerous aspects of everyday life, either in real time, such as traffic or financial conditions, in short-term evolutions, such as medical or meteorological, or in predictive situations, such as business, crime, or disease trends. Virtually every field is turning to gathering big data, with mobile sensor networks spanning the globe, cameras on the ground and in the air, archives storing information published on the web, and loggers capturing the activities of Internet citizens the world over. The challenge is on to invent new tools and techniques to mine these vast stores, to inform decision making, to improve medical diagnosis, and otherwise to answer needs and desires of tomorrow's society in ways that are unimagined today.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Feathers are some of the most remarkable things ever made by an animal. They are gorgeous in their complexity, delicate in their construction, and yet strong enough to hold a bird thousands of feet in the air. Like all things in nature, feathers evolved over millions of years into their modern form. It could be hard to imagine how this could have happened. After all, what did the intermediate forms look like? What good is half a wing, festooned with half-feathers? Thanks to science, we now know that birds are living dinosaurs. You can see the kinship in their skeletons. Certain dinosaurs share some anatomical details with birds found in no other animals, such as wish bones. And in the late 1990s, paleontologists started digging up some compelling support for that idea: dinosaurs with bits of feathers still preserved on their bodies. Since then, scientists have found dozens of species of dinosaurs with remnants of feathers. Some were as small as pigeons, and some were the size of a school bus. If you look at how they are related on a family tree, the evolution of feathers doesn't seem quite so impossible. The most distant feathered relatives of birds had straight feathers that looked like wires. Then these wires split apart, producing simple branches. In many dinosaur lineages, these simple feathers evolved into more intricate ones, including some that we see today on birds. At the same time, the feathers spread across the bodies of dinosaurs, turning from sparse patches of fuzz into dense plumage, which even extended down to their legs. A few fossils even preserved some of the molecules that give feathers color. They reveal a beautiful range of colors: glossy, dark plumage, reminiscent of crows, alternating strips of black and white, or splashes of bright red. Some dinosaurs had high crests on their heads, and others had long, dramatic tail feathers. Now, none of these dinosaurs could use their feathers to fly - their arms were too short and the rest of their bodies were far too heavy. But, birds don't just use feathers to fly. A woodcock uses feathers to blend in perfectly with its forest backdrop. An ostrich stretches its wings over its nest to shade its young. A peacock displays its magnificent tail feathers to attract peahens. Feathers could have served these functions for dinosaurs too. Exactly how feathered dinosaurs took flight is still a bit of a mystery. But if a small-feathered dinosaur flapped its arms as it ran up an incline, its feathers would have provided extra lift to help it run faster. This accident of physics might have led to the evolution of longer dinosaur arms, which would let them run faster and even leap short distances through the air. Eventually, their arms stretched out into wings. Only then, perhaps 50 million years after the first wiry feathers evolved, did feathers lift those dinosaurs into the sky.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Feathers are some of the most remarkable things ever made by an animal. They are gorgeous in their complexity, delicate in their construction, and yet strong enough to hold a bird thousands of feet in the air. Like all things in nature, feathers evolved over millions of years into their modern form. It could be hard to imagine how this could have happened. After all, what did the intermediate forms look like? What good is half a wing, festooned with half-feathers? Thanks to science, we now know that birds are living dinosaurs. You can see the kinship in their skeletons. Certain dinosaurs share some anatomical details with birds found in no other animals, such as wish bones. And in the late 1990s, paleontologists started digging up some compelling support for that idea: dinosaurs with bits of feathers still preserved on their bodies. Since then, scientists have found dozens of species of dinosaurs with remnants of feathers. Some were as small as pigeons, and some were the size of a school bus. If you look at how they are related on a family tree, the evolution of feathers doesn't seem quite so impossible. The most distant feathered relatives of birds had straight feathers that looked like wires. Then these wires split apart, producing simple branches. In many dinosaur lineages, these simple feathers evolved into more intricate ones, including some that we see today on birds. At the same time, the feathers spread across the bodies of dinosaurs, turning from sparse patches of fuzz into dense plumage, which even extended down to their legs. A few fossils even preserved some of the molecules that give feathers color. They reveal a beautiful range of colors: glossy, dark plumage, reminiscent of crows, alternating strips of black and white, or splashes of bright red. Some dinosaurs had high crests on their heads, and others had long, dramatic tail feathers. Now, none of these dinosaurs could use their feathers to fly - their arms were too short and the rest of their bodies were far too heavy. But, birds don't just use feathers to fly. A woodcock uses feathers to blend in perfectly with its forest backdrop. An ostrich stretches its wings over its nest to shade its young. A peacock displays its magnificent tail feathers to attract peahens. Feathers could have served these functions for dinosaurs too. Exactly how feathered dinosaurs took flight is still a bit of a mystery. But if a small-feathered dinosaur flapped its arms as it ran up an incline, its feathers would have provided extra lift to help it run faster. This accident of physics might have led to the evolution of longer dinosaur arms, which would let them run faster and even leap short distances through the air. Eventually, their arms stretched out into wings. Only then, perhaps 50 million years after the first wiry feathers evolved, did feathers lift those dinosaurs into the sky.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Mysteries of Vernacular Tuxedo: men's evening wear for semi-formal occasions. Tuxedo, surprisingly, has its roots in Native American history. The Delaware Indians of what is now the Northeast United States, were divided into three subgroups, distinguished by their animal totems: the turkey, the turtle, and the wolf. Members of the tribe belonging to the wolf totem were often referred to by the indigenous word for the four-footed canine, p'tuksit. In the 18th century, Europeans who settled in the former region of the P'tuksit Anglicized the name as "tuxedo" and slapped it on a town in southeast New York. Decades later, in the late 1800s, a lavish resort was constructed and christened "The Tuxedo Club". It was at The Tuxedo Club, around the turn of the century, when a dress jacket was required for almost every occasion, that a brash young man, heir to an enormous tobacco fortune, caused a stir by flaunting tradition and donning a formal dinner jacket without tails. His bold fashion statement was quickly popularized and nicknamed tuxedo, which in modern America, is the headache of high school prom attendees across the nation.

Ladies and gentlemen, at TED
we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement. So let's watch a movement happen,
start to finish, in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it. First, of course you know, a leader needs the guts
to stand out and be ridiculed. What he's doing is so easy to follow. Here's his first follower
with a crucial role; he's going to show everyone
else how to follow. Now, notice that the leader
embraces him as an equal. Now it's not about the leader anymore; it's about them, plural. Now, there he is calling to his friends. Now, if you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated form
of leadership in itself. It takes guts to stand out like that. The first follower is what transforms
a lone nut into a leader. (Laughter) (Applause) And here comes a second follower. Now it's not a lone nut,
it's not two nuts -- three is a crowd, and a crowd is news. So a movement must be public. It's important to show
not just the leader, but the followers, because you find that new followers
emulate the followers, not the leader. Now, here come two more people,
and immediately after, three more people. Now we've got momentum.
This is the tipping point. Now we've got a movement. (Laughter) So, notice that, as more people join in, it's less risky. So those that were sitting
on the fence before now have no reason not to. They won't stand out,
they won't be ridiculed, but they will be part
of the in-crowd if they hurry. (Laughter) So, over the next minute, you'll see all of those that prefer
to stick with the crowd because eventually they would be
ridiculed for not joining in. And that's how you make a movement. But let's recap some lessons from this. So first, if you are the type, like the shirtless dancing guy
that is standing alone, remember the importance of nurturing
your first few followers as equals so it's clearly
about the movement, not you. (Laughter) Okay, but we might have missed
the real lesson here. The biggest lesson, if you noticed -- did you catch it? -- is that leadership is over-glorified. Yes, it was the shirtless guy
who was first, and he'll get all the credit, but it was really the first follower that transformed the lone nut
into a leader. So, as we're told
that we should all be leaders, that would be really ineffective. If you really care
about starting a movement, have the courage to follow
and show others how to follow. And when you find a lone nut
doing something great, have the guts to be the first one
to stand up and join in. And what a perfect place
to do that, at TED. Thanks. (Applause)

Since there is no direct match, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that comes closest to the topic. 

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is 7, but please note that this is not a perfect match.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that Question 4: What is the tipping point in a movement? mentions "when the movement becomes public and gains momentum" as an option. This option contains the word "public," which is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ.

Considering this new information, I believe that Question 4 is a better match for the ground truth MCQ, although it is still not a perfect match.

However, an even better match can be found in the fact that the transcript states "So a movement must be public" and this can be a standalone question.

Unfortunately, this standalone question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You believe that the Sun is much larger than the Earth, that the Earth is a roughly spherical planet that rotates on its axis every 24 hours and it revolves around the Sun once every 365 days. You believe that you were born on a particular date, that you were born to two human parents and that each of your human parents was born on an earlier date. You believe that other human beings have thoughts and feelings like you do and that you are not surrounded by humanoid robots. You believe all of these things and many more, not on the basis of direct observation, which can't, by itself, tell you very much about the relative size and motion of the Sun and the Earth, or about your own family history, or about what goes on in the minds of other humans. Instead, these beliefs are mostly based on what you've been told. Without spoken and written testimonies, human beings could not pass on knowledge from one person to another, let alone from one generation to another. We would know much, much less about the world around us. So learning about a topic by asking an expert on that topic, or appealing to authority, helps us gain knowledge, but, it doesn't always. Even the most highly respected authorities can turn out to be wrong. Occasionally this happens because a highly respected authority is dishonest and claims to know something that she or he really doesn't know. Sometimes it happens just because they make a mistake. They think they know when they don't know. For example, a number of respected economists did not expect the financial collapse of 2008. They turned out to be wrong. Maybe they were wrong because they were overlooking some important evidence. Maybe they were wrong because they were misinterpreting some of the evidence they had noticed. Or maybe they were wrong simply because they were reasoning carelessly from the total body of their evidence. But whatever the reason, they turned out to be wrong and many people who trusted their authority ended up losing lots of money, losing lots of other people's money, on account of that misplaced trust. So while appealing to authority can sometimes provide us with valuable knowledge, it also can sometimes be the cause of monumental errors. It's important to all of us to be able to distinguish those occasions on which we can safely and reasonably trust authority from those occasions on which we can't. But how do we do that? In order to do that, nothing is more useful than an authority's track record on a particular topic. If someone turns out to perform well in a given situation much of the time, then it's likely that he or she will continue to perform well in that same situation, at least in the near term. And this generalization holds true of the testimony of authorities as much as of anything else. If someone can consistently pick winners in both politics and baseball, then we should probably trust him or her to keep on picking winners in both politics or baseball, though maybe not in other things where his or her track record may be less stellar. If other forecasters have a poorer track record on those same two topics, then we shouldn't trust them as much. So whenever you're considering whether to trust the testimony of some authority, the first question to ask yourself is, "What's their track record on this topic?" And notice that you can apply the very same lesson to yourself. Your instincts tell you that you've just met Mr. Right, but what sort of track record do your instincts have on topics like this one? Have your instincts proven themselves to be worthy of your trust? Just as we judge other people's testimony by their track record, so, too, we can judge our own instincts by their track record. And this brings us one step closer to an objective view of ourselves and our relation to the world around us.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 5: Why is it useful to consider an authority's track record on a particular topic?**

Although the question itself does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the intent and content of the question are related to the idea of considering an authority's track record to make informed decisions. The correct option for Question 5 is not explicitly stated, but option C ("Because it helps us to predict their future performance") aligns with the idea presented in the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more similar question is not present among the generated MCQs. The question that would be most similar would be one that asks about the confidence in a prediction based on an authority's track record, which is not present.

If I had to choose the most similar question based on the options provided, I would choose **Question 5** as the most similar generated MCQ, with the understanding that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can identify a generated MCQ that shares some similarities with the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about making a prediction or inference based on given data (the ACY test scores and the percentage of students who graduate from university). The question requires the test-taker to analyze the data and determine the confidence level in Akiko's graduation from university.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 is the most similar in terms of question intent, which is about making a prediction or inference based on an authority's track record. However, the content and options are not directly related to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would select Question 5, but with a note that it's not a perfect match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 5

Please note that the generated MCQs seem to be more focused on the topics discussed in the transcript, such as the importance of considering an authority's track record, the potential pitfalls of appealing to authority, and the role of instincts in decision-making. The ground truth MCQ, on the other hand, appears to be a more abstract reasoning question that requires analysis of data and prediction-making.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4: What is the most useful thing to consider when deciding whether to trust the testimony of an authority?**

Although this question does not directly ask about confidence in an expert's prediction, it is related to the concept of evaluating an authority's reliability, which is the core idea of the ground truth MCQ. The correct option, "Their track record on a particular topic," is also relevant to the ground truth MCQ, which mentions Njeri's track record of predicting asteroid contact.

However, a more similar question is:

**Question 5: Why is it useful to consider an authority's track record on a particular topic?**

This question is more similar in intent and content to the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the usefulness of considering an authority's track record, which is directly related to the idea of evaluating Njeri's prediction based on her past performance.

But the most similar question is:

**Question 7: What is the importance of considering an authority's track record when deciding whether to trust their testimony?**

 Options: A. It helps us to gain knowledge and make the right decisions, B. It helps us to avoid making mistakes and losing money, C. It helps us to understand the authority's qualifications and our own biases and opinions, D. All of the above 

This question is the most similar in intent, options and content to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options.

If I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 7** is the most similar generated MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You believe that the Sun is much larger than the Earth, that the Earth is a roughly spherical planet that rotates on its axis every 24 hours and it revolves around the Sun once every 365 days. You believe that you were born on a particular date, that you were born to two human parents and that each of your human parents was born on an earlier date. You believe that other human beings have thoughts and feelings like you do and that you are not surrounded by humanoid robots. You believe all of these things and many more, not on the basis of direct observation, which can't, by itself, tell you very much about the relative size and motion of the Sun and the Earth, or about your own family history, or about what goes on in the minds of other humans. Instead, these beliefs are mostly based on what you've been told. Without spoken and written testimonies, human beings could not pass on knowledge from one person to another, let alone from one generation to another. We would know much, much less about the world around us. So learning about a topic by asking an expert on that topic, or appealing to authority, helps us gain knowledge, but, it doesn't always. Even the most highly respected authorities can turn out to be wrong. Occasionally this happens because a highly respected authority is dishonest and claims to know something that she or he really doesn't know. Sometimes it happens just because they make a mistake. They think they know when they don't know. For example, a number of respected economists did not expect the financial collapse of 2008. They turned out to be wrong. Maybe they were wrong because they were overlooking some important evidence. Maybe they were wrong because they were misinterpreting some of the evidence they had noticed. Or maybe they were wrong simply because they were reasoning carelessly from the total body of their evidence. But whatever the reason, they turned out to be wrong and many people who trusted their authority ended up losing lots of money, losing lots of other people's money, on account of that misplaced trust. So while appealing to authority can sometimes provide us with valuable knowledge, it also can sometimes be the cause of monumental errors. It's important to all of us to be able to distinguish those occasions on which we can safely and reasonably trust authority from those occasions on which we can't. But how do we do that? In order to do that, nothing is more useful than an authority's track record on a particular topic. If someone turns out to perform well in a given situation much of the time, then it's likely that he or she will continue to perform well in that same situation, at least in the near term. And this generalization holds true of the testimony of authorities as much as of anything else. If someone can consistently pick winners in both politics and baseball, then we should probably trust him or her to keep on picking winners in both politics or baseball, though maybe not in other things where his or her track record may be less stellar. If other forecasters have a poorer track record on those same two topics, then we shouldn't trust them as much. So whenever you're considering whether to trust the testimony of some authority, the first question to ask yourself is, "What's their track record on this topic?" And notice that you can apply the very same lesson to yourself. Your instincts tell you that you've just met Mr. Right, but what sort of track record do your instincts have on topics like this one? Have your instincts proven themselves to be worthy of your trust? Just as we judge other people's testimony by their track record, so, too, we can judge our own instincts by their track record. And this brings us one step closer to an objective view of ourselves and our relation to the world around us.

**Transcript**:
in 2002 a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane the wright brothers in the beginning of the last century had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly they also had taken out numerous patterns on essential parts of the airplane they were not the only ones that was common practice in the industry and those who held patents on airplanes were defending them fiercely and suing competitors left and right this actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry and this was at the time that in particular the u.s government was interested in ramping up the production of military airplanes so there was a bit of a conflict there the u.s government decided to take action and force those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of of airplanes so what is this got to do with this in 2002 nelson obama a kenyan social scientist discovered he had hiv and needed access to treatment he was told that a cure did not exist aids he heard was lethal and treatment was not offered this was at the time that treatment actually existed in rich countries aids had become a chronic disease people in our countries here in europe in north america were living with hiv healthy lives not so for nelson he wasn't rich enough and not so for his three-year-old son he discovered a year later also had hiv nelson decided to become a treatment activist and join up with other groups in 2002 they were facing a different battle prices for arvs the drugs needed to treat hiv cost about 12 000 per patient per year the patents on those drugs were held by a number of western pharmaceutical companies that were not necessarily willing to make those patents available when you have a patent you can exclude anyone else from making um from from producing or making low-cost versions for example available of those of those medications clearly this led to patent wars breaking out all over the globe luckily those patents did not exist everywhere there were countries that did not recognize pharmaceutical product patterns such as india and indian pharmaceutical companies started to produce so-called generic versions low-cost copies of antiretroviral medicines and make them develop available in the developing world and within a year the price had come down from ten thousand dollars per patient per year to three hundred and fifty dollars per patient per year and today that same triple pill cocktail is available for 60 dollars per patient per year and of course that started to have an enormous effect on the number of people who could afford access to those medicines treatment programs became possible funding became available and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly today eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs 34 million are infected with hiv never has this number been so high but actually this is good news because what it means is people stop dying people who have access to these drugs stop dying and there's something else they also stop passing on the virus this is fairly recent science that has shown that what that means is we have the tools to break the back of this epidemic so what's the problem well things have changed first of all the rules have changed today all countries are obliged to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years this is as a result of the intellectual property rules of the world trade organization so what india did is no longer possible second the practice of patent holding companies have changed here you see the patent practices before the world trade organization's rules before 95 for antiretroviral drugs this is what you see today and this is in developing countries so what that means is unless we do something deliberate and unless we do something now we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis because new drugs are developed new drugs go to market but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries so unless we act unless we do something today we will soon be faced what some have termed the treatment time bomb it isn't only the number of drugs that are patented there's something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away this shows you a patent landscape this is the landscape of one medicine so you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available you will probably choose to do something else again deliberate action is needed so surely if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes we should be able to do something similar to tackle the hiv aids epidemic and we did in 2010 unitate established the medicines patent pool for hiv and this is how it works patent holders inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions but make those patents available to the medicines patent pool the medicines patent pool then license those out whoever need access to those patents that can be generic manufacturers it can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies for example those manufacturers can then sell those medicines at much lower costs to people who need access to them to treatment programs that need access to them they pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property there is one key difference with the airplane patent pool the medicines patent pool is a voluntary mechanism the airplane patent holders were not left a choice whether they licensed their patents or not they were forced to do so that is something that the medicines patent pool cannot do it relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and make them available for others for others to use today nelson odoma is healthy he has access to antiretroviral drugs his son will soon be 14 years old nelson is a member of the expert advisory group of the medicines patent pool and he told me not so long ago ellen we rely in kenya and in many other countries on the medicines patent pool to make sure that new medicines also become available to us that new medicines without delay become available to us and this is no longer fantasy already um i'll give you an example in august of this year the united states drug agency approved a new four-in-one aids medication the company gilead that holds the patents has licensed licensed the intellectual property to the medicine's patent pool the pool is already working today two months later with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product can go to market at low cost where and when it is needed this is unprecedented this has never been done before the rule is about a 10-year delay for a new product to go to market in developing countries if at all this has never been seen before nelson's expectations are very high and quite rightly so he and his son will need access to the next generation anti-retrovirals and the next throughout their lifetime so that he and many others in kenya and other countries can continue to live healthy active lives now we count on the willingness of drug companies to make that happen we count on those companies that understand that it is in the interest not only in interest of the global good but also in their own interest to move from conflict to collaboration and through the medicines patent pool they can make that happen they can also choose not to do that but they those that go down that road may end up in a similar situation the wright brothers ended up with early last century facing forcible measures by government so they better jump now thank you you

**Transcript**:
in 2002 a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane the wright brothers in the beginning of the last century had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly they also had taken out numerous patterns on essential parts of the airplane they were not the only ones that was common practice in the industry and those who held patents on airplanes were defending them fiercely and suing competitors left and right this actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry and this was at the time that in particular the u.s government was interested in ramping up the production of military airplanes so there was a bit of a conflict there the u.s government decided to take action and force those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of of airplanes so what is this got to do with this in 2002 nelson obama a kenyan social scientist discovered he had hiv and needed access to treatment he was told that a cure did not exist aids he heard was lethal and treatment was not offered this was at the time that treatment actually existed in rich countries aids had become a chronic disease people in our countries here in europe in north america were living with hiv healthy lives not so for nelson he wasn't rich enough and not so for his three-year-old son he discovered a year later also had hiv nelson decided to become a treatment activist and join up with other groups in 2002 they were facing a different battle prices for arvs the drugs needed to treat hiv cost about 12 000 per patient per year the patents on those drugs were held by a number of western pharmaceutical companies that were not necessarily willing to make those patents available when you have a patent you can exclude anyone else from making um from from producing or making low-cost versions for example available of those of those medications clearly this led to patent wars breaking out all over the globe luckily those patents did not exist everywhere there were countries that did not recognize pharmaceutical product patterns such as india and indian pharmaceutical companies started to produce so-called generic versions low-cost copies of antiretroviral medicines and make them develop available in the developing world and within a year the price had come down from ten thousand dollars per patient per year to three hundred and fifty dollars per patient per year and today that same triple pill cocktail is available for 60 dollars per patient per year and of course that started to have an enormous effect on the number of people who could afford access to those medicines treatment programs became possible funding became available and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly today eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs 34 million are infected with hiv never has this number been so high but actually this is good news because what it means is people stop dying people who have access to these drugs stop dying and there's something else they also stop passing on the virus this is fairly recent science that has shown that what that means is we have the tools to break the back of this epidemic so what's the problem well things have changed first of all the rules have changed today all countries are obliged to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years this is as a result of the intellectual property rules of the world trade organization so what india did is no longer possible second the practice of patent holding companies have changed here you see the patent practices before the world trade organization's rules before 95 for antiretroviral drugs this is what you see today and this is in developing countries so what that means is unless we do something deliberate and unless we do something now we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis because new drugs are developed new drugs go to market but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries so unless we act unless we do something today we will soon be faced what some have termed the treatment time bomb it isn't only the number of drugs that are patented there's something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away this shows you a patent landscape this is the landscape of one medicine so you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available you will probably choose to do something else again deliberate action is needed so surely if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes we should be able to do something similar to tackle the hiv aids epidemic and we did in 2010 unitate established the medicines patent pool for hiv and this is how it works patent holders inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions but make those patents available to the medicines patent pool the medicines patent pool then license those out whoever need access to those patents that can be generic manufacturers it can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies for example those manufacturers can then sell those medicines at much lower costs to people who need access to them to treatment programs that need access to them they pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property there is one key difference with the airplane patent pool the medicines patent pool is a voluntary mechanism the airplane patent holders were not left a choice whether they licensed their patents or not they were forced to do so that is something that the medicines patent pool cannot do it relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and make them available for others for others to use today nelson odoma is healthy he has access to antiretroviral drugs his son will soon be 14 years old nelson is a member of the expert advisory group of the medicines patent pool and he told me not so long ago ellen we rely in kenya and in many other countries on the medicines patent pool to make sure that new medicines also become available to us that new medicines without delay become available to us and this is no longer fantasy already um i'll give you an example in august of this year the united states drug agency approved a new four-in-one aids medication the company gilead that holds the patents has licensed licensed the intellectual property to the medicine's patent pool the pool is already working today two months later with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product can go to market at low cost where and when it is needed this is unprecedented this has never been done before the rule is about a 10-year delay for a new product to go to market in developing countries if at all this has never been seen before nelson's expectations are very high and quite rightly so he and his son will need access to the next generation anti-retrovirals and the next throughout their lifetime so that he and many others in kenya and other countries can continue to live healthy active lives now we count on the willingness of drug companies to make that happen we count on those companies that understand that it is in the interest not only in interest of the global good but also in their own interest to move from conflict to collaboration and through the medicines patent pool they can make that happen they can also choose not to do that but they those that go down that road may end up in a similar situation the wright brothers ended up with early last century facing forcible measures by government so they better jump now thank you you

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is related to the topic of patent holders and the Medicines Patent Pool.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 5, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not cover the specific topic of how patent holders are paid for their work in the Medicines Patent Pool.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic, I would suggest Question 8, but it is not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that specifically cover the topic of how patent holders are paid for their work in the Medicines Patent Pool.

However, if I had to provide an index, I would say that there is no good match, but if I had to choose, I would say:

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 8: What is the main goal of the medicines patent pool?**
Options: A. To increase the prices of antiretroviral medicines, B. To decrease the production of antiretroviral medicines, C. To make antiretroviral medicines available at low cost to people in need, D. To promote the development of new antiretroviral medicines

Although the question is not an exact match, the intent and content of the options are similar to the ground truth MCQ. The correct option (C) implies that the medicines patent pool enables access to medications at low cost, which is related to options A, B, and C in the ground truth MCQ.

However, an even better match is:

**Question 4: What was the result of the establishment of the medicines patent pool in 2010?**
Options: A. The prices of antiretroviral medicines increased, B. The production of antiretroviral medicines decreased, C. The prices of antiretroviral medicines decreased, and the production increased, D. The medicines patent pool was not effective in reducing the prices of antiretroviral medicines

This question is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of the content and intent of the options. The correct option (C) implies that the medicines patent pool lowers the prices of medication and enables access to them, which is related to options A, B, and C in the ground truth MCQ.

But the best match is:

None of the above questions exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 4** is the most similar.

Wait, there is another question that was not considered:

**Question 5 and Question 6 and Question 7 and Question 9 and Question 10** do not match at all.

However, **Question 3** does not match, but **Question 1 and Question 2** provide some useful information that can help us create another question that is more similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Let's create another question using the information from **Question 1 and Question 2**:

**Generated Question 11**: The Medicines Patent Pool does which of the following?
Options: A. Lowers the prices of medication by allowing generic manufacturers to produce them, B. Shortens the time to make medications available by allowing generic manufacturers to produce them before the patent expires, C. Enables developing countries to access new medications by providing licenses to generic manufacturers, D. All of the above

This generated question is more similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, since it was not part of the original list, I will choose the most similar question from the original list.

The most similar question from the original list is:

**Question 4: What was the result of the establishment of the medicines patent pool in 2010?**

However, another question is even more similar:

**Question 8: What is the main goal of the medicines patent pool?**

But an even more similar question is not available. 

Considering all of the above and using the original list of questions, I conclude that:

The most similar generated MCQ is **Question 8** or **Question 4**.

However, between **Question 8** and **Question 4**, I believe that **Question 8** is less similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore,

The final answer is: **4**

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] America's public energy conversation boils down to this question would you rather die of a oil Wars or be climate change or see nuclear holocaust or D all of the above oh I missed one or e none of the above that's the one we're not normally offered what if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing could we have fuel without fear could we reinvent fire you see fire made us human fossil fuels made us modern but now we need a new fire that makes us safe secure healthy and durable let's see how four-fifths of the world's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo those fossil fuels have built our civilization they've created our wealth they've enriched the lives of billions but they also have rising costs to our security economy health and environment that are starting to erode if not outweigh their benefits so we need a new fire and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity each of which puts two fifths of the fossil carbon in the air but they're really quite distinct less than 1% of our electricity is made from oil although almost half is made from coal their uses are quite concentrated three-fourths of our oil fuels transportation three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings and the rest of both runs factories so very efficient vehicles buildings and factories save oil and cold and also natural gas that can displace both of them but today's energy system is not just inefficient it is also in disconnected aging dirty and insecure so it needs refurbishment by 2050 though it could become efficient connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos factories and buildings all relying on a modern secure and resilient electricity system we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply this could cost by 2050 five trillion dollars less in net present value that is expressed as a lump sum today then business as usual assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero a conservatively low estimate yet this cheaper energy system could support a hundred fifty eight percent bigger u.s. economy all without needing oil or coal or for that matter nuclear energy moreover this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of Congress and no new federal taxes mandate subsidies or laws and running Washington gridlock let me say that again I'm going to tell you how to get the United States completely off oil and coal five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of Congress led by business for profit in other words we're going to use our most effective institutions private enterprise Co evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions and whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security or environmental stewardship and climate protection and Public Health reinventing fire makes sense and makes money General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies so in reinventing fire we integrated all four sectors that use energy transportation buildings industry and electricity and we integrated four kinds of innovation not just technology and policy but also design and business strategy those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles so let's start by making autos oil free two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight and every unit of energy you save at the wheels by taking out weight or drag saves seven units at the tank is you don't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels unfortunately over the past quarter century epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have but today ultra light ultra strong materials like carbon fiber composites can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them so their engines get smaller indeed that sort of vehicle Fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper so sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today while the driving cost even from the start is very much lower so these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of Victorian engine and steel stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reinforce each other namely ultralight materials making them into structures and electric propulsion the sails can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary fee baits that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on in one's and just in the first two years the biggest of Europe's five feeb eight programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers of course computers and electronics are now America's biggest industry while typewriter makers have vanished so vehicle Fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years but then also make electrification affordable and that displaces the rest of the oil America could lead this next automotive revolution currently the leader is Germany last year Volkswagen announced that by next year they'll be producing this carbon-fiber plug-in hybrid getting 230 miles a gallon also last year BMW announced this carbon-fiber electric car they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries and they said we do not intend to be a typewriter maker out he claimed it's going to beat them both by year seven years ago and even faster and cheaper American manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part which doubles as a carbon cap in one minute and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is don't worry about dropping it it's tougher than titanium Tom Friedman actually who acted as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it but such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance they can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos they can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound to steel if we made our autos this way it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half Saudi Arabia's or half an OPEC by drilling in the Detroit formation a very perspective play and all those Detroit cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel they are all American carbon free and inexhaustible the same physics in the same business logic also applied to big vehicles in the five years ending at 2010 Walmart saved 60% of the fuel per ton-mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds and combined with triple to quintupled efficiency airplanes now on the drawing board can save close to a trillion dollars also today's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military R&D has given us the Internet the global positioning system and the jet engine and microchip industries as we design and build vehicles better we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving instead of just seeing the the travel grow we can use innovative pricing charging for road infrastructure by the mile not by the gallon we can use some smart IT to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride-sharing we can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be so they don't need to go somewhere else and we can use smart IT to make traffic free-flowing together those things can give us the same or better access with 46 to 84 percent less driving saving another point four trillion dollars plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively so forty years hence when you add it all up a far more mobile US economy can use no oil saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks rather than buying them for over 100 adds up to a four trillion dollar net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero so to get mobility without oil to phase out the oil we can get efficient and then switch fuel those hundred and twenty-five to 240 mile per gallon equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells electricity and advanced biofuels the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels the trucks could even use natural gas but no vehicles will need oil and the most biofuel we might need just three million barrels a day can be made 2/3 from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call institutional acupuncture we figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly we stick little needles in it to get it flowing working with partners like Ford and Walmart the Pentagon and the long transition is already well underway in fact three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil not in supply but in demand and Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peek around 2016 in other words oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices but the electrified vehicles don't need to burden the electricity grid rather when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that helped the grid integrate varying solar solar and wind power so the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately and they also converge the oil story with our second big story saving electricity and then making it differently and those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound two diverse disruptions than any other sector because we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on with 20th and 19th century institutions rules and cultures changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving keep improving faster than we're installing them so the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper but as efficiency in buildings in industry starts to grow faster than the economy America's electricity use could actually shrink even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos and we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends over the next 40 years buildings which use 3/4 of the electricity can triple or quadruple their energy productivity saving 1.4 trillion dollars net present value with a 33 percent internal rate of return or in English the savings are worth four times what they cost an industry can accelerate to doubling its energy productivity with a 21 percent internal rate of return Nakia is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings that is it can give you expanding returns not diminishing returns that is how our 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on-site into Super Windows that pass light but reflect heat plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third and then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved seventeen million dollars of capital cost which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry dowas billion dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars but industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars of energy still to save for example three fifths of the world's electricity runs motors half of that runs pumps and fans and those can all be made more efficient and the motors that turned them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating 35 improvements paying back in about a year but first we ought to be capturing bigger cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the text books for example pumps the biggest use of motors move liquid through pipes but a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy not by getting better pumps but just by replacing long thin crooked pipes with fat short straight pipes this is not about new technology at just our rearranging our metal furniture of course it also shrinks the pumping equipment at its capital costs so what does such savings mean for the electricity that is 3/5 used in motors well from the coal burns at the power plant through all these compounding losses only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe is float but now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost pollution and 100 levels cause global weirding back at the power plant and of course as you go back upstream the components get smaller and therefore cheaper our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries typically our retrofit design and save about 30 to 60% of the energy and payback in a few years while the new facility design save 40 to 90 odd percent with generally lower capital cost now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity chiefly renewables China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost in fact these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart and Germany now has more solar workers than America has Steelworkers already in about 20 states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cell phone bypass your wireline phone company and the sort of thing gives utility executives the heebie-jeebies and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams in renewables are no longer a fringe activity for each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable mainly lately in developing countries in 2010 renewables other than big hydro particularly wind and solar cells got a hundred and fifty 1 billion dollars of private investment and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding sixty billion watts in that one year that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year in contrast the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity in the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk in fact in this country no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital despite seven years of hundred plus percent subsidies so how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants well efficiency and gas can displace them all at below just their operating costs and combined with renewables can displace them more than 23 times and less than their replacement cost but we only need to replace them once we're often told though that only : nuclear plants can keep the lights on because they're 24/7 whereas wind and solar power are variable and hence supposedly unreliable actually no generator is 24/7 they all break and when a big plant goes down you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds often for weeks or months often without warning that is exactly why we've designed the grid to backup failed plants with working plants and in exactly the same way the grid can handle window wind and solar powers for castable variations our early simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they're forecasted integrated and diversified by both type and location and that's true both for continental areas like the US or Europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid that is how for example for German States in 2010 were 43 to 52 percent when powered Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered Denmark 36 and it's how all of Europe can shift to renewable electricity in America are aging dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050 and whatever we replace it with it's got to cost about the same about six trillion dollars net present value whether we buy more of what we've got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal or renewables that are or or less centralized but those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks around national security fuel water finance technology climate and health for example our over centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or terrorist attack but that blackout risk disappears and all of the other risks are best managed with distributed renewables organized into local micro grids that normally interconnect but can stand alone at need that is they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly that approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting for its own power supply they think they need that how about the rest of us that they're defending we want our stuff to work too and at about the same cost as business-as-usual this would maximize national security customer choice entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation together efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector traditionally utilities built a lot of giant : nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables and those utilities were rewarded as they still are in 34 states for selling you more electricity however especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency demand response cogeneration renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage so our energy future is not fate but choice and that choice is very flexible in 1976 for example government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP could never go down and I heretic Lee suggested it could go down several fold well that's what's actually happened so far it's fallen by half but with today's much better technologies more mature delivery channels and integrative design we can do far more and even cheaper so to solve the energy problem we just needed to enlarge it and the results may at first seem incredible but you know as Marshall McLuhan said only puny secrets need protection big discoveries are protected by public incredulity now combine the electricity in oil revolutions both driven by modern efficiency and you get the really big story reinventing fire we're business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050 saving 5 trillion dollars growing the economy 2.6 fold strengthening our national security oh and by the way by getting rid of the oil and coal reducing the fossil carbon emissions 82 to 86 percent now if you like any of those outcomes you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important so focusing on outcomes not motives can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge this also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges climate change nuclear proliferation energy insecurity energy poverty all of which I'll make us less safe now our team at our my help smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives with some more hatching of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there to former oilman Maurice strong said not all the fossils are in the fuel but as Edgar Willard who used to chair DuPont reminds us in companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem because he said they simply won't be around long term I've described not just a once in a civilization business opportunity but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species we humans are inventing a new fire not dug from below but flowing from above not scarce but bountiful not local but everywhere not transient but permanent not costly but free and but for a little transitional tale of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure this new fire is flameless efficiently used it really can do our work without working our undoing each of you owns a piece of that five trillion dollar prize and our new book reinventing fire describes how you can capture it so with the conversation just begun at reinventing fire calm let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other and with everyone around you to help make the world richer fairer cooler and safer by together reinventing fire thank you [Applause]

energy moreover this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of Congress and no new federal taxes mandate subsidies or laws and running Washington gridlock let me say that again I'm going to tell you how to get the United States completely off oil and coal five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of Congress led by business for profit in other words we're going to use our most effective institutions private enterprise Co evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions and whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security or environmental stewardship and climate protection and Public Health reinventing fire makes sense and makes money General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies so in reinventing fire we integrated all four sectors that use energy transportation buildings industry and electricity and we integrated four kinds of innovation not just technology and policy but also design and business strategy those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles so let's start by making autos oil free two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight and every unit of energy you save at the wheels by taking out weight or drag saves seven units at the tank is you don't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels unfortunately over the past quarter century epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have but today ultra light ultra strong materials like carbon fiber composites can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them so their engines get smaller indeed that sort of vehicle Fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper so sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today while the driving cost even from the start is very much lower so these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of Victorian engine and steel stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reinforce each other namely ultralight materials making them into structures and electric propulsion the sails can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary fee baits that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on in one's and just in the first two years the biggest of Europe's five feeb eight programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers of course computers and electronics are now America's biggest industry while typewriter makers have vanished so vehicle Fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years but then also make electrification affordable and that displaces the rest of the oil America could lead this next automotive revolution currently the leader is Germany last year Volkswagen announced that by next year they'll be producing this carbon-fiber plug-in hybrid getting 230 miles a gallon also last year BMW announced this carbon-fiber electric car they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries and they said we do not intend to be a typewriter maker out he claimed it's going to beat them both by year seven years ago and even faster and cheaper American manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part which doubles as a carbon cap in one minute and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is don't worry about dropping it it's tougher than titanium Tom Friedman actually who acted as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it but such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance they can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos they can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound to steel if we made our autos this way it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half Saudi Arabia's or half an OPEC by drilling in the Detroit formation a very perspective play and all those Detroit cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel they are all American carbon free and inexhaustible the same physics in the same business logic also applied to big vehicles in the five years ending at 2010 Walmart saved 60% of the fuel per ton-mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds and combined with triple to quintupled efficiency airplanes now on the drawing board can save close to a trillion dollars also today's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military R&D has given us the Internet the global positioning system and the jet engine and microchip industries as we design and build vehicles better we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving instead of just seeing the the travel grow we can use innovative pricing charging for road infrastructure by the mile not by the gallon we can use some smart IT to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride-sharing we can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be so they don't need to go somewhere else and we can use smart IT to make traffic free-flowing together those things can give us the same or better access with 46 to 84 percent less driving saving another point four trillion dollars plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively so forty years hence when you add it all up a far more mobile US economy can use no oil saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks rather than buying them for over 100 adds up to a four trillion dollar net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero so to get mobility without oil to phase out the oil we can get efficient and then switch fuel those hundred and twenty-five to 240 mile per gallon equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells electricity and advanced biofuels the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels the trucks could even use natural gas but no vehicles will need oil and the most biofuel we might need just three million barrels a day can be made 2/3 from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call institutional acupuncture we figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly we stick little needles in it to get it flowing working with partners like Ford and Walmart the Pentagon and the long transition is already well underway in fact three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil not in supply but in demand and Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peek around 2016 in other words oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices but the electrified vehicles don't need to burden the electricity grid rather when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that helped the grid integrate varying solar solar and wind power so the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately and they also converge the oil story with our second big story saving electricity and then making it differently and those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound two diverse disruptions than any other sector because we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on with 20th and 19th century institutions rules and cultures changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving keep improving faster than we're installing them so the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper but as efficiency in buildings in industry starts to grow faster than the economy America's electricity use could actually shrink even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos and we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends over the next 40 years buildings which use 3/4 of the electricity can triple or quadruple their energy productivity saving 1.4 trillion dollars net present value with a 33 percent internal rate of return or in English the savings are worth four times what they cost an industry can accelerate to doubling its energy productivity with a 21 percent internal rate of return Nakia is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings that is it can give you expanding returns not diminishing returns that is how our 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on-site into Super Windows that pass light but reflect heat plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third and then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved seventeen million dollars of capital cost which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry dowas billion dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars but industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars of energy still to save for example three fifths of the world's electricity runs motors half of that runs pumps and fans and those can all be made more efficient and the motors that turned them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating 35 improvements paying back in about a year but first we ought to be capturing bigger cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the text books for example pumps the biggest use of motors move liquid through pipes but a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy not by getting better pumps but just by replacing long thin crooked pipes with fat short straight pipes this is not about new technology at just our rearranging our metal furniture of course it also shrinks the pumping equipment at its capital costs so what does such savings mean for the electricity that is 3/5 used in motors well from the coal burns at the power plant through all these compounding losses only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe is float but now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost pollution and 100 levels cause global weirding back at the power plant and of course as you go back upstream the components get smaller and therefore cheaper our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries typically our retrofit design and save about 30 to 60% of the energy and payback in a few years while the new facility design save 40 to 90 odd percent with generally lower capital cost now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity chiefly renewables China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost in fact these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart and Germany now has more solar workers than America has Steelworkers already in about 20 states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cell phone bypass your wireline phone company and the sort of thing gives utility executives the heebie-jeebies and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams in renewables are no longer a fringe activity for each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable mainly lately in developing countries in 2010 renewables other than big hydro particularly wind and solar cells got a hundred and fifty 1 billion dollars of private investment and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding sixty billion watts in that one year that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year in contrast the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity in the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk in fact in this country no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital despite seven years of hundred plus percent subsidies so how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants well efficiency and gas can displace them all at below just their operating costs and combined with renewables can displace them more than 23 times and less than their replacement cost but we only need to replace them once we're often told though that only : nuclear plants can keep the lights on because they're 24/7 whereas wind and solar power are variable and hence supposedly unreliable actually no generator is 24/7 they all break and when a big plant goes down you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds often for weeks or months often without warning that is exactly why we've designed the grid to backup failed plants with working plants and in exactly the same way the grid can handle window wind and solar powers for castable variations our early simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they're forecasted integrated and diversified by both type and location and that's true both for continental areas like the US or Europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid that is how for example for German States in 2010 were 43 to 52 percent when powered Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered Denmark 36 and it's how all of Europe can shift to renewable electricity in America are aging dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050 and whatever we replace it with it's got to cost about the same about six trillion dollars net present value whether we buy more of what we've got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal or renewables that are or or less centralized but those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks around national security fuel water finance technology climate and health for example our over centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or terrorist attack but that blackout risk disappears and all of the other risks are best managed with distributed renewables organized into local micro grids that normally interconnect but can stand alone at need that is they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly that approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting for its own power supply they think they need that how about the rest of us that they're defending we want our stuff to work too and at about the same cost as business-as-usual this would maximize national security customer choice entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation together efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector traditionally utilities built a lot of giant : nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables and those utilities were rewarded as they still are in 34 states for selling you more electricity however especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency demand response cogeneration renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage so our energy future is not fate but choice and that choice is very flexible in 1976 for example government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP could never go down and I heretic Lee suggested it could go down several fold well that's what's actually happened so far it's fallen by half but with today's much better technologies more mature delivery channels and integrative design we can do far more and even cheaper so to solve the energy problem we just needed to enlarge it and the results may at first seem incredible but you know as Marshall McLuhan said only puny secrets need protection big discoveries are protected by public incredulity now combine the electricity in oil revolutions both driven by modern efficiency and you get the really big story reinventing fire we're business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050 saving 5 trillion dollars growing the economy 2.6 fold strengthening our national security oh and by the way by getting rid of the oil and coal reducing the fossil carbon emissions 82 to 86 percent now if you like any of those outcomes you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important so focusing on outcomes not motives can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge this also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges climate change nuclear proliferation energy insecurity energy poverty all of which I'll make us less safe now our team at our my help smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives with some more hatching of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there to former oilman Maurice strong said not all the fossils are in the fuel but as Edgar Willard who used to chair DuPont reminds us in companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem because he said they simply won't be around long term I've described not just a once in a civilization business opportunity but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species we humans are inventing a new fire not dug from below but flowing from above not scarce but bountiful not local but everywhere not transient but permanent not costly but free and but for a little transitional tale of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure this new fire is flameless efficiently used it really can do our work without working our undoing each of you owns a piece of that five trillion dollar prize and our new book reinventing fire describes how you can capture it so with the conversation just begun at reinventing fire calm let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other and with everyone around you to help make the world richer fairer cooler and safer by together reinventing fire thank you [Applause]

[Music] [Applause] America's public energy conversation boils down to this question would you rather die of a oil Wars or be climate change or see nuclear holocaust or D all of the above oh I missed one or e none of the above that's the one we're not normally offered what if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing could we have fuel without fear could we reinvent fire you see fire made us human fossil fuels made us modern but now we need a new fire that makes us safe secure healthy and durable let's see how four-fifths of the world's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo those fossil fuels have built our civilization they've created our wealth they've enriched the lives of billions but they also have rising costs to our security economy health and environment that are starting to erode if not outweigh their benefits so we need a new fire and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity each of which puts two fifths of the fossil carbon in the air but they're really quite distinct less than 1% of our electricity is made from oil although almost half is made from coal their uses are quite concentrated three-fourths of our oil fuels transportation three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings and the rest of both runs factories so very efficient vehicles buildings and factories save oil and cold and also natural gas that can displace both of them but today's energy system is not just inefficient it is also in disconnected aging dirty and insecure so it needs refurbishment by 2050 though it could become efficient connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos factories and buildings all relying on a modern secure and resilient electricity system we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply this could cost by 2050 five trillion dollars less in net present value that is expressed as a lump sum today then business as usual assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero a conservatively low estimate yet this cheaper energy system could support a hundred fifty eight percent bigger u.s. economy all without needing oil or coal or for that matter nuclear energy moreover this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of Congress and no new federal taxes mandate subsidies or laws and running Washington gridlock let me say that again I'm going to tell you how to get the United States completely off oil and coal five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of Congress led by business for profit in other words we're going to use our most effective institutions private enterprise Co evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions and whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security or environmental stewardship and climate protection and Public Health reinventing fire makes sense and makes money General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies so in reinventing fire we integrated all four sectors that use energy transportation buildings industry and electricity and we integrated four kinds of innovation not just technology and policy but also design and business strategy those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles so let's start by making autos oil free two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car

executives the heebie-jeebies and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams in renewables are no longer a fringe activity for each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable mainly lately in developing countries in 2010 renewables other than big hydro particularly wind and solar cells got a hundred and fifty 1 billion dollars of private investment and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding sixty billion watts in that one year that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year in contrast the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity in the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk in fact in this country no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital despite seven years of hundred plus percent subsidies so how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants well efficiency and gas can displace them all at below just their operating costs and combined with renewables can displace them more than 23 times and less than their replacement cost but we only need to replace them once we're often told though that only : nuclear plants can keep the lights on because they're 24/7 whereas wind and solar power are variable and hence supposedly unreliable actually no generator is 24/7 they all break and when a big plant goes down you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds often for weeks or months often without warning that is exactly why we've designed the grid to backup failed plants with working plants and in exactly the same way the grid can handle window wind and solar powers for castable variations our early simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they're forecasted integrated and diversified by both type and location and that's true both for continental areas like the US or Europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid that is how for example for German States in 2010 were 43 to 52 percent when powered Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered Denmark 36 and it's how all of Europe can shift to renewable electricity in America are aging dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] America's public energy conversation boils down to this question would you rather die of a oil Wars or be climate change or see nuclear holocaust or D all of the above oh I missed one or e none of the above that's the one we're not normally offered what if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing could we have fuel without fear could we reinvent fire you see fire made us human fossil fuels made us modern but now we need a new fire that makes us safe secure healthy and durable let's see how four-fifths of the world's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo those fossil fuels have built our civilization they've created our wealth they've enriched the lives of billions but they also have rising costs to our security economy health and environment that are starting to erode if not outweigh their benefits so we need a new fire and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity each of which puts two fifths of the fossil carbon in the air but they're really quite distinct less than 1% of our electricity is made from oil although almost half is made from coal their uses are quite concentrated three-fourths of our oil fuels transportation three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings and the rest of both runs factories so very efficient vehicles buildings and factories save oil and cold and also natural gas that can displace both of them but today's energy system is not just inefficient it is also in disconnected aging dirty and insecure so it needs refurbishment by 2050 though it could become efficient connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos factories and buildings all relying on a modern secure and resilient electricity system we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply this could cost by 2050 five trillion dollars less in net present value that is expressed as a lump sum today then business as usual assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero a conservatively low estimate yet this cheaper energy system could support a hundred fifty eight percent bigger u.s. economy all without needing oil or coal or for that matter nuclear energy moreover this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of Congress and no new federal taxes mandate subsidies or laws and running Washington gridlock let me say that again I'm going to tell you how to get the United States completely off oil and coal five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of Congress led by business for profit in other words we're going to use our most effective institutions private enterprise Co evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions and whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security or environmental stewardship and climate protection and Public Health reinventing fire makes sense and makes money General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies so in reinventing fire we integrated all four sectors that use energy transportation buildings industry and electricity and we integrated four kinds of innovation not just technology and policy but also design and business strategy those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles so let's start by making autos oil free two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight and every unit of energy you save at the wheels by taking out weight or drag saves seven units at the tank is you don't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels unfortunately over the past quarter century epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have but today ultra light ultra strong materials like carbon fiber composites can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them so their engines get smaller indeed that sort of vehicle Fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper so sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today while the driving cost even from the start is very much lower so these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of Victorian engine and steel stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reinforce each other namely ultralight materials making them into structures and electric propulsion the sails can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary fee baits that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on in one's and just in the first two years the biggest of Europe's five feeb eight programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers of course computers and electronics are now America's biggest industry while typewriter makers have vanished so vehicle Fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years but then also make electrification affordable and that displaces the rest of the oil America could lead this next automotive revolution currently the leader is Germany last year Volkswagen announced that by next year they'll be producing this carbon-fiber plug-in hybrid getting 230 miles a gallon also last year BMW announced this carbon-fiber electric car they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries and they said we do not intend to be a typewriter maker out he claimed it's going to beat them both by year seven years ago and even faster and cheaper American manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part which doubles as a carbon cap in one minute and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is don't worry about dropping it it's tougher than titanium Tom Friedman actually who acted as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it but such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance they can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos they can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound to steel if we made our autos this way it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half Saudi Arabia's or half an OPEC by drilling in the Detroit formation a very perspective play and all those Detroit cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel they are all American carbon free and inexhaustible the same physics in the same business logic also applied to big vehicles in the five years ending at 2010 Walmart saved 60% of the fuel per ton-mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds and combined with triple to quintupled efficiency airplanes now on the drawing board can save close to a trillion dollars also today's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military R&D has given us the Internet the global positioning system and the jet engine and microchip industries as we design and build vehicles better we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving instead of just seeing the the travel grow we can use innovative pricing charging for road infrastructure by the mile not by the gallon we can use some smart IT to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride-sharing we can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be so they don't need to go somewhere else and we can use smart IT to make traffic free-flowing together those things can give us the same or better access with 46 to 84 percent less driving saving another point four trillion dollars plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively so forty years hence when you add it all up a far more mobile US economy can use no oil saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks rather than buying them for over 100 adds up to a four trillion dollar net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero so to get mobility without oil to phase out the oil we can get efficient and then switch fuel those hundred and twenty-five to 240 mile per gallon equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells electricity and advanced biofuels the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels the trucks could even use natural gas but no vehicles will need oil and the most biofuel we might need just three million barrels a day can be made 2/3 from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call institutional acupuncture we figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly we stick little needles in it to get it flowing working with partners like Ford and Walmart the Pentagon and the long transition is already well underway in fact three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil not in supply but in demand and Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peek around 2016 in other words oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices but the electrified vehicles don't need to burden the electricity grid rather when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that helped the grid integrate varying solar solar and wind power so the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately and they also converge the oil story with our second big story saving electricity and then making it differently and those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound two diverse disruptions than any other sector because we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on with 20th and 19th century institutions rules and cultures changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving keep improving faster than we're installing them so the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper but as efficiency in buildings in industry starts to grow faster than the economy America's electricity use could actually shrink even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos and we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends over the next 40 years buildings which use 3/4 of the electricity can triple or quadruple their energy productivity saving 1.4 trillion dollars net present value with a 33 percent internal rate of return or in English the savings are worth four times what they cost an industry can accelerate to doubling its energy productivity with a 21 percent internal rate of return Nakia is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings that is it can give you expanding returns not diminishing returns that is how our 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on-site into Super Windows that pass light but reflect heat plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third and then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved seventeen million dollars of capital cost which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry dowas billion dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars but industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars of energy still to save for example three fifths of the world's electricity runs motors half of that runs pumps and fans and those can all be made more efficient and the motors that turned them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating 35 improvements paying back in about a year but first we ought to be capturing bigger cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the text books for example pumps the biggest use of motors move liquid through pipes but a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy not by getting better pumps but just by replacing long thin crooked pipes with fat short straight pipes this is not about new technology at just our rearranging our metal furniture of course it also shrinks the pumping equipment at its capital costs so what does such savings mean for the electricity that is 3/5 used in motors well from the coal burns at the power plant through all these compounding losses only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe is float but now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost pollution and 100 levels cause global weirding back at the power plant and of course as you go back upstream the components get smaller and therefore cheaper our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries typically our retrofit design and save about 30 to 60% of the energy and payback in a few years while the new facility design save 40 to 90 odd percent with generally lower capital cost now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity chiefly renewables China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost in fact these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart and Germany now has more solar workers than America has Steelworkers already in about 20 states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cell phone bypass your wireline phone company and the sort of thing gives utility

[Music] [Applause] America's public energy conversation boils down to this question would you rather die of a oil Wars or be climate change or see nuclear holocaust or D all of the above oh I missed one or e none of the above that's the one we're not normally offered what if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing could we have fuel without fear could we reinvent fire you see fire made us human fossil fuels made us modern but now we need a new fire that makes us safe secure healthy and durable let's see how four-fifths of the world's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo those fossil fuels have built our civilization they've created our wealth they've enriched the lives of billions but they also have rising costs to our security economy health and environment that are starting to erode if not outweigh their benefits so we need a new fire and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity each of which puts two fifths of the fossil carbon in the air but they're really quite distinct less than 1% of our electricity is made from oil although almost half is made from coal their uses are quite concentrated three-fourths of our oil fuels transportation three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings and the rest of both runs factories so very efficient vehicles buildings and factories save oil and cold and also natural gas that can displace both of them but today's energy system is not just inefficient it is also in disconnected aging dirty and insecure so it needs refurbishment by 2050 though it could become efficient connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos factories and buildings all relying on a modern secure and resilient electricity system we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply this could cost by 2050 five trillion dollars less in net present value that is expressed as a lump sum today then business as usual assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero a conservatively low estimate yet this cheaper energy system could support a hundred fifty eight percent bigger u.s. economy all without needing oil or coal or for that matter nuclear energy moreover this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of Congress and no new federal taxes mandate subsidies or laws and running Washington gridlock let me say that again I'm going to tell you how to get the United States completely off oil and coal five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of Congress led by business for profit in other words we're going to use our most effective institutions private enterprise Co evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions and whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security or environmental stewardship and climate protection and Public Health reinventing fire makes sense and makes money General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies so in reinventing fire we integrated all four sectors that use energy transportation buildings industry and electricity and we integrated four kinds of innovation not just technology and policy but also design and business strategy those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles so let's start by making autos oil free two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight and every unit of energy you save at the wheels by taking out weight or drag saves seven units at the tank is you don't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels unfortunately over the past quarter century epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have but today ultra light ultra strong materials like carbon fiber composites can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them so their engines get smaller indeed that sort of vehicle Fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper so sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today while the driving cost even from the start is very much lower so these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of Victorian engine and steel stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reinforce each other namely ultralight materials making them into structures and electric propulsion the sails can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary fee baits that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on in one's and just in the first two years the biggest of Europe's five feeb eight programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers of course computers and electronics are now America's biggest industry while typewriter makers have vanished so vehicle Fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years but then also make electrification affordable and that displaces the rest of the oil America could lead this next automotive revolution currently the leader is Germany last year Volkswagen announced that by next year they'll be producing this carbon-fiber plug-in hybrid getting 230 miles a gallon also last year BMW announced this carbon-fiber electric car they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries and they said we do not intend to be a typewriter maker out he claimed it's going to beat them both by year seven years ago and even faster and cheaper American manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part which doubles as a carbon cap in one minute and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is don't worry about dropping it it's tougher than titanium Tom Friedman actually who acted as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it but such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance they can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos they can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound to steel if we made our autos this way it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half Saudi Arabia's or half an OPEC by drilling in the Detroit formation a very perspective play and all those Detroit cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel they are all American carbon free and inexhaustible the same physics in the same business logic also applied to big vehicles in the five years ending at 2010 Walmart saved 60% of the fuel per ton-mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds and combined with triple to quintupled efficiency airplanes now on the drawing board can save close to a trillion dollars also today's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military R&D has given us the Internet the global positioning system and the jet engine and microchip industries as we design and build vehicles better we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving instead of just seeing the the travel grow we can use innovative pricing charging for road infrastructure by the mile not by the gallon we can use some smart IT to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride-sharing we can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be so they don't need to go somewhere else and we can use smart IT to make traffic free-flowing together those things can give us the same or better access with 46 to 84 percent less driving saving another point four trillion dollars plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively so forty years hence when you add it all up a far more mobile US economy can use no oil saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks rather than buying them for over 100 adds up to a four trillion dollar net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero so to get mobility without oil to phase out the oil we can get efficient and then switch fuel those hundred and twenty-five to 240 mile per gallon equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells electricity and advanced biofuels the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels the trucks could even use natural gas but no vehicles will need oil and the most biofuel we might need just three million barrels a day can be made 2/3 from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call institutional acupuncture we figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly we stick little needles in it to get it flowing working with partners like Ford and Walmart the Pentagon and the long transition is already well underway in fact three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil not in supply but in demand and Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peek around 2016 in other words oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices but the electrified vehicles don't need to burden the electricity grid rather when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that helped the grid integrate varying solar solar and wind power so the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately and they also converge the oil story with our second big story saving electricity and then making it differently and those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound two diverse disruptions than any other sector because we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on with 20th and 19th century institutions rules and cultures changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving keep improving faster than we're installing them so the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper but as efficiency in buildings in industry starts to grow faster than the economy America's electricity use could actually shrink even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos and we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends over the next 40 years buildings which use 3/4 of the electricity can triple or quadruple their energy productivity saving 1.4 trillion dollars net present value with a 33 percent internal rate of return or in English the savings are worth four times what they cost an industry can accelerate to doubling its energy productivity with a 21 percent internal rate of return Nakia is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings that is it can give you expanding returns not diminishing returns that is how our 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on-site into Super Windows that pass light but reflect heat plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third and then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved seventeen million dollars of capital cost which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry dowas billion dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars but industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars of energy still to save for example three fifths of the world's electricity runs motors half of that runs pumps and fans and those can all be made more efficient and the motors that turned them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating 35 improvements paying back in about a year but first we ought to be capturing bigger cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the text books for example pumps the biggest use of motors move liquid through pipes but a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy not by getting better pumps but just by replacing long thin crooked pipes with fat short straight pipes this is not about new technology at just our rearranging our metal furniture of course it also shrinks the pumping equipment at its capital costs so what does such savings mean for the electricity that is 3/5 used in motors well from the coal burns at the power plant through all these compounding losses only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe is float but now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost pollution and 100 levels cause global weirding back at the power plant and of course as you go back upstream the components get smaller and therefore cheaper our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries typically our retrofit design and save about 30 to 60% of the energy and payback in a few years while the new facility design save 40 to 90 odd percent with generally lower capital cost now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity chiefly renewables China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost in fact these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart and Germany now has more solar workers than America has Steelworkers already in about 20 states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cell phone bypass your wireline phone company and the sort of thing gives utility executives the heebie-jeebies and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams in renewables are no longer a fringe activity for each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable mainly lately in developing countries in 2010 renewables other than big hydro particularly wind and solar cells got a hundred and fifty 1 billion dollars of private investment and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding sixty billion watts in that one year that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year in contrast the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity in the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk in fact in this country no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital despite seven years of hundred plus percent subsidies so how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants well efficiency and gas can displace them all at below just their operating costs and combined with renewables can displace them more than 23 times and less than their replacement cost but we only need to replace them once we're often told though that only : nuclear plants can keep the lights on because they're 24/7 whereas wind and solar power are variable and hence supposedly unreliable actually no generator is 24/7 they all break and when a big plant goes down you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds often for weeks or months often without warning that is exactly why we've designed the grid to backup failed plants with working plants and in exactly the same way the grid can handle window wind and solar powers for castable variations our early simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they're forecasted integrated and diversified by both type and location and that's true both for continental areas like the US or Europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid that is how for example for German States in 2010 were 43 to 52 percent when powered Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered Denmark 36 and it's how all of Europe can shift to renewable electricity in America are aging dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050 and whatever we replace it with it's got to cost about the same about six trillion dollars net present value whether we buy more of what we've got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal or renewables that are or or less centralized but those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks around national security fuel water finance technology climate and health for example our over centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or terrorist attack but that blackout risk disappears and all of the other risks are best managed with distributed renewables organized into local micro grids that normally interconnect but can stand alone at need that is they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly that approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting for its own power supply they think they need that how about the rest of us that they're defending we want our stuff to work too and at about the same cost as business-as-usual this would maximize national security customer choice entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation together efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector traditionally utilities built a lot of giant : nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables and those utilities were rewarded as they still are in 34 states for selling you more electricity however especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency demand response cogeneration renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage so our energy future is not fate but choice and that choice is very flexible in 1976 for example government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP could never go down and I heretic Lee suggested it could go down several fold well that's what's actually happened so far it's fallen by half but with today's much better technologies more mature delivery channels and integrative design we can do far more and even cheaper so to solve the energy problem we just needed to enlarge it and the results may at first seem incredible but you know as Marshall McLuhan said only puny secrets need protection big discoveries are protected by public incredulity now combine the electricity in oil revolutions both driven by modern efficiency and you get the really big story reinventing fire we're business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050 saving 5 trillion dollars growing the economy 2.6 fold strengthening our national security oh and by the way by getting rid of the oil and coal reducing the fossil carbon emissions 82 to 86 percent now if you like any of those outcomes you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important so focusing on outcomes not motives can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge this also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges climate change nuclear proliferation energy insecurity energy poverty all of which I'll make us less safe now our team at our my help smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives with some more hatching of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there to former oilman Maurice strong said not all the fossils are in the fuel but as Edgar Willard who used to chair DuPont reminds us in companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem because he said they simply won't be around long term I've described not just a once in a civilization business opportunity but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species we humans are inventing a new fire not dug from below but flowing from above not scarce but bountiful not local but everywhere not transient but permanent not costly but free and but for a little transitional tale of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure this new fire is flameless efficiently used it really can do our work without working our undoing each of you owns a piece of that five trillion dollar prize and our new book reinventing fire describes how you can capture it so with the conversation just begun at reinventing fire calm let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other and with everyone around you to help make the world richer fairer cooler and safer by together reinventing fire thank you [Applause]

on-site into Super Windows that pass light but reflect heat plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third and then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved seventeen million dollars of capital cost which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry dowas billion dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars but industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars of energy still to save for example three fifths of the world's electricity runs motors half of that runs pumps and fans and those can all be made more efficient and the motors that turned them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating 35 improvements paying back in about a year but first we ought to be capturing bigger cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the text books for example pumps the biggest use of motors move liquid through pipes but a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy not by getting better pumps but just by replacing long thin crooked pipes with fat short straight pipes this is not about new technology at just our rearranging our metal furniture of course it also shrinks the pumping equipment at its capital costs so what does such savings mean for the electricity that is 3/5 used in motors well from the coal burns at the power plant through all these compounding losses only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe is float but now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost pollution and 100 levels cause global weirding back at the power plant and of course as you go back upstream the components get smaller and therefore cheaper our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries typically our retrofit design and save about 30 to 60% of the energy and payback in a few years while the new facility design save 40 to 90 odd percent with generally lower capital cost now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity chiefly renewables China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost in fact these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart and Germany now has more solar workers than America has Steelworkers already in about 20 states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cell phone bypass your wireline phone company and the sort of thing gives utility executives the heebie-jeebies and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams in renewables are no longer a fringe activity for each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable mainly lately in developing countries in 2010 renewables other than big hydro particularly wind and solar cells got a hundred and fifty 1 billion dollars of private investment and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding sixty billion watts in that one year that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year in contrast the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity in the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk in fact in this country no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital despite seven years of hundred plus percent subsidies so how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants well efficiency and gas can displace them all at below just their operating costs and combined with renewables can displace them more than 23 times and less than their replacement cost but we only need to replace them once we're often told though that only : nuclear plants can keep the lights on because they're 24/7 whereas wind and solar power are variable and hence supposedly unreliable actually no generator is 24/7 they all break and when a big plant goes down you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds often for weeks or months often without warning that is exactly why we've designed the grid to backup failed plants with working plants and in exactly the same way the grid can handle window wind and solar powers for castable variations our early simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they're forecasted integrated and diversified by both type and location and that's true both for continental areas like the US or Europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid that is how for example for German States in 2010 were 43 to 52 percent when powered Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered Denmark 36 and it's how all of Europe can shift to renewable electricity in America are aging dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050 and whatever we replace it with it's got to cost about the same about six trillion dollars net present value whether we buy more of what we've got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal or renewables that are or or less centralized but those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks around national security fuel water finance technology climate and health for example our over centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or terrorist attack but that blackout risk disappears and all of the other risks are best managed with distributed renewables organized into local micro grids that normally interconnect but can stand alone at need that is they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly that approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting for its own power supply they think they need that how about the rest of us that they're defending we want our stuff to work too and at about the same cost as business-as-usual this would maximize national security customer choice entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation together efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector traditionally utilities built a lot of giant : nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables and those utilities were rewarded as they still are in 34 states for selling you more electricity however especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency demand response cogeneration renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage so our energy future is not fate but choice and that choice is very flexible in 1976 for example government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP could never go down and I heretic Lee suggested it could go down several fold well that's what's actually happened so far it's fallen by half but with today's much better technologies more mature delivery channels and integrative design we can do far more and even cheaper so to solve the energy problem we just needed to enlarge it and the results may at first seem incredible but you know as Marshall McLuhan said only puny secrets need protection big discoveries are protected by public incredulity now combine the electricity in oil revolutions both driven by modern efficiency and you get the really big story reinventing fire we're business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050 saving 5 trillion dollars growing the economy 2.6 fold strengthening our national security oh and by the way by getting rid of the oil and coal reducing the fossil carbon emissions 82 to 86 percent now if you like any of those outcomes you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important so focusing on outcomes not motives can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge this also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges climate change nuclear proliferation energy insecurity energy poverty all of which I'll make us less safe now our team at our my help smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives with some more hatching of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there to former oilman Maurice strong said not all the fossils are in the fuel but as Edgar Willard who used to chair DuPont reminds us in companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem because he said they simply won't be around long term I've described not just a once in a civilization business opportunity but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species we humans are inventing a new fire not dug from below but flowing from above not scarce but bountiful not local but everywhere not transient but permanent not costly but free and but for a little transitional tale of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure this new fire is flameless efficiently used it really can do our work without working our undoing each of you owns a piece of that five trillion dollar prize and our new book reinventing fire describes how you can capture it so with the conversation just begun at reinventing fire calm let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other and with everyone around you to help make the world richer fairer cooler and safer by together reinventing fire thank you [Applause]

After analyzing the generated MCQs, I found that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the biggest use of motors, and the correct answer is "Moving liquid through pipes." Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the closest in terms of topic, but it asks about the current source of four-fifths of the world's energy, which is not directly related to the use of motors.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ closely. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar, although it's still not a good match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2 (although it's not a good match)

Note: The generated MCQs seem to be focused on the broader topic of energy and sustainability, whereas the ground truth MCQ is more specific to the use of motors.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You've probably heard of Pavlov's dogs, the phrase that often summarizes Dr. Ivan Pavlov's early 20th century research, in which he demonstrated that we can alter what stimuli elicit a reflective response in canines. He showed this by sounding a bell just before he presented his group of dogs with meat powder. After many presentations of the bell, followed by tasty meat powder, the dogs eventually began to salivate at just the sound of the bell. They salivated even when there was no meat powder present. This phenomenon isn't limited to dogs. Consider the placebo effect, in which a pill with no active substances brings about a response similar to a pill with a substance present. What changes here is our reaction to our ailment, such as perceiving less pain and not the ailment itself. Or, consider the love humans have for a parent. Some would argue that this love is instinctual, and they may be partially right. But, the argument fails to account for the equal amount of love that children adopted later in life hold for their adoptive parents. But the behaviorist argument can account for both accounts of love. A parent, biological or not, is constantly paired with things like food, smiles, toys, affection, games, protection, and entertainment. And a parent's constant association with these wonderful or crucial aspects of a child's life has a similar, albeit more complicated, effect that meat powder had on Pavlov's salivating dogs. In other words, if one's parent is predictive of really good or really important things, then one's parent becomes a really good and important thing, too. And there is also romantic advice to be gained from Pavlov's observations. We all need food to survive, right? And someone who can provide such things in a delicious, saliva-producing manner stands to become our human equivalent of a ringing bell. In other words, if you can cook one or more scrumptious meals for a potential love interest, there's a good chance that you'll be viewed more favorably in the future, even if you didn't prepare the delicious food. And who wouldn't want the love of their life drooling over them? But life is not just bell rings and salivation. There's also a dark side to this type of learning, called "taste aversion". Taste aversion occurs when we ingest some food that eventually makes us sick, and, as a result, we avoid that food, sometimes for the rest of our lives. Taste aversion is so powerful that the effect can be seen even if the illness is experienced hours later and even if the food itself did not actually make us sick. Such is the case when we have the flu, and, by accident, we ingest some food moments prior to vomiting. In this case, we know that the food did not cause the vomiting, but our bodies don't know that. And the next time we encounter that food, we are likely to refuse eating it. Now, imagine the potential consequences of undercooking a meal on a first date. If the food makes your date sick, it is possible for them to associate that bad feeling with not just the food, but with your food in particular. If the episode was traumatizing enough, or if it also happens on a subsequent date, they may come to relate you with the consequences, just like Pavlov's dogs related the bell with the meat powder. In other words, the sight of you showing up at the next dinner date might actually make your date nauseous! As the old saying goes, the fastest way to someone's heart is through their stomach, assuming you don't make them sick in the process.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Although Question 1 does not directly ask about who is credited with identifying that neutral stimuli can produce reflexive responses, it does mention Dr. Ivan Pavlov's research with dogs, which is the same topic as the ground truth MCQ. Additionally, Question 1 mentions classical conditioning, which is the concept that Dr. Pavlov's research demonstrated.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 1. However, it's worth noting that the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new question that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ would be needed to accurately assess the same knowledge.

Here is an example of a new question that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ:

Question: Who is credited with discovering that neutral stimuli can elicit a reflexive response when paired with a stimulus that naturally elicits that response?

Options: A. Sigmund Freud, B. B. F. Skinner, C. William James, D. Ivan Pavlov

Correct Option: D.

In other words, if you can cook one or more scrumptious meals for a potential love interest, there's a good chance that you'll be viewed more favorably in the future, even if you didn't prepare the delicious food. And who wouldn't want the love of their life drooling over them? But life is not just bell rings and salivation. There's also a dark side to this type of learning, called "taste aversion". Taste aversion occurs when we ingest some food that eventually makes us sick, and, as a result, we avoid that food, sometimes for the rest of our lives. Taste aversion is so powerful that the effect can be seen even if the illness is experienced hours later and even if the food itself did not actually make us sick. Such is the case when we have the flu, and, by accident, we ingest some food moments prior to vomiting. In this case, we know that the food did not cause the vomiting, but our bodies don't know that. And the next time we encounter that food, we are likely to refuse eating it. Now, imagine the potential consequences of undercooking a meal on a first date. If the food makes your date sick, it is possible for them to associate that bad feeling with not just the food, but with your food in particular. If the episode was traumatizing enough, or if it also happens on a subsequent date, they may come to relate you with the consequences, just like Pavlov's dogs related the bell with the meat powder. In other words, the sight of you showing up at the next dinner date might actually make your date nauseous! As the old saying goes, the fastest way to someone's heart is through their stomach, assuming you don't make them sick in the process.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You've probably heard of Pavlov's dogs, the phrase that often summarizes Dr. Ivan Pavlov's early 20th century research, in which he demonstrated that we can alter what stimuli elicit a reflective response in canines. He showed this by sounding a bell just before he presented his group of dogs with meat powder. After many presentations of the bell, followed by tasty meat powder, the dogs eventually began to salivate at just the sound of the bell. They salivated even when there was no meat powder present. This phenomenon isn't limited to dogs. Consider the placebo effect, in which a pill with no active substances brings about a response similar to a pill with a substance present. What changes here is our reaction to our ailment, such as perceiving less pain and not the ailment itself. Or, consider the love humans have for a parent. Some would argue that this love is instinctual, and they may be partially right. But, the argument fails to account for the equal amount of love that children adopted later in life hold for their adoptive parents. But the behaviorist argument can account for both accounts of love. A parent, biological or not, is constantly paired with things like food, smiles, toys, affection, games, protection, and entertainment. And a parent's constant association with these wonderful or crucial aspects of a child's life has a similar, albeit more complicated, effect that meat powder had on Pavlov's salivating dogs. In other words, if one's parent is predictive of really good or really important things, then one's parent becomes a really good and important thing, too. And there is also romantic advice to be gained from Pavlov's observations. We all need food to survive, right? And someone who can provide such things in a delicious, saliva-producing manner stands to become our human equivalent of a ringing bell. In other words, if you can cook one or more scrumptious meals for a potential love interest, there's a good chance that you'll be viewed more favorably in the future, even if you didn't prepare the delicious food.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar So as an astronomer, when I look at the sky with other people, they always ask me, "What is your favorite place in the universe? What is your favorite galaxy? What is your favorite planet?" My answer is Earth. That's right. This is a very special place, even for an astronomer. We look at a lot of places, but there's only one that we know of in the whole universe that we can live on. It's an amazing planet, there is an amazing number of things happening, some of them, you are hearing about it today. That's the only place in the universe where we know that there is life, so that makes it extremely special. What I'm going to talk to you about is this great adventure in astronomy that is happening where we are actually actively looking for other places like this. It's impossible to imagine the number of possibilities, what happens on those other planets that can be habitable. So that's what I'm going to tell you about. So, the first thing we have to think of is, well, what makes a planet habitable? And, the easiest thing to do is to look at our own solar system. We have multiple examples. The first thing we learn is that size matters. We can't have a planet that's too small or too big. If we look at a planet that is too small, it doesn't have an atmosphere. The moon, technically not a planet, but a good example for this, is too small, it doesn't hold an atmosphere. Jupiter - very, very big - and it actually is mostly composed of gas, it has no surface you can stand on. The Earth is just right. The second thing that we learned is that the planet has to be at the right distance from its star. If the planet is too close to its star, it's too hot. That's the case for Venus. Here I have a picture that was taken by a spacecraft that landed on Venus, and the surface, although it's rocky and quite familiar to us compared to Earth, it's really too hot. At the opposite end, if a planet is too far from the star, it is too cold. That's the case for Mars. So, we need to look for planets that are at the right distance from their star and also of the right size. So, one other thing, you know, you might think, "Oh, this is really hard because the planet has to be just right. It only happened once in our solar system." But when you look at the sky at night, and here's a video that I took actually from Hawaii, a dark place where you can see a lot of stars, the first thing you notice is that there are a lot of stars. So, the odds are in our favor, even if a small fraction of the stars have habitable planets. There are a lot of stars. On a moonless night, in a dark site, if you count the stars in the sky and you count five stars per second, it would take you 15 minutes to count all of the stars in the sky. That is a tiny fraction of the stars in our galaxy. If you count all the stars in our galaxy, and you also count at five stars per second, it would take you more than 1,000 years to count all the stars in our galaxy. And then, if you manage to count the galaxies in the universe, if you count five galaxies per second, it would take you also more than 1,000 years to count all of the galaxies in the universe. So the numbers are just astronomical, there's a lot of opportunities for exoplanets. There has to be a large number of exoplanets along which there are, on which there could be life. So this is very exciting. So let's imagine that maybe only 1 in 100 stars has the right kind of planet, and I think this is pessimistic. If you could visit one of those planets per second, it'll take you sixty years to actually visit all of them in our galaxy alone. That's, I think, one second is not enough to study them. So, there's a few hundred of us in this room. If we divided the task and each of us basically took a couple of minutes to study each planet, it would take us a life time to do this. Meet back again and tell those amazing stories of what we would have seen in maybe some TED senior event. So, why is it hard? Why don't we have pictures of exoplanets with aliens on them? Well, here's an example. This is a picture that was taken by the Cassinni spacecraft as it was orbiting Saturn. It's actually behind Saturn, so what you see is the sun that is blocked by Saturn. And if you look very, in detail, if you have very sharp eyesight, you will see all of us. We're all on that picture. Here is where we are. Um, so that's what Earth starts to look like when we look at it from far away. Now, we have to do the same thing around other stars, and the planet is very close to the star. So this is zooming in to us. All of us are on that little dot at the time the picture was taken. So, what I work on is inventing optics, tricks to actually do this, to take images of planets around those other stars. This is my easiest coronagraph. We call this optic tricks, "coronagraph". This is the easiest one I ever built. I just put my thumb in front of the sun and then you can see things around it. That's what we're trying to do, but we need to do it much better than what I did in this picture. And, there are two things we need to do: we need a much better eye, call them telescopes, and we need more fancy, clever ways to do it than putting a thumb. So as an example, one of the projects I work on is for the Subaru Telescope, which you can see here in this picture. It's a very large telescope, so I replace my eye by a large telescope. And, the other thing that we do is the coronagraph is not just a stupid thumb, it's this very complicated thing that's shown in that picture that I would love to have time to tell you about. Just to give you a sense for size, this arrow points to a door on the side of the telescope, and if you have very sharp eyes, you can see that there is a railing going around the telescope, so it's a really big eye. So, I think the most exciting thing for me is actually to look at the night sky, to see all these stars and wonder, "Well, are there people on planets around those stars?" Because there must be amazing things happening around those stars that we don't know yet. During your life time, we will start to actually figure out those things. And the most exciting thing for me is to think about, maybe, beings on those stars looking back at our star and wondering the same thing. So I think the future will be extremely exciting because we are starting to figure out those things and amazing range of possibilities is, I think, even wider than our imagination. Thank you.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar So as an astronomer, when I look at the sky with other people, they always ask me, "What is your favorite place in the universe? What is your favorite galaxy? What is your favorite planet?" My answer is Earth. That's right. This is a very special place, even for an astronomer. We look at a lot of places, but there's only one that we know of in the whole universe that we can live on. It's an amazing planet, there is an amazing number of things happening, some of them, you are hearing about it today. That's the only place in the universe where we know that there is life, so that makes it extremely special. What I'm going to talk to you about is this great adventure in astronomy that is happening where we are actually actively looking for other places like this. It's impossible to imagine the number of possibilities, what happens on those other planets that can be habitable. So that's what I'm going to tell you about. So, the first thing we have to think of is, well, what makes a planet habitable? And, the easiest thing to do is to look at our own solar system. We have multiple examples. The first thing we learn is that size matters. We can't have a planet that's too small or too big. If we look at a planet that is too small, it doesn't have an atmosphere. The moon, technically not a planet, but a good example for this, is too small, it doesn't hold an atmosphere. Jupiter - very, very big - and it actually is mostly composed of gas, it has no surface you can stand on. The Earth is just right. The second thing that we learned is that the planet has to be at the right distance from its star. If the planet is too close to its star, it's too hot. That's the case for Venus. Here I have a picture that was taken by a spacecraft that landed on Venus, and the surface, although it's rocky and quite familiar to us compared to Earth, it's really too hot. At the opposite end, if a planet is too far from the star, it is too cold. That's the case for Mars. So, we need to look for planets that are at the right distance from their star and also of the right size. So, one other thing, you know, you might think, "Oh, this is really hard because the planet has to be just right. It only happened once in our solar system." But when you look at the sky at night, and here's a video that I took actually from Hawaii, a dark place where you can see a lot of stars, the first thing you notice is that there are a lot of stars. So, the odds are in our favor, even if a small fraction of the stars have habitable planets. There are a lot of stars. On a moonless night, in a dark site, if you count the stars in the sky and you count five stars per second, it would take you 15 minutes to count all of the stars in the sky. That is a tiny fraction of the stars in our galaxy. If you count all the stars in our galaxy, and you also count at five stars per second, it would take you more than 1,000 years to count all the stars in our galaxy. And then, if you manage to count the galaxies in the universe, if you count five galaxies per second, it would take you also more than 1,000 years to count all of the galaxies in the universe. So the numbers are just astronomical, there's a lot of opportunities for exoplanets. There has to be a large number of exoplanets along which there are, on which there could be life. So this is very exciting. So let's imagine that maybe only 1 in 100 stars has the right kind of planet, and I think this is pessimistic. If you could visit one of those planets per second, it'll take you sixty years to actually visit all of them in our galaxy alone. That's, I think, one second is not enough to study them. So, there's a few hundred of us in this room. If we divided the task and each of us basically took a couple of minutes to study each planet, it would take us a life time to do this. Meet back again and tell those amazing stories of what we would have seen in maybe some TED senior event. So, why is it hard? Why don't we have pictures of exoplanets with aliens on them? Well, here's an example. This is a picture that was taken by the Cassinni spacecraft as it was orbiting Saturn. It's actually behind Saturn, so what you see is the sun that is blocked by Saturn. And if you look very, in detail, if you have very sharp eyesight, you will see all of us. We're all on that picture. Here is where we are. Um, so that's what Earth starts to look like when we look at it from far away. Now, we have to do the same thing around other stars, and the planet is very close to the star. So this is zooming in to us. All of us are on that little dot at the time the picture was taken. So, what I work on is inventing optics, tricks to actually do this, to take images of planets around those other stars. This is my easiest coronagraph. We call this optic tricks, "coronagraph". This is the easiest one I ever built. I just put my thumb in front of the sun and then you can see things around it. That's what we're trying to do, but we need to do it much better than what I did in this picture. And, there are two things we need to do: we need a much better eye, call them telescopes, and we need more fancy, clever ways to do it than putting a thumb. So as an example, one of the projects I work on is for the Subaru Telescope, which you can see here in this picture. It's a very large telescope, so I replace my eye by a large telescope. And, the other thing that we do is the coronagraph is not just a stupid thumb, it's this very complicated thing that's shown in that picture that I would love to have time to tell you about. Just to give you a sense for size, this arrow points to a door on the side of the telescope, and if you have very sharp eyes, you can see that there is a railing going around the telescope, so it's a really big eye. So, I think the most exciting thing for me is actually to look at the night sky, to see all these stars and wonder, "Well, are there people on planets around those stars?" Because there must be amazing things happening around those stars that we don't know yet. During your life time, we will start to actually figure out those things. And the most exciting thing for me is to think about, maybe, beings on those stars looking back at our star and wondering the same thing. So I think the future will be extremely exciting because we are starting to figure out those things and amazing range of possibilities is, I think, even wider than our imagination. Thank you.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar So as an astronomer, when I look at the sky with other people, they always ask me, "What is your favorite place in the universe? What is your favorite galaxy? What is your favorite planet?" My answer is Earth. That's right. This is a very special place, even for an astronomer. We look at a lot of places, but there's only one that we know of in the whole universe that we can live on. It's an amazing planet, there is an amazing number of things happening, some of them, you are hearing about it today. That's the only place in the universe where we know that there is life, so that makes it extremely special. What I'm going to talk to you about is this great adventure in astronomy that is happening where we are actually actively looking for other places like this. It's impossible to imagine the number of possibilities, what happens on those other planets that can be habitable. So that's what I'm going to tell you about. So, the first thing we have to think of is, well, what makes a planet habitable? And, the easiest thing to do is to look at our own solar system. We have multiple examples. The first thing we learn is that size matters. We can't have a planet that's too small or too big. If we look at a planet that is too small, it doesn't have an atmosphere. The moon, technically not a planet, but a good example for this, is too small, it doesn't hold an atmosphere. Jupiter - very, very big - and it actually is mostly composed of gas, it has no surface you can stand on. The Earth is just right. The second thing that we learned is that the planet has to be at the right distance from its star. If the planet is too close to its star, it's too hot. That's the case for Venus. Here I have a picture that was taken by a spacecraft that landed on Venus, and the surface, although it's rocky and quite familiar to us compared to Earth, it's really too hot. At the opposite end, if a planet is too far from the star, it is too cold. That's the case for Mars. So, we need to look for planets that are at the right distance from their star and also of the right size. So, one other thing, you know, you might think, "Oh, this is really hard because the planet has to be just right. It only happened once in our solar system." But when you look at the sky at night, and here's a video that I took actually from Hawaii, a dark place where you can see a lot of stars, the first thing you notice is that there are a lot of stars. So, the odds are in our favor, even if a small fraction of the stars have habitable planets. There are a lot of stars. On a moonless night, in a dark site, if you count the stars in the sky and you count five stars per second, it would take you 15 minutes to count all of the stars in the sky. That is a tiny fraction of the stars in our galaxy. If you count all the stars in our galaxy, and you also count at five stars per second, it would take you more than 1,000 years to count all the stars in our galaxy. And then, if you manage to count the galaxies in the universe, if you count five galaxies per second, it would take you also more than 1,000 years to count all of the galaxies in the universe. So the numbers are just astronomical, there's a lot of opportunities for exoplanets. There has to be a large number of exoplanets along which there are, on which there could be life. So this is very exciting. So let's imagine that maybe only 1 in 100 stars has the right kind of planet, and I think this is pessimistic. If you could visit one of those planets per second, it'll take you sixty years to actually visit all of them in our galaxy alone. That's, I think, one second is not enough to study them. So, there's a few hundred of us in this room. If we divided the task and each of us basically took a couple of minutes to study each planet, it would take us a life time to do this. Meet back again and tell those amazing stories of what we would have seen in maybe some TED senior event. So, why is it hard? Why don't we have pictures of exoplanets with aliens on them? Well, here's an example. This is a picture that was taken by the Cassinni spacecraft as it was orbiting Saturn. It's actually behind Saturn, so what you see is the sun that is blocked by Saturn. And if you look very, in detail, if you have very sharp eyesight, you will see all of us. We're all on that picture. Here is where we are. Um, so that's what Earth starts to look like when we look at it from far away. Now, we have to do the same thing around other stars, and the planet is very close to the star. So this is zooming in to us. All of us are on that little dot at the time the picture was taken. So, what I work on is inventing optics, tricks to actually do this, to take images of planets around those other stars. This is my easiest coronagraph. We call this optic tricks, "coronagraph". This is the easiest one I ever built. I just put my thumb in front of the sun and then you can see things around it. That's what we're trying to do, but we need to do it much better than what I did in this picture. And, there are two things we need to do: we need a much better eye, call them telescopes, and we need more fancy, clever ways to do it than putting a thumb. So as an example, one of the projects I work on is for the Subaru Telescope, which you can see here in this picture. It's a very large telescope, so I replace my eye by a large telescope. And, the other thing that we do is the coronagraph is not just a stupid thumb, it's this very complicated thing that's shown in that picture that I would love to have time to tell you about. Just to give you a sense for size, this arrow points to a door on the side of the telescope, and if you have very sharp eyes, you can see that there is a railing going around the telescope, so it's a really big eye. So, I think the most exciting thing for me is actually to look at the night sky, to see all these stars and wonder, "Well, are there people on planets around those stars?" Because there must be amazing things happening around those stars that we don't know yet. During your life time, we will start to actually figure out those things. And the most exciting thing for me is to think about, maybe, beings on those stars looking back at our star and wondering the same thing. So I think the future will be extremely exciting because we are starting to figure out those things and amazing range of possibilities is, I think, even wider than our imagination. Thank you.

**Transcript**:
Bean bags are awesome. But I see a few people out there
who are standing, we've got some over here, and standing takes more
work than lounging. Using the Live Strong
Organization's online database of weight loss resources, you can calculate that by the time I'm done
with this speech, those of you who are standing will have burned 7.5 more calories than those of you who are bean-bagging it. (Laughter) Okay, here's a question, speaking of weight loss,
specifically weight, this speech is live. I'm actually here in front of you guys, we're all here together. But this speech is being recorded and it will become a video
that people can access all over the world on computers, mobile devices, televisions. I weight about 190 pounds. How much will the video weigh? Asking questions like that is what I do every week
on my channel Vsauce. For the last two years, I have been asking really fun questions, mind-boggling questions, and approaching them
as sincerely as I can, celebrating scientific
concepts and scientists. And I research and write and produce and host and edit and upload and run the social media all by myself, but it's not lonely, because Vsauce has
more than 2 million subscribers, and every month, my videos are seen
by more than 20 million people. Yeah. (Applause) It's very exciting. I've found that asking a strange question
is a great way to get people in, not just people, but fans. And fans are different
than just viewers or an audience, because fans want to come back. They subscribe to you on YouTube and they want to watch
everything you've made and everything you plan
to make in the future because we are curious people and sparking curiosity is great bait. It's a great way to catch a human. And once you've caught them, you have this captive
audience that you can, with the goal in mind
of answering the question, accidentally teach a lot of things to. So, let's take a look
at some of my videos. Here are eight of them. But down here in the lower-right corner, "What Color is a Mirror?" When people see that, it's very difficult not to click,
because you think, "Come on, are you serious? How could you possibly
answer that question?" Well, so far, 7.6 million
people have watched this five-minute video
about what color a mirror is. And in that episode, I answer the question and I get a chance to explain
what would normally be kind of dry topics: optics, diffuse versus specular reflection, how light works,
how light works on the retina, and even the etymology of color terms like white and black. Okay, spoiler alert: mirrors are not clear, they are not silvery, like they're often illustrated. Mirrors, technically speaking, are just a tiny, tiny, little bit ... green. You can demonstrate this
by putting two mirrors next to each other, facing so they reflect
back and forth forever. Look down that infinite reflection,
and it will get dimmer, because some light is lost
or absorbed every time, but it will also become greener, because green light, that is light of a wavelength
that we perceive as green, is best reflected by most mirrors. Okay, so, how much does a video weigh? Well, when you stream
a video onto your computer, that information is temporarily stored using electrons. And the number of electrons on your device
won't actually increase or decrease. But it takes energy
to store them in one place, and, thanks to our friend Albert Einstein, we know that energy and mass are related. Okay, so here's the thing: let's say you're watching a YouTube video at a really nice resolution, 720p. Assuming a typical bit rate, we can figure that a minute
of YouTube video is going to need to involve
about 10 million electrons on your device. Plugging all those electrons
and the energy it takes to hold them in the correct place
for you to see the video, into that formula, we can figure out
that one minute of YouTube video increases the mass of your computer by about 10 to the negative 19th grams. Written out, it looks like this. (Whistle) That's like nothing. You could call that nothing,
and you wouldn't really get in trouble, because the best scales
we've ever invented that we could try to use
to actually to detect that change are only accurate to 10
to the negative 9th grams. So, we can't measure it, but we can, like we just did,
calculate it. And that's really cool
because when I was a kid, my school had two shelves
of science books. That was really cool, but I read all of them
within, like, two grades, and it was hard to get more books because books are heavy,
you need space for them and moving books around is tougher
than what we can do today. With numbers that small, I can fit thousands of books on my own little personal
electronic reader. I can stream hours and hours and days and days of YouTube video without my computer
ever getting measurably heavier. And as information becomes that light, it becomes a lot more democratic, meaning that more teachers and presenters and creators
and viewers than ever before can be involved. Right now, on YouTube, there is an explosion
of content like this happening. The three Vsauce channels
are down there in the corner. But everyone else,
all together, collectively, their views dwarf what I can do alone or with the people that I work with, and that is really, really exciting. It turns out that tapping
into people's curiosity and responsibly answering their questions is a brilliant way to build
fans and an audience and get in viewers. It's even a great way
for brands and companies to build trust. So, calculating the weight of a video is kind of a funny question, but I cannot wait to see
what we ask and answer next. As always, thanks for watching. (Applause)

to make in the future because we are curious people and sparking curiosity is great bait. It's a great way to catch a human. And once you've caught them, you have this captive
audience that you can, with the goal in mind
of answering the question, accidentally teach a lot of things to. So, let's take a look
at some of my videos. Here are eight of them. But down here in the lower-right corner, "What Color is a Mirror?" When people see that, it's very difficult not to click,
because you think, "Come on, are you serious? How could you possibly
answer that question?" Well, so far, 7.6 million
people have watched this five-minute video
about what color a mirror is. And in that episode, I answer the question and I get a chance to explain
what would normally be kind of dry topics: optics, diffuse versus specular reflection, how light works,
how light works on the retina, and even the etymology of color terms like white and black. Okay, spoiler alert: mirrors are not clear, they are not silvery, like they're often illustrated. Mirrors, technically speaking, are just a tiny, tiny, little bit ... green. You can demonstrate this
by putting two mirrors next to each other, facing so they reflect
back and forth forever. Look down that infinite reflection,
and it will get dimmer, because some light is lost
or absorbed every time, but it will also become greener, because green light, that is light of a wavelength
that we perceive as green, is best reflected by most mirrors. Okay, so, how much does a video weigh? Well, when you stream
a video onto your computer, that information is temporarily stored using electrons. And the number of electrons on your device
won't actually increase or decrease. But it takes energy
to store them in one place, and, thanks to our friend Albert Einstein, we know that energy and mass are related. Okay, so here's the thing: let's say you're watching a YouTube video at a really nice resolution, 720p. Assuming a typical bit rate, we can figure that a minute
of YouTube video is going to need to involve
about 10 million electrons on your device. Plugging all those electrons
and the energy it takes to hold them in the correct place
for you to see the video, into that formula, we can figure out
that one minute of YouTube video increases the mass of your computer by about 10 to the negative 19th grams. Written out, it looks like this. (Whistle) That's like nothing. You could call that nothing,
and you wouldn't really get in trouble, because the best scales
we've ever invented that we could try to use
to actually to detect that change are only accurate to 10
to the negative 9th grams. So, we can't measure it, but we can, like we just did,
calculate it. And that's really cool
because when I was a kid, my school had two shelves
of science books. That was really cool, but I read all of them
within, like, two grades, and it was hard to get more books because books are heavy,
you need space for them and moving books around is tougher
than what we can do today. With numbers that small, I can fit thousands of books on my own little personal
electronic reader. I can stream hours and hours and days and days of YouTube video without my computer
ever getting measurably heavier. And as information becomes that light, it becomes a lot more democratic, meaning that more teachers and presenters and creators
and viewers than ever before can be involved. Right now, on YouTube, there is an explosion
of content like this happening. The three Vsauce channels
are down there in the corner. But everyone else,
all together, collectively, their views dwarf what I can do alone or with the people that I work with, and that is really, really exciting. It turns out that tapping
into people's curiosity and responsibly answering their questions is a brilliant way to build
fans and an audience and get in viewers. It's even a great way
for brands and companies to build trust. So, calculating the weight of a video is kind of a funny question, but I cannot wait to see
what we ask and answer next. As always, thanks for watching. (Applause)

Bean bags are awesome. But I see a few people out there
who are standing, we've got some over here, and standing takes more
work than lounging. Using the Live Strong
Organization's online database of weight loss resources, you can calculate that by the time I'm done
with this speech, those of you who are standing will have burned 7.5 more calories than those of you who are bean-bagging it. (Laughter) Okay, here's a question, speaking of weight loss,
specifically weight, this speech is live. I'm actually here in front of you guys, we're all here together. But this speech is being recorded and it will become a video
that people can access all over the world on computers, mobile devices, televisions. I weight about 190 pounds. How much will the video weigh? Asking questions like that is what I do every week
on my channel Vsauce. For the last two years, I have been asking really fun questions, mind-boggling questions, and approaching them
as sincerely as I can, celebrating scientific
concepts and scientists. And I research and write and produce and host and edit and upload and run the social media all by myself, but it's not lonely, because Vsauce has
more than 2 million subscribers, and every month, my videos are seen
by more than 20 million people. Yeah. (Applause) It's very exciting. I've found that asking a strange question

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar So I work on trying to understand how the universe works at the very basic level, the most basic level we can find. So, when you try in your everyday life to try and work out how something works, what you're actually doing is you're looking for what I call hidden structures. For example, you take something like your cell phone, your smart phone, it's a complicated object, and you might wonder how it works. Well, what you can do is go in and actually take it apart. You'll void the warranty, but that's OK. And you'll go in and what you'll find is that it's made of tiny little electronic components. And those electronic components are actually moving around a certain kind of particle that we know that's called the electron, and that's where the name "electronics" comes from. So if you know the actual rules of how to put those things together, you can actually make your smart phone or you could make various other electronic devices as well. So, there are people like myself who, actually for a living, try and do this sort of thing not just for, say, a cell phone or its components, but asking what, say, your hand is made of, or the chair you're sitting in, or the planet Earth, the sun, the stars, the entire universe. And so, using various kinds of instruments and observations and experiments, we've been able to probe deeper and deeper over the years, and we now know that the matter that we're made of and that we see around us is actually made of tiny little elementary particles. And elementary particles interact with each other via the forces of nature, but we've also discovered that those forces of nature themselves actually operate by exchanging elementary particles as well. They're actually particles of force that are exchanged by the particles of matter. And you may have heard this year that there was big news, a major announcement in this story, the Large Hadron Collider, the LHC, a huge experiment in Europe, has actually uncovered a Higgs boson, and that particle's job is to interact with the various elementary particles and give them the masses that we observe. So, this exciting picture is analogous to the one I showed you for the cell phone. We have the components and we have the rules of particle theory, as it's called, by which these all operate and give rise to the various things. Now, we actually think that we've only just scratched the surface of finding this quantum world, the hidden structure of our world. Let me give you three examples of the puzzles we're still working on. So, what I did is I gathered the particles up into the patterns that they tend to form, but we don't know where those patterns come from. We know how to describe the particles, but we don't know where the patterns come from. When you see patterns in science, you look for a hidden structure, so that's one of the things. Also, we now know that there's a huge amount more matter out there than just the things that I was just talking about. That stuff is called dark matter. We don't know what it is, and we'd like to be able to get it and experiment with it and figure out what it is. And then, the other thing I'd like to talk about is the fact that the force of gravity, perhaps the most familiar force we know, when you get down to the quantum level, it actually doesn't operate according to those rules of particle theory. So, given that gravity is actually about the shape of space and time as Einstein taught us, we, in working out what the quantum story of gravity is, which we call quantum gravity, we hope to get to groups of questions like, are there particles of space and time itself and how do they fit together? What are the rules? So, this leads us to things like studying where it all began, 13.7 billion years ago, the Big Bang. We know matter and energy as we understand it was created, but also, space and time itself. So those are the sorts of things we study in this quest. Also, we have things that are around us today, such as black holes, which are very important clues. They're actually holes in space that we'd like to understand. Also, the newly discovered dark energy, which is the tendency of space all through the universe to accelerate its expansion. So scientists are working on these kinds of things, trying to understand what we think is now the case that there's not just hidden structures of matter and energy, but also space and time. So the question is, what are the rules? And there are many approaches to this, and one of them is one you may have heard of, called string theory. And so it is one of many approaches and we don't know if it's right yet, we're not finished developing the theory, but it's given us some really exciting, tantalizing hints. I'd like to tell you about a few of them. So, one of them is simply that you take away the idea of looking for a tiny quantum particle, you look instead for an extended object, a string, which can vibrate. And it actually gives you some exciting opportunities because, for example, it would say if we've missed that hidden structure by not looking closely enough, we wouldn't realize that many different kinds of particles are just different vibrations of the same string, which is a really exciting possibility and a huge simplification. So that's one of the ideas. The other thing that's really exciting about string theory is that one of those particles it describes is actually the missing quantum of gravity that we have been trying to understand. And then the other thing is that strings actually, instead of one wanting just to move in the dimensions, the three space dimensions that we are familiar with, actually seem to want to move in higher dimensions. So we have this idea, then, what would it mean for our world, if this were anything to do with our world, and we don't know that yet? Here's a way that our world would arise from that. You would have our world, and then one of the hidden structures would be hidden chunks in space time that are not visible, those extra dimensions. And then the various particles that we see in the world would come from being vibrations of strings and those patterns we saw that we can't explain come from the fact that the strings can probe and feel the shape of those internal dimensions. So, one of the things, then, is can we actually test this? This is a lovely idea, but how do we confront this with real experiments and observations because we're doing science here? And that's the hard thing. We think that the energy you need to probe the tiny-enough scales to see the strings if they're there, is more than we can hope to get any time soon. But what we can do is we can look for the consequences of those hidden structures, we can look for how those things show up in physics that we can get access to. So, that's why we study things like dark matter, black holes, dark energy, and we also look at remnants of the early universe, the cosmic microwave background that satellites. And, importantly, we look for clues from the various kinds of particle physics experiments, like the LHC. So, one last thing, then, is a new thing that's been going on. String theory may turn out to be useful in other areas of physics. There are new kinds of experiments that start out, say, with our friend the electron, and actually show that in certain circumstances, the electrons interact in a way that give you completely new, weird kinds of behavior. And there are models that show that string theory's actually the best way. In some circumstances, using the rules of string theory, you can actually explain that sort of behavior. So this gives us an exciting possibility, there's real experiments you can do with these electrons that will help us shape the rules for what string theory is. And you might go, "Well, OK, that's going to give us maybe some fancy new kind of electronics that we can make a better cell phone with." But, what I'm saying that those rules may actually be the same rules we're looking for to see if string theory can help us with these bigger questions. So, at the end of the day, the hidden structures of the universe we're looking for, may, one day, be right under our noses. Thank you.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar So I work on trying to understand how the universe works at the very basic level, the most basic level we can find. So, when you try in your everyday life to try and work out how something works, what you're actually doing is you're looking for what I call hidden structures. For example, you take something like your cell phone, your smart phone, it's a complicated object, and you might wonder how it works. Well, what you can do is go in and actually take it apart. You'll void the warranty, but that's OK. And you'll go in and what you'll find is that it's made of tiny little electronic components. And those electronic components are actually moving around a certain kind of particle that we know that's called the electron, and that's where the name "electronics" comes from. So if you know the actual rules of how to put those things together, you can actually make your smart phone or you could make various other electronic devices as well. So, there are people like myself who, actually for a living, try and do this sort of thing not just for, say, a cell phone or its components, but asking what, say, your hand is made of, or the chair you're sitting in, or the planet Earth, the sun, the stars, the entire universe. And so, using various kinds of instruments and observations and experiments, we've been able to probe deeper and deeper over the years, and we now know that the matter that we're made of and that we see around us is actually made of tiny little elementary particles. And elementary particles interact with each other via the forces of nature, but we've also discovered that those forces of nature themselves actually operate by exchanging elementary particles as well. They're actually particles of force that are exchanged by the particles of matter. And you may have heard this year that there was big news, a major announcement in this story, the Large Hadron Collider, the LHC, a huge experiment in Europe, has actually uncovered a Higgs boson, and that particle's job is to interact with the various elementary particles and give them the masses that we observe. So, this exciting picture is analogous to the one I showed you for the cell phone. We have the components and we have the rules of particle theory, as it's called, by which these all operate and give rise to the various things. Now, we actually think that we've only just scratched the surface of finding this quantum world, the hidden structure of our world. Let me give you three examples of the puzzles we're still working on. So, what I did is I gathered the particles up into the patterns that they tend to form, but we don't know where those patterns come from. We know how to describe the particles, but we don't know where the patterns come from. When you see patterns in science, you look for a hidden structure, so that's one of the things. Also, we now know that there's a huge amount more matter out there than just the things that I was just talking about. That stuff is called dark matter. We don't know what it is, and we'd like to be able to get it and experiment with it and figure out what it is. And then, the other thing I'd like to talk about is the fact that the force of gravity, perhaps the most familiar force we know, when you get down to the quantum level, it actually doesn't operate according to those rules of particle theory. So, given that gravity is actually about the shape of space and time as Einstein taught us, we, in working out what the quantum story of gravity is, which we call quantum gravity, we hope to get to groups of questions like, are there particles of space and time itself and how do they fit together? What are the rules? So, this leads us to things like studying where it all began, 13.7 billion years ago, the Big Bang. We know matter and energy as we understand it was created, but also, space and time itself. So those are the sorts of things we study in this quest. Also, we have things that are around us today, such as black holes, which are very important clues. They're actually holes in space that we'd like to understand. Also, the newly discovered dark energy, which is the tendency of space all through the universe to accelerate its expansion. So scientists are working on these kinds of things, trying to understand what we think is now the case that there's not just hidden structures of matter and energy, but also space and time. So the question is, what are the rules? And there are many approaches to this, and one of them is one you may have heard of, called string theory. And so it is one of many approaches and we don't know if it's right yet, we're not finished developing the theory, but it's given us some really exciting, tantalizing hints. I'd like to tell you about a few of them. So, one of them is simply that you take away the idea of looking for a tiny quantum particle, you look instead for an extended object, a string, which can vibrate. And it actually gives you some exciting opportunities because, for example, it would say if we've missed that hidden structure by not looking closely enough, we wouldn't realize that many different kinds of particles are just different vibrations of the same string, which is a really exciting possibility and a huge simplification. So that's one of the ideas. The other thing that's really exciting about string theory is that one of those particles it describes is actually the missing quantum of gravity that we have been trying to understand. And then the other thing is that strings actually, instead of one wanting just to move in the dimensions, the three space dimensions that we are familiar with, actually seem to want to move in higher dimensions. So we have this idea, then, what would it mean for our world, if this were anything to do with our world, and we don't know that yet? Here's a way that our world would arise from that. You would have our world, and then one of the hidden structures would be hidden chunks in space time that are not visible, those extra dimensions. And then the various particles that we see in the world would come from being vibrations of strings and those patterns we saw that we can't explain come from the fact that the strings can probe and feel the shape of those internal dimensions. So, one of the things, then, is can we actually test this? This is a lovely idea, but how do we confront this with real experiments and observations because we're doing science here? And that's the hard thing. We think that the energy you need to probe the tiny-enough scales to see the strings if they're there, is more than we can hope to get any time soon. But what we can do is we can look for the consequences of those hidden structures, we can look for how those things show up in physics that we can get access to. So, that's why we study things like dark matter, black holes, dark energy, and we also look at remnants of the early universe, the cosmic microwave background that satellites. And, importantly, we look for clues from the various kinds of particle physics experiments, like the LHC. So, one last thing, then, is a new thing that's been going on. String theory may turn out to be useful in other areas of physics. There are new kinds of experiments that start out, say, with our friend the electron, and actually show that in certain circumstances, the electrons interact in a way that give you completely new, weird kinds of behavior. And there are models that show that string theory's actually the best way. In some circumstances, using the rules of string theory, you can actually explain that sort of behavior. So this gives us an exciting possibility, there's real experiments you can do with these electrons that will help us shape the rules for what string theory is.

So, at the end of the day, the hidden structures of the universe we're looking for, may, one day, be right under our noses. Thank you.

The other thing that's really exciting about string theory is that one of those particles it describes is actually the missing quantum of gravity that we have been trying to understand. And then the other thing is that strings actually, instead of one wanting just to move in the dimensions, the three space dimensions that we are familiar with, actually seem to want to move in higher dimensions. So we have this idea, then, what would it mean for our world, if this were anything to do with our world, and we don't know that yet? Here's a way that our world would arise from that. You would have our world, and then one of the hidden structures would be hidden chunks in space time that are not visible, those extra dimensions. And then the various particles that we see in the world would come from being vibrations of strings and those patterns we saw that we can't explain come from the fact that the strings can probe and feel the shape of those internal dimensions. So, one of the things, then, is can we actually test this? This is a lovely idea, but how do we confront this with real experiments and observations because we're doing science here? And that's the hard thing. We think that the energy you need to probe the tiny-enough scales to see the strings if they're there, is more than we can hope to get any time soon. But what we can do is we can look for the consequences of those hidden structures, we can look for how those things show up in physics that we can get access to. So, that's why we study things like dark matter, black holes, dark energy, and we also look at remnants of the early universe, the cosmic microwave background that satellites. And, importantly, we look for clues from the various kinds of particle physics experiments, like the LHC. So, one last thing, then, is a new thing that's been going on. String theory may turn out to be useful in other areas of physics. There are new kinds of experiments that start out, say, with our friend the electron, and actually show that in certain circumstances, the electrons interact in a way that give you completely new, weird kinds of behavior. And there are models that show that string theory's actually the best way. In some circumstances, using the rules of string theory, you can actually explain that sort of behavior. So this gives us an exciting possibility, there's real experiments you can do with these electrons that will help us shape the rules for what string theory is. And you might go, "Well, OK, that's going to give us maybe some fancy new kind of electronics that we can make a better cell phone with." But, what I'm saying that those rules may actually be the same rules we're looking for to see if string theory can help us with these bigger questions. So, at the end of the day, the hidden structures of the universe we're looking for, may, one day, be right under our noses. Thank you.

[Music] [Music] when I was 11 I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house my father was listening to BBC news on his small gray radio there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then because the news mostly depressed him the Taliban are gone my father shouted I didn't know what it meant but I could see that my father was very very happy you can go to a real school now he said a morning that I will never forget a real school you see I was six when Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school so for the next 5 years I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister who was no longer allowed to be outside alone to a secret school it was the only way we both could be educated each day we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going we would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping the school was in a house more than 100 of us packed in one small living room it was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer we all knew we were risking Our Lives the teacher the students and our parents from time to time a school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious we always wondered what they knew about us why are we being followed do they know where we live we were scared but still school was where we wanted to be I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was priced and daughters were treasured my grandfather was extraordinary man for his time a total Maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan he insisted that his daughter my mom go to school and for that he was disowned by his father but my educated mother became a teacher there she is she retired two years ago only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood and my father that's him he was the first ever in his family to receive an education there was no question that his children will receive an education including his daughters despite the Taliban despite the risks to him there was greater risk in not educating his children during Taliban years I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future I would want to quit but my father he would say listen my daughter you can lose everything you own in your life your money can be stolen you can be forced to leave your home during a war but the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees we will so do you still not want to continue today I'm 22 I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by Decades of War fewer than 6% of women my age have made it Beyond high school and had my family not been so committed to my education I would be one of them instead I stand Here a proud graduate of midbury college when I returned to Afghanistan my grandfather the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters was among the first to congratulate me he not only brags about my college degree but also that I was the first woman and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Cabo my family Believes In Me I dream big but my family dreams even bigger for me that's why I am a global Ambassador for 10times 10 a global campaign to educate women that's why I co-founded Sola the first and perhaps only boarding

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the greatest risk according to Shabana's father, and the correct option is "Not educating his children." Among the generated MCQs, none directly ask about the greatest risk. However, Question 10 asks about the key to success in a society like Afghanistan, and option B mentions the support of fathers, which is related to the idea that Shabana's father believes in educating his children.

Although Question 10 is not a direct match, it is the closest in terms of question intent and content. Therefore, I would identify Question 10 as the most similar generated MCQ.

[Music] [Music] when I was 11 I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house my father was listening to BBC news on his small gray radio there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then because the news mostly depressed him the Taliban are gone my father shouted I didn't know what it meant but I could see that my father was very very happy you can go to a real school now he said a morning that I will never forget a real school you see I was six when Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school so for the next 5 years I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister who was no longer allowed to be outside alone to a secret school it was the only way we both could be educated each day we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going we would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping the school was in a house more than 100 of us packed in one small living room it was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer we all knew we were risking Our Lives the teacher the students and our parents from time to time a school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious we always wondered what they knew about us why are we being followed do they know where we live we were scared but still school was where we wanted to be I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was priced and daughters were treasured my grandfather was extraordinary man for his time a total Maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan he insisted that his daughter my mom go to school and for that he was disowned by his father but my educated mother became a teacher there she is she retired two years ago only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood and my father that's him he was the first ever in his family to receive an education there was no question that his children will receive an education including his daughters despite the Taliban despite the risks to him there was greater risk in not educating his children during Taliban years I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future I would want to quit but my father he would say listen my daughter you can lose everything you own in your life your money can be stolen you can be forced to leave your home during a war but the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees we will so do you still not want to continue today I'm 22 I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by Decades of War fewer than 6% of women my age have made it Beyond high school and had my family not been so committed to my education I would be one of them instead I stand Here a proud graduate of midbury college when I returned to Afghanistan my grandfather the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters was among the first to congratulate me he not only brags about my college degree but also that I was the first woman and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Cabo my family Believes In Me I dream big but my family dreams even bigger for me that's why I am a global Ambassador for 10times 10 a global campaign to educate women that's why I co-founded Sola the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan a country where it's still risky for girlss to go to school the exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing an opportunity and I see their parents and their fathers who like my own advocate for them despite and even in the face of daunting opposition like like Ahmed that's not his real name and I cannot show you his face but Ahmed is the father of one of my students less than a month ago he and his daughter were on on their way from Sola to their Village and they literally missed being killed by a roadside Bomb by minutes as he arrived home the phone rang a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school they would try again kill me now if you wish he said but I will not ruin my daughter's future because of your old and backward ideas what I've come to realize about aanas sun and this is something that is often dismissed in the west that behind most most most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success it's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success in fact they're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a a bright future for their daughters but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan we must have the support of men under the Taliban girls who went to school numbered in hundreds remember it was illegal but today more than 3 million girls are in school in Afghanistan aanan looks so different from here in America I find that Americans see the fragility in changes I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the US troops withdrawal but when I'm back in Afghanistan when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them who encourage them I see a promising future and Lasting change to me Afghanistan is a country of Hope and boundless possibilities and every single day the girls of solar remind me of that like me they are dreaming big thank you

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of girls in school in Afghanistan during the time of Shabana's talk. The closest generated MCQ is Question 8, which asks about the percentage of women in Afghanistan who have made it beyond high school. Although the question is not exactly the same, it is related to education in Afghanistan.

However, I must note that the options in Question 8 do not match the options in the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 8, but with the caveat that it is not a perfect match.

[Music] [Applause] you should be nice to nerds in fact I'd go so far as to say if you don't already have a nerd in your life you should get one I'm I'm just saying scientists and Engineers change the world I'd like to tell you about a magical place called DARPA where scientists and Engineers defy The Impossible and refuse to fear failure now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize because when you remove the fear of failure impossible things suddenly become possible if you want to know how ask yourself this question what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail if you really ask yourself this question you can't help but feel uncomfortable I feel a little uncomfortable because when you ask it you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you how it keeps us from attemp tempting great things and life gets dull amazing things stop happening sure good things happen but amazing things stop happening now I should be clear I'm not encouraging failure I'm discouraging fear of failure because it's not failure itself that constrains us the path to truly new never been done before things always has failure along the way we're tested and in part that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great Clemens so said life gets interesting when we fail because it's a sign that we've surpassed ourselves in 1895 Lord Kelvin declared that heavier than air flying machines were impossible in October of 1903 the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly and 2 months later on December 17th Orville Wright powered the first airplane across a beach in North Carolina the flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 ft that was 1903 one year later the next Declarations of impossibilities began Ferdinand fos a French army General credited with having one of the most original and subtle Minds in the French army said airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value 40 years later AO experts coined the term transonic they debed should it have 1 s or two you see they were having trouble in this flight regime and it wasn't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound in 1947 there was no wind tunnel data Beyond Mach 0.85 and yet on Tuesday October 14th 1947 Chuck gagger climbed into the cockpit of his Bell X1 and he flew towards an unknown possibility and in so doing he became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound six of eight Atlas rockets blew up on the pad after 11 complete mission failures we got our first images from space and on that first flight we got more data than in all you two missions combined it took a lot of failures to get there since we took to the sky we have wanted to fly faster and farther and to do so we've had to believe in impossible things and we've had to refuse to fear failure that's still true today today we don't talk about flying trans sonically or even supersonically we talk about flying hypersonically not mock 2 or Mach 3 mach 20 at mach 20 we can fly from New York to Long Beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds at that speed the surface of the air foil is the temperature of molten steel 3,500 de F like a blast furnace we are essentially burning the air foil as we fly it and we are flying it or trying to DARPA Hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built it's boosted to near space at top a minitar 4 rocket now the minitar 4 has too much impulse so we have to Bleed It Off by flying the rocket at an 89° angle of attack for portions of the trajectory that's an unnatural act for a rocket the third stage has a camera we call it rocket Cam and it's pointed at the Hypersonic glider this is the actual rocket cam footage from flight one now to conceal the shape we changed the aspect ratio a little bit but this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider as it heads into the atmosphere back towards Earth we've flown twice in the first flight no aerodynamic control of the vehicle but we collected more Hypersonic flight data than in 30 years of groundbased testing combined and in the second flight 3 minutes of fully controlled aerodynamic flight at mach 20 we must fly again because amazing never been done before things require that you fly you can't learn to fly at Mack 20 unless you fly and while there's no substitute for Speed maneuverability is a very close second if a mock 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds to get from New York to Long Beach a hummingbird would take well days you see hummingbirds are not Hypersonic but they are maneuverable in fact the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards it can fly up down forwards backwards even upside down and so if we wanted to fly in this room or place places where humans can't go we'd need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so this is a hummingbird drone it can fly in all directions even backwards it can hover and rotate this prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera it weighs less than one ablea battery it does not eat nectar in 2008 it flew for a whopping 20 seconds a year later 2 minutes then six eventually 11 many prototypes crashed many but there's no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly it's beautiful isn't it wow it's great Matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot failure is part of creating new and amazing things we cannot both fear failure and make amazing new things like a robot with the stability of a dog on rough terrain or maybe even ice a robot that can run like a cheetah or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human or perhaps Spider-Man will one day be gecko man a gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe one square mimer of a gecko's foot pad has 14,000 hairlike structures called sete they are used to help it grip to surfaces using intermolecular forces today we can manufacture structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko's foot the result of four 4x4 in artificial nanog gecko adhesive can support a static load of 660 lb that's enough to stick 6 42 in plasma TVs to your wall no nails so much for velcro right and it's not just passive structures it's entire machines this is a spider mite it's 1 mm long but it looks like Godzilla next to these micro machines in the world of Godzilla spidermites we can make millions of mirrors each 1if the diameter of a human hair moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second to make large screen displays so that we can watch movies like Godzilla in high def and if we can build machines at that scale what what about Eiffel Tower like trusses at the micro scale today we are making metals that are lighter than styrofoam so light they can sit a top a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air so light that you can make a car that two people can lift but so strong that it has the crash worthiness of an SUV from the smallest wisp of air air to the powerful forces of Nature's storms there are 44 lightning strikes per second around the globe each lightning bolt heats the air to 44,000 de F hotter than the surface of the Sun what if we could use these electromagnetic pulses as beacons beacons in a moving network of powerful transmitters experiments suggest that lightning could be the next GPS electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains using a grid the size of your thumb with 32 electrodes on the surface of his brain Tim uses his thoughts B I want to control an advanced prosthetic

that moment mattered to Tim and Katie and this green goo May someday matter to you this green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life it was made in tobacco plants tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever and if it seems far-fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy what about Gamers that could solve problems that experts can't solve last September the gamers of foldit solved the three-dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to AIDS in reesus monkeys now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments for 15 years it was unsolved in the scientific Community The Gamers of Fold It solved it in 15 days now they were able to do so by working together they were able to work together because they're connected by the internet and others also connected to the internet used it as an instrument of democracy and together they changed the fate of their Nation the internet is home to two billion people or 30% of the world's population it allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals it allows us to amplify our voices and our p power as a group but it too had humble beginnings in 1969 the internet was but a dream a few sketches on a piece of paper and then on October 29th the first packet switched message was sent from UCLA to Sri the first two letters of the word login that's all that made it through an l and an O and then a buffer overflow crashed the system two letters an l and an O now a worldwide Force so who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called DARPA they are nerds and they are heroes Among Us they challenge existing perspectives at the edges of Science and under the most demanding of conditions they remind us that we can change the world if we defy The Impossible and we refuse to fear failure they remind us that we all have nerd power sometimes we just forget you see there was a time when you weren't afraid of failure when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing you were good at math you could build things you were an astronaut an adventurer jacqu custo you could jump higher run faster kick harder than anyone you believed in impossible things and you were Fearless you were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero scientists and Engineers can indeed change the world so can you you were born to so go ahead ask yourself what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail now I want to say this is not easy it's hard to hold on to this feeling really hard I guess in some way I sort of believe it's supposed to be hard doubt and fear always creep in we think someone else someone smarter than us someone more capable someone with more resources will solve that problem but there isn't anyone else there's just you and if we're lucky in that moment someone steps into that doubt and fear takes a hand and says let me help you believe Jason Harley did that for me Jason started at DARPA on March 18th 2010 he was with with our transportation team I saw Jason nearly every day sometimes twice a day and more so than most he saw the highs and the lows the celebrations and the disappointments and on one particularly dark day for me Jason sat down and he wrote an email he was encouraging but firm and when he hit send he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make it mattered to me in that moment and still today when I doubt when I feel afraid when I need to reconnect with that feeling I remember his words they were so powerful supero supero supero [Music] super superhero superhero music superhero superhero music superhero [Music] superhero because that's what being a superhero is all [Applause] about there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you and remember be nice to nerds thank you thank you rea thank you I have a couple of questions the um so that glider of yours the mark 20 glider Mark glider the first one uh no control it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere it did what happened on that second flight yeah it also went in the Pacific but this time under control well yeah no we didn't fly it into the Pacific right um no there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed and so in the second flight we were able to get 3 minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it I I imagine you're not planning to open up to passenger service from New York to Long Beach it might be a little warm what do you picture what what do you picture that glider being used for well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this how it's ultimately used will be determined by the military now the purpose of the vehicle though the purpose of the technology is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes and to carry a payload of more than a few pounds yeah like what's the payload it could carry well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be right we got to fly it first but not necessarily just a camera yeah no not necessarily just a camera um it it's it's amazing um the the the the the hummingbird um I mean I'm curious you know you you started your beautiful sequence on flight with with a wing a plane kind of trying to flap its wings and failing horribly and there haven't been that many planes built since that flat Wings why why did we think that this was the time to go bio mimicry and and copy a hummingbird isn't that a very expensive solution for a small well maneuverable flying object so I mean in part we wondered if it was possible to do it and you have to revisit these questions over time the folks at aerovironment tried 300 or more different Wing designs 12 different forms of the avionics took them 10 full prototypes to get something that would actually fly but there's something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something you'd recognize so we often talk about Stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing but when things look just natural you also don't see them ah ah so it's not necessar Ste it's partly the the look actually sure look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters I mean because that's the that's I think as well as the a at looking at that I'm sure some people here are thinking you know technology catches up so quick how long is it before some crazed geek with a little remote control flies R through a window of the White House I mean do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here well look our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise that's what we do it would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we didn't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time it's just the nature of what we do now our responsibility is to push that edge and you know we have to be of course Mindful and responsible of how the technology is developed and ultimately used but we can't simply close our eyes and pretend that it isn't advancing it's advancing I mean you're you're clearly a really inspiring leader and um um you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention but at a personal level I mean in a way I can't imagine doing your job do you wake up in the night sometimes just asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of of your team Brilliance sure I mean I think it would you couldn't be human if you didn't ask those questions you know how do you answer them well I don't always have answers for them right I think that um we learn as time goes on I mean my job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you can have I work with some of the most amazing people and with that exhilaration comes a really deep sense of responsibility and so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what's possible right and this tremendous seriousness of what it means Regina that was jaw dropping as I say thank you so much for coming to thank [Applause] [Music] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] you should be nice to nerds in fact I'd go so far as to say if you don't already have a nerd in your life you should get one I'm I'm just saying scientists and Engineers change the world I'd like to tell you about a magical place called DARPA where scientists and Engineers defy The Impossible and refuse to fear failure now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize because when you remove the fear of failure impossible things suddenly become possible if you want to know how ask yourself this question what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail if you really ask yourself this question you can't help but feel uncomfortable I feel a little uncomfortable because when you ask it you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you how it keeps us from attemp tempting great things and life gets dull amazing things stop happening sure good things happen but amazing things stop happening now I should be clear I'm not encouraging failure I'm discouraging fear of failure because it's not failure itself that constrains us the path to truly new never been done before things always has failure along the way we're tested and in part that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great Clemens so said life gets interesting when we fail because it's a sign that we've surpassed ourselves in 1895 Lord Kelvin declared that heavier than air flying machines were impossible in October of 1903 the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly and 2 months later on December 17th Orville Wright powered the first airplane across a beach in North Carolina the flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 ft that was 1903 one year later the next Declarations of impossibilities began Ferdinand fos a French army General credited with having one of the most original and subtle Minds in the French army said airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value 40 years later AO experts coined the term transonic they debed should it have 1 s or two you see they were having trouble in this flight regime and it wasn't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound in 1947 there was no wind tunnel data Beyond Mach 0.85 and yet on Tuesday October 14th 1947 Chuck gagger climbed into the cockpit of his Bell X1 and he flew towards an unknown possibility and in so doing he became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound six of eight Atlas rockets blew up on the pad after 11 complete mission failures we got our first images from space and on that first flight we got more data than in all you two missions combined it took a lot of failures to get there since we took to the sky we have wanted to fly faster and farther and to do so we've had to believe in impossible things and we've had to refuse to fear failure that's still true today today we don't talk about flying trans sonically or even supersonically we talk about flying hypersonically not mock 2 or Mach 3 mach 20 at mach 20 we can fly from New York to Long Beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds at that speed the surface of the air foil is the temperature of molten steel 3,500 de F like a blast furnace we are essentially burning the air foil as we fly it and we are flying it or trying to DARPA Hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built it's boosted to near space at top a minitar 4 rocket now the minitar 4 has too much impulse so we have to Bleed It Off by flying the rocket at an 89° angle of attack for portions of the trajectory that's an unnatural act for a rocket the third stage has a camera we call it rocket Cam and it's pointed at the Hypersonic glider this is the actual rocket cam footage from flight one now to conceal the shape we changed the aspect ratio a little bit but this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider as it heads into the atmosphere back towards Earth we've flown twice in the first flight no aerodynamic control of the vehicle but we collected more Hypersonic flight data than in 30 years of groundbased testing combined and in the second flight 3 minutes of fully controlled aerodynamic flight at mach 20 we must fly again because amazing never been done before things require that you fly you can't learn to fly at Mack 20 unless you fly and while there's no substitute for Speed maneuverability is a very close second if a mock 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds to get from New York to Long Beach a hummingbird would take well days you see hummingbirds are not Hypersonic but they are maneuverable in fact the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards it can fly up down forwards backwards even upside down and so if we wanted to fly in this room or place places where humans can't go we'd need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so this is a hummingbird drone it can fly in all directions even backwards it can hover and rotate this prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera it weighs less than one ablea battery it does not eat nectar in 2008 it flew for a whopping 20 seconds a year later 2 minutes then six eventually 11 many prototypes crashed many but there's no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly it's beautiful isn't it wow it's great Matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot failure is part of creating new and amazing things we cannot both fear failure and make amazing new things like a robot with the stability of a dog on rough terrain or maybe even ice a robot that can run like a cheetah or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human or perhaps Spider-Man will one day be gecko man a gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe one square mimer of a gecko's foot pad has 14,000 hairlike structures called sete they are used to help it grip to surfaces using intermolecular forces today we can manufacture structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko's foot the result of four 4x4 in artificial nanog gecko adhesive can support a static load of 660 lb that's enough to stick 6 42 in plasma TVs to your wall no nails so much for velcro right and it's not just passive structures it's entire machines this is a spider mite it's 1 mm long but it looks like Godzilla next to these micro machines in the world of Godzilla spidermites we can make millions of mirrors each 1if the diameter of a human hair moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second to make large screen displays so that we can watch movies like Godzilla in high def and if we can build machines at that scale what what about Eiffel Tower like trusses at the micro scale today we are making metals that are lighter than styrofoam so light they can sit a top a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air so light that you can make a car that two people can lift but so strong that it has the crash worthiness of an SUV from the smallest wisp of air air to the powerful forces of Nature's storms there are 44 lightning strikes per second around the globe each lightning bolt heats the air to 44,000 de F hotter than the surface of the Sun what if we could use these electromagnetic pulses as beacons beacons in a moving network of powerful transmitters experiments suggest that lightning could be the next GPS electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains using a grid the size of your thumb with 32 electrodes on the surface of his brain Tim uses his thoughts B I want to control an advanced prosthetic arm and his thoughts made him reach for Katie this is the first time time a human has controlled a robot with thought alone sorry and it is the first time that Tim has held Katie's hand in seven years that moment mattered to Tim and Katie and this green goo May someday matter to you this green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life it was made in tobacco plants tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever and if it seems far-fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy what about Gamers that could solve problems that experts can't solve last September the gamers of foldit solved the three-dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to AIDS in reesus monkeys now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments for 15 years it was unsolved in the scientific Community The Gamers of Fold It solved it in 15 days now they were able to do so by working together they were able to work together because they're connected by the internet and others also connected to the internet used it as an instrument of democracy and together they changed the fate of their Nation the internet is home to two billion people or 30% of the world's population it allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals it allows us to amplify our voices and our p power as a group but it too had humble beginnings in 1969 the internet was but a dream a few sketches on a piece of paper and then on October 29th the first packet switched message was sent from UCLA to Sri the first two letters of the word login that's all that made it through an l and an O and then a buffer overflow crashed the system two letters an l and an O now a worldwide Force so who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called DARPA they are nerds and they are heroes Among Us they challenge existing perspectives at the edges of Science and under the most demanding of conditions they remind us that we can change the world if we defy The Impossible and we refuse to fear failure they remind us that we all have nerd power sometimes we just forget you see there was a time when you weren't afraid of failure when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing you were good at math you could build things you were an astronaut an adventurer jacqu custo you could jump higher run faster kick harder than anyone you believed in impossible things and you were Fearless you were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero scientists and Engineers can indeed change the world so can you you were born to so go ahead ask yourself what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail now I want to say this is not easy it's hard to hold on to this feeling really hard I guess in some way I sort of believe it's supposed to be hard doubt and fear always creep in we think someone else someone smarter than us someone more capable someone with more resources will solve that problem but there isn't anyone else there's just you and if we're lucky in that moment someone steps into that doubt and fear takes a hand and says let me help you believe Jason Harley did that for me Jason started at DARPA on March 18th 2010 he was with with our transportation team I saw Jason nearly every day sometimes twice a day and more so than most he saw the highs and the lows the celebrations and the disappointments and on one particularly dark day for me Jason sat down and he wrote an email he was encouraging but firm and when he hit send he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make it mattered to me in that moment and still today when I doubt when I feel afraid when I need to reconnect with that feeling I remember his words they were so powerful supero supero supero [Music] super superhero superhero music superhero superhero music superhero [Music] superhero because that's what being a superhero is all [Applause] about there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you and remember be nice to nerds thank you thank you rea thank you I have a couple of questions the um so that glider of yours the mark 20 glider Mark glider the first one uh no control it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere it did what happened on that second flight yeah it also went in the Pacific but this time under control well yeah no we didn't fly it into the Pacific right um no there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed and so in the second flight we were able to get 3 minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it I I imagine you're not planning to open up to passenger service from New York to Long Beach it might be a little warm what do you picture what what do you picture that glider being used for well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this how it's ultimately used will be determined by the military now the purpose of the vehicle though the purpose of the technology is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes and to carry a payload of more than a few pounds yeah like what's the payload it could carry well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be right we got to fly it first but not necessarily just a camera yeah no not necessarily just a camera um it it's it's amazing um the the the the the hummingbird um I mean I'm curious you know you you started your beautiful sequence on flight with with a wing a plane kind of trying to flap its wings and failing horribly and there haven't been that many planes built since that flat Wings why why did we think that this was the time to go bio mimicry and and copy a hummingbird isn't that a very expensive solution for a small well maneuverable flying object so I mean in part we wondered if it was possible to do it and you have to revisit these questions over time the folks at aerovironment tried 300 or more different Wing designs 12 different forms of the avionics took them 10 full prototypes to get something that would actually fly but there's something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something you'd recognize so we often talk about Stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing but when things look just natural you also don't see them ah ah so it's not necessar Ste it's partly the the look actually sure look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters I mean because that's the that's I think as well as the a at looking at that I'm sure some people here are thinking you know technology catches up so quick how long is it before some crazed geek with a little remote control flies R through a window of the White House I mean do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here well look our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise that's what we do it would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we didn't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time it's just the nature of what we do now our responsibility is to push that edge and you know we have to be of course Mindful and responsible of how the technology is developed and ultimately used but we can't simply close our eyes and pretend that it isn't advancing it's advancing I mean you're you're clearly a really inspiring leader and um um you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention but at a personal level I mean in a way I can't imagine doing your job do you wake up in the night sometimes just asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of of your team Brilliance sure I mean I think it would you couldn't be human if you didn't ask those questions you know how do you answer them well I don't always have answers for them right I think that um we learn as time goes on I mean my job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you can have I work with some of the most amazing people and with that exhilaration comes a really deep sense of responsibility and so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what's possible right and this tremendous seriousness of what it means Regina that was jaw dropping as I say thank you so much for coming to thank [Applause] [Music] you

speed and so in the second flight we were able to get 3 minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it I I imagine you're not planning to open up to passenger service from New York to Long Beach it might be a little warm what do you picture what what do you picture that glider being used for well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this how it's ultimately used will be determined by the military now the purpose of the vehicle though the purpose of the technology is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes and to carry a payload of more than a few pounds yeah like what's the payload it could carry well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be right we got to fly it first but not necessarily just a camera yeah no not necessarily just a camera um it it's it's amazing um the the the the the hummingbird um I mean I'm curious you know you you started your beautiful sequence on flight with with a wing a plane kind of trying to flap its wings and failing horribly and there haven't been that many planes built since that flat Wings why why did we think that this was the time to go bio mimicry and and copy a hummingbird isn't that a very expensive solution for a small well maneuverable flying object so I mean in part we wondered if it was possible to do it and you have to revisit these questions over time the folks at aerovironment tried 300 or more different Wing designs 12 different forms of the avionics took them 10 full prototypes to get something that would actually fly but there's something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something you'd recognize so we often talk about Stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing but when things look just natural you also don't see them ah ah so it's not necessar Ste it's partly the the look actually sure look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters I mean because that's the that's I think as well as the a at looking at that I'm sure some people here are thinking you know technology catches up so quick how long is it before some crazed geek with a little remote control flies R through a window of the White House I mean do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here well look our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise that's what we do it would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we didn't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time it's just the nature of what we do now our responsibility is to push that edge and you know we have to be of course Mindful and responsible of how the technology is developed and ultimately used but we can't simply close our eyes and pretend that it isn't advancing it's advancing I mean you're you're clearly a really inspiring leader and um um you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention but at a personal level I mean in a way I can't imagine doing your job do you wake up in the night sometimes just asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of of your team Brilliance sure I mean I think it would you couldn't be human if you didn't ask those questions you know how do you answer them well I don't always have answers for them right I think that um we learn as time goes on I mean my job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you can have I work with some of the most amazing people and with that exhilaration comes a really deep sense of responsibility and so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what's possible right and this tremendous seriousness of what it means Regina that was jaw dropping as I say thank you so much for coming to thank [Applause] [Music] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] you should be nice to nerds in fact I'd go so far as to say if you don't already have a nerd in your life you should get one I'm I'm just saying scientists and Engineers change the world I'd like to tell you about a magical place called DARPA where scientists and Engineers defy The Impossible and refuse to fear failure now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize because when you remove the fear of failure impossible things suddenly become possible if you want to know how ask yourself this question what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail if you really ask yourself this question you can't help but feel uncomfortable I feel a little uncomfortable because when you ask it you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you how it keeps us from attemp tempting great things and life gets dull amazing things stop happening sure good things happen but amazing things stop happening now I should be clear I'm not encouraging failure I'm discouraging fear of failure because it's not failure itself that constrains us the path to truly new never been done before things always has failure along the way we're tested and in part that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great Clemens so said life gets interesting when we fail because it's a sign that we've surpassed ourselves in 1895 Lord Kelvin declared that heavier than air flying machines were impossible in October of 1903 the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly and 2 months later on December 17th Orville Wright powered the first airplane across a beach in North Carolina the flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 ft that was 1903 one year later the next Declarations of impossibilities began Ferdinand fos a French army General credited with having one of the most original and subtle Minds in the French army said airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value 40 years later AO experts coined the term transonic they debed should it have 1 s or two you see they were having trouble in this flight regime and it wasn't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound in 1947 there was no wind tunnel data Beyond Mach 0.85 and yet on Tuesday October 14th 1947 Chuck gagger climbed into the cockpit of his Bell X1 and he flew towards an unknown possibility and in so doing he became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound six of eight Atlas rockets blew up on the pad after 11 complete mission failures we got our first images from space and on that first flight we got more data than in all you two missions combined it took a lot of failures to get there since we took to the sky we have wanted to fly faster and farther and to do so we've had to believe in impossible things and we've had to refuse to fear failure that's still true today today we don't talk about flying trans sonically or even supersonically we talk about flying hypersonically not mock 2 or Mach 3 mach 20 at mach 20 we can fly from New York to Long Beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds at that speed the surface of the air foil is the temperature of molten steel 3,500 de F like a blast furnace we are essentially burning the air foil as we fly it and we are flying it or trying to DARPA Hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built it's boosted to near space at top a minitar 4 rocket now the minitar 4 has too much impulse so we have to Bleed It Off by flying the rocket at an 89° angle of attack for portions of the trajectory that's an unnatural act for a rocket the third stage has a camera we call it rocket Cam and it's pointed at the Hypersonic glider this is the actual rocket cam footage from flight one now to conceal the shape we changed the aspect ratio a little bit but this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider as it heads into the atmosphere back towards Earth we've flown twice in the first flight no aerodynamic control of the vehicle but we collected more Hypersonic flight data than in 30 years of groundbased testing combined and in the second flight 3 minutes of fully controlled aerodynamic flight at mach 20 we must fly again because amazing never been done before things require that you fly you can't learn to fly at Mack 20 unless you fly and while there's no substitute for Speed maneuverability is a very close second if a mock 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds to get from New York to Long Beach a hummingbird would take well days you see hummingbirds are not Hypersonic but they are maneuverable in fact the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards it can fly up down forwards backwards even upside down and so if we wanted to fly in this room or place places where humans can't go we'd need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so this is a hummingbird drone it can fly in all directions even backwards it can hover and rotate this prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera it weighs less than one ablea battery it does not eat nectar in 2008 it flew for a whopping 20 seconds a year later 2 minutes then six eventually 11 many prototypes crashed many but there's no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly it's beautiful isn't it wow it's great Matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot failure is part of creating new and amazing things we cannot both fear failure and make amazing new things like a robot with the stability of a dog on rough terrain or maybe even ice a robot that can run like a cheetah or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human or perhaps Spider-Man will one day be gecko man a gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe one square mimer of a gecko's foot pad has 14,000 hairlike structures called sete they are used to help it grip to surfaces using intermolecular forces today we can manufacture structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko's foot the result of four 4x4 in artificial nanog gecko adhesive can support a static load of 660 lb that's enough to stick 6 42 in plasma TVs to your wall no nails so much for velcro right and it's not just passive structures it's entire machines this is a spider mite it's 1 mm long but it looks like Godzilla next to these micro machines in the world of Godzilla spidermites we can make millions of mirrors each 1if the diameter of a human hair moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second to make large screen displays so that we can watch movies like Godzilla in high def and if we can build machines at that scale what what about Eiffel Tower like trusses at the micro scale today we are making metals that are lighter than styrofoam so light they can sit a top a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air so light that you can make a car that two people can lift but so strong that it has the crash worthiness of an SUV from the smallest wisp of air air to the powerful forces of Nature's storms there are 44 lightning strikes per second around the globe each lightning bolt heats the air to 44,000 de F hotter than the surface of the Sun what if we could use these electromagnetic pulses as beacons beacons in a moving network of powerful transmitters experiments suggest that lightning could be the next GPS electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains using a grid the size of your thumb with 32 electrodes on the surface of his brain Tim uses his thoughts B I want to control an advanced prosthetic arm and his thoughts made him reach for Katie this is the first time time a human has controlled a robot with thought alone sorry and it is the first time that Tim has held Katie's hand in seven years that moment mattered to Tim and Katie and this green goo May someday matter to you this green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life it was made in tobacco plants tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever and if it seems far-fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy what about Gamers that could solve problems that experts can't solve last September the gamers of foldit solved the three-dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to AIDS in reesus monkeys now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments for 15 years it was unsolved in the scientific Community The Gamers of Fold It solved it in 15 days now they were able to do so by working together they were able to work together because they're connected by the internet and others also connected to the internet used it as an instrument of democracy and together they changed the fate of their Nation the internet is home to two billion people or 30% of the world's population it allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals it allows us to amplify our voices and our p power as a group but it too had humble beginnings in 1969 the internet was but a dream a few sketches on a piece of paper and then on October 29th the first packet switched message was sent from UCLA to Sri the first two letters of the word login that's all that made it through an l and an O and then a buffer overflow crashed the system two letters an l and an O now a worldwide Force so who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called DARPA they are nerds and they are heroes Among Us they challenge existing perspectives at the edges of Science and under the most demanding of conditions they remind us that we can change the world if we defy The Impossible and we refuse to fear failure they remind us that we all have nerd power sometimes we just forget you see there was a time when you weren't afraid of failure when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing you were good at math you could build things you were an astronaut an adventurer jacqu custo you could jump higher run faster kick harder than anyone you believed in impossible things and you were Fearless you were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero scientists and Engineers can indeed change the world so can you you were born to so go ahead ask yourself what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail now I want to say this is not easy it's hard to hold on to this feeling really hard I guess in some way I sort of believe it's supposed to be hard doubt and fear always creep in we think someone else someone smarter than us someone more capable someone with more resources will solve that problem but there isn't anyone else there's just you and if we're lucky in that moment someone steps into that doubt and fear takes a hand and says let me help you believe Jason Harley did that for me Jason started at DARPA on March 18th 2010 he was with with our transportation team I saw Jason nearly every day sometimes twice a day and more so than most he saw the highs and the lows the celebrations and the disappointments and on one particularly dark day for me Jason sat down and he wrote an email he was encouraging but firm and when he hit send he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make it mattered to me in that moment and still today when I doubt when I feel afraid when I need to reconnect with that feeling I remember his words they were so powerful supero supero supero [Music] super superhero superhero music superhero superhero music superhero [Music] superhero because that's what being a superhero is all [Applause] about there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you and remember be nice to nerds thank you thank you rea thank you I have a couple of questions the um so that glider of yours the mark 20 glider Mark glider the first one uh no control it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere it did what happened on that second flight yeah it also went in

work with some of the most amazing people and with that exhilaration comes a really deep sense of responsibility and so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what's possible right and this tremendous seriousness of what it means Regina that was jaw dropping as I say thank you so much for coming to thank [Applause] [Music] you

an SUV from the smallest wisp of air air to the powerful forces of Nature's storms there are 44 lightning strikes per second around the globe each lightning bolt heats the air to 44,000 de F hotter than the surface of the Sun what if we could use these electromagnetic pulses as beacons beacons in a moving network of powerful transmitters experiments suggest that lightning could be the next GPS electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains using a grid the size of your thumb with 32 electrodes on the surface of his brain Tim uses his thoughts B I want to control an advanced prosthetic arm and his thoughts made him reach for Katie this is the first time time a human has controlled a robot with thought alone sorry and it is the first time that Tim has held Katie's hand in seven years that moment mattered to Tim and Katie and this green goo May someday matter to you this green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life it was made in tobacco plants tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever and if it seems far-fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy what about Gamers that could solve problems that experts can't solve last September the gamers of foldit solved the three-dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to AIDS in reesus monkeys now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments for 15 years it was unsolved in the scientific Community The Gamers of Fold It solved it in 15 days now they were able to do so by working together they were able to work together because they're connected by the internet and others also connected to the internet used it as an instrument of democracy and together they changed the fate of their Nation the internet is home to two billion people or 30% of the world's population it allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals it allows us to amplify our voices and our p power as a group but it too had humble beginnings in 1969 the internet was but a dream a few sketches on a piece of paper and then on October 29th the first packet switched message was sent from UCLA to Sri the first two letters of the word login that's all that made it through an l and an O and then a buffer overflow crashed the system two letters an l and an O now a worldwide Force so who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called DARPA they are nerds and they are heroes Among Us they challenge existing perspectives at the edges of Science and under the most demanding of conditions they remind us that we can change the world if we defy The Impossible and we refuse to fear failure they remind us that we all have nerd power sometimes we just forget you see there was a time when you weren't afraid of failure when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing you were good at math you could build things you were an astronaut an adventurer jacqu custo you could jump higher run faster kick harder than anyone you believed in impossible things and you were Fearless you were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero scientists and Engineers can indeed change the world so can you you were born to so go ahead ask yourself what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail now I want to say this is not easy it's hard to hold on to this feeling really hard I guess in some way I sort of believe it's supposed to be hard doubt and fear always creep in we think someone else someone smarter than us someone more capable someone with more resources will solve that problem but there isn't anyone else there's just you and if we're lucky in that moment someone steps into that doubt and fear takes a hand and says let me help you believe Jason Harley did that for me Jason started at DARPA on March 18th 2010 he was with with our transportation team I saw Jason nearly every day sometimes twice a day and more so than most he saw the highs and the lows the celebrations and the disappointments and on one particularly dark day for me Jason sat down and he wrote an email he was encouraging but firm and when he hit send he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make it mattered to me in that moment and still today when I doubt when I feel afraid when I need to reconnect with that feeling I remember his words they were so powerful supero supero supero [Music] super superhero superhero music superhero superhero music superhero [Music] superhero because that's what being a superhero is all [Applause] about there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you and remember be nice to nerds thank you thank you rea thank you I have a couple of questions the um so that glider of yours the mark 20 glider Mark glider the first one uh no control it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere it did what happened on that second flight yeah it also went in the Pacific but this time under control well yeah no we didn't fly it into the Pacific right um no there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed and so in the second flight we were able to get 3 minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it I I imagine you're not planning to open up to passenger service from New York to Long Beach it might be a little warm what do you picture what what do you picture that glider being used for well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this how it's ultimately used will be determined by the military now the purpose of the vehicle though the purpose of the technology is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes and to carry a payload of more than a few pounds yeah like what's the payload it could carry well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be right we got to fly it first but not necessarily just a camera yeah no not necessarily just a camera um it it's it's amazing um the the the the the hummingbird um I mean I'm curious you know you you started your beautiful sequence on flight with with a wing a plane kind of trying to flap its wings and failing horribly and there haven't been that many planes built since that flat Wings why why did we think that this was the time to go bio mimicry and and copy a hummingbird isn't that a very expensive solution for a small well maneuverable flying object so I mean in part we wondered if it was possible to do it and you have to revisit these questions over time the folks at aerovironment tried 300 or more different Wing designs 12 different forms of the avionics took them 10 full prototypes to get something that would actually fly but there's something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something you'd recognize so we often talk about Stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing but when things look just natural you also don't see them ah ah so it's not necessar Ste it's partly the the look actually sure look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters I mean because that's the that's I think as well as the a at looking at that I'm sure some people here are thinking you know technology catches up so quick how long is it before some crazed geek with a little remote control flies R through a window of the White House I mean do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here well look our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise that's what we do it would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we didn't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time it's just the nature of what we do now our responsibility is to push that edge and you know we have to be of course Mindful and responsible of how the technology is developed and ultimately used but we can't simply close our eyes and pretend that it isn't advancing it's advancing I mean you're you're clearly a really inspiring leader and um um you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention but at a personal level I mean in a way I can't imagine doing your job do you wake up in the night sometimes just asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of of your team Brilliance sure I mean I think it would you couldn't be human if you didn't ask those questions you know how do you answer them well I don't always have answers for them right I think that um we learn as time goes on I mean my job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you can have I work with some of the most amazing people and with that exhilaration comes a really deep sense of responsibility and so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what's possible right and this tremendous seriousness of what it means Regina that was jaw dropping as I say thank you so much for coming to thank [Applause] [Music] you

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Mysteries of Vernacular Miniature, something distinctively smaller than other members of its type or class. Miniature traces its roots to the Latin, minium, which meant, "red lead". Minium referred, in particular, to a compound of lead used as a pigment in Medieval times. In those days, because there were no printing presses, groups of scribes were tasked with painstakingly copying all books by hand. Whenever they needed to denote a chapter break or a division of text, scribes would switch from standard black to the red pigment, minium. Another important visual device used to increase the prominence of certain portions of text was to set them off with large, ornate, and colorful capital letters, often surrounded by tiny, detailed paintings. The Italians began to refer to these elaborate and diminutive paintings as miniatura, illuminations. Because of the necessarily small size of the paintings, miniatura began to be associated with all things wee and spawned to other words with the same base, like the Latin minimum, for least. Miniatura was transmuted into English in the 16th century as the word, miniature, and since that time, it has had the exact same meaning we use today.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar One of the grandest scientific tools ever made by mankind is called an atom smasher. And I mean literally grand. The biggest one ever built, the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, is a ring with a circumference of about 18 miles. That's more than the entire length of Manhattan. So what is an atom smasher? It is a device that collides atomic nuclei together at extremely high energy. The most powerful one scientists have ever built can heat matter to the hottest temperatures ever achieved, temperatures last seen at a trillionth of second after the universe began. Our accelerators are full of engineering superlatives. The beam-containing region of the LHC is a vacuum, with lower pressure than what surrounds the international space station, and is 456 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, colder than the temperature of deepest space. A previous accelerator sitting in the LHC tunnel holds the world record for velocity, accelerating an electron to a speed so fast that if it were to race a photon of light, it would take about 14 minutes for the photon to get a lead of about 10 feet. If that doesn't impress you, remember the photon is fastest thing in the universe, it goes about 186,000 miles per second. So how do these subatomic particle accelerators work? Well, they use electric fields. Electric fields make charged particles move in the same way that gravity will pull a dropped baseball. The force from the electric field will pull a particle to make it move. The speed will continue to increase until the charged particle is moving incredibly fast. A simple particle accelerator can be made by hooking two parallel metal plates to a battery. The charge from the battery moves on to the two metal plates and makes an electric field that pulls the particle along. And that's it, you got a particle accelerator. The problem is that an accelerator built this way is very weak. Building a modern accelerator like the LHC this way would take over five trillion standard D-cell batteries. So scientists use much stronger batteries and put them one after another. An earlier accelerator used this method and was about a mile long and was equivalent to 30 billion batteries. However, to make an accelerator that is equivalent to five trillion batteries would require an accelerator 150 miles long. Scientists needed another way. While electric fields would make a particle go faster, magnetic fields make them move in a circular path. If you put an electric field along the circle, you don't need to use miles of electric fields, you can use a single electric field over and over again. The beams go around the circle, and each time they gain more energy. So very high-energy accelerators consist of a short region with accelerating electric fields, combined with long series of magnets that guide the particles in a circle. The strength of the magnets and the radius of the circular path determines the maximum energy of the beam. Once the beam is zooming along, then the real fun begins, the smashing. The reason physicists want to get those particles moving so fast is so that they can slam them into one another. These collisions can teach us about the fundamental rules that govern matter, but they'd be impossible without the feat of engineering that is the particle accelerator.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar One of the grandest scientific tools ever made by mankind is called an atom smasher. And I mean literally grand. The biggest one ever built, the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, is a ring with a circumference of about 18 miles. That's more than the entire length of Manhattan. So what is an atom smasher? It is a device that collides atomic nuclei together at extremely high energy. The most powerful one scientists have ever built can heat matter to the hottest temperatures ever achieved, temperatures last seen at a trillionth of second after the universe began. Our accelerators are full of engineering superlatives. The beam-containing region of the LHC is a vacuum, with lower pressure than what surrounds the international space station, and is 456 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, colder than the temperature of deepest space. A previous accelerator sitting in the LHC tunnel holds the world record for velocity, accelerating an electron to a speed so fast that if it were to race a photon of light, it would take about 14 minutes for the photon to get a lead of about 10 feet. If that doesn't impress you, remember the photon is fastest thing in the universe, it goes about 186,000 miles per second. So how do these subatomic particle accelerators work? Well, they use electric fields. Electric fields make charged particles move in the same way that gravity will pull a dropped baseball. The force from the electric field will pull a particle to make it move. The speed will continue to increase until the charged particle is moving incredibly fast. A simple particle accelerator can be made by hooking two parallel metal plates to a battery. The charge from the battery moves on to the two metal plates and makes an electric field that pulls the particle along. And that's it, you got a particle accelerator. The problem is that an accelerator built this way is very weak. Building a modern accelerator like the LHC this way would take over five trillion standard D-cell batteries. So scientists use much stronger batteries and put them one after another. An earlier accelerator used this method and was about a mile long and was equivalent to 30 billion batteries. However, to make an accelerator that is equivalent to five trillion batteries would require an accelerator 150 miles long. Scientists needed another way. While electric fields would make a particle go faster, magnetic fields make them move in a circular path. If you put an electric field along the circle, you don't need to use miles of electric fields, you can use a single electric field over and over again. The beams go around the circle, and each time they gain more energy. So very high-energy accelerators consist of a short region with accelerating electric fields, combined with long series of magnets that guide the particles in a circle. The strength of the magnets and the radius of the circular path determines the maximum energy of the beam. Once the beam is zooming along, then the real fun begins, the smashing. The reason physicists want to get those particles moving so fast is so that they can slam them into one another. These collisions can teach us about the fundamental rules that govern matter, but they'd be impossible without the feat of engineering that is the particle accelerator.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Nameste. I'm from India, and India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world. It has contributed to the world concepts such as yoga, ayurveda, spicy chicken tikka, and Vedic math. Vedic math is one of the world's easiest and simplest way to do math. We are going to combine together and do some number crunching today. So what we are going to first do is multiply by 11. We're going to do it together, so if you blink, you're going to miss it. So just watch it, OK. So we're going to do 32 times 11, OK. So we split 3, and we split 2, and we add 3 and 2 and paste it on top, and we get the answer as 352. That's it. Let's try another sum. 45 times 11. Let's hear it. Exactly, that's 495. And 75 times 11. So it gives you 7,125, 1 gets carried over and it becomes 825. That's how simple it is. OK, this is the principle behind it where a is the coefficient. Let's move on. OK, now what we're going to do is the base method. OK, this is used to multiply numbers very close to the powers of 10, like 10, 100, 1,000, and so on. So we have a sum here, say 99 times 97. OK, now tell me, is 99 more than 100 or less than 100? Less by how much? So we write minus 01. And 97 is less than 100 by how much? So we write minus 03. So what we're going to do is we're going to cross subtract and get the first part of the answer, like this. We're going to do cross subtraction. 97 minus 01 would give us 96. and we multiply 03 times 01 vertically, and we get an answer of 03. Let's check another sum. Try and do it yourselves. We got 98, which is, is it more than a 100, less than 100? By how much? And 97 is 3. So we got 98, we go crosswise, we got 98 minus 3, or we can do 97 minus 2, they'll all give you the same answer. So that would give us 95. And the second part would be 06. So that's our answer. OK, let's take a bigger number. Let's try this one. Here the base is 1,000. So we got -004, and 997 would be -003. We go crosswise like this, and we get 996 minus 003 would give us 993, and 004 times 003 would give us 012. And that's our answer. Thank you. 14 times 12. OK, here the base is 10. OK, so is 14 more than 10 or less than 10? More, so we got plus 4, and 12, we got plus 2. Again, we apply the same rule, so we do 12 plus 4, which gives us 16, like this. And we multiply 2 and 4, that gives us 8. So now, all of us here, we're going to do mental squaring, OK. Everybody is going to participate here, and we're going to do squares of numbers more than 100 mentally right now. So we got 101, OK, now visualize on the board, what's going to be on the right hand side. Plus 01, so we got that. OK, now we add plus sides, right? Yes? No? So we got 101 plus 01, that would give us 102, and, see here, like this. And 01 is getting squared, right? So that would give us 01, and that's your answer. Try the next one. Let's try 102 squared. Let's try, everybody. So 100, so 102 would be 10404. OK, now the next one, try it everybody together. I'll give you 5 seconds. OK, let's say it together, let's say it together, OK. [10609] 10609 and that's the answer. Woo! 104 squared, how much would that be? Calculate it, 5 seconds. Come on, girls in the back. OK, so the answer would be 10816. OK, let's do the next one: 105 squared. Oh, no, no, no, no, we're going to try over, we're going to try over, OK? OK. I'll give you 5 seconds, just think about it. OK, now we're going to go, OK? 11025. OK, let's going to do the next one, 106 squared. Try it, come one, everybody, it's simple and easy. [11236] OK, let's do it one more time. 11236. Now 107, think, hold on, don't say anything out loud, just think mentally, 107 squared. OK, now let's say it out loud. 11449. And 108 squared. [11664] Fantastic, give yourself a round of applause, come on! And this is the principle behind this, where a and b are the excesses or the deficiency from the base. I'm going to teach you in Vedic math, there are 16 sutras, or word formulas, OK. They are very visual and one of them is called, "vertically and crosswise," through which you can multiply any number by any number in a single line. So I'm going to do a two-digit by a two-digit multiplication. Let's do this. So we got 31 times 12. OK, so we're going to apply the vertically and crosswise sutra. So we're going to do like this: vertically, and then we're going to go crosswise, and then we're going to do vertical again. So, 2 times 1 gives us [2], 2 times 3 gives us [6], and 1 times 1 gives us [1]. 6 plus 1, [7]. 1 times 3 gives us [3]. And that's it, and that's our answer. No more tedious calculations, no more going through the rough work, it's simple in one line. I want to show you a sum again, this time with carry-overs. The same formula, all of us here can do this, OK. Same formula. So let's get started. 4 times 2 gives us [8]. OK, now we go crosswise like this, so we're going to multiply 4 times 1, [4], and 3 times 2, [6] 4 plus 6 gives us [10]. So we put down 0, carry the 1. And 3 times 1 gives us [3], plus 1, [4]. Exactly, that's our answer, 408. OK, thank you for being such a participative audience, and we had a great time number crunching. Now I want to end with a question: whether you'd like math to be dull or boring, or fun and interesting? The choice is yours.

So we got 101, OK, now visualize on the board, what's going to be on the right hand side. Plus 01, so we got that. OK, now we add plus sides, right? Yes? No? So we got 101 plus 01, that would give us 102, and, see here, like this. And 01 is getting squared, right? So that would give us 01, and that's your answer. Try the next one. Let's try 102 squared. Let's try, everybody. So 100, so 102 would be 10404. OK, now the next one, try it everybody together. I'll give you 5 seconds. OK, let's say it together, let's say it together, OK. [10609] 10609 and that's the answer. Woo! 104 squared, how much would that be? Calculate it, 5 seconds. Come on, girls in the back. OK, so the answer would be 10816. OK, let's do the next one: 105 squared. Oh, no, no, no, no, we're going to try over, we're going to try over, OK? OK. I'll give you 5 seconds, just think about it. OK, now we're going to go, OK? 11025. OK, let's going to do the next one, 106 squared. Try it, come one, everybody, it's simple and easy. [11236] OK, let's do it one more time. 11236. Now 107, think, hold on, don't say anything out loud, just think mentally, 107 squared. OK, now let's say it out loud. 11449. And 108 squared. [11664] Fantastic, give yourself a round of applause, come on! And this is the principle behind this, where a and b are the excesses or the deficiency from the base. I'm going to teach you in Vedic math, there are 16 sutras, or word formulas, OK. They are very visual and one of them is called, "vertically and crosswise," through which you can multiply any number by any number in a single line. So I'm going to do a two-digit by a two-digit multiplication. Let's do this. So we got 31 times 12. OK, so we're going to apply the vertically and crosswise sutra. So we're going to do like this: vertically, and then we're going to go crosswise, and then we're going to do vertical again. So, 2 times 1 gives us [2], 2 times 3 gives us [6], and 1 times 1 gives us [1]. 6 plus 1, [7]. 1 times 3 gives us [3]. And that's it, and that's our answer. No more tedious calculations, no more going through the rough work, it's simple in one line. I want to show you a sum again, this time with carry-overs. The same formula, all of us here can do this, OK. Same formula. So let's get started. 4 times 2 gives us [8]. OK, now we go crosswise like this, so we're going to multiply 4 times 1, [4], and 3 times 2, [6] 4 plus 6 gives us [10]. So we put down 0, carry the 1. And 3 times 1 gives us [3], plus 1, [4]. Exactly, that's our answer, 408. OK, thank you for being such a participative audience, and we had a great time number crunching. Now I want to end with a question: whether you'd like math to be dull or boring, or fun and interesting? The choice is yours.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Nameste. I'm from India, and India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world. It has contributed to the world concepts such as yoga, ayurveda, spicy chicken tikka, and Vedic math. Vedic math is one of the world's easiest and simplest way to do math. We are going to combine together and do some number crunching today. So what we are going to first do is multiply by 11. We're going to do it together, so if you blink, you're going to miss it. So just watch it, OK. So we're going to do 32 times 11, OK. So we split 3, and we split 2, and we add 3 and 2 and paste it on top, and we get the answer as 352. That's it. Let's try another sum. 45 times 11. Let's hear it. Exactly, that's 495. And 75 times 11. So it gives you 7,125, 1 gets carried over and it becomes 825. That's how simple it is. OK, this is the principle behind it where a is the coefficient. Let's move on. OK, now what we're going to do is the base method. OK, this is used to multiply numbers very close to the powers of 10, like 10, 100, 1,000, and so on. So we have a sum here, say 99 times 97. OK, now tell me, is 99 more than 100 or less than 100? Less by how much? So we write minus 01. And 97 is less than 100 by how much? So we write minus 03. So what we're going to do is we're going to cross subtract and get the first part of the answer, like this. We're going to do cross subtraction. 97 minus 01 would give us 96. and we multiply 03 times 01 vertically, and we get an answer of 03. Let's check another sum. Try and do it yourselves. We got 98, which is, is it more than a 100, less than 100? By how much? And 97 is 3. So we got 98, we go crosswise, we got 98 minus 3, or we can do 97 minus 2, they'll all give you the same answer. So that would give us 95. And the second part would be 06. So that's our answer. OK, let's take a bigger number. Let's try this one. Here the base is 1,000. So we got -004, and 997 would be -003. We go crosswise like this, and we get 996 minus 003 would give us 993, and 004 times 003 would give us 012. And that's our answer. Thank you. 14 times 12. OK, here the base is 10. OK, so is 14 more than 10 or less than 10? More, so we got plus 4, and 12, we got plus 2. Again, we apply the same rule, so we do 12 plus 4, which gives us 16, like this. And we multiply 2 and 4, that gives us 8. So now, all of us here, we're going to do mental squaring, OK. Everybody is going to participate here, and we're going to do squares of numbers more than 100 mentally right now. So we got 101, OK, now visualize on the board, what's going to be on the right hand side. Plus 01, so we got that. OK, now we add plus sides, right? Yes? No?

Now 107, think, hold on, don't say anything out loud, just think mentally, 107 squared. OK, now let's say it out loud. 11449. And 108 squared.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the base for the number 995 when using The Base Method. Although there isn't a direct match, Question 2 mentions the base method and uses numbers close to the powers of 10, which is similar to the concept in the ground truth MCQ.

However, a closer match would be a question that directly asks about the base for a specific number. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask such a question. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the closest, although it's still not a direct match.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar This is Zeno of Elea, an ancient Greek philosopher famous for inventing a number of paradoxes, arguments that seem logical, but whose conclusion is absurd or contradictory. For more than 2,000 years, Zeno's mind-bending riddles have inspired mathematicians and philosophers to better understand the nature of infinity. One of the best known of Zeno's problems is called the dichotomy paradox, which means, "the paradox of cutting in two" in ancient Greek. It goes something like this: After a long day of sitting around, thinking, Zeno decides to walk from his house to the park. The fresh air clears his mind and help him think better. In order to get to the park, he first has to get half way to the park. This portion of his journey takes some finite amount of time. Once he gets to the halfway point, he needs to walk half the remaining distance. Again, this takes a finite amount of time. Once he gets there, he still needs to walk half the distance that's left, which takes another finite amount of time. This happens again and again and again. You can see that we can keep going like this forever, dividing whatever distance is left into smaller and smaller pieces, each of which takes some finite time to traverse. So, how long does it take Zeno to get to the park? Well, to find out, you need to add the times of each of the pieces of the journey. The problem is, there are infinitely many of these finite-sized pieces. So, shouldn't the total time be infinity? This argument, by the way, is completely general. It says that traveling from any location to any other location should take an infinite amount of time. In other words, it says that all motion is impossible. This conclusion is clearly absurd, but where is the flaw in the logic? To resolve the paradox, it helps to turn the story into a math problem. Let's supposed that Zeno's house is one mile from the park and that Zeno walks at one mile per hour. Common sense tells us that the time for the journey should be one hour. But, let's look at things from Zeno's point of view and divide up the journey into pieces. The first half of the journey takes half an hour, the next part takes quarter of an hour, the third part takes an eighth of an hour, and so on. Summing up all these times, we get a series that looks like this. "Now", Zeno might say, "since there are infinitely many of terms on the right side of the equation, and each individual term is finite, the sum should equal infinity, right?" This is the problem with Zeno's argument. As mathematicians have since realized, it is possible to add up infinitely many finite-sized terms and still get a finite answer. "How?" you ask. Well, let's think of it this way. Let's start with a square that has area of one meter. Now let's chop the square in half, and then chop the remaining half in half, and so on. While we're doing this, let's keep track of the areas of the pieces. The first slice makes two parts, each with an area of one-half The next slice divides one of those halves in half, and so on. But, no matter how many times we slice up the boxes, the total area is still the sum of the areas of all the pieces. Now you can see why we choose this particular way of cutting up the square. We've obtained the same infinite series as we had for the time of Zeno's journey. As we construct more and more blue pieces, to use the math jargon, as we take the limit as n tends to infinity, the entire square becomes covered with blue. But the area of the square is just one unit, and so the infinite sum must equal one. Going back to Zeno's journey, we can now see how how the paradox is resolved. Not only does the infinite series sum to a finite answer, but that finite answer is the same one that common sense tells us is true. Zeno's journey takes one hour.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 8: What is the limit of the sum of the areas of the pieces of the square as n tends to infinity? Options: A. The sum is infinite, B. The sum is finite, C. The limit does not exist, D. The limit is 0**

However, this question is not an exact match, as it refers to the limit of the sum of the areas of the pieces of the square, whereas the ground truth MCQ refers to an infinite series in general.

A more similar question would be one that directly addresses the concept of infinite series and their sums. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 4: What is the flaw in Zeno's logic that leads to the conclusion that all motion is impossible? Options: A. He assumes that infinite series always sum to infinity, B. He assumes that the sum of an infinite series of finite terms is always finite, C. He assumes that time is infinite, D. He assumes that distance is infinite** is the closest match, as it addresses the concept of infinite series and their sums in the context of Zeno's paradox.

However, I must note that the options in Question 4 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would recommend generating new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is **Question 4**. However, please note that this is not an exact match, and a more similar question should be generated to accurately assess the student's understanding of the concept.

This conclusion is clearly absurd, but where is the flaw in the logic? To resolve the paradox, it helps to turn the story into a math problem. Let's supposed that Zeno's house is one mile from the park and that Zeno walks at one mile per hour. Common sense tells us that the time for the journey should be one hour. But, let's look at things from Zeno's point of view and divide up the journey into pieces. The first half of the journey takes half an hour, the next part takes quarter of an hour, the third part takes an eighth of an hour, and so on. Summing up all these times, we get a series that looks like this. "Now", Zeno might say, "since there are infinitely many of terms on the right side of the equation, and each individual term is finite, the sum should equal infinity, right?" This is the problem with Zeno's argument. As mathematicians have since realized, it is possible to add up infinitely many finite-sized terms and still get a finite answer. "How?" you ask. Well, let's think of it this way. Let's start with a square that has area of one meter. Now let's chop the square in half, and then chop the remaining half in half, and so on. While we're doing this, let's keep track of the areas of the pieces. The first slice makes two parts, each with an area of one-half The next slice divides one of those halves in half, and so on. But, no matter how many times we slice up the boxes, the total area is still the sum of the areas of all the pieces. Now you can see why we choose this particular way of cutting up the square. We've obtained the same infinite series as we had for the time of Zeno's journey. As we construct more and more blue pieces, to use the math jargon, as we take the limit as n tends to infinity, the entire square becomes covered with blue. But the area of the square is just one unit, and so the infinite sum must equal one. Going back to Zeno's journey, we can now see how how the paradox is resolved. Not only does the infinite series sum to a finite answer, but that finite answer is the same one that common sense tells us is true. Zeno's journey takes one hour.

[Music] [Applause] this man is wearing what we call a bee beard a beard full of bees now this is what many of you might picture when you think about honeybees maybe insects or maybe anything that has more legs than two and let me start by telling you I gotcha I understand that but there are many things to know and I want you to open your minds here keep them open and change your perspective about honey bees notice that this man is not getting stung he probably has a queen bee tied to his chin and the other bees are attracted to it so this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees and that goes deep back for thousands of years we're very co-evolved because we depend on bees for pollination and even more recently as an economic commodity many of you may have heard that honey bees are disappearing not just dying but they're gone we don't even find dead bodies this is called colony collapse disorder and it's bizarre researchers around the globe still do not know what's causing it but what we do know is that with the declining numbers of bees the cost of over 130 Fruit and Vegetable crops that we rely on for food is going up in price so honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture here you can see some pictures of what are called Green roofs or Urban agriculture we're familiar with the image on the left that shows a local neighborhood Garden in the South End that's where I call home have a beehive in the backyard and perhaps a green roof in the future when we're further utilizing urban areas where there are stacks of uh Garden spaces check out this image above the Orange Line in Boston try to spot the Beehive it's there it's on the rooftop right on the corner there and it's been there for a couple of years now the way that Urban beekeeping currently operates is that the beehives are quite hidden and it's not because they need to be it's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea and that's why I want you today to try to think about this think about the benefit of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works so we know flowers we know fruits and vegetables even some alphalpha and hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat rely on pollinators but you've got male and female parts to a plant here and basically pollinators are attracted to plants for their nectar and in the process a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen or that male kind of sperm counterpart along the way and then travel to different flowers and eventually an apple in this case will be produced you can see the orientation the stem is down the blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it but that's a basic overview of how pollination works and let's think about Urban living not today and not in the past but what about in a hundred years what's it going to look like we have huge Grand challenges these days of habitat loss where we have more and more people billions of people in 100 years God knows how many people and how little space there will be to fit all of them so we need to change the way that we see cities and looking at this picture on the left of New York City today you can see how gray and brown it is we have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back into the atmosphere contributing to Global Climate Change no doubt what about in a 100 years if we have green rooftops everywhere and gardening and we create our own crops right in the cities we save on the costs of transportation we save uh on a healthier diet and we also educate and create new jobs locally we need bees for the future of our cities and urban living here's some data that we collected through our company with best bees where we deliver install and manage honeybee hives for anybody who wants them in the city in the countryside and we introduce honeybees and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop or fire escape for even that matter and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is there's a counterintuitive Trend that we noticed in these numbers so let's look at the first metric here overwintering survival now this has been a huge problem for many years basically since the late 1980s when the veroa might came and brought many different viruses bacteria and fungal diseases with it overwintering success is hard and that's when most of the colonies are lost and we found that in the cities bees are surviving better than they are in the country a bit counterintuitive right we think oh bees Countryside agriculture but that's not what the bees are showing the bees like it in the city furthermore they also produce more honey the the urban honey is delicious the bees in Boston on this the rooftop of the seport hotel where we have hundreds of thousands of bees flying overhead right now that I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by are going to all of the local Community Gardens and making delicious healthy honey that just tastes like the flowers in our city so the yield for urban hives in terms of Honey production is higher as well as the overwintering survival compared to rural areas again a bit counterintuitive and looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee Health we can go back to the year 950 and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland so the problems with bees today isn't necessarily something new it has been happening oh since over a thousand years ago but what we don't really notice are these problems in cities so one thing I want to encourage you to think about is the idea of what an urban island is you think in the city maybe the temperature is warmer why are bees doing better in the city this is a big question now to help us understand why they should be in the city perhaps there's more pollen in the city with the trains coming into urban hubs they can carry pollen with them very light pollen and it's just a big supermarket in the city a lot of Linden trees live along the railroad tracks perhaps there fewer pesticides in the cities than there are in urban areas perhaps there other things that we're just not thinking about yet but that's one idea to think about Urban islands and colony collapse disorder is not the only thing affecting honeybees honeybees are dying and it's a huge huge Grand Challenge of our time what you can see up here is a map of the world and we're tracking the spread of this veroa Mite now the veroa is what changed the game in beekeeping and you can see at the top right the years are changing we're coming up to modern times and you can see the spread of the verite from the early 1900s through now it's 1968 and we're pretty much covering Asia 1971 we saw it spread to Europe and South America and then when we get to the 1980s and specifically in 1987 the veroa might finally came to North America into the United States and that is when the game changed for honeybees in the United States many of us will remember our childhood growing up maybe you got stung by a bee you saw bees and flowers think of the kids today their childhood's a bit different they don't experience this the bees just aren't around anymore so we need bees and they're disappearing and it's a big problem what can we do here so what I do is honeybee research I got my PhD studying honeybee health I started in 200 5 studying honeybees in 2006 honeybees started disappearing so suddenly like this little nerd kid going to school working with bugs became very relevant in the world and it worked out that way so my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier I don't research what's killing the bees per se I'm not one of the many researchers around the world who's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees we're looking at ways to make bees healthier through vaccine through yogurt like probiotics and other types of Therapies in ways that can be fed Orly to bees and this process is so easy even a seven-year-old can do it you just mix up some pollen sugar and water and whatever active ingredient you want to put in and you just give it right to the Bees No chemicals involved just immune boosters humans think about our own health in a prospective way we exercise we eat healthy we take vitamins why don't we think about honeybees in that same type of way bring them to areas where they're thriving and try to make them healthier before they get sick I spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines with needles like years years at the bench oh my gosh it's 3:00 a.m. and I'm still pricking bees and then one day I said why don't we just do an oral vaccine it's like GH so that's that's what we do I'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives because they can be anything I mean really open your mind with this you can paint a hive to match your home you can hide a hive inside your home these are three hives on the rooftop of the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel and they're beautiful here I mean we matched the new color of the inside of their rooms to do some type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets and these bees are terrific and they also will use herbs that are growing in the garden that's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking and the honey they do live events they'll use that honey at their bars honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there we also have a classroom hives project where uh this is a nonprofit Venture we're spreading the word around the world for how honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom or into the museum setting behind glass and used as an educational tool this Hive that you see here has been in Fenway High School for many years now the bees fly right into the Outfield of Fenway Park nobody notices it if you're not a flower these bees do not care about you they don't they don't thus they excuse me flying around some other images here and telling a part of the story that really made Urban beekeeping terrific is in New York City beekeeping was illegal until 2010 that's a big problem because what's going to pollinate all of the gardens and the produce locally hands I mean locally in Boston there is a terrific company called Green City Growers and they are going and pollinating their squash by hand with Q-tips and if they miss that 3-day window there's no fruit their clients aren't happy and people go hungry so this is important we have also some images of honey from Brooklyn now this was a mystery in the New York Times where the honey was very red and the New York State forensics Department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a Marino Cherry Factory down the street so you can tailor your honey to taste however you want by planting be friendly flowers Paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping they've had hives on the rooftop of their opera house for many years now and that's what really got people started thinking wow we can do this and we should do this also in London and in Europe across the board they're very advanced in their use of green rooftops and integrating beehives and I'll show you an ending note here I would like to encourage you to open your mind what can you do to save the bees or to help them or to think of sustainable cities in the future we really just change your perspective try to understand that bees are very important that bee isn't going to sting you if you see it the bee dies honey bees die when they sting so they don't want to do it either it's nothing to panic about they're all over the city you could even get your own Hive if you want there are great resources available and there even companies that will help get you set up and Mentor you and it's important for our educational system in the world for students to learn about agriculture worldwide such as this little girl who again is not even getting stung thank you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the importance of bees according to Noah Wilson-Rich, and the correct answer is "We depend on them for pollination."

Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is the most relevant, but it does not directly address the importance of bees. However, Question 3 mentions "Colony collapse disorder" which is related to the decline of bees and indirectly to their importance in pollination.

But a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the importance or role of bees. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the importance of bees.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar, but it's a weak match.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] this man is wearing what we call a bee beard a beard full of bees now this is what many of you might picture when you think about honeybees maybe insects or maybe anything that has more legs than two and let me start by telling you I gotcha I understand that but there are many things to know and I want you to open your minds here keep them open and change your perspective about honey bees notice that this man is not getting stung he probably has a queen bee tied to his chin and the other bees are attracted to it so this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees and that goes deep back for thousands of years we're very co-evolved because we depend on bees for pollination and even more recently as an economic commodity many of you may have heard that honey bees are disappearing not just dying but they're gone we don't even find dead bodies this is called colony collapse disorder and it's bizarre researchers around the globe still do not know what's causing it but what we do know is that with the declining numbers of bees the cost of over 130 Fruit and Vegetable crops that we rely on for food is going up in price so honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture here you can see some pictures of what are called Green roofs or Urban agriculture we're familiar with the image on the left that shows a local neighborhood Garden in the South End that's where I call home have a beehive in the backyard and perhaps a green roof in the future when we're further utilizing urban areas where there are stacks of uh Garden spaces check out this image above the Orange Line in Boston try to spot the Beehive it's there it's on the rooftop right on the corner there and it's been there for a couple of years now the way that Urban beekeeping currently operates is that the beehives are quite hidden and it's not because they need to be it's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea and that's why I want you today to try to think about this think about the benefit of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works so we know flowers we know fruits and vegetables even some alphalpha and hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat rely on pollinators but you've got male and female parts to a plant here and basically pollinators are attracted to plants for their nectar and in the process a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen or that male kind of sperm counterpart along the way and then travel to different flowers and eventually an apple in this case will be produced you can see the orientation the stem is down the blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it but that's a basic overview of how pollination works and let's think about Urban living not today and not in the past but what about in a hundred years what's it going to look like we have huge Grand challenges these days of habitat loss where we have more and more people billions of people in 100 years God knows how many people and how little space there will be to fit all of them so we need to change the way that we see cities and looking at this picture on the left of New York City today you can see how gray and brown it is we have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back into the atmosphere contributing to Global Climate Change no doubt what about in a 100 years if we have green rooftops everywhere and gardening and we create our own crops right in the cities we save on the costs of transportation we save uh on a healthier diet and we also educate and create new jobs locally we need bees for the future of our cities and urban living here's some data that we collected through our company with best bees where we deliver install and manage honeybee hives for anybody who wants them in the city in the countryside and we introduce honeybees and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop or fire escape for even that matter and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is there's a counterintuitive Trend that we noticed in these numbers so let's look at the first metric here overwintering survival now this has been a huge problem for many years basically since the late 1980s when the veroa might came and brought many different viruses bacteria and fungal diseases with it overwintering success is hard and that's when most of the colonies are lost and we found that in the cities bees are surviving better than they are in the country a bit counterintuitive right we think oh bees Countryside agriculture but that's not what the bees are showing the bees like it in the city furthermore they also produce more honey the the urban honey is delicious the bees in Boston on this the rooftop of the seport hotel where we have hundreds of thousands of bees flying overhead right now that I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by are going to all of the local Community Gardens and making delicious healthy honey that just tastes like the flowers in our city so the yield for urban hives in terms of Honey production is higher as well as the overwintering survival compared to rural areas again a bit counterintuitive and looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee Health we can go back to the year 950 and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland so the problems with bees today isn't necessarily something new it has been happening oh since over a thousand years ago but what we don't really notice are these problems in cities so one thing I want to encourage you to think about is the idea of what an urban island is you think in the city maybe the temperature is warmer why are bees doing better in the city this is a big question now to help us understand why they should be in the city perhaps there's more pollen in the city with the trains coming into urban hubs they can carry pollen with them very light pollen and it's just a big supermarket in the city a lot of Linden trees live along the railroad tracks perhaps there fewer pesticides in the cities than there are in urban areas perhaps there other things that we're just not thinking about yet but that's one idea to think about Urban islands and colony collapse disorder is not the only thing affecting honeybees honeybees are dying and it's a huge huge Grand Challenge of our time what you can see up here is a map of the world and we're tracking the spread of this veroa Mite now the veroa is what changed the game in beekeeping and you can see at the top right the years are changing we're coming up to modern times and you can see the spread of the verite from the early 1900s through now it's 1968 and we're pretty much covering Asia 1971 we saw it spread to Europe and South America and then when we get to the 1980s and specifically in 1987 the veroa might finally came to North America into the United States and that is when the game changed for honeybees in the United States many of us will remember our childhood growing up maybe you got stung by a bee you saw bees and flowers think of the kids today their childhood's a bit different they don't experience this the bees just aren't around anymore so we need bees and they're disappearing and it's a big problem what can we do here so what I do is honeybee research I got my PhD studying honeybee health I started in 200 5 studying honeybees in 2006 honeybees started disappearing so suddenly like this little nerd kid going to school working with bugs became very relevant in the world and it worked out that way so my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier I don't research what's killing the bees per se I'm not one of the many researchers around the world who's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees we're looking at ways to make bees healthier through vaccine through yogurt like probiotics and other types of Therapies in ways that can be fed Orly to bees and this process is so easy even a seven-year-old can do it you just mix up some pollen sugar and water and whatever active ingredient you want to put in and you just give it right to the Bees No chemicals involved just immune boosters humans think about our own health in a prospective way we exercise we eat healthy we take vitamins why don't we think about honeybees in that same type of way bring them to areas where they're thriving and try to make them healthier before they get sick I spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines with needles like years years at the bench oh my gosh it's 3:00 a.m. and I'm still pricking bees and then one day I said why don't we just do an oral vaccine it's like GH so that's that's what we do I'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives because they can be anything I mean really open your mind with this you can paint a hive to match your home you can hide a hive inside your home these are three hives on the rooftop of the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel and they're beautiful here I mean we matched the new color of the inside of their rooms to do some type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets and these bees are terrific and they also will use herbs that are growing in the garden that's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking and the honey they do live events they'll use that honey at their bars honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there we also have a classroom hives project where uh this is a nonprofit Venture we're spreading the word around the world for how honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom or into the museum setting behind glass and used as an educational tool this Hive that you see here has been in Fenway High School for many years now the bees fly right into the Outfield of Fenway Park nobody notices it if you're not a flower these bees do not care about you they don't they don't thus they excuse me flying around some other images here and telling a part of the story that really made Urban beekeeping terrific is in New York City beekeeping was illegal until 2010 that's a big problem because what's going to pollinate all of the gardens and the produce locally hands I mean locally in Boston there is a terrific company called Green City Growers and they are going and pollinating their squash by hand with Q-tips and if they miss that 3-day window there's no fruit their clients aren't happy and people go hungry so this is important we have also some images of honey from Brooklyn now this was a mystery in the New York Times where the honey was very red and the New York State forensics Department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a Marino Cherry Factory down the street so you can tailor your honey to taste however you want by planting be friendly flowers Paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping they've had hives on the rooftop of their opera house for many years now and that's what really got people started thinking wow we can do this and we should do this also in London and in Europe across the board they're very advanced in their use of green rooftops and integrating beehives and I'll show you an ending note here I would like to encourage you to open your mind what can you do to save the bees or to help them or to think of sustainable cities in the future we really just change your perspective try to understand that bees are very important that bee isn't going to sting you if you see it the bee dies honey bees die when they sting so they don't want to do it either it's nothing to panic about they're all over the city you could even get your own Hive if you want there are great resources available and there even companies that will help get you set up and Mentor you and it's important for our educational system in the world for students to learn about agriculture worldwide such as this little girl who again is not even getting stung thank you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the benefits of having more green rooftops and growing crops in cities, as mentioned by Noah Wilson-Rich. The correct answer is "We sustain healthier diets" and "We save on the costs of transportation."

Although there isn't a direct match, I found that Question 6 has some relevance to the topic of urban beekeeping and cities, but it doesn't match the question intent.

If I had to choose a question that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 9: "What is the term for the area where bees are thriving in cities?" Options: A. Urban island, B. Habitat loss, C. Colony collapse disorder, D. Veroa mite. This question is related to the topic of urban beekeeping and cities, but it doesn't match the question intent or content of the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new question should be generated to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar, but it's not a direct match.

Index: 9 (with the caveat that it's not a direct match)

honey bees notice that this man is not getting stung he probably has a queen bee tied to his chin and the other bees are attracted to it so this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees and that goes deep back for thousands of years we're very co-evolved because we depend on bees for pollination and even more recently as an economic commodity many of you may have heard that honey bees are disappearing not just dying but they're gone we don't even find dead bodies this is called colony collapse disorder and it's bizarre researchers around the globe still do not know what's causing it but what we do know is that with the declining numbers of bees the cost of over 130 Fruit and Vegetable crops that we rely on for food is going up in price so honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture here you can see some pictures of what are called Green roofs or Urban agriculture we're familiar with the image on the left that shows a local neighborhood Garden in the South End that's where I call home have a beehive in the backyard and perhaps a green roof in the future when we're further utilizing urban areas where there are stacks of uh Garden spaces check out this image above the Orange Line in Boston try to spot the Beehive it's there it's on the rooftop right on the corner there and it's been there for a couple of years now the way that Urban beekeeping currently operates is that the beehives are quite hidden and it's not because they need to be it's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea and that's why I want you today to try to think about this think about the benefit of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works so we know flowers we know fruits and vegetables even some alphalpha and hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat rely on pollinators but you've got male and female parts to a plant here and basically pollinators are attracted to plants for their nectar and in the process a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen or that male kind of sperm counterpart along the way and then travel to different flowers and eventually an apple in this case will be produced you can see the orientation the stem is down the blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it but that's a basic overview of how pollination works and let's think about Urban living not today and not in the past but what about in a hundred years what's it going to look like we have huge Grand challenges these days of habitat loss where we have more and more people billions of people in 100 years God knows how many people and how little space there will be to fit all of them so we need to change the way that we see cities and looking at this picture on the left of New York City today you can see how gray and brown it is we have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back into the atmosphere contributing to Global Climate Change no doubt what about in a 100 years if we have green rooftops everywhere and gardening and we create our own crops right in the cities we save on the costs of transportation we save uh on a healthier diet and we also educate and create new jobs locally we need bees for the future of our cities and urban living here's some data that we collected through our company with best bees where we deliver install and manage honeybee hives for anybody who wants them in the city in the countryside and we introduce honeybees and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop or fire escape for even that matter and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is there's a counterintuitive Trend that we noticed in these numbers so let's look at the first metric here overwintering survival now this has been a huge problem for many years basically since the late 1980s when the veroa might came and brought many different viruses bacteria and fungal diseases with it overwintering success is hard and that's when most of the colonies are lost and we found that in the cities bees are surviving better than they are in the country a bit counterintuitive right we think oh bees Countryside agriculture but that's not what the bees are showing the bees like it in the city furthermore they also produce more honey the the urban honey is delicious the bees in Boston on this the rooftop of the seport hotel where we have hundreds of thousands of bees flying overhead right now that I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by are going to all of the local Community Gardens and making delicious healthy honey that just tastes like the flowers in our city so the yield for urban hives in terms of Honey production is higher as well as the overwintering survival compared to rural areas again a bit counterintuitive and looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee Health we can go back to the year 950 and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland so the problems with bees today isn't necessarily something new it has been happening oh since over a thousand years ago but what we don't really notice are these problems in cities so one thing I want to encourage you to think about is the idea of what an urban island is you think in the city maybe the temperature is warmer why are bees doing better in the city this is a big question now to help us understand why they should be in the city perhaps there's more pollen in the city with the trains coming into urban hubs they can carry pollen with them very light pollen and it's just a big supermarket in the city a lot of Linden trees live along the railroad tracks perhaps there fewer pesticides in the cities than there are in urban areas perhaps there other things that we're just not thinking about yet but that's one idea to think about Urban islands and colony collapse disorder is not the only thing affecting honeybees honeybees are dying and it's a huge huge Grand Challenge of our time what you can see up here is a map of the world and we're tracking the spread of this veroa Mite now the veroa is what changed the game in beekeeping and you can see at the top right the years are changing we're coming up to modern times and you can see the spread of the verite from the early 1900s through now it's 1968 and we're pretty much covering Asia 1971 we saw it spread to Europe and South America and then when we get to the 1980s and specifically in 1987 the veroa might finally came to North America into the United States and that is when the game changed for honeybees in the United States many of us will remember our childhood growing up maybe you got stung by a bee you saw bees and flowers think of the kids today their childhood's a bit different they don't experience this the bees just aren't around anymore so we need bees and they're disappearing and it's a big problem what can we do here so what I do is honeybee research I got my PhD studying honeybee health I started in 200 5 studying honeybees in 2006 honeybees started disappearing so suddenly like this little nerd kid going to school working with bugs became very relevant in the world and it worked out that way so my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier I don't research what's killing the bees per se I'm not one of the many researchers around the world who's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees we're looking at ways to make bees healthier through vaccine through yogurt like probiotics and other types of Therapies in ways that can be fed Orly to bees and this process is so easy even a seven-year-old can do it you just mix up some pollen sugar and water and whatever active ingredient you want to put in and you just give it right to the Bees No chemicals involved just immune boosters humans think about our own health in a prospective way we exercise we eat healthy we take vitamins why don't we think about honeybees in that same type of way bring them to areas where they're thriving and try to make them healthier before they get sick I spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines with needles like years years at the bench oh my gosh it's 3:00 a.m. and I'm still pricking bees and then one day I said why don't we just do an oral vaccine it's like GH so that's that's what we do I'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives because they can be anything I mean really open your mind with this you can paint a hive to match your home you can hide a hive inside your home these are three hives on the rooftop of the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel and they're beautiful here I mean we matched the new color of the inside of their rooms to do some type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets and these bees are terrific and they also will use herbs that are growing in the garden that's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking and the honey they do live events they'll use that honey at their bars honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there we also have a classroom hives project where uh this is a nonprofit Venture we're spreading the word around the world for how honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom or into the museum setting behind glass and used as an educational tool this Hive that you see here has been in Fenway High School for many years now the bees fly right into the Outfield of Fenway Park nobody notices it if you're not a flower these bees do not care about you they don't they don't thus they excuse me flying around some other images here and telling a part of the story that really made Urban beekeeping terrific is in New York City beekeeping was illegal until 2010 that's a big problem because what's going to pollinate all of the gardens and the produce locally hands I mean locally in Boston there is a terrific company called Green City Growers and they are going and pollinating their squash by hand with Q-tips and if they miss that 3-day window there's no fruit their clients aren't happy and people go hungry so this is important we have also some images of honey from Brooklyn now this was a mystery in the New York Times where the honey was very red and the New York State forensics Department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a Marino Cherry Factory down the street so you can tailor your honey to taste however you want by planting be friendly flowers Paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping they've had hives on the rooftop of their opera house for many years now and that's what really got people started thinking wow we can do this and we should do this also in London and in Europe across the board they're very advanced in their use of green rooftops and integrating beehives and I'll show you an ending note here I would like to encourage you to open your mind what can you do to save the bees or to help them or to think of sustainable cities in the future we really just change your perspective try to understand that bees are very important that bee isn't going to sting you if you see it the bee dies honey bees die when they sting so they don't want to do it either it's nothing to panic about they're all over the city you could even get your own Hive if you want there are great resources available and there even companies that will help get you set up and Mentor you and it's important for our educational system in the world for students to learn about agriculture worldwide such as this little girl who again is not even getting stung thank you

**Transcript**:
by birth and by choice I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life and for the past thirty years I've worked at Ford Motor Company and for most of those years I worried about how am I gonna sell more cars and trucks but today I worry about what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks what happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles triples or even quadruples my life is guided by two great passions and the first is automobiles I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest four-door Lincoln's and leave it in the driveway and it I decided about that time at about age 10 that it would be really cool if I was a test driver so my parents would go to dinner they'd sit down I'd sneak out of the house I jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway and it was a blast and that went on for about two years until I think it was about 12 my dad brought home a Lincoln Mark three and it was snowing that day so he and mom went to dinner and I snuck out and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts or maybe even some figure eights in the snow my dad finished in early that evening and he was walking through the front hall and out the front door just about the same time I hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car and almost ended up in the fraud hall so it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while but I really began to love cars then and my first car was a 1975 electric green Mustang and even though the color was pretty hideous I did love the car and it really cemented my love affair with cars that's continued on this day but cars are really more than a passion of mine they're quite literally in my blood my great-grandfather was Henry Ford and on my mother's side my great-grandfather was Harvey Firestone so when I was born I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me but my great-grandfather Henry Ford really leave that the mission of the Ford Motor Company was to make people's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress and that's a belief that I share my other great passion is the environment and as a young boy I used to go up to northern Michigan and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in and then later wrote about and it really struck me and as the years went by in a very negative way when I would go to some stream that I'd loved and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it and so even at a young age that really resonated with me and and the whole notion of environmental preservation at a very basic level sunk in with me as a high schooler I started to read authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold and Edward Abbey and I really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world but it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict with nature and that was true until I got to college and when I got to college you could imagine my surprise when I would go to class and a number of my professors would say that Ford Motor Company and my family was kind of everything that was wrong with with our country they thought that we were more interested as an industry in profits rather than progress and that we filled the skies with smog and frankly we were the enemy I joined Ford after college after some soul-searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do but I decided I wanted to go and see if I could affect change there and as I look back you know over 30 years ago it was a little naive to think at that age that I could but I wanted to and I really discovered that my professors weren't completely wrong in fact when I got back to Detroit my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced by those in my own company and certainly by those in the end of Drake I had some very interesting conversations as you can imagine there were some within Ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that I needed to stop hanging out with quote environmental wackos I was considered a radical and I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists of course I had no intention of doing that and I kept speaking out about the environment and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability and in time my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today I mean I think most people in the industry understand that we've got to get on with it and the good news is today we are tackling the big issues of cards in the environment not only at Ford but really as an industry we're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights and with new technology we're reducing and I believe someday will eliminate co2 emissions we're starting to sell electric cars which is great we're developing alternative power trains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word economically socially and environmentally and actually although we've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do I can see the day where my two great passions cars and the environment actually come into harmony but unfortunately as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem and as I said we're not there yet we've got a lot of work to do but I can see where we will but even as we're in the process of doing that another huge problem is looming and people aren't noticing and that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened just as the environment is the problem put in its simplest terms is one of mathematics today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world and within our lifetime that numbers going to grow to about 9 billion and at that population level our planet will be dealing with the of growth and with that growth comes some severe practical problems one of which is our transportation system simply won't be able to deal with it when we look at the population growth in terms of cars it becomes even clearer today there are about a hundred million cars on the road worldwide and but with more people and greater prosperity around the world that numbers going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid-century and this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives today the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams and that's a huge waste of time and resources but that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest today the average driver in Beijing has a five-hour commute and last summer many of you probably saw this there was a hundred-mile traffic jam that took 11 days to clear in China in the decades to come seventy-five percent of the world's population will live in cities and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more so you can see the size of the issue that we're facing when you factor in population growth it's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow frankly four billion clean cars on the road are still 4 billion cars and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam so if we make no changes today what is tomorrow look like well I think you probably already have the picture traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge and they're really very very inconvenient but that's kind of all they are but the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and healthcare particularly to people that live in city centers and our quality of life is going to be severely compromised so what's going to solve this well the answer isn't going be more of the same my great-grandfather once said before he invented the Model T if I had asked people then what they wanted they would have answered we want faster horses so the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads when America began moving west we didn't add more wagon trains we built railroads and to connect our country after World War two we didn't build more two-lane highways we built the interstate highway system today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future we are going to build smart cars but we also need to build smart roads smart parking smart public transportation systems and more we don't want to waste our time sitting in traffic sitting at toll booths or looking for parking spots we need an integrated system that uses real-time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers in fact that's the kind of system that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world the city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another and they go underneath the city streets and up above you've got a series of pedestrian walkways on New York City's 34th Street gridlock will soon be replaced with a connected system of vehicle-specific quarters pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created and all of this will will cut down the average rush-hour commute to get across town in New York from about an hour today at rush hour to about 20 minutes now if you look at Hong Kong they have a very interesting system called Octopus there it's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system so parking garages buses trains they all operate within the same system now shared car services are also springing up around the world and these efforts I think are great that we're leaving congestion and there's frankly starting to save some fuel these are all really good ideas that will move us forward but what really inspires me is what's gonna be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other very soon the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and GPS information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network every morning I drive about 30 miles from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn Michigan and every night I go home my commute is a total crapshoot and I often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home but very soon we're gonna see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other so if the car ahead of me and I 94 hits traffic it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way and these systems are being tested right now and frankly they're gonna be ready for primetime pretty soon but the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless so just imagine one day very soon you're gonna be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system so you get in your car and as you get in your car your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive no more driving around looking for one which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today's cars in urban areas is looking for parking spots or think about being in New York City and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smartphone so you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one or being in a future TED Conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time this is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system so I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem but as we found out with addressing co2 issues and also fossil fuels there is no one silver bullet the solution is not going to be more cars more roads or a new rail system it can only be found I believe in a global network of interconnected solutions now I know we can develop the technology that's going to make this work but we've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven't even thought of yet our overall transportation mix and infrastructure must support all the future options we need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue companies entrepreneurs venture capitalists they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity as well as an enormous social problem and just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge and it was really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power how much money and how much serious thought isn't over the last really three years is poured into the green energy field we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock we need people like all of you in this room leading thinkers I mean frankly I really need all of you to think about how you can help solve this this huge issue and we need people from all walks of life not just inventors we need policy makers and government officials to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge this is going to be solved by any one person or one group it's going to really require a national energy policy and frankly for each country because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels traffic jams and also how integrated the the system's already are but we need to get going and we need to get going today and we must have an infrastructure that's designed to support this flexible future you know we've come a long way since the Model T most people never traveled more than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime and since then the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live where we work where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around we don't want to regress and lose that freedom we're on our way to solving and as I said earlier I know we've got a long way to go the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it and that's the environmental issue but I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock because in doing so we're gonna preserve what we've really come to take for granted which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world and and it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this because if you can envision as I do a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today that's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow I believe we're at our best when were confronted with big issues this is a big one and it won't wait so let's get started now thank you

that evening and he was walking through the front hall and out the front door just about the same time I hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car and almost ended up in the fraud hall so it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while but I really began to love cars then and my first car was a 1975 electric green Mustang and even though the color was pretty hideous I did love the car and it really cemented my love affair with cars that's continued on this day but cars are really more than a passion of mine they're quite literally in my blood my great-grandfather was Henry Ford and on my mother's side my great-grandfather was Harvey Firestone so when I was born I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me but my great-grandfather Henry Ford really leave that the mission of the Ford Motor Company was to make people's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress and that's a belief that I share my other great passion is the environment and as a young boy I used to go up to northern Michigan and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in and then later wrote about and it really struck me and as the years went by in a very negative way when I would go to some stream that I'd loved and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it and so even at a young age that really resonated with me and and the whole notion of environmental preservation at a very basic level sunk in with me as a high schooler I started to read authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold and Edward Abbey and I really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world but it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict with nature and that was true until I got to college and when I got to college you could imagine my surprise when I would go to class and a number of my professors would say that Ford Motor Company and my family was kind of everything that was wrong with with our country they thought that we were more interested as an industry in profits rather than progress and that we filled the skies with smog and frankly we were the enemy I joined Ford after college after some soul-searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do but I decided I wanted to go and see if I could affect change there and as I look back you know over 30 years ago it was a little naive to think at that age that I could but I wanted to and I really discovered that my professors weren't completely wrong in fact when I got back to Detroit my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced by those in my own company and certainly by those in the end of Drake I had some very interesting conversations as you can imagine there were some within Ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that I needed to stop hanging out with quote environmental wackos I was considered a radical and I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists of course I had no intention of doing that and I kept speaking out about the environment and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability and in time my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today I mean I think most people in the industry understand that we've got to get on with it and the good news is today we are tackling the big issues of cards in the environment not only at Ford but really as an industry we're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights and with new technology we're reducing and I believe someday will eliminate co2 emissions we're starting to sell electric cars which is great we're developing alternative power trains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word economically socially and environmentally and actually although we've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do I can see the day where my two great passions cars and the environment actually come into harmony but unfortunately as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem and as I said we're not there yet we've got a lot of work to do but I can see where we will but even as we're in the process of doing that another huge problem is looming and people aren't noticing and that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened just as the environment is the problem put in its simplest terms is one of mathematics today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world and within our lifetime that numbers going to grow to about 9 billion and at that population level our planet will be dealing with the of growth and with that growth comes some severe practical problems one of which is our transportation system simply won't be able to deal with it when we look at the population growth in terms of cars it becomes even clearer today there are about a hundred million cars on the road worldwide and but with more people and greater prosperity around the world that numbers going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid-century and this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives today the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams and that's a huge waste of time and resources but that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest today the average driver in Beijing has a five-hour commute and last summer many of you probably saw this there was a hundred-mile traffic jam that took 11 days to clear in China in the decades to come seventy-five percent of the world's population will live in cities and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more so you can see the size of the issue that we're facing when you factor in population growth it's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow frankly four billion clean cars on the road are still 4 billion cars and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam so if we make no changes today what is tomorrow look like well I think you probably already have the picture traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge and they're really very very inconvenient but that's kind of all they are but the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and healthcare particularly to people that live in city centers and our quality of life is going to be severely compromised so what's going to solve this well the answer isn't going be more of the same my great-grandfather once said before he invented the Model T if I had asked people then what they wanted they would have answered we want faster horses so the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads when America began moving west we didn't add more wagon trains we built railroads and to connect our country after World War two we didn't build more two-lane highways we built the interstate highway system today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future we are going to build smart cars but we also need to build smart roads smart parking smart public transportation systems and more we don't want to waste our time sitting in traffic sitting at toll booths or looking for parking spots we need an integrated system that uses real-time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers in fact that's the kind of system that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world the city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another and they go underneath the city streets and up above you've got a series of pedestrian walkways on New York City's 34th Street gridlock will soon be replaced with a connected system of vehicle-specific quarters pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created and all of this will will cut down the average rush-hour commute to get across town in New York from about an hour today at rush hour to about 20 minutes now if you look at Hong Kong they have a very interesting system called Octopus there it's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system so parking garages buses trains they all operate within the same system now shared car services are also springing up around the world and these efforts I think are great that we're leaving congestion and there's frankly starting to save some fuel these are all really good ideas that will move us forward but what really inspires me is what's gonna be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other very soon the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and GPS information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network every morning I drive about 30 miles from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn Michigan and every night I go home my commute is a total crapshoot and I often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home but very soon we're gonna see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other so if the car ahead of me and I 94 hits traffic it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way and these systems are being tested right now and frankly they're gonna be ready for primetime pretty soon but the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless so just imagine one day very soon you're gonna be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system so you get in your car and as you get in your car your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive no more driving around looking for one which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today's cars in urban areas is looking for parking spots or think about being in New York City and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smartphone so you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one or being in a future TED Conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time this is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system so I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem but as we found out with addressing co2 issues and also fossil fuels there is no one silver bullet the solution is not going to be more cars more roads or a new rail system it can only be found I believe in a global network of interconnected solutions now I know we can develop the technology that's going to make this work but we've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven't even thought of yet our overall transportation mix and infrastructure must support all the future options we need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue companies entrepreneurs venture capitalists they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity as well as an enormous social problem and just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge and it was really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power how much money and how much serious thought isn't over the last really three years is poured into the green energy field we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock we need people like all of you in this room leading thinkers I mean frankly I really need all of you to think about how you can help solve this this huge issue and we need people from all walks of life not just inventors we need policy makers and government officials to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge this is going to be solved by any one person or one group it's going to really require a national energy policy and frankly for each country because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels traffic jams and also how integrated the the system's already are but we need to get going and we need to get going today and we must have an infrastructure that's designed to support this flexible future you know we've come a long way since the Model T most people never traveled more than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime and since then the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live where we work where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around we don't want to regress and lose that freedom we're on our way to solving and as I said earlier I know we've got a long way to go the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it and that's the environmental issue but I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock because in doing so we're gonna preserve what we've really come to take for granted which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world and and it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this because if you can envision as I do a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today that's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow I believe we're at our best when were confronted with big issues this is a big one and it won't wait so let's get started now thank you

**Transcript**:
by birth and by choice I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life and for the past thirty years I've worked at Ford Motor Company and for most of those years I worried about how am I gonna sell more cars and trucks but today I worry about what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks what happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles triples or even quadruples my life is guided by two great passions and the first is automobiles I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest four-door Lincoln's and leave it in the driveway and it I decided about that time at about age 10 that it would be really cool if I was a test driver so my parents would go to dinner they'd sit down I'd sneak out of the house I jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway and it was a blast and that went on for about two years until I think it was about 12 my dad brought home a Lincoln Mark three and it was snowing that day so he and mom went to dinner and I snuck out and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts or maybe even some figure eights in the snow my dad finished in early

**Transcript**:
by birth and by choice I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life and for the past thirty years I've worked at Ford Motor Company and for most of those years I worried about how am I gonna sell more cars and trucks but today I worry about what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks what happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles triples or even quadruples my life is guided by two great passions and the first is automobiles I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest four-door Lincoln's and leave it in the driveway and it I decided about that time at about age 10 that it would be really cool if I was a test driver so my parents would go to dinner they'd sit down I'd sneak out of the house I jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway and it was a blast and that went on for about two years until I think it was about 12 my dad brought home a Lincoln Mark three and it was snowing that day so he and mom went to dinner and I snuck out and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts or maybe even some figure eights in the snow my dad finished in early that evening and he was walking through the front hall and out the front door just about the same time I hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car and almost ended up in the fraud hall so it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while but I really began to love cars then and my first car was a 1975 electric green Mustang and even though the color was pretty hideous I did love the car and it really cemented my love affair with cars that's continued on this day but cars are really more than a passion of mine they're quite literally in my blood my great-grandfather was Henry Ford and on my mother's side my great-grandfather was Harvey Firestone so when I was born I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me but my great-grandfather Henry Ford really leave that the mission of the Ford Motor Company was to make people's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress and that's a belief that I share my other great passion is the environment and as a young boy I used to go up to northern Michigan and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in and then later wrote about and it really struck me and as the years went by in a very negative way when I would go to some stream that I'd loved and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it and so even at a young age that really resonated with me and and the whole notion of environmental preservation at a very basic level sunk in with me as a high schooler I started to read authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold and Edward Abbey and I really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world but it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict with nature and that was true until I got to college and when I got to college you could imagine my surprise when I would go to class and a number of my professors would say that Ford Motor Company and my family was kind of everything that was wrong with with our country they thought that we were more interested as an industry in profits rather than progress and that we filled the skies with smog and frankly we were the enemy I joined Ford after college after some soul-searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do but I decided I wanted to go and see if I could affect change there and as I look back you know over 30 years ago it was a little naive to think at that age that I could but I wanted to and I really discovered that my professors weren't completely wrong in fact when I got back to Detroit my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced by those in my own company and certainly by those in the end of Drake I had some very interesting conversations as you can imagine there were some within Ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that I needed to stop hanging out with quote environmental wackos I was considered a radical and I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists of course I had no intention of doing that and I kept speaking out about the environment and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability and in time my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today I mean I think most people in the industry understand that we've got to get on with it and the good news is today we are tackling the big issues of cards in the environment not only at Ford but really as an industry we're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights and with new technology we're reducing and I believe someday will eliminate co2 emissions we're starting to sell electric cars which is great we're developing alternative power trains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word economically socially and environmentally and actually although we've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do I can see the day where my two great passions cars and the environment actually come into harmony but unfortunately as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem and as I said we're not there yet we've got a lot of work to do but I can see where we will but even as we're in the process of doing that another huge problem is looming and people aren't noticing and that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened just as the environment is the problem put in its simplest terms is one of mathematics today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world and within our lifetime that numbers going to grow to about 9 billion and at that population level our planet will be dealing with the of growth and with that growth comes some severe practical problems one of which is our transportation system simply won't be able to deal with it when we look at the population growth in terms of cars it becomes even clearer today there are about a hundred million cars on the road worldwide and but with more people and greater prosperity around the world that numbers going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid-century and this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives today the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams and that's a huge waste of time and resources but that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest today the average driver in Beijing has a five-hour commute and last summer many of you probably saw this there was a hundred-mile traffic jam that took 11 days to clear in China in the decades to come seventy-five percent of the world's population will live in cities and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more so you can see the size of the issue that we're facing when you factor in population growth it's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow frankly four billion clean cars on the road are still 4 billion cars and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam so if we make no changes today what is tomorrow look like well I think you probably already have the picture traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge and they're really very very inconvenient but that's kind of all they are but the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and healthcare particularly to people that live in city centers and our quality of life is going to be severely compromised so what's going to solve this well the answer isn't going be more of the same my great-grandfather once said before he invented the Model T if I had asked people then what they wanted they would have answered we want faster horses so the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads when America began moving west we didn't add more wagon trains we built railroads and to connect our country after World War two we didn't build more two-lane highways we built the interstate highway system today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future we are going to build smart cars but we also need to build smart roads smart parking smart public transportation systems and more we don't want to waste our time sitting in traffic sitting at toll booths or looking for parking spots we need an integrated system that uses real-time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers in fact that's the kind of system that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world the city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another and they go underneath the city streets and up above you've got a series of pedestrian walkways on New York City's 34th Street gridlock will soon be replaced with a connected system of vehicle-specific quarters pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created and all of this will will cut down the average rush-hour commute to get across town in New York from about an hour today at rush hour to about 20 minutes now if you look at Hong Kong they have a very interesting system called Octopus there it's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system so parking garages buses trains they all operate within the same system now shared car services are also springing up around the world and these efforts I think are great that we're leaving congestion and there's frankly starting to save some fuel these are all really good ideas that will move us forward but what really inspires me is what's gonna be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other very soon the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and GPS information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network every morning I drive about 30 miles from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn Michigan and every night I go home my commute is a total crapshoot and I often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home but very soon we're gonna see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other so if the car ahead of me and I 94 hits traffic it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way and these systems are being tested right now and frankly they're gonna be ready for primetime pretty soon but the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless so just imagine one day very soon you're gonna be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system so you get in your car and as you get in your car your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive no more driving around looking for one which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today's cars in urban areas is looking for parking spots or think about being in New York City and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smartphone so you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one or being in a future TED Conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time this is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system so I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem but as we found out with addressing co2 issues and also fossil fuels there is no one silver bullet the solution is not going to be more cars more roads or a new rail system it can only be found I believe in a global network of interconnected solutions now I know we can develop the technology that's going to make this work but we've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven't even thought of yet our overall transportation mix and infrastructure must support all the future options we need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue companies entrepreneurs venture capitalists they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity as well as an enormous social problem and just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge and it was really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power how much money and how much serious thought isn't over the last really three years is poured into the green energy field we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock we need people like all of you in this room leading thinkers I mean frankly I really need all of you to think about how you can help solve this this huge issue and we need people from all walks of life not just inventors we need policy makers and government officials to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge this is going to be solved by any one person or one group it's going to really require a national energy policy and frankly for each country because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels traffic jams and also how integrated the the system's already are but we need to get going and we need to get going today and we must have an infrastructure that's designed to support this flexible future you know we've come a long way since the Model T most people never traveled more than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime and since then the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live where we work where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around we don't want to regress and lose that freedom we're on our way to solving and as I said earlier I know we've got a long way to go the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it and that's the environmental issue but I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock because in doing so we're gonna preserve what we've really come to take for granted which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world and and it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this because if you can envision as I do a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today that's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow I believe we're at our best when were confronted with big issues this is a big one and it won't wait so let's get started now thank you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 6: What is the potential benefit of a connected car network? Options: A. Reduced traffic jams, B. Increased parking spots, C. Improved navigation, D. All of the above**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question is not present in the generated MCQs, but Question 6 is related to the topic of traffic and parking.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the biggest contributor to fuel consumption in urban locations. Unfortunately, such a question is not present in the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose:

**None of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose, I would say Question 6 is the most similar, but it's not a direct match.**

To provide an index, I would say the most similar generated MCQ is:

**6**

However, please note that this is not a direct match, and a more suitable generated MCQ is not present in the options.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby The ancient Greeks had a great idea: The universe is simple. In their minds, all you needed to make it were four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. As theories go, it's a beautiful one. It has simplicity and elegance. It says that by combining the four basic elements in different ways, you could produce all the wonderful diversity of the universe. Earth and fire, for example, give you things that are dry. Air and water, things that are wet. But as theories go, it had a problem. It didn't predict anything that could be measured, and measurement is the basis of experimental science. Worse still, the theory was wrong. But the Greeks were great scientists of the mind and in the 5th century B.C., Leucippus of Miletus came up with one of the most enduring scientific ideas ever. Everything we see is made up of tiny, indivisible bits of stuff called atoms. This theory is simple and elegant, and it has the advantage over the earth, air, fire, and water theory of being right. Centuries of scientific thought and experimentation have established that the real elements, things like hydrogen, carbon, and iron, can be broken down into atoms. In Leucippus's theory, the atom is the smallest, indivisible bit of stuff that's still recognizable as hydrogen, carbon, or iron. The only thing wrong with Leucippus's idea is that atoms are, in fact, divisible. Furthermore, his atoms idea turns out to explain just a small part of what the universe is made of. What appears to be the ordinary stuff of the universe is, in fact, quite rare. Leucippus's atoms, and the things they're made of, actually make up only about 5% of what we know to be there. Physicists know the rest of the universe, 95% of it, as the dark universe, made of dark matter and dark energy. How do we know this? Well, we know because we look at things and we see them. That might seem rather simplistic, but it's actually quite profound. All the stuff that's made of atoms is visible. Light bounces off it, and we can see it. When we look out into space, we see stars and galaxies. Some of them, like the one we live in, are beautiful, spiral shapes, spinning gracefully through space. When scientists first measured the motion of groups of galaxies in the 1930's and weighed the amount of matter they contained, they were in for a surprise. They found that there's not enough visible stuff in those groups to hold them together. Later measurements of individual galaxies confirmed this puzzling result. There's simply not enough visible stuff in galaxies to provide enough gravity to hold them together. From what we can see, they ought to fly apart, but they don't. So there must be stuff there that we can't see. We call that stuff dark matter. The best evidence for dark matter today comes from measurements of something called the cosmic microwave background, the afterglow of the Big Bang, but that's another story. All of the evidence we have says that dark matter is there and it accounts for much of the stuff in those beautiful spiral galaxies that fill the heavens. So where does that leave us? We've long known that the heavens do not revolve around us and that we're residents of a fairly ordinary planet, orbiting a fairly ordinary star, in the spiral arm of a fairly ordinary galaxy. The discovery of dark matter took us one step further away from the center of things. It told us that the stuff we're made of is only a small fraction of what makes up the universe. But there was more to come. Early this century, scientists studying the outer reaches of the universe confirmed that not only is everything moving apart from everything else, as you would expect in a universe that began in hot, dense big bang, but that the universe's expansion also seems to be accelerating. What's that about? Either there is some kind of energy pushing this acceleration, just like you provide energy to accelerate a car, or gravity does not behave exactly as we think. Most scientists think it's the former, that there's some kind of energy driving the acceleration, and they called it dark energy. Today's best measurements allow us to work out just how much of the universe is dark. It looks as if dark energy makes up about 68% of the universe and dark matter about 27%, leaving just 5% for us and everything else we can actually see. So what's the dark stuff made of? We don't know, but there's one theory, called supersymmetry, that could explain some of it. Supersymmetry, or SUSY for short, predicts a whole range of new particles, some of which could make up the dark matter. If we found evidence for SUSY, we could go from understanding 5% of our universe, the things we can actually see, to around a third. Not bad for a day's work. Dark energy would probably be harder to understand, but there are some speculative theories out there that might point the way. Among them are theories that go back to that first great idea of the ancient Greeks, the idea that we began with several minutes ago, the idea that the universe must be simple. These theories predict that there is just a single element from which all the universe's wonderful diversity stems, a vibrating string. The idea is that all the particles we know today are just different harmonics on the string. Unfortunately, string theories today are, as yet, untestable. But, with so much of the universe waiting to be explored, the stakes are high. Does all of this make you feel small? It shouldn't. Instead, you should marvel in the fact that, as far as we know, you are a member of the only species in the universe able even to begin to grasp its wonders, and you're living at the right time to see our understanding explode.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby The ancient Greeks had a great idea: The universe is simple. In their minds, all you needed to make it were four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. As theories go, it's a beautiful one. It has simplicity and elegance. It says that by combining the four basic elements in different ways, you could produce all the wonderful diversity of the universe. Earth and fire, for example, give you things that are dry. Air and water, things that are wet. But as theories go, it had a problem. It didn't predict anything that could be measured, and measurement is the basis of experimental science. Worse still, the theory was wrong. But the Greeks were great scientists of the mind and in the 5th century B.C., Leucippus of Miletus came up with one of the most enduring scientific ideas ever. Everything we see is made up of tiny, indivisible bits of stuff called atoms. This theory is simple and elegant, and it has the advantage over the earth, air, fire, and water theory of being right. Centuries of scientific thought and experimentation have established that the real elements, things like hydrogen, carbon, and iron, can be broken down into atoms. In Leucippus's theory, the atom is the smallest, indivisible bit of stuff that's still recognizable as hydrogen, carbon, or iron. The only thing wrong with Leucippus's idea is that atoms are, in fact, divisible. Furthermore, his atoms idea turns out to explain just a small part of what the universe is made of. What appears to be the ordinary stuff of the universe is, in fact, quite rare. Leucippus's atoms, and the things they're made of, actually make up only about 5% of what we know to be there. Physicists know the rest of the universe, 95% of it, as the dark universe, made of dark matter and dark energy. How do we know this? Well, we know because we look at things and we see them. That might seem rather simplistic, but it's actually quite profound. All the stuff that's made of atoms is visible. Light bounces off it, and we can see it. When we look out into space, we see stars and galaxies. Some of them, like the one we live in, are beautiful, spiral shapes, spinning gracefully through space. When scientists first measured the motion of groups of galaxies in the 1930's and weighed the amount of matter they contained, they were in for a surprise. They found that there's not enough visible stuff in those groups to hold them together. Later measurements of individual galaxies confirmed this puzzling result. There's simply not enough visible stuff in galaxies to provide enough gravity to hold them together. From what we can see, they ought to fly apart, but they don't. So there must be stuff there that we can't see. We call that stuff dark matter. The best evidence for dark matter today comes from measurements of something called the cosmic microwave background, the afterglow of the Big Bang, but that's another story. All of the evidence we have says that dark matter is there and it accounts for much of the stuff in those beautiful spiral galaxies that fill the heavens. So where does that leave us? We've long known that the heavens do not revolve around us and that we're residents of a fairly ordinary planet, orbiting a fairly ordinary star, in the spiral arm of a fairly ordinary galaxy. The discovery of dark matter took us one step further away from the center of things. It told us that the stuff we're made of is only a small fraction of what makes up the universe. But there was more to come. Early this century, scientists studying the outer reaches of the universe confirmed that not only is everything moving apart from everything else, as you would expect in a universe that began in hot, dense big bang, but that the universe's expansion also seems to be accelerating. What's that about? Either there is some kind of energy pushing this acceleration, just like you provide energy to accelerate a car, or gravity does not behave exactly as we think. Most scientists think it's the former, that there's some kind of energy driving the acceleration, and they called it dark energy. Today's best measurements allow us to work out just how much of the universe is dark. It looks as if dark energy makes up about 68% of the universe and dark matter about 27%, leaving just 5% for us and everything else we can actually see. So what's the dark stuff made of? We don't know, but there's one theory, called supersymmetry, that could explain some of it. Supersymmetry, or SUSY for short, predicts a whole range of new particles, some of which could make up the dark matter. If we found evidence for SUSY, we could go from understanding 5% of our universe, the things we can actually see, to around a third. Not bad for a day's work. Dark energy would probably be harder to understand, but there are some speculative theories out there that might point the way. Among them are theories that go back to that first great idea of the ancient Greeks, the idea that we began with several minutes ago, the idea that the universe must be simple. These theories predict that there is just a single element from which all the universe's wonderful diversity stems, a vibrating string. The idea is that all the particles we know today are just different harmonics on the string. Unfortunately, string theories today are, as yet, untestable. But, with so much of the universe waiting to be explored, the stakes are high. Does all of this make you feel small? It shouldn't. Instead, you should marvel in the fact that, as far as we know, you are a member of the only species in the universe able even to begin to grasp its wonders, and you're living at the right time to see our understanding explode.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Is it possible to create something out of nothing? Or, more precisely, can energy be made into matter? Yes, but only when it comes together with its twin, antimatter. And there's something pretty mysterious about antimatter: there's way less of it out there than there should be. Let's start with the most famous physics formula ever: E equals m c squared. It basically says that mass is concentrated energy, and mass and energy are exchangeable, like two currencies with a huge exchange rate. 90 trillion Joules of energy are equivalent to 1 gram of mass. But how do I actually transform energy into matter? The magic word is energy density. If you concentrate a huge amount of energy in a tiny space, new particles will come into existence. If we look closer, we see that these particles always come in pairs, like twins. That's because particles always have a counterpart, an antiparticle, and these are always produced in exactly equal amounts: 50/50. This might sound like science fiction, but it's the daily life of particle accelerators. In the collisions between two protons at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, billions of particles and antiparticles are produced every second. Consider, for example, the electron. It has a very small mass and negative electric charge. It's antiparticle, the positron, has exactly the same mass, but a positive electric charge. But, apart from the opposite charges, both particles are identical and perfectly stable. And the same is true for their heavy cousins, the proton and the antiproton. Therefore, scientists are convinced that a world made of antimatter would look, feel, and smell just like our world. In this antiworld, we may find antiwater, antigold, and, for example, an antimarble. Now imagine that a marble and an antimarble are brought together. These two apparently solid objects would completely disappear into a big flash of energy, equivalent to an atomic bomb. Because combining matter and antimatter would create so much energy, science fiction is full of ideas about harnessing the energy stored in antimatter, for example, to fuel spaceships like Star Trek. After all, the energy content of antimatter is a billion times higher than conventional fuel. The energy of one gram of antimatter would be enough for driving a car 1,000 times around the Earth, or to bring the space shuttle into orbit. So why don't we use antimatter for energy production? Well, antimatter isn't just sitting around, ready for us to harvest. We have to make antimatter before we can combust antimatter, and it takes a billion times more energy to make antimatter than you get back. But, what if there was some antimatter in outer space and we could dig it out one day from an antiplanet somewhere. A few decades ago, many scientists believed that this could actually be possible. Today, observations have shown that there is no significant amount of antimatter anywhere in the visible universe, which is weird because, like we said before, there should be just as much antimatter as there is matter in the universe. Since antiparticles and particles should exist in equal numbers, this missing antimatter? Now that is a real mystery. To understand what might be happening, we must go back to the Big Bang. In the instant the universe was created, a huge amount of energy was transformed into mass, and our initial universe contained equal amounts of matter and antimatter. But just a second later, most matter and all of the antimatter had destroyed one another, producing an enormous amount of radiation that can still be observed today. Just about 100 millionths of the original amount of matter stuck around and no antimatter whatsoever. "Now, wait!" you might say, "Why did all the antimatter disappear and only matter was left?" It seems that we were somehow lucky that a tiny asymmetry exists between matter and antimatter. Otherwise, there would be no particles at all anywhere in the universe and also no human beings. But what causes this asymmetry? Experiments at CERN are trying to find out the reason why something exists and why we don't live in a universe filled with radiation only? But, so far, we just don't know the answer.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Is it possible to create something out of nothing? Or, more precisely, can energy be made into matter? Yes, but only when it comes together with its twin, antimatter. And there's something pretty mysterious about antimatter: there's way less of it out there than there should be. Let's start with the most famous physics formula ever: E equals m c squared. It basically says that mass is concentrated energy, and mass and energy are exchangeable, like two currencies with a huge exchange rate. 90 trillion Joules of energy are equivalent to 1 gram of mass. But how do I actually transform energy into matter? The magic word is energy density. If you concentrate a huge amount of energy in a tiny space, new particles will come into existence. If we look closer, we see that these particles always come in pairs, like twins. That's because particles always have a counterpart, an antiparticle, and these are always produced in exactly equal amounts: 50/50. This might sound like science fiction, but it's the daily life of particle accelerators. In the collisions between two protons at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, billions of particles and antiparticles are produced every second. Consider, for example, the electron. It has a very small mass and negative electric charge. It's antiparticle, the positron, has exactly the same mass, but a positive electric charge. But, apart from the opposite charges, both particles are identical and perfectly stable. And the same is true for their heavy cousins, the proton and the antiproton. Therefore, scientists are convinced that a world made of antimatter would look, feel, and smell just like our world. In this antiworld, we may find antiwater, antigold, and, for example, an antimarble. Now imagine that a marble and an antimarble are brought together. These two apparently solid objects would completely disappear into a big flash of energy, equivalent to an atomic bomb. Because combining matter and antimatter would create so much energy, science fiction is full of ideas about harnessing the energy stored in antimatter, for example, to fuel spaceships like Star Trek. After all, the energy content of antimatter is a billion times higher than conventional fuel. The energy of one gram of antimatter would be enough for driving a car 1,000 times around the Earth, or to bring the space shuttle into orbit. So why don't we use antimatter for energy production? Well, antimatter isn't just sitting around, ready for us to harvest. We have to make antimatter before we can combust antimatter, and it takes a billion times more energy to make antimatter than you get back. But, what if there was some antimatter in outer space and we could dig it out one day from an antiplanet somewhere. A few decades ago, many scientists believed that this could actually be possible. Today, observations have shown that there is no significant amount of antimatter anywhere in the visible universe, which is weird because, like we said before, there should be just as much antimatter as there is matter in the universe. Since antiparticles and particles should exist in equal numbers, this missing antimatter? Now that is a real mystery. To understand what might be happening, we must go back to the Big Bang. In the instant the universe was created, a huge amount of energy was transformed into mass, and our initial universe contained equal amounts of matter and antimatter. But just a second later, most matter and all of the antimatter had destroyed one another, producing an enormous amount of radiation that can still be observed today. Just about 100 millionths of the original amount of matter stuck around and no antimatter whatsoever. "Now, wait!" you might say, "Why did all the antimatter disappear and only matter was left?" It seems that we were somehow lucky that a tiny asymmetry exists between matter and antimatter. Otherwise, there would be no particles at all anywhere in the universe and also no human beings. But what causes this asymmetry? Experiments at CERN are trying to find out the reason why something exists and why we don't live in a universe filled with radiation only? But, so far, we just don't know the answer.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Big data is an elusive concept. It represents an amount of digital information, which is uncomfortable to store, transport, or analyze. Big data is so voluminous that it overwhelms the technologies of the day and challenges us to create the next generation of data storage tools and techniques. So, big data isn't new. In fact, physicists at CERN have been rangling with the challenge of their ever-expanding big data for decades. Fifty years ago, CERN's data could be stored in a single computer. OK, so it wasn't your usual computer, this was a mainframe computer that filled an entire building. To analyze the data, physicists from around the world traveled to CERN to connect to the enormous machine. In the 1970's, our ever-growing big data was distributed across different sets of computers, which mushroomed at CERN. Each set was joined together in dedicated, homegrown networks. But physicists collaborated without regard for the boundaries between sets, hence needed to access data on all of these. So, we bridged the independent networks together in our own CERNET. In the 1980's, islands of similar networks speaking different dialects sprung up all over Europe and the States, making remote access possible but torturous. To make it easy for our physicists across the world to access the ever-expanding big data stored at CERN without traveling, the networks needed to be talking with the same language. We adopted the fledgling internet working standard from the States, followed by the rest of Europe, and we established the principal link at CERN between Europe and the States in 1989, and the truly global internet took off! Physicists could easily then access the terabytes of big data remotely from around the world, generate results, and write papers in their home institutes. Then, they wanted to share their findings with all their colleagues. To make this information sharing easy, we created the web in the early 1990's. Physicists no longer needed to know where the information was stored in order to find it and access it on the web, an idea which caught on across the world and has transformed the way we communicate in our daily lives. During the early 2000's, the continued growth of our big data outstripped our capability to analyze it at CERN, despite having buildings full of computers. We had to start distributing the petabytes of data to our collaborating partners in order to employ local computing and storage at hundreds of different institutes. In order to orchestrate these interconnected resources with their diverse technologies, we developed a computing grid, enabling the seamless sharing of computing resources around the globe. This relies on trust relationships and mutual exchange. But this grid model could not be transferred out of our community so easily, where not everyone has resources to share nor could companies be expected to have the same level of trust. Instead, an alternative, more business-like approach for accessing on-demand resources has been flourishing recently, called cloud computing, which other communities are now exploiting to analyzing their big data. It might seem paradoxical for a place like CERN, a lab focused on the study of the unimaginably small building blocks of matter, to be the source of something as big as big data. But the way we study the fundamental particles, as well as the forces by which they interact, involves creating them fleetingly, colliding protons in our accelerators and capturing a trace of them as they zoom off near light speed. To see those traces, our detector, with 150 million sensors, acts like a really massive 3-D camera, taking a picture of each collision event - that's up to 14 millions times per second. That makes a lot of data. But if big data has been around for so long, why do we suddenly keep hearing about it now? Well, as the old metaphor explains, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and this is no longer just science that is exploiting this. The fact that we can derive more knowledge by joining related information together and spotting correlations can inform and enrich numerous aspects of everyday life, either in real time, such as traffic or financial conditions, in short-term evolutions, such as medical or meteorological, or in predictive situations, such as business, crime, or disease trends. Virtually every field is turning to gathering big data, with mobile sensor networks spanning the globe, cameras on the ground and in the air, archives storing information published on the web, and loggers capturing the activities of Internet citizens the world over. The challenge is on to invent new tools and techniques to mine these vast stores, to inform decision making, to improve medical diagnosis, and otherwise to answer needs and desires of tomorrow's society in ways that are unimagined today.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Which of these is the largest amount of data?
Options: A. 7 gigabytes, B. 3 petabytes, C. 2 terabytes, D. 10 nanobytes
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: Why did CERN start distributing petabytes of data to collaborating partners in the early 2000s?

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Big data is an elusive concept. It represents an amount of digital information, which is uncomfortable to store, transport, or analyze. Big data is so voluminous that it overwhelms the technologies of the day and challenges us to create the next generation of data storage tools and techniques. So, big data isn't new. In fact, physicists at CERN have been rangling with the challenge of their ever-expanding big data for decades. Fifty years ago, CERN's data could be stored in a single computer. OK, so it wasn't your usual computer, this was a mainframe computer that filled an entire building. To analyze the data, physicists from around the world traveled to CERN to connect to the enormous machine. In the 1970's, our ever-growing big data was distributed across different sets of computers, which mushroomed at CERN. Each set was joined together in dedicated, homegrown networks. But physicists collaborated without regard for the boundaries between sets, hence needed to access data on all of these. So, we bridged the independent networks together in our own CERNET. In the 1980's, islands of similar networks speaking different dialects sprung up all over Europe and the States, making remote access possible but torturous. To make it easy for our physicists across the world to access the ever-expanding big data stored at CERN without traveling, the networks needed to be talking with the same language. We adopted the fledgling internet working standard from the States, followed by the rest of Europe, and we established the principal link at CERN between Europe and the States in 1989, and the truly global internet took off! Physicists could easily then access the terabytes of big data remotely from around the world, generate results, and write papers in their home institutes. Then, they wanted to share their findings with all their colleagues. To make this information sharing easy, we created the web in the early 1990's. Physicists no longer needed to know where the information was stored in order to find it and access it on the web, an idea which caught on across the world and has transformed the way we communicate in our daily lives. During the early 2000's, the continued growth of our big data outstripped our capability to analyze it at CERN, despite having buildings full of computers. We had to start distributing the petabytes of data to our collaborating partners in order to employ local computing and storage at hundreds of different institutes. In order to orchestrate these interconnected resources with their diverse technologies, we developed a computing grid, enabling the seamless sharing of computing resources around the globe. This relies on trust relationships and mutual exchange. But this grid model could not be transferred out of our community so easily, where not everyone has resources to share nor could companies be expected to have the same level of trust. Instead, an alternative, more business-like approach for accessing on-demand resources has been flourishing recently, called cloud computing, which other communities are now exploiting to analyzing their big data. It might seem paradoxical for a place like CERN, a lab focused on the study of the unimaginably small building blocks of matter, to be the source of something as big as big data. But the way we study the fundamental particles, as well as the forces by which they interact, involves creating them fleetingly, colliding protons in our accelerators and capturing a trace of them as they zoom off near light speed. To see those traces, our detector, with 150 million sensors, acts like a really massive 3-D camera, taking a picture of each collision event - that's up to 14 millions times per second. That makes a lot of data. But if big data has been around for so long, why do we suddenly keep hearing about it now? Well, as the old metaphor explains, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and this is no longer just science that is exploiting this. The fact that we can derive more knowledge by joining related information together and spotting correlations can inform and enrich numerous aspects of everyday life, either in real time, such as traffic or financial conditions, in short-term evolutions, such as medical or meteorological, or in predictive situations, such as business, crime, or disease trends. Virtually every field is turning to gathering big data, with mobile sensor networks spanning the globe, cameras on the ground and in the air, archives storing information published on the web, and loggers capturing the activities of Internet citizens the world over. The challenge is on to invent new tools and techniques to mine these vast stores, to inform decision making, to improve medical diagnosis, and otherwise to answer needs and desires of tomorrow's society in ways that are unimagined today.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Feathers are some of the most remarkable things ever made by an animal. They are gorgeous in their complexity, delicate in their construction, and yet strong enough to hold a bird thousands of feet in the air. Like all things in nature, feathers evolved over millions of years into their modern form. It could be hard to imagine how this could have happened. After all, what did the intermediate forms look like? What good is half a wing, festooned with half-feathers? Thanks to science, we now know that birds are living dinosaurs. You can see the kinship in their skeletons. Certain dinosaurs share some anatomical details with birds found in no other animals, such as wish bones. And in the late 1990s, paleontologists started digging up some compelling support for that idea: dinosaurs with bits of feathers still preserved on their bodies. Since then, scientists have found dozens of species of dinosaurs with remnants of feathers. Some were as small as pigeons, and some were the size of a school bus. If you look at how they are related on a family tree, the evolution of feathers doesn't seem quite so impossible. The most distant feathered relatives of birds had straight feathers that looked like wires. Then these wires split apart, producing simple branches. In many dinosaur lineages, these simple feathers evolved into more intricate ones, including some that we see today on birds. At the same time, the feathers spread across the bodies of dinosaurs, turning from sparse patches of fuzz into dense plumage, which even extended down to their legs. A few fossils even preserved some of the molecules that give feathers color. They reveal a beautiful range of colors: glossy, dark plumage, reminiscent of crows, alternating strips of black and white, or splashes of bright red. Some dinosaurs had high crests on their heads, and others had long, dramatic tail feathers. Now, none of these dinosaurs could use their feathers to fly - their arms were too short and the rest of their bodies were far too heavy. But, birds don't just use feathers to fly. A woodcock uses feathers to blend in perfectly with its forest backdrop. An ostrich stretches its wings over its nest to shade its young. A peacock displays its magnificent tail feathers to attract peahens. Feathers could have served these functions for dinosaurs too. Exactly how feathered dinosaurs took flight is still a bit of a mystery. But if a small-feathered dinosaur flapped its arms as it ran up an incline, its feathers would have provided extra lift to help it run faster. This accident of physics might have led to the evolution of longer dinosaur arms, which would let them run faster and even leap short distances through the air. Eventually, their arms stretched out into wings. Only then, perhaps 50 million years after the first wiry feathers evolved, did feathers lift those dinosaurs into the sky.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Mysteries of Vernacular Tuxedo: men's evening wear for semi-formal occasions. Tuxedo, surprisingly, has its roots in Native American history. The Delaware Indians of what is now the Northeast United States, were divided into three subgroups, distinguished by their animal totems: the turkey, the turtle, and the wolf. Members of the tribe belonging to the wolf totem were often referred to by the indigenous word for the four-footed canine, p'tuksit. In the 18th century, Europeans who settled in the former region of the P'tuksit Anglicized the name as "tuxedo" and slapped it on a town in southeast New York. Decades later, in the late 1800s, a lavish resort was constructed and christened "The Tuxedo Club". It was at The Tuxedo Club, around the turn of the century, when a dress jacket was required for almost every occasion, that a brash young man, heir to an enormous tobacco fortune, caused a stir by flaunting tradition and donning a formal dinner jacket without tails. His bold fashion statement was quickly popularized and nicknamed tuxedo, which in modern America, is the headache of high school prom attendees across the nation.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Mysteries of Vernacular Tuxedo: men's evening wear for semi-formal occasions. Tuxedo, surprisingly, has its roots in Native American history. The Delaware Indians of what is now the Northeast United States, were divided into three subgroups, distinguished by their animal totems: the turkey, the turtle, and the wolf. Members of the tribe belonging to the wolf totem were often referred to by the indigenous word for the four-footed canine, p'tuksit. In the 18th century, Europeans who settled in the former region of the P'tuksit Anglicized the name as "tuxedo" and slapped it on a town in southeast New York. Decades later, in the late 1800s, a lavish resort was constructed and christened "The Tuxedo Club". It was at The Tuxedo Club, around the turn of the century, when a dress jacket was required for almost every occasion, that a brash young man, heir to an enormous tobacco fortune, caused a stir by flaunting tradition and donning a formal dinner jacket without tails. His bold fashion statement was quickly popularized and nicknamed tuxedo, which in modern America, is the headache of high school prom attendees across the nation.

**Transcript**:
Ladies and gentlemen, at TED
we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement. So let's watch a movement happen,
start to finish, in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it. First, of course you know, a leader needs the guts
to stand out and be ridiculed. What he's doing is so easy to follow. Here's his first follower
with a crucial role; he's going to show everyone
else how to follow. Now, notice that the leader
embraces him as an equal. Now it's not about the leader anymore; it's about them, plural. Now, there he is calling to his friends. Now, if you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated form
of leadership in itself. It takes guts to stand out like that. The first follower is what transforms
a lone nut into a leader. (Laughter) (Applause) And here comes a second follower. Now it's not a lone nut,
it's not two nuts -- three is a crowd, and a crowd is news. So a movement must be public. It's important to show
not just the leader, but the followers, because you find that new followers
emulate the followers, not the leader. Now, here come two more people,
and immediately after, three more people. Now we've got momentum.
This is the tipping point. Now we've got a movement. (Laughter) So, notice that, as more people join in, it's less risky. So those that were sitting
on the fence before now have no reason not to. They won't stand out,
they won't be ridiculed, but they will be part
of the in-crowd if they hurry. (Laughter) So, over the next minute, you'll see all of those that prefer
to stick with the crowd because eventually they would be
ridiculed for not joining in. And that's how you make a movement. But let's recap some lessons from this. So first, if you are the type, like the shirtless dancing guy
that is standing alone, remember the importance of nurturing
your first few followers as equals so it's clearly
about the movement, not you. (Laughter) Okay, but we might have missed
the real lesson here. The biggest lesson, if you noticed -- did you catch it? -- is that leadership is over-glorified. Yes, it was the shirtless guy
who was first, and he'll get all the credit, but it was really the first follower that transformed the lone nut
into a leader. So, as we're told
that we should all be leaders, that would be really ineffective. If you really care
about starting a movement, have the courage to follow
and show others how to follow. And when you find a lone nut
doing something great, have the guts to be the first one
to stand up and join in. And what a perfect place
to do that, at TED. Thanks. (Applause)

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You believe that the Sun is much larger than the Earth, that the Earth is a roughly spherical planet that rotates on its axis every 24 hours and it revolves around the Sun once every 365 days. You believe that you were born on a particular date, that you were born to two human parents and that each of your human parents was born on an earlier date. You believe that other human beings have thoughts and feelings like you do and that you are not surrounded by humanoid robots. You believe all of these things and many more, not on the basis of direct observation, which can't, by itself, tell you very much about the relative size and motion of the Sun and the Earth, or about your own family history, or about what goes on in the minds of other humans. Instead, these beliefs are mostly based on what you've been told. Without spoken and written testimonies, human beings could not pass on knowledge from one person to another, let alone from one generation to another. We would know much, much less about the world around us. So learning about a topic by asking an expert on that topic, or appealing to authority, helps us gain knowledge, but, it doesn't always. Even the most highly respected authorities can turn out to be wrong. Occasionally this happens because a highly respected authority is dishonest and claims to know something that she or he really doesn't know. Sometimes it happens just because they make a mistake. They think they know when they don't know. For example, a number of respected economists did not expect the financial collapse of 2008. They turned out to be wrong. Maybe they were wrong because they were overlooking some important evidence. Maybe they were wrong because they were misinterpreting some of the evidence they had noticed. Or maybe they were wrong simply because they were reasoning carelessly from the total body of their evidence. But whatever the reason, they turned out to be wrong and many people who trusted their authority ended up losing lots of money, losing lots of other people's money, on account of that misplaced trust. So while appealing to authority can sometimes provide us with valuable knowledge, it also can sometimes be the cause of monumental errors. It's important to all of us to be able to distinguish those occasions on which we can safely and reasonably trust authority from those occasions on which we can't. But how do we do that? In order to do that, nothing is more useful than an authority's track record on a particular topic. If someone turns out to perform well in a given situation much of the time, then it's likely that he or she will continue to perform well in that same situation, at least in the near term. And this generalization holds true of the testimony of authorities as much as of anything else. If someone can consistently pick winners in both politics and baseball, then we should probably trust him or her to keep on picking winners in both politics or baseball, though maybe not in other things where his or her track record may be less stellar. If other forecasters have a poorer track record on those same two topics, then we shouldn't trust them as much. So whenever you're considering whether to trust the testimony of some authority, the first question to ask yourself is, "What's their track record on this topic?" And notice that you can apply the very same lesson to yourself. Your instincts tell you that you've just met Mr. Right, but what sort of track record do your instincts have on topics like this one? Have your instincts proven themselves to be worthy of your trust? Just as we judge other people's testimony by their track record, so, too, we can judge our own instincts by their track record. And this brings us one step closer to an objective view of ourselves and our relation to the world around us.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You believe that the Sun is much larger than the Earth, that the Earth is a roughly spherical planet that rotates on its axis every 24 hours and it revolves around the Sun once every 365 days. You believe that you were born on a particular date, that you were born to two human parents and that each of your human parents was born on an earlier date. You believe that other human beings have thoughts and feelings like you do and that you are not surrounded by humanoid robots. You believe all of these things and many more, not on the basis of direct observation, which can't, by itself, tell you very much about the relative size and motion of the Sun and the Earth, or about your own family history, or about what goes on in the minds of other humans. Instead, these beliefs are mostly based on what you've been told. Without spoken and written testimonies, human beings could not pass on knowledge from one person to another, let alone from one generation to another. We would know much, much less about the world around us. So learning about a topic by asking an expert on that topic, or appealing to authority, helps us gain knowledge, but, it doesn't always. Even the most highly respected authorities can turn out to be wrong. Occasionally this happens because a highly respected authority is dishonest and claims to know something that she or he really doesn't know. Sometimes it happens just because they make a mistake. They think they know when they don't know. For example, a number of respected economists did not expect the financial collapse of 2008. They turned out to be wrong. Maybe they were wrong because they were overlooking some important evidence. Maybe they were wrong because they were misinterpreting some of the evidence they had noticed. Or maybe they were wrong simply because they were reasoning carelessly from the total body of their evidence. But whatever the reason, they turned out to be wrong and many people who trusted their authority ended up losing lots of money, losing lots of other people's money, on account of that misplaced trust. So while appealing to authority can sometimes provide us with valuable knowledge, it also can sometimes be the cause of monumental errors. It's important to all of us to be able to distinguish those occasions on which we can safely and reasonably trust authority from those occasions on which we can't. But how do we do that? In order to do that, nothing is more useful than an authority's track record on a particular topic. If someone turns out to perform well in a given situation much of the time, then it's likely that he or she will continue to perform well in that same situation, at least in the near term. And this generalization holds true of the testimony of authorities as much as of anything else. If someone can consistently pick winners in both politics and baseball, then we should probably trust him or her to keep on picking winners in both politics or baseball, though maybe not in other things where his or her track record may be less stellar. If other forecasters have a poorer track record on those same two topics, then we shouldn't trust them as much. So whenever you're considering whether to trust the testimony of some authority, the first question to ask yourself is, "What's their track record on this topic?" And notice that you can apply the very same lesson to yourself. Your instincts tell you that you've just met Mr. Right, but what sort of track record do your instincts have on topics like this one? Have your instincts proven themselves to be worthy of your trust? Just as we judge other people's testimony by their track record, so, too, we can judge our own instincts by their track record. And this brings us one step closer to an objective view of ourselves and our relation to the world around us.

**Transcript**:
in 2002 a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane the wright brothers in the beginning of the last century had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly they also had taken out numerous patterns on essential parts of the airplane they were not the only ones that was common practice in the industry and those who held patents on airplanes were defending them fiercely and suing competitors left and right this actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry and this was at the time that in particular the u.s government was interested in ramping up the production of military airplanes so there was a bit of a conflict there the u.s government decided to take action and force those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of of airplanes so what is this got to do with this in 2002 nelson obama a kenyan social scientist discovered he had hiv and needed access to treatment he was told that a cure did not exist aids he heard was lethal and treatment was not offered this was at the time that treatment actually existed in rich countries aids had become a chronic disease people in our countries here in europe in north america were living with hiv healthy lives not so for nelson he wasn't rich enough and not so for his three-year-old son he discovered a year later also had hiv nelson decided to become a treatment activist and join up with other groups in 2002 they were facing a different battle prices for arvs the drugs needed to treat hiv cost about 12 000 per patient per year the patents on those drugs were held by a number of western pharmaceutical companies that were not necessarily willing to make those patents available when you have a patent you can exclude anyone else from making um from from producing or making low-cost versions for example available of those of those medications clearly this led to patent wars breaking out all over the globe luckily those patents did not exist everywhere there were countries that did not recognize pharmaceutical product patterns such as india and indian pharmaceutical companies started to produce so-called generic versions low-cost copies of antiretroviral medicines and make them develop available in the developing world and within a year the price had come down from ten thousand dollars per patient per year to three hundred and fifty dollars per patient per year and today that same triple pill cocktail is available for 60 dollars per patient per year and of course that started to have an enormous effect on the number of people who could afford access to those medicines treatment programs became possible funding became available and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly today eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs 34 million are infected with hiv never has this number been so high but actually this is good news because what it means is people stop dying people who have access to these drugs stop dying and there's something else they also stop passing on the virus this is fairly recent science that has shown that what that means is we have the tools to break the back of this epidemic so what's the problem well things have changed first of all the rules have changed today all countries are obliged to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years this is as a result of the intellectual property rules of the world trade organization so what india did is no longer possible second the practice of patent holding companies have changed here you see the patent practices before the world trade organization's rules before 95 for antiretroviral drugs this is what you see today and this is in developing countries so what that means is unless we do something deliberate and unless we do something now we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis because new drugs are developed new drugs go to market but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries so unless we act unless we do something today we will soon be faced what some have termed the treatment time bomb it isn't only the number of drugs that are patented there's something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away this shows you a patent landscape this is the landscape of one medicine so you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available you will probably choose to do something else again deliberate action is needed so surely if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes we should be able to do something similar to tackle the hiv aids epidemic and we did in 2010 unitate established the medicines patent pool for hiv and this is how it works patent holders inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions but make those patents available to the medicines patent pool the medicines patent pool then license those out whoever need access to those patents that can be generic manufacturers it can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies for example those manufacturers can then sell those medicines at much lower costs to people who need access to them to treatment programs that need access to them they pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property there is one key difference with the airplane patent pool the medicines patent pool is a voluntary mechanism the airplane patent holders were not left a choice whether they licensed their patents or not they were forced to do so that is something that the medicines patent pool cannot do it relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and make them available for others for others to use today nelson odoma is healthy he has access to antiretroviral drugs his son will soon be 14 years old nelson is a member of the expert advisory group of the medicines patent pool and he told me not so long ago ellen we rely in kenya and in many other countries on the medicines patent pool to make sure that new medicines also become available to us that new medicines without delay become available to us and this is no longer fantasy already um i'll give you an example in august of this year the united states drug agency approved a new four-in-one aids medication the company gilead that holds the patents has licensed licensed the intellectual property to the medicine's patent pool the pool is already working today two months later with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product can go to market at low cost where and when it is needed this is unprecedented this has never been done before the rule is about a 10-year delay for a new product to go to market in developing countries if at all this has never been seen before nelson's expectations are very high and quite rightly so he and his son will need access to the next generation anti-retrovirals and the next throughout their lifetime so that he and many others in kenya and other countries can continue to live healthy active lives now we count on the willingness of drug companies to make that happen we count on those companies that understand that it is in the interest not only in interest of the global good but also in their own interest to move from conflict to collaboration and through the medicines patent pool they can make that happen they can also choose not to do that but they those that go down that road may end up in a similar situation the wright brothers ended up with early last century facing forcible measures by government so they better jump now thank you you

**Transcript**:
in 2002 a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane the wright brothers in the beginning of the last century had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly they also had taken out numerous patterns on essential parts of the airplane they were not the only ones that was common practice in the industry and those who held patents on airplanes were defending them fiercely and suing competitors left and right this actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry and this was at the time that in particular the u.s government was interested in ramping up the production of military airplanes so there was a bit of a conflict there the u.s government decided to take action and force those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of of airplanes so what is this got to do with this in 2002 nelson obama a kenyan social scientist discovered he had hiv and needed access to treatment he was told that a cure did not exist aids he heard was lethal and treatment was not offered this was at the time that treatment actually existed in rich countries aids had become a chronic disease people in our countries here in europe in north america were living with hiv healthy lives not so for nelson he wasn't rich enough and not so for his three-year-old son he discovered a year later also had hiv nelson decided to become a treatment activist and join up with other groups in 2002 they were facing a different battle prices for arvs the drugs needed to treat hiv cost about 12 000 per patient per year the patents on those drugs were held by a number of western pharmaceutical companies that were not necessarily willing to make those patents available when you have a patent you can exclude anyone else from making um from from producing or making low-cost versions for example available of those of those medications clearly this led to patent wars breaking out all over the globe luckily those patents did not exist everywhere there were countries that did not recognize pharmaceutical product patterns such as india and indian pharmaceutical companies started to produce so-called generic versions low-cost copies of antiretroviral medicines and make them develop available in the developing world and within a year the price had come down from ten thousand dollars per patient per year to three hundred and fifty dollars per patient per year and today that same triple pill cocktail is available for 60 dollars per patient per year and of course that started to have an enormous effect on the number of people who could afford access to those medicines treatment programs became possible funding became available and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly today eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs 34 million are infected with hiv never has this number been so high but actually this is good news because what it means is people stop dying people who have access to these drugs stop dying and there's something else they also stop passing on the virus this is fairly recent science that has shown that what that means is we have the tools to break the back of this epidemic so what's the problem well things have changed first of all the rules have changed today all countries are obliged to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years this is as a result of the intellectual property rules of the world trade organization so what india did is no longer possible second the practice of patent holding companies have changed here you see the patent practices before the world trade organization's rules before 95 for antiretroviral drugs this is what you see today and this is in developing countries so what that means is unless we do something deliberate and unless we do something now we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis because new drugs are developed new drugs go to market but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries so unless we act unless we do something today we will soon be faced what some have termed the treatment time bomb it isn't only the number of drugs that are patented there's something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away this shows you a patent landscape this is the landscape of one medicine so you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available you will probably choose to do something else again deliberate action is needed so surely if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes we should be able to do something similar to tackle the hiv aids epidemic and we did in 2010 unitate established the medicines patent pool for hiv and this is how it works patent holders inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions but make those patents available to the medicines patent pool the medicines patent pool then license those out whoever need access to those patents that can be generic manufacturers it can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies for example those manufacturers can then sell those medicines at much lower costs to people who need access to them to treatment programs that need access to them they pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property there is one key difference with the airplane patent pool the medicines patent pool is a voluntary mechanism the airplane patent holders were not left a choice whether they licensed their patents or not they were forced to do so that is something that the medicines patent pool cannot do it relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and make them available for others for others to use today nelson odoma is healthy he has access to antiretroviral drugs his son will soon be 14 years old nelson is a member of the expert advisory group of the medicines patent pool and he told me not so long ago ellen we rely in kenya and in many other countries on the medicines patent pool to make sure that new medicines also become available to us that new medicines without delay become available to us and this is no longer fantasy already um i'll give you an example in august of this year the united states drug agency approved a new four-in-one aids medication the company gilead that holds the patents has licensed licensed the intellectual property to the medicine's patent pool the pool is already working today two months later with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product can go to market at low cost where and when it is needed this is unprecedented this has never been done before the rule is about a 10-year delay for a new product to go to market in developing countries if at all this has never been seen before nelson's expectations are very high and quite rightly so he and his son will need access to the next generation anti-retrovirals and the next throughout their lifetime so that he and many others in kenya and other countries can continue to live healthy active lives now we count on the willingness of drug companies to make that happen we count on those companies that understand that it is in the interest not only in interest of the global good but also in their own interest to move from conflict to collaboration and through the medicines patent pool they can make that happen they can also choose not to do that but they those that go down that road may end up in a similar situation the wright brothers ended up with early last century facing forcible measures by government so they better jump now thank you you

**Transcript**:
in 2002 a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane the wright brothers in the beginning of the last century had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly they also had taken out numerous patterns on essential parts of the airplane they were not the only ones that was common practice in the industry and those who held patents on airplanes were defending them fiercely and suing competitors left and right this actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry and this was at the time that in particular the u.s government was interested in ramping up the production of military airplanes so there was a bit of a conflict there the u.s government decided to take action and force those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of of airplanes so what is this got to do with this in 2002 nelson obama a kenyan social scientist discovered he had hiv and needed access to treatment he was told that a cure did not exist aids he heard was lethal and treatment was not offered this was at the time that treatment actually existed in rich countries aids had become a chronic disease people in our countries here in europe in north america were living with hiv healthy lives not so for nelson he wasn't rich enough and not so for his three-year-old son he discovered a year later also had hiv nelson decided to become a treatment activist and join up with other groups in 2002 they were facing a different battle prices for arvs the drugs needed to treat hiv cost about 12 000 per patient per year the patents on those drugs were held by a number of western pharmaceutical companies that were not necessarily willing to make those patents available when you have a patent you can exclude anyone else from making um from from producing or making low-cost versions for example available of those of those medications clearly this led to patent wars breaking out all over the globe luckily those patents did not exist everywhere there were countries that did not recognize pharmaceutical product patterns such as india and indian pharmaceutical companies started to produce so-called generic versions low-cost copies of antiretroviral medicines and make them develop available in the developing world and within a year the price had come down from ten thousand dollars per patient per year to three hundred and fifty dollars per patient per year and today that same triple pill cocktail is available for 60 dollars per patient per year and of course that started to have an enormous effect on the number of people who could afford access to those medicines treatment programs became possible funding became available and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly today eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs 34 million are infected with hiv never has this number been so high but actually this is good news because what it means is people stop dying people who have access to these drugs stop dying and there's something else they also stop passing on the virus this is fairly recent science that has shown that what that means is we have the tools to break the back of this epidemic so what's the problem well things have changed first of all the rules have changed today all countries are obliged to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years this is as a result of the intellectual property rules of the world trade organization so what india did is no longer possible second the practice of patent holding companies have changed here you see the patent practices before the world trade organization's rules before 95 for antiretroviral drugs this is what you see today and this is in developing countries so what that means is unless we do something deliberate and unless we do something now we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis because new drugs are developed new drugs go to market but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries so unless we act unless we do something today we will soon be faced what some have termed the treatment time bomb it isn't only the number of drugs that are patented there's something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away this shows you a patent landscape this is the landscape of one medicine so you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available you will probably choose to do something else again deliberate action is needed so surely if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes we should be able to do something similar to tackle the hiv aids epidemic and we did in 2010 unitate established the medicines patent pool for hiv and this is how it works patent holders inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions but make those patents available to the medicines patent pool the medicines patent pool then license those out whoever need access to those patents that can be generic manufacturers it can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies for example those manufacturers can then sell those medicines at much lower costs to people who need access to them to treatment programs that need access to them they pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property there is one key difference with the airplane patent pool the medicines patent pool is a voluntary mechanism the airplane patent holders were not left a choice whether they licensed their patents or not they were forced to do so that is something that the medicines patent pool cannot do it relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and make them available for others for others to use today nelson odoma is healthy he has access to antiretroviral drugs his son will soon be 14 years old nelson is a member of the expert advisory group of the medicines patent pool and he told me not so long ago ellen we rely in kenya and in many other countries on the medicines patent pool to make sure that new medicines also become available to us that new medicines without delay become available to us and this is no longer fantasy already um i'll give you an example in august of this year the united states drug agency approved a new four-in-one aids medication the company gilead that holds the patents has licensed licensed the intellectual property to the medicine's patent pool the pool is already working today two months later with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product can go to market at low cost where and when it is needed this is unprecedented this has never been done before the rule is about a 10-year delay for a new product to go to market in developing countries if at all this has never been seen before nelson's expectations are very high and quite rightly so he and his son will need access to the next generation anti-retrovirals and the next throughout their lifetime so that he and many others in kenya and other countries can continue to live healthy active lives now we count on the willingness of drug companies to make that happen we count on those companies that understand that it is in the interest not only in interest of the global good but also in their own interest to move from conflict to collaboration and through the medicines patent pool they can make that happen they can also choose not to do that but they those that go down that road may end up in a similar situation the wright brothers ended up with early last century facing forcible measures by government so they better jump now thank you you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] America's public energy conversation boils down to this question would you rather die of a oil Wars or be climate change or see nuclear holocaust or D all of the above oh I missed one or e none of the above that's the one we're not normally offered what if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing could we have fuel without fear could we reinvent fire you see fire made us human fossil fuels made us modern but now we need a new fire that makes us safe secure healthy and durable let's see how four-fifths of the world's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo those fossil fuels have built our civilization they've created our wealth they've enriched the lives of billions but they also have rising costs to our security economy health and environment that are starting to erode if not outweigh their benefits so we need a new fire and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity each of which puts two fifths of the fossil carbon in the air but they're really quite distinct less than 1% of our electricity is made from oil although almost half is made from coal their uses are quite concentrated three-fourths of our oil fuels transportation three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings and the rest of both runs factories so very efficient vehicles buildings and factories save oil and cold and also natural gas that can displace both of them but today's energy system is not just inefficient it is also in disconnected aging dirty and insecure so it needs refurbishment by 2050 though it could become efficient connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos factories and buildings all relying on a modern secure and resilient electricity system we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply this could cost by 2050 five trillion dollars less in net present value that is expressed as a lump sum today then business as usual assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero a conservatively low estimate yet this cheaper energy system could support a hundred fifty eight percent bigger u.s. economy all without needing oil or coal or for that matter nuclear energy moreover this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of Congress and no new federal taxes mandate subsidies or laws and running Washington gridlock let me say that again I'm going to tell you how to get the United States completely off oil and coal five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of Congress led by business for profit in other words we're going to use our most effective institutions private enterprise Co evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions and whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security or environmental stewardship and climate protection and Public Health reinventing fire makes sense and makes money General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies so in reinventing fire we integrated all four sectors that use energy transportation buildings industry and electricity and we integrated four kinds of innovation not just technology and policy but also design and business strategy those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles so let's start by making autos oil free two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight and every unit of energy you save at the wheels by taking out weight or drag saves seven units at the tank is you don't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels unfortunately over the past quarter century epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have but today ultra light ultra strong materials like carbon fiber composites can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them so their engines get smaller indeed that sort of vehicle Fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper so sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today while the driving cost even from the start is very much lower so these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of Victorian engine and steel stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reinforce each other namely ultralight materials making them into structures and electric propulsion the sails can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary fee baits that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on in one's and just in the first two years the biggest of Europe's five feeb eight programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers of course computers and electronics are now America's biggest industry while typewriter makers have vanished so vehicle Fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years but then also make electrification affordable and that displaces the rest of the oil America could lead this next automotive revolution currently the leader is Germany last year Volkswagen announced that by next year they'll be producing this carbon-fiber plug-in hybrid getting 230 miles a gallon also last year BMW announced this carbon-fiber electric car they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries and they said we do not intend to be a typewriter maker out he claimed it's going to beat them both by year seven years ago and even faster and cheaper American manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part which doubles as a carbon cap in one minute and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is don't worry about dropping it it's tougher than titanium Tom Friedman actually who acted as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it but such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance they can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos they can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound to steel if we made our autos this way it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half Saudi Arabia's or half an OPEC by drilling in the Detroit formation a very perspective play and all those Detroit cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel they are all American carbon free and inexhaustible the same physics in the same business logic also applied to big vehicles in the five years ending at 2010 Walmart saved 60% of the fuel per ton-mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds and combined with triple to quintupled efficiency airplanes now on the drawing board can save close to a trillion dollars also today's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military R&D has given us the Internet the global positioning system and the jet engine and microchip industries as we design and build vehicles better we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving instead of just seeing the the travel grow we can use innovative pricing charging for road infrastructure by the mile not by the gallon we can use some smart IT to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride-sharing we can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be so they don't need to go somewhere else and we can use smart IT to make traffic free-flowing together those things can give us the same or better access with 46 to 84 percent less driving saving another point four trillion dollars plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively so forty years hence when you add it all up a far more mobile US economy can use no oil saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks rather than buying them for over 100 adds up to a four trillion dollar net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero so to get mobility without oil to phase out the oil we can get efficient and then switch fuel those hundred and twenty-five to 240 mile per gallon equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells electricity and advanced biofuels the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels the trucks could even use natural gas but no vehicles will need oil and the most biofuel we might need just three million barrels a day can be made 2/3 from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call institutional acupuncture we figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly we stick little needles in it to get it flowing working with partners like Ford and Walmart the Pentagon and the long transition is already well underway in fact three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil not in supply but in demand and Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peek around 2016 in other words oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices but the electrified vehicles don't need to burden the electricity grid rather when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that helped the grid integrate varying solar solar and wind power so the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately and they also converge the oil story with our second big story saving electricity and then making it differently and those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound two diverse disruptions than any other sector because we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on with 20th and 19th century institutions rules and cultures changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving keep improving faster than we're installing them so the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper but as efficiency in buildings in industry starts to grow faster than the economy America's electricity use could actually shrink even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos and we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends over the next 40 years buildings which use 3/4 of the electricity can triple or quadruple their energy productivity saving 1.4 trillion dollars net present value with a 33 percent internal rate of return or in English the savings are worth four times what they cost an industry can accelerate to doubling its energy productivity with a 21 percent internal rate of return Nakia is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings that is it can give you expanding returns not diminishing returns that is how our 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on-site into Super Windows that pass light but reflect heat plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third and then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved seventeen million dollars of capital cost which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry dowas billion dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars but industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars of energy still to save for example three fifths of the world's electricity runs motors half of that runs pumps and fans and those can all be made more efficient and the motors that turned them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating 35 improvements paying back in about a year but first we ought to be capturing bigger cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the text books for example pumps the biggest use of motors move liquid through pipes but a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy not by getting better pumps but just by replacing long thin crooked pipes with fat short straight pipes this is not about new technology at just our rearranging our metal furniture of course it also shrinks the pumping equipment at its capital costs so what does such savings mean for the electricity that is 3/5 used in motors well from the coal burns at the power plant through all these compounding losses only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe is float but now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost pollution and 100 levels cause global weirding back at the power plant and of course as you go back upstream the components get smaller and therefore cheaper our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries typically our retrofit design and save about 30 to 60% of the energy and payback in a few years while the new facility design save 40 to 90 odd percent with generally lower capital cost now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity chiefly renewables China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost in fact these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart and Germany now has more solar workers than America has Steelworkers already in about 20 states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cell phone bypass your wireline phone company and the sort of thing gives utility executives the heebie-jeebies and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams in renewables are no longer a fringe activity for each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable mainly lately in developing countries in 2010 renewables other than big hydro particularly wind and solar cells got a hundred and fifty 1 billion dollars of private investment and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding sixty billion watts in that one year that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year in contrast the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity in the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk in fact in this country no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital despite seven years of hundred plus percent subsidies so how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants well efficiency and gas can displace them all at below just their operating costs and combined with renewables can displace them more than 23 times and less than their replacement cost but we only need to replace them once we're often told though that only : nuclear plants can keep the lights on because they're 24/7 whereas wind and solar power are variable and hence supposedly unreliable actually no generator is 24/7 they all break and when a big plant goes down you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds often for weeks or months often without warning that is exactly why we've designed the grid to backup failed plants with working plants and in exactly the same way the grid can handle window wind and solar powers for castable variations our early simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they're forecasted integrated and diversified by both type and location and that's true both for continental areas like the US or Europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid that is how for example for German States in 2010 were 43 to 52 percent when powered Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered Denmark 36 and it's how all of Europe can shift to renewable electricity in America are aging dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050 and whatever we replace it with it's got to cost about the same about six trillion dollars net present value whether we buy more of what we've got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal or renewables that are or or less centralized but those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks around national security fuel water finance technology climate and health for example our over centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or terrorist attack but that blackout risk disappears and all of the other risks are best managed with distributed renewables organized into local micro grids that normally interconnect but can stand alone at need that is they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly that approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting for its own power supply they think they need that how about the rest of us that they're defending we want our stuff to work too and at about the same cost as business-as-usual this would maximize national security customer choice entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation together efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector traditionally utilities built a lot of giant : nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables and those utilities were rewarded as they still are in 34 states for selling you more electricity however especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency demand response cogeneration renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage so our energy future is not fate but choice and that choice is very flexible in 1976 for example government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP could never go down and I heretic Lee suggested it could go down several fold well that's what's actually happened so far it's fallen by half but with today's much better technologies more mature delivery channels and integrative design we can do far more and even cheaper so to solve the energy problem we just needed to enlarge it and the results may at first seem incredible but you know as Marshall McLuhan said only puny secrets need protection big discoveries are protected by public incredulity now combine the electricity in oil revolutions both driven by modern efficiency and you get the really big story reinventing fire we're business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050 saving 5 trillion dollars growing the economy 2.6 fold strengthening our national security oh and by the way by getting rid of the oil and coal reducing the fossil carbon emissions 82 to 86 percent now if you like any of those outcomes you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important so focusing on outcomes not motives can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge this also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges climate change nuclear proliferation energy insecurity energy poverty all of which I'll make us less safe now our team at our my help smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives with some more hatching of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there to former oilman Maurice strong said not all the fossils are in the fuel but as Edgar Willard who used to chair DuPont reminds us in companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem because he said they simply won't be around long term I've described not just a once in a civilization business opportunity but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species we humans are inventing a new fire not dug from below but flowing from above not scarce but bountiful not local but everywhere not transient but permanent not costly but free and but for a little transitional tale of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure this new fire is flameless efficiently used it really can do our work without working our undoing each of you owns a piece of that five trillion dollar prize and our new book reinventing fire describes how you can capture it so with the conversation just begun at reinventing fire calm let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other and with everyone around you to help make the world richer fairer cooler and safer by together reinventing fire thank you [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] America's public energy conversation boils down to this question would you rather die of a oil Wars or be climate change or see nuclear holocaust or D all of the above oh I missed one or e none of the above that's the one we're not normally offered what if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing could we have fuel without fear could we reinvent fire you see fire made us human fossil fuels made us modern but now we need a new fire that makes us safe secure healthy and durable let's see how four-fifths of the world's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo those fossil fuels have built our civilization they've created our wealth they've enriched the lives of billions but they also have rising costs to our security economy health and environment that are starting to erode if not outweigh their benefits so we need a new fire and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity each of which puts two fifths of the fossil carbon in the air but they're really quite distinct less than 1% of our electricity is made from oil although almost half is made from coal their uses are quite concentrated three-fourths of our oil fuels transportation three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings and the rest of both runs factories so very efficient vehicles buildings and factories save oil and cold and also natural gas that can displace both of them but today's energy system is not just inefficient it is also in disconnected aging dirty and insecure so it needs refurbishment by 2050 though it could become efficient connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos factories and buildings all relying on a modern secure and resilient electricity system we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply this could cost by 2050 five trillion dollars less in net present value that is expressed as a lump sum today then business as usual assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero a conservatively low estimate yet this cheaper energy system could support a hundred fifty eight percent bigger u.s. economy all without needing oil or coal or for that matter nuclear energy moreover this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of Congress and no new federal taxes mandate subsidies or laws and running Washington gridlock let me say that again I'm going to tell you how to get the United States completely off oil and coal five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of Congress led by business for profit in other words we're going to use our most effective institutions private enterprise Co evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions and whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security or environmental stewardship and climate protection and Public Health reinventing fire makes sense and makes money General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies so in reinventing fire we integrated all four sectors that use energy transportation buildings industry and electricity and we integrated four kinds of innovation not just technology and policy but also design and business strategy those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles so let's start by making autos oil free two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight and every unit of energy you save at the wheels by taking out weight or drag saves seven units at the tank is you don't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels unfortunately over the past quarter century epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have but today ultra light ultra strong materials like carbon fiber composites can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them so their engines get smaller indeed that sort of vehicle Fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper so sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today while the driving cost even from the start is very much lower so these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of Victorian engine and steel stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reinforce each other namely ultralight materials making them into structures and electric propulsion the sails can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary fee baits that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on in one's and just in the first two years the biggest of Europe's five feeb eight programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers of course computers and electronics are now America's biggest industry while typewriter makers have vanished so vehicle Fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years but then also make electrification affordable and that displaces the rest of the oil America could lead this next automotive revolution currently the leader is Germany last year Volkswagen announced that by next year they'll be producing this carbon-fiber plug-in hybrid getting 230 miles a gallon also last year BMW announced this carbon-fiber electric car they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries and they said we do not intend to be a typewriter maker out he claimed it's going to beat them both by year seven years ago and even faster and cheaper American manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part which doubles as a carbon cap in one minute and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is don't worry about dropping it it's tougher than titanium Tom Friedman actually who acted as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it but such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance they can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos they can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound to steel if we made our autos this way it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half Saudi Arabia's or half an OPEC by drilling in the Detroit formation a very perspective play and all those Detroit cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel they are all American carbon free and inexhaustible the same physics in the same business logic also applied to big vehicles in the five years ending at 2010 Walmart saved 60% of the fuel per ton-mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds and combined with triple to quintupled efficiency airplanes now on the drawing board can save close to a trillion dollars also today's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military R&D has given us the Internet the global positioning system and the jet engine and microchip industries as we design and build vehicles better we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving instead of just seeing the the travel grow we can use innovative pricing charging for road infrastructure by the mile not by the gallon we can use some smart IT to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride-sharing we can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be so they don't need to go somewhere else and we can use smart IT to make traffic free-flowing together those things can give us the same or better access with 46 to 84 percent less driving saving another point four trillion dollars plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively so forty years hence when you add it all up a far more mobile US economy can use no oil saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks rather than buying them for over 100 adds up to a four trillion dollar net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero so to get mobility without oil to phase out the oil we can get efficient and then switch fuel those hundred and twenty-five to 240 mile per gallon equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells electricity and advanced biofuels the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels the trucks could even use natural gas but no vehicles will need oil and the most biofuel we might need just three million barrels a day can be made 2/3 from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call institutional acupuncture we figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly we stick little needles in it to get it flowing working with partners like Ford and Walmart the Pentagon and the long transition is already well underway in fact three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil not in supply but in demand and Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peek around 2016 in other words oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices but the electrified vehicles don't need to burden the electricity grid rather when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that helped the grid integrate varying solar solar and wind power so the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately and they also converge the oil story with our second big story saving electricity and then making it differently and those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound two diverse disruptions than any other sector because we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on with 20th and 19th century institutions rules and cultures changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving keep improving faster than we're installing them so the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper but as efficiency in buildings in industry starts to grow faster than the economy America's electricity use could actually shrink even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos and we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends over the next 40 years buildings which use 3/4 of the electricity can triple or quadruple their energy productivity saving 1.4 trillion dollars net present value with a 33 percent internal rate of return or in English the savings are worth four times what they cost an industry can accelerate to doubling its energy productivity with a 21 percent internal rate of return Nakia is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings that is it can give you expanding returns not diminishing returns that is how our 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on-site into Super Windows that pass light but reflect heat plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third and then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved seventeen million dollars of capital cost which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry dowas billion dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars but industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars of energy still to save for example three fifths of the world's electricity runs motors half of that runs pumps and fans and those can all be made more efficient and the motors that turned them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating 35 improvements paying back in about a year but first we ought to be capturing bigger cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the text books for example pumps the biggest use of motors move liquid through pipes but a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy not by getting better pumps but just by replacing long thin crooked pipes with fat short straight pipes this is not about new technology at just our rearranging our metal furniture of course it also shrinks the pumping equipment at its capital costs so what does such savings mean for the electricity that is 3/5 used in motors well from the coal burns at the power plant through all these compounding losses only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe is float but now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost pollution and 100 levels cause global weirding back at the power plant and of course as you go back upstream the components get smaller and therefore cheaper our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries typically our retrofit design and save about 30 to 60% of the energy and payback in a few years while the new facility design save 40 to 90 odd percent with generally lower capital cost now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity chiefly renewables China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost in fact these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart and Germany now has more solar workers than America has Steelworkers already in about 20 states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cell phone bypass your wireline phone company and the sort of thing gives utility executives the heebie-jeebies and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams in renewables are no longer a fringe activity for each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable mainly lately in developing countries in 2010 renewables other than big hydro particularly wind and solar cells got a hundred and fifty 1 billion dollars of private investment and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding sixty billion watts in that one year that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year in contrast the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity in the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk in fact in this country no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital despite seven years of hundred plus percent subsidies so how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants well efficiency and gas can displace them all at below just their operating costs and combined with renewables can displace them more than 23 times and less than their replacement cost but we only need to replace them once we're often told though that only : nuclear plants can keep the lights on because they're 24/7 whereas wind and solar power are variable and hence supposedly unreliable actually no generator is 24/7 they all break and when a big plant goes down you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds often for weeks or months often without warning that is exactly why we've designed the grid to backup failed plants with working plants and in exactly the same way the grid can handle window wind and solar powers for castable variations our early simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they're forecasted integrated and diversified by both type and location and that's true both for continental areas like the US or Europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid that is how for example for German States in 2010 were 43 to 52 percent when powered Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered Denmark 36 and it's how all of Europe can shift to renewable electricity in America are aging dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050 and whatever we replace it with it's got to cost about the same about six trillion dollars net present value whether we buy more of what we've got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal or renewables that are or or less centralized but those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks around national security fuel water finance technology climate and health for example our over centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or terrorist attack but that blackout risk disappears and all of the other risks are best managed with distributed renewables organized into local micro grids that normally interconnect but can stand alone at need that is they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly that approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting for its own power supply they think they need that how about the rest of us that they're defending we want our stuff to work too and at about the same cost as business-as-usual this would maximize national security customer choice entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation together efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector traditionally utilities built a lot of giant : nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables and those utilities were rewarded as they still are in 34 states for selling you more electricity however especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency demand response cogeneration renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage so our energy future is not fate but choice and that choice is very flexible in 1976 for example government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP could never go down and I heretic Lee suggested it could go down several fold well that's what's actually happened so far it's fallen by half but with today's much better technologies more mature delivery channels and integrative design we can do far more and even cheaper so to solve the energy problem we just needed to enlarge it and the results may at first seem incredible but you know as Marshall McLuhan said only puny secrets need protection big discoveries are protected by public incredulity now combine the electricity in oil revolutions both driven by modern efficiency and you get the really big story reinventing fire we're business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050 saving 5 trillion dollars growing the economy 2.6 fold strengthening our national security oh and by the way by getting rid of the oil and coal reducing the fossil carbon emissions 82 to 86 percent now if you like any of those outcomes you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important so focusing on outcomes not motives can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge this also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges climate change nuclear proliferation energy insecurity energy poverty all of which I'll make us less safe now our team at our my help smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives with some more hatching of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there to former oilman Maurice strong said not all the fossils are in the fuel but as Edgar Willard who used to chair DuPont reminds us in companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem because he said they simply won't be around long term I've described not just a once in a civilization business opportunity but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species we humans are inventing a new fire not dug from below but flowing from above not scarce but bountiful not local but everywhere not transient but permanent not costly but free and but for a little transitional tale of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure this new fire is flameless efficiently used it really can do our work without working our undoing each of you owns a piece of that five trillion dollar prize and our new book reinventing fire describes how you can capture it so with the conversation just begun at reinventing fire calm let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other and with everyone around you to help make the world richer fairer cooler and safer by together reinventing fire thank you [Applause]

the biggest use of motors move liquid through pipes but a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy not by getting better pumps but just by replacing long thin crooked pipes with fat short straight pipes this is not about new technology at just our rearranging our metal furniture of course it also shrinks the pumping equipment at its capital costs so what does such savings mean for the electricity that is 3/5 used in motors well from the coal burns at the power plant through all these compounding losses only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe is float but now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost pollution and 100 levels cause global weirding back at the power plant and of course as you go back upstream the components get smaller and therefore cheaper our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries typically our retrofit design and save about 30 to 60% of the energy and payback in a few years while the new facility design save 40 to 90 odd percent with generally lower capital cost now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity chiefly renewables China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost in fact these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart and Germany now has more solar workers than America has Steelworkers already in about 20 states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cell phone bypass your wireline phone company and the sort of thing gives utility executives the heebie-jeebies and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams in renewables are no longer a fringe activity for each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable mainly lately in developing countries in 2010 renewables other than big hydro particularly wind and solar cells got a hundred and fifty 1 billion dollars of private investment and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding sixty billion watts in that one year that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year in contrast the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity in the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk in fact in this country no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital despite seven years of hundred plus percent subsidies so how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants well efficiency and gas can displace them all at below just their operating costs and combined with renewables can displace them more than 23 times and less than their replacement cost but we only need to replace them once we're often told though that only : nuclear plants can keep the lights on because they're 24/7 whereas wind and solar power are variable and hence supposedly unreliable actually no generator is 24/7 they all break and when a big plant goes down you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds often for weeks or months often without warning that is exactly why we've designed the grid to backup failed plants with working plants and in exactly the same way the grid can handle window wind and solar powers for castable variations our early simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they're forecasted integrated and diversified by both type and location and that's true both for continental areas like the US or Europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid that is how for example for German States in 2010 were 43 to 52 percent when powered Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered Denmark 36 and it's how all of Europe can shift to renewable electricity in America are aging dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050 and whatever we replace it with it's got to cost about the same about six trillion dollars net present value whether we buy more of what we've got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal or renewables that are or or less centralized but those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks around national security fuel water finance technology climate and health for example our over centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or terrorist attack but that blackout risk disappears and all of the other risks are best managed with distributed renewables organized into local micro grids that normally interconnect but can stand alone at need that is they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly that approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting for its own power supply they think they need that how about the rest of us that they're defending we want our stuff to work too and at about the same cost as business-as-usual this would maximize national security customer choice entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation together efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector traditionally utilities built a lot of giant : nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables and those utilities were rewarded as they still are in 34 states for selling you more electricity however especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency demand response cogeneration renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage so our energy future is not fate but choice and that choice is very flexible in 1976 for example government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP could never go down and I heretic Lee suggested it could go down several fold well that's what's actually happened so far it's fallen by half but with today's much better technologies more mature delivery channels and integrative design we can do far more and even cheaper so to solve the energy problem we just needed to enlarge it and the results may at first seem incredible but you know as Marshall McLuhan said only puny secrets need protection big discoveries are protected by public incredulity now combine the electricity in oil revolutions both driven by modern efficiency and you get the really big story reinventing fire we're business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050 saving 5 trillion dollars growing the economy 2.6 fold strengthening our national security oh and by the way by getting rid of the oil and coal reducing the fossil carbon emissions 82 to 86 percent now if you like any of those outcomes you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important so focusing on outcomes not motives can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge this also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges climate change nuclear proliferation energy insecurity energy poverty all of which I'll make us less safe now our team at our my help smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives with some more hatching of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there to former oilman Maurice strong said not all the fossils are in the fuel but as Edgar Willard who used to chair DuPont reminds us in companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem because he said they simply won't be around long term I've described not just a once in a civilization business opportunity but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species we humans are inventing a new fire not dug from below but flowing from above not scarce but bountiful not local but everywhere not transient but permanent not costly but free and but for a little transitional tale of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure this new fire is flameless efficiently used it really can do our work without working our undoing each of you owns a piece of that five trillion dollar prize and our new book reinventing fire describes how you can capture it so with the

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] America's public energy conversation boils down to this question would you rather die of a oil Wars or be climate change or see nuclear holocaust or D all of the above oh I missed one or e none of the above that's the one we're not normally offered what if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing could we have fuel without fear could we reinvent fire you see fire made us human fossil fuels made us modern but now we need a new fire that makes us safe secure healthy and durable let's see how four-fifths of the world's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo those fossil fuels have built our civilization they've created our wealth they've enriched the lives of billions but they also have rising costs to our security economy health and environment that are starting to erode if not outweigh their benefits so we need a new fire and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity each of which puts two fifths of the fossil carbon in the air but they're really quite distinct less than 1% of our electricity is made from oil although almost half is made from coal their uses are quite concentrated three-fourths of our oil fuels transportation three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings and the rest of both runs factories so very efficient vehicles buildings and factories save oil and cold and also natural gas that can displace both of them but today's energy system is not just inefficient it is also in disconnected aging dirty and insecure so it needs refurbishment by 2050 though it could become efficient connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos factories and buildings all relying on a modern secure and resilient electricity system we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply this could cost by 2050 five trillion dollars less in net present value that is expressed as a lump sum today then business as usual assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero a conservatively low estimate yet this cheaper energy system could support a hundred fifty eight percent bigger u.s. economy all without needing oil or coal or for that matter nuclear energy moreover this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of Congress and no new federal taxes mandate subsidies or laws and running Washington gridlock let me say that again I'm going to tell you how to get the United States completely off oil and coal five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of Congress led by business for profit in other words we're going to use our most effective institutions private enterprise Co evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions and whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security or environmental stewardship and climate protection and Public Health reinventing fire makes sense and makes money General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies so in reinventing fire we integrated all four sectors that use energy transportation buildings industry and electricity and we integrated four kinds of innovation not just technology and policy but also design and business strategy those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles so let's start by making autos oil free two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight and every unit of energy you save at the wheels by taking out weight or drag saves seven units at the tank is you don't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels unfortunately over the past quarter century epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have but today ultra light ultra strong materials like carbon fiber composites can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them so their engines get smaller indeed that sort of vehicle Fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper so sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today while the driving cost even from the start is very much lower so these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of Victorian engine and steel stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reinforce each other namely ultralight materials making them into structures and electric propulsion the sails can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary fee baits that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on in one's and just in the first two years the biggest of Europe's five feeb eight programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers of course computers and electronics are now America's biggest industry while typewriter makers have vanished so vehicle Fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years but then also make electrification affordable and that displaces the rest of the oil America could lead this next automotive revolution currently the leader is Germany last year Volkswagen announced that by next year they'll be producing this carbon-fiber plug-in hybrid getting 230 miles a gallon also last year BMW announced this carbon-fiber electric car they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries and they said we do not intend to be a typewriter maker out he claimed it's going to beat them both by year seven years ago and even faster and cheaper American manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part which doubles as a carbon cap in one minute and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is don't worry about dropping it it's tougher than titanium Tom Friedman actually who acted as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it but such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance they can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos they can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound to steel if we made our autos this way it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half Saudi Arabia's or half an OPEC by drilling in the Detroit formation a very perspective play and all those Detroit cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel they are all American carbon free and inexhaustible the same physics in the same business logic also applied to big vehicles in the five years ending at 2010 Walmart saved 60% of the fuel per ton-mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds and combined with triple to quintupled efficiency airplanes now on the drawing board can save close to a trillion dollars also today's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military R&D has given us the Internet the global positioning system and the jet engine and microchip industries as we design and build vehicles better we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving instead of just seeing the the travel grow we can use innovative pricing charging for road infrastructure by the mile not by the gallon we can use some smart IT to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride-sharing we can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be so they don't need to go somewhere else and we can use smart IT to make traffic free-flowing together those things can give us the same or better access with 46 to 84 percent less driving saving another point four trillion dollars plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively so forty years hence when you add it all up a far more mobile US economy can use no oil saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks rather than buying them for over 100 adds up to a four trillion dollar net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero so to get mobility without oil to phase out the oil we can get efficient and then switch fuel those hundred and twenty-five to 240 mile per gallon equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells electricity and advanced biofuels the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels the trucks could even use natural gas but no vehicles will need oil and the most biofuel we might need just three million barrels a day can be made 2/3 from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call institutional acupuncture we figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly we stick little needles in it to get it flowing working with partners like Ford and Walmart the Pentagon and the long transition is already well underway in fact three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil not in supply but in demand and Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peek around 2016 in other words oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices but the electrified vehicles don't need to burden the electricity grid rather when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that helped the grid integrate varying solar solar and wind power so the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately and they also converge the oil story with our second big story saving electricity and then making it differently and those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound two diverse disruptions than any other sector because we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on with 20th and 19th century institutions rules and cultures changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving keep improving faster than we're installing them so the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper but as efficiency in buildings in industry starts to grow faster than the economy America's electricity use could actually shrink even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos and we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends over the next 40 years buildings which use 3/4 of the electricity can triple or quadruple their energy productivity saving 1.4 trillion dollars net present value with a 33 percent internal rate of return or in English the savings are worth four times what they cost an industry can accelerate to doubling its energy productivity with a 21 percent internal rate of return Nakia is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings that is it can give you expanding returns not diminishing returns that is how our 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on-site into Super Windows that pass light but reflect heat plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third and then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved seventeen million dollars of capital cost which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry dowas billion dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars but industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars of energy still to save for example three fifths of the world's electricity runs motors half of that runs pumps and fans and those can all be made more efficient and the motors that turned them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating 35 improvements paying back in about a year but first we ought to be capturing bigger cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the text books for example pumps

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] America's public energy conversation boils down to this question would you rather die of a oil Wars or be climate change or see nuclear holocaust or D all of the above oh I missed one or e none of the above that's the one we're not normally offered what if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing could we have fuel without fear could we reinvent fire you see fire made us human fossil fuels made us modern but now we need a new fire that makes us safe secure healthy and durable let's see how four-fifths of the world's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo those fossil fuels have built our civilization they've created our wealth they've enriched the lives of billions but they also have rising costs to our security economy health and environment that are starting to erode if not outweigh their benefits so we need a new fire and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity each of which puts two fifths of the fossil carbon in the air but they're really quite distinct less than 1% of our electricity is made from oil although almost half is made from coal their uses are quite concentrated three-fourths of our oil fuels transportation three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings and the rest of both runs factories so very efficient vehicles buildings and factories save oil and cold and also natural gas that can displace both of them but today's energy system is not just inefficient it is also in disconnected aging dirty and insecure so it needs refurbishment by 2050 though it could become efficient connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos factories and buildings all relying on a modern secure and resilient electricity system we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply this could cost by 2050 five trillion dollars less in net present value that is expressed as a lump sum today then business as usual assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero a conservatively low estimate yet this cheaper energy system could support a hundred fifty eight percent bigger u.s. economy all without needing oil or coal or for that matter nuclear energy moreover this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of Congress and no new federal taxes mandate subsidies or laws and running Washington gridlock let me say that again I'm going to tell you how to get the United States completely off oil and coal five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of Congress led by business for profit in other words we're going to use our most effective institutions private enterprise Co evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions and whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security or environmental stewardship and climate protection and Public Health reinventing fire makes sense and makes money General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies so in reinventing fire we integrated all four sectors that use energy transportation buildings industry and electricity and we integrated four kinds of innovation not just technology and policy but also design and business strategy those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles so let's start by making autos oil free two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight and every unit of energy you save at the wheels by taking out weight or drag saves seven units at the tank is you don't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels unfortunately over the past quarter century epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have but today ultra light ultra strong materials like carbon fiber composites can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them so their engines get smaller indeed that sort of vehicle Fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper so sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today while the driving cost even from the start is very much lower so these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of Victorian engine and steel stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reinforce each other namely ultralight materials making them into structures and electric propulsion the sails can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary fee baits that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on in one's and just in the first two years the biggest of Europe's five feeb eight programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers of course computers and electronics are now America's biggest industry while typewriter makers have vanished so vehicle Fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years but then also make electrification affordable and that displaces the rest of the oil America could lead this next automotive revolution currently the leader is Germany last year Volkswagen announced that by next year they'll be producing this carbon-fiber plug-in hybrid getting 230 miles a gallon also last year BMW announced this carbon-fiber electric car they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries and they said we do not intend to be a typewriter maker out he claimed it's going to beat them both by year seven years ago and even faster and cheaper American manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part which doubles as a carbon cap in one minute and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is don't worry about dropping it it's tougher than titanium Tom Friedman actually who acted as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it but such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance they can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos they can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound to steel if we made our autos this way it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half Saudi Arabia's or half an OPEC by drilling in the Detroit formation a very perspective play and all those Detroit cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel they are all American carbon free and inexhaustible the same physics in the same business logic also applied to big vehicles in the five years ending at 2010 Walmart saved 60% of the fuel per ton-mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds and combined with triple to quintupled efficiency airplanes now on the drawing board can save close to a trillion dollars also today's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military R&D has given us the Internet the global positioning system and the jet engine and microchip industries as we design and build vehicles better we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving instead of just seeing the the travel grow we can use innovative pricing charging for road infrastructure by the mile not by the gallon we can use some smart IT to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride-sharing we can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be so they don't need to go somewhere else and we can use smart IT to make traffic free-flowing together those things can give us the same or better access with 46 to 84 percent less driving saving another point four trillion dollars plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively so forty years hence when you add it all up a far more mobile US economy can use no oil saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks rather than buying them for over 100 adds up to a four trillion dollar net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero so to get mobility without oil to phase out the oil we can get efficient and then switch fuel those hundred and twenty-five to 240 mile per gallon equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells electricity and advanced biofuels the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels the trucks could even use natural gas but no vehicles will need oil and the most biofuel we might need just three million barrels a day can be made 2/3 from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call institutional acupuncture we figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly we stick little needles in it to get it flowing working with partners like Ford and Walmart the Pentagon and the long transition is already well underway in fact three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil not in supply but in demand and Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peek around 2016 in other words oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices but the electrified vehicles don't need to burden the electricity grid rather when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that helped the grid integrate varying solar solar and wind power so the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately and they also converge the oil story with our second big story saving electricity and then making it differently and those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound two diverse disruptions than any other sector because we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on with 20th and 19th century institutions rules and cultures changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving keep improving faster than we're installing them so the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper but as efficiency in buildings in industry starts to grow faster than the economy America's electricity use could actually shrink even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos and we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends over the next 40 years buildings which use 3/4 of the electricity can triple or quadruple their energy productivity saving 1.4 trillion dollars net present value with a 33 percent internal rate of return or in English the savings are worth four times what they cost an industry can accelerate to doubling its energy productivity with a 21 percent internal rate of return Nakia is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings that is it can give you expanding returns not diminishing returns that is how our 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on-site into Super Windows that pass light but reflect heat plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third and then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved seventeen million dollars of capital cost which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry dowas billion dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars but industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars of energy still to save for example three fifths of the world's electricity runs motors half of that runs pumps and fans and those can all be made more efficient and the motors that turned them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating 35 improvements paying back in about a year but first we ought to be capturing bigger cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the text books for example pumps the biggest use of motors move liquid through pipes but a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy not by getting better pumps but just by replacing long thin crooked pipes with fat short straight pipes this is not about new technology at just our rearranging our metal furniture of course it also shrinks the pumping equipment at its capital costs so what does such savings mean for the electricity that is 3/5 used in motors well from the coal burns at the power plant through all these compounding losses only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe is float but now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost pollution and 100 levels cause global weirding back at the power plant and of course as you go back upstream the components get smaller and therefore cheaper our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries typically our retrofit design and save about 30 to 60% of the energy and payback in a few years while the new facility design save 40 to 90 odd percent with generally lower capital cost now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity chiefly renewables China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost in fact these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart and Germany now has more solar workers than America has Steelworkers already in about 20 states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cell phone bypass your wireline phone company and the sort of thing gives utility executives the heebie-jeebies and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams in renewables are no longer a fringe activity for each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable mainly lately in developing countries in 2010 renewables other than big hydro particularly wind and solar cells got a hundred and fifty 1 billion dollars of private investment and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding sixty billion watts in that one year that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year in contrast the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity in the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk in fact in this country no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital despite seven years of hundred plus percent subsidies so how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants well efficiency and gas can displace them all at below just their operating costs and combined with renewables can displace them more than 23 times and less than their replacement cost but we only need to replace them once we're often told though that only : nuclear plants can keep the lights on because they're 24/7 whereas wind and solar power are variable and hence supposedly unreliable actually no generator is 24/7 they all break and when a big plant goes down you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds often for weeks or months often without warning that is exactly why we've designed the grid to backup failed plants with working plants and in exactly the same way the grid can handle window wind and solar powers for castable variations our early simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they're forecasted integrated and diversified by both type and location and that's true both for continental areas like the US or Europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid that is how for example for German States in 2010 were 43 to 52 percent when powered Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered Denmark 36 and it's how all of Europe can shift to renewable electricity in America are aging dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050 and whatever we replace it with it's got to cost about the same about six trillion dollars net present value whether we buy more of what we've got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal or renewables that are or or less centralized but those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks around national security fuel water finance technology climate and health for example our over centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or terrorist attack but that blackout risk disappears and all of the other risks are best managed with distributed renewables organized into local micro grids that normally interconnect but can stand alone at need that is they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly that approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting for its own power supply they think they need that how about the rest of us that they're defending we want our stuff to work too and at about the same cost as business-as-usual this would maximize national security customer choice entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation together efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector traditionally utilities built a lot of giant : nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables and those utilities were rewarded as they still are in 34 states for selling you more electricity however especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency demand response cogeneration renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage so our energy future is not fate but choice and that choice is very flexible in 1976 for example government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP could never go down and I heretic Lee suggested it could go down several fold well that's what's actually happened so far it's fallen by half but with today's much better technologies more mature delivery channels and integrative design we can do far more and even cheaper so to solve the energy problem we just needed to enlarge it and the results may at first seem incredible but you know as Marshall McLuhan said only puny secrets need protection big discoveries are protected by public incredulity now combine the electricity in oil revolutions both driven by modern efficiency and you get the really big story reinventing fire we're business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050 saving 5 trillion dollars growing the economy 2.6 fold strengthening our national security oh and by the way by getting rid of the oil and coal reducing the fossil carbon emissions 82 to 86 percent now if you like any of those outcomes you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important so focusing on outcomes not motives can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge this also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges climate change nuclear proliferation energy insecurity energy poverty all of which I'll make us less safe now our team at our my help smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives with some more hatching of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there to former oilman Maurice strong said not all the fossils are in the fuel but as Edgar Willard who used to chair DuPont reminds us in companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem because he said they simply won't be around long term I've described not just a once in a civilization business opportunity but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species we humans are inventing a new fire not dug from below but flowing from above not scarce but bountiful not local but everywhere not transient but permanent not costly but free and but for a little transitional tale of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure this new fire is flameless efficiently used it really can do our work without working our undoing each of you owns a piece of that five trillion dollar prize and our new book reinventing fire describes how you can capture it so with the conversation just begun at reinventing fire calm let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other and with everyone around you to help make the world richer fairer cooler and safer by together reinventing fire thank you [Applause]

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You've probably heard of Pavlov's dogs, the phrase that often summarizes Dr. Ivan Pavlov's early 20th century research, in which he demonstrated that we can alter what stimuli elicit a reflective response in canines. He showed this by sounding a bell just before he presented his group of dogs with meat powder. After many presentations of the bell, followed by tasty meat powder, the dogs eventually began to salivate at just the sound of the bell. They salivated even when there was no meat powder present. This phenomenon isn't limited to dogs. Consider the placebo effect, in which a pill with no active substances brings about a response similar to a pill with a substance present. What changes here is our reaction to our ailment, such as perceiving less pain and not the ailment itself. Or, consider the love humans have for a parent. Some would argue that this love is instinctual, and they may be partially right. But, the argument fails to account for the equal amount of love that children adopted later in life hold for their adoptive parents. But the behaviorist argument can account for both accounts of love. A parent, biological or not, is constantly paired with things like food, smiles, toys, affection, games, protection, and entertainment. And a parent's constant association with these wonderful or crucial aspects of a child's life has a similar, albeit more complicated, effect that meat powder had on Pavlov's salivating dogs. In other words, if one's parent is predictive of really good or really important things, then one's parent becomes a really good and important thing, too. And there is also romantic advice to be gained from Pavlov's observations. We all need food to survive, right? And someone who can provide such things in a delicious, saliva-producing manner stands to become our human equivalent of a ringing bell. In other words, if you can cook one or more scrumptious meals for a potential love interest, there's a good chance that you'll be viewed more favorably in the future, even if you didn't prepare the delicious food. And who wouldn't want the love of their life drooling over them? But life is not just bell rings and salivation. There's also a dark side to this type of learning, called "taste aversion". Taste aversion occurs when we ingest some food that eventually makes us sick, and, as a result, we avoid that food, sometimes for the rest of our lives. Taste aversion is so powerful that the effect can be seen even if the illness is experienced hours later and even if the food itself did not actually make us sick. Such is the case when we have the flu, and, by accident, we ingest some food moments prior to vomiting. In this case, we know that the food did not cause the vomiting, but our bodies don't know that. And the next time we encounter that food, we are likely to refuse eating it. Now, imagine the potential consequences of undercooking a meal on a first date. If the food makes your date sick, it is possible for them to associate that bad feeling with not just the food, but with your food in particular. If the episode was traumatizing enough, or if it also happens on a subsequent date, they may come to relate you with the consequences, just like Pavlov's dogs related the bell with the meat powder. In other words, the sight of you showing up at the next dinner date might actually make your date nauseous! As the old saying goes, the fastest way to someone's heart is through their stomach, assuming you don't make them sick in the process.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You've probably heard of Pavlov's dogs, the phrase that often summarizes Dr. Ivan Pavlov's early 20th century research, in which he demonstrated that we can alter what stimuli elicit a reflective response in canines. He showed this by sounding a bell just before he presented his group of dogs with meat powder. After many presentations of the bell, followed by tasty meat powder, the dogs eventually began to salivate at just the sound of the bell. They salivated even when there was no meat powder present. This phenomenon isn't limited to dogs. Consider the placebo effect, in which a pill with no active substances brings about a response similar to a pill with a substance present. What changes here is our reaction to our ailment, such as perceiving less pain and not the ailment itself. Or, consider the love humans have for a parent. Some would argue that this love is instinctual, and they may be partially right. But, the argument fails to account for the equal amount of love that children adopted later in life hold for their adoptive parents. But the behaviorist argument can account for both accounts of love. A parent, biological or not, is constantly paired with things like food, smiles, toys, affection, games, protection, and entertainment. And a parent's constant association with these wonderful or crucial aspects of a child's life has a similar, albeit more complicated, effect that meat powder had on Pavlov's salivating dogs. In other words, if one's parent is predictive of really good or really important things, then one's parent becomes a really good and important thing, too. And there is also romantic advice to be gained from Pavlov's observations. We all need food to survive, right? And someone who can provide such things in a delicious, saliva-producing manner stands to become our human equivalent of a ringing bell. In other words, if you can cook one or more scrumptious meals for a potential love interest, there's a good chance that you'll be viewed more favorably in the future, even if you didn't prepare the delicious food. And who wouldn't want the love of their life drooling over them? But life is not just bell rings and salivation. There's also a dark side to this type of learning, called "taste aversion". Taste aversion occurs when we ingest some food that eventually makes us sick, and, as a result, we avoid that food, sometimes for the rest of our lives. Taste aversion is so powerful that the effect can be seen even if the illness is experienced hours later and even if the food itself did not actually make us sick. Such is the case when we have the flu, and, by accident, we ingest some food moments prior to vomiting. In this case, we know that the food did not cause the vomiting, but our bodies don't know that. And the next time we encounter that food, we are likely to refuse eating it. Now, imagine the potential consequences of undercooking a meal on a first date. If the food makes your date sick, it is possible for them to associate that bad feeling with not just the food, but with your food in particular. If the episode was traumatizing enough, or if it also happens on a subsequent date, they may come to relate you with the consequences, just like Pavlov's dogs related the bell with the meat powder. In other words, the sight of you showing up at the next dinner date might actually make your date nauseous! As the old saying goes, the fastest way to someone's heart is through their stomach, assuming you don't make them sick in the process.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar So as an astronomer, when I look at the sky with other people, they always ask me, "What is your favorite place in the universe? What is your favorite galaxy? What is your favorite planet?" My answer is Earth. That's right. This is a very special place, even for an astronomer. We look at a lot of places, but there's only one that we know of in the whole universe that we can live on. It's an amazing planet, there is an amazing number of things happening, some of them, you are hearing about it today. That's the only place in the universe where we know that there is life, so that makes it extremely special. What I'm going to talk to you about is this great adventure in astronomy that is happening where we are actually actively looking for other places like this. It's impossible to imagine the number of possibilities, what happens on those other planets that can be habitable. So that's what I'm going to tell you about. So, the first thing we have to think of is, well, what makes a planet habitable? And, the easiest thing to do is to look at our own solar system. We have multiple examples. The first thing we learn is that size matters. We can't have a planet that's too small or too big. If we look at a planet that is too small, it doesn't have an atmosphere. The moon, technically not a planet, but a good example for this, is too small, it doesn't hold an atmosphere. Jupiter - very, very big - and it actually is mostly composed of gas, it has no surface you can stand on. The Earth is just right. The second thing that we learned is that the planet has to be at the right distance from its star. If the planet is too close to its star, it's too hot. That's the case for Venus. Here I have a picture that was taken by a spacecraft that landed on Venus, and the surface, although it's rocky and quite familiar to us compared to Earth, it's really too hot. At the opposite end, if a planet is too far from the star, it is too cold. That's the case for Mars. So, we need to look for planets that are at the right distance from their star and also of the right size. So, one other thing, you know, you might think, "Oh, this is really hard because the planet has to be just right. It only happened once in our solar system." But when you look at the sky at night, and here's a video that I took actually from Hawaii, a dark place where you can see a lot of stars, the first thing you notice is that there are a lot of stars. So, the odds are in our favor, even if a small fraction of the stars have habitable planets. There are a lot of stars. On a moonless night, in a dark site, if you count the stars in the sky and you count five stars per second, it would take you 15 minutes to count all of the stars in the sky. That is a tiny fraction of the stars in our galaxy. If you count all the stars in our galaxy, and you also count at five stars per second, it would take you more than 1,000 years to count all the stars in our galaxy. And then, if you manage to count the galaxies in the universe, if you count five galaxies per second, it would take you also more than 1,000 years to count all of the galaxies in the universe. So the numbers are just astronomical, there's a lot of opportunities for exoplanets. There has to be a large number of exoplanets along which there are, on which there could be life. So this is very exciting. So let's imagine that maybe only 1 in 100 stars has the right kind of planet, and I think this is pessimistic. If you could visit one of those planets per second, it'll take you sixty years to actually visit all of them in our galaxy alone. That's, I think, one second is not enough to study them. So, there's a few hundred of us in this room. If we divided the task and each of us basically took a couple of minutes to study each planet, it would take us a life time to do this. Meet back again and tell those amazing stories of what we would have seen in maybe some TED senior event. So, why is it hard? Why don't we have pictures of exoplanets with aliens on them? Well, here's an example. This is a picture that was taken by the Cassinni spacecraft as it was orbiting Saturn. It's actually behind Saturn, so what you see is the sun that is blocked by Saturn. And if you look very, in detail, if you have very sharp eyesight, you will see all of us. We're all on that picture. Here is where we are. Um, so that's what Earth starts to look like when we look at it from far away. Now, we have to do the same thing around other stars, and the planet is very close to the star. So this is zooming in to us. All of us are on that little dot at the time the picture was taken. So, what I work on is inventing optics, tricks to actually do this, to take images of planets around those other stars. This is my easiest coronagraph. We call this optic tricks, "coronagraph". This is the easiest one I ever built. I just put my thumb in front of the sun and then you can see things around it. That's what we're trying to do, but we need to do it much better than what I did in this picture. And, there are two things we need to do: we need a much better eye, call them telescopes, and we need more fancy, clever ways to do it than putting a thumb. So as an example, one of the projects I work on is for the Subaru Telescope, which you can see here in this picture. It's a very large telescope, so I replace my eye by a large telescope. And, the other thing that we do is the coronagraph is not just a stupid thumb, it's this very complicated thing that's shown in that picture that I would love to have time to tell you about. Just to give you a sense for size, this arrow points to a door on the side of the telescope, and if you have very sharp eyes, you can see that there is a railing going around the telescope, so it's a really big eye. So, I think the most exciting thing for me is actually to look at the night sky, to see all these stars and wonder, "Well, are there people on planets around those stars?" Because there must be amazing things happening around those stars that we don't know yet. During your life time, we will start to actually figure out those things. And the most exciting thing for me is to think about, maybe, beings on those stars looking back at our star and wondering the same thing. So I think the future will be extremely exciting because we are starting to figure out those things and amazing range of possibilities is, I think, even wider than our imagination. Thank you.

It's an amazing planet, there is an amazing number of things happening, some of them, you are hearing about it today. That's the only place in the universe where we know that there is life, so that makes it extremely special. What I'm going to talk to you about is this great adventure in astronomy that is happening where we are actually actively looking for other places like this. It's impossible to imagine the number of possibilities, what happens on those other planets that can be habitable. So that's what I'm going to tell you about. So, the first thing we have to think of is, well, what makes a planet habitable? And, the easiest thing to do is to look at our own solar system. We have multiple examples. The first thing we learn is that size matters. We can't have a planet that's too small or too big. If we look at a planet that is too small, it doesn't have an atmosphere. The moon, technically not a planet, but a good example for this, is too small, it doesn't hold an atmosphere. Jupiter - very, very big - and it actually is mostly composed of gas, it has no surface you can stand on. The Earth is just right. The second thing that we learned is that the planet has to be at the right distance from its star. If the planet is too close to its star, it's too hot. That's the case for Venus. Here I have a picture that was taken by a spacecraft that landed on Venus, and the surface, although it's rocky and quite familiar to us compared to Earth, it's really too hot. At the opposite end, if a planet is too far from the star, it is too cold. That's the case for Mars. So, we need to look for planets that are at the right distance from their star and also of the right size. So, one other thing, you know, you might think, "Oh, this is really hard because the planet has to be just right. It only happened once in our solar system." But when you look at the sky at night, and here's a video that I took actually from Hawaii, a dark place where you can see a lot of stars, the first thing you notice is that there are a lot of stars. So, the odds are in our favor, even if a small fraction of the stars have habitable planets. There are a lot of stars. On a moonless night, in a dark site, if you count the stars in the sky and you count five stars per second, it would take you 15 minutes to count all of the stars in the sky. That is a tiny fraction of the stars in our galaxy. If you count all the stars in our galaxy, and you also count at five stars per second, it would take you more than 1,000 years to count all the stars in our galaxy. And then, if you manage to count the galaxies in the universe, if you count five galaxies per second, it would take you also more than 1,000 years to count all of the galaxies in the universe. So the numbers are just astronomical, there's a lot of opportunities for exoplanets. There has to be a large number of exoplanets along which there are, on which there could be life. So this is very exciting. So let's imagine that maybe only 1 in 100 stars has the right kind of planet, and I think this is pessimistic. If you could visit one of those planets per second, it'll take you sixty years to actually visit all of them in our galaxy alone. That's, I think, one second is not enough to study them. So, there's a few hundred of us in this room. If we divided the task and each of us basically took a couple of minutes to study each planet, it would take us a life time to do this. Meet back again and tell those amazing stories of what we would have seen in maybe some TED senior event. So, why is it hard? Why don't we have pictures of exoplanets with aliens on them? Well, here's an example. This is a picture that was taken by the Cassinni spacecraft as it was orbiting Saturn. It's actually behind Saturn, so what you see is the sun that is blocked by Saturn. And if you look very, in detail, if you have very sharp eyesight, you will see all of us. We're all on that picture. Here is where we are. Um, so that's what Earth starts to look like when we look at it from far away. Now, we have to do the same thing around other stars, and the planet is very close to the star. So this is zooming in to us. All of us are on that little dot at the time the picture was taken. So, what I work on is inventing optics, tricks to actually do this, to take images of planets around those other stars. This is my easiest coronagraph. We call this optic tricks, "coronagraph". This is the easiest one I ever built. I just put my thumb in front of the sun and then you can see things around it. That's what we're trying to do, but we need to do it much better than what I did in this picture. And, there are two things we need to do: we need a much better eye, call them telescopes, and we need more fancy, clever ways to do it than putting a thumb. So as an example, one of the projects I work on is for the Subaru Telescope, which you can see here in this picture. It's a very large telescope, so I replace my eye by a large telescope. And, the other thing that we do is the coronagraph is not just a stupid thumb, it's this very complicated thing that's shown in that picture that I would love to have time to tell you about. Just to give you a sense for size, this arrow points to a door on the side of the telescope, and if you have very sharp eyes, you can see that there is a railing going around the telescope, so it's a really big eye. So, I think the most exciting thing for me is actually to look at the night sky, to see all these stars and wonder, "Well, are there people on planets around those stars?" Because there must be amazing things happening around those stars that we don't know yet. During your life time, we will start to actually figure out those things. And the most exciting thing for me is to think about, maybe, beings on those stars looking back at our star and wondering the same thing. So I think the future will be extremely exciting because we are starting to figure out those things and amazing range of possibilities is, I think, even wider than our imagination. Thank you.

But when you look at the sky at night, and here's a video that I took actually from Hawaii, a dark place where you can see a lot of stars, the first thing you notice is that there are a lot of stars. So, the odds are in our favor, even if a small fraction of the stars have habitable planets. There are a lot of stars. On a moonless night, in a dark site, if you count the stars in the sky and you count five stars per second, it would take you 15 minutes to count all of the stars in the sky. That is a tiny fraction of the stars in our galaxy. If you count all the stars in our galaxy, and you also count at five stars per second, it would take you more than 1,000 years to count all the stars in our galaxy. And then, if you manage to count the galaxies in the universe, if you count five galaxies per second, it would take you also more than 1,000 years to count all of the galaxies in the universe. So the numbers are just astronomical, there's a lot of opportunities for exoplanets. There has to be a large number of exoplanets along which there are, on which there could be life. So this is very exciting. So let's imagine that maybe only 1 in 100 stars has the right kind of planet, and I think this is pessimistic. If you could visit one of those planets per second, it'll take you sixty years to actually visit all of them in our galaxy alone. That's, I think, one second is not enough to study them. So, there's a few hundred of us in this room. If we divided the task and each of us basically took a couple of minutes to study each planet, it would take us a life time to do this. Meet back again and tell those amazing stories of what we would have seen in maybe some TED senior event. So, why is it hard? Why don't we have pictures of exoplanets with aliens on them? Well, here's an example. This is a picture that was taken by the Cassinni spacecraft as it was orbiting Saturn. It's actually behind Saturn, so what you see is the sun that is blocked by Saturn. And if you look very, in detail, if you have very sharp eyesight, you will see all of us. We're all on that picture. Here is where we are. Um, so that's what Earth starts to look like when we look at it from far away. Now, we have to do the same thing around other stars, and the planet is very close to the star. So this is zooming in to us. All of us are on that little dot at the time the picture was taken. So, what I work on is inventing optics, tricks to actually do this, to take images of planets around those other stars. This is my easiest coronagraph. We call this optic tricks, "coronagraph". This is the easiest one I ever built. I just put my thumb in front of the sun and then you can see things around it. That's what we're trying to do, but we need to do it much better than what I did in this picture. And, there are two things we need to do: we need a much better eye, call them telescopes, and we need more fancy, clever ways to do it than putting a thumb. So as an example, one of the projects I work on is for the Subaru Telescope, which you can see here in this picture. It's a very large telescope, so I replace my eye by a large telescope. And, the other thing that we do is the coronagraph is not just a stupid thumb, it's this very complicated thing that's shown in that picture that I would love to have time to tell you about. Just to give you a sense for size, this arrow points to a door on the side of the telescope, and if you have very sharp eyes, you can see that there is a railing going around the telescope, so it's a really big eye. So, I think the most exciting thing for me is actually to look at the night sky, to see all these stars and wonder, "Well, are there people on planets around those stars?" Because there must be amazing things happening around those stars that we don't know yet. During your life time, we will start to actually figure out those things. And the most exciting thing for me is to think about, maybe, beings on those stars looking back at our star and wondering the same thing. So I think the future will be extremely exciting because we are starting to figure out those things and amazing range of possibilities is, I think, even wider than our imagination. Thank you.

**Transcript**:
Bean bags are awesome. But I see a few people out there
who are standing, we've got some over here, and standing takes more
work than lounging. Using the Live Strong
Organization's online database of weight loss resources, you can calculate that by the time I'm done
with this speech, those of you who are standing will have burned 7.5 more calories than those of you who are bean-bagging it. (Laughter) Okay, here's a question, speaking of weight loss,
specifically weight, this speech is live. I'm actually here in front of you guys, we're all here together. But this speech is being recorded and it will become a video
that people can access all over the world on computers, mobile devices, televisions. I weight about 190 pounds. How much will the video weigh? Asking questions like that is what I do every week
on my channel Vsauce. For the last two years, I have been asking really fun questions, mind-boggling questions, and approaching them
as sincerely as I can, celebrating scientific
concepts and scientists. And I research and write and produce and host and edit and upload and run the social media all by myself, but it's not lonely, because Vsauce has
more than 2 million subscribers, and every month, my videos are seen
by more than 20 million people. Yeah. (Applause) It's very exciting. I've found that asking a strange question
is a great way to get people in, not just people, but fans. And fans are different
than just viewers or an audience, because fans want to come back. They subscribe to you on YouTube and they want to watch
everything you've made and everything you plan
to make in the future because we are curious people and sparking curiosity is great bait. It's a great way to catch a human. And once you've caught them, you have this captive
audience that you can, with the goal in mind
of answering the question, accidentally teach a lot of things to. So, let's take a look
at some of my videos. Here are eight of them. But down here in the lower-right corner, "What Color is a Mirror?" When people see that, it's very difficult not to click,
because you think, "Come on, are you serious? How could you possibly
answer that question?" Well, so far, 7.6 million
people have watched this five-minute video
about what color a mirror is. And in that episode, I answer the question and I get a chance to explain
what would normally be kind of dry topics: optics, diffuse versus specular reflection, how light works,
how light works on the retina, and even the etymology of color terms like white and black. Okay, spoiler alert: mirrors are not clear, they are not silvery, like they're often illustrated. Mirrors, technically speaking, are just a tiny, tiny, little bit ... green. You can demonstrate this
by putting two mirrors next to each other, facing so they reflect
back and forth forever. Look down that infinite reflection,
and it will get dimmer, because some light is lost
or absorbed every time, but it will also become greener, because green light, that is light of a wavelength
that we perceive as green, is best reflected by most mirrors. Okay, so, how much does a video weigh? Well, when you stream
a video onto your computer, that information is temporarily stored using electrons. And the number of electrons on your device
won't actually increase or decrease. But it takes energy
to store them in one place, and, thanks to our friend Albert Einstein, we know that energy and mass are related. Okay, so here's the thing: let's say you're watching a YouTube video at a really nice resolution, 720p. Assuming a typical bit rate, we can figure that a minute
of YouTube video is going to need to involve
about 10 million electrons on your device. Plugging all those electrons
and the energy it takes to hold them in the correct place
for you to see the video, into that formula, we can figure out
that one minute of YouTube video increases the mass of your computer by about 10 to the negative 19th grams. Written out, it looks like this. (Whistle) That's like nothing. You could call that nothing,
and you wouldn't really get in trouble, because the best scales
we've ever invented that we could try to use
to actually to detect that change are only accurate to 10
to the negative 9th grams. So, we can't measure it, but we can, like we just did,
calculate it. And that's really cool
because when I was a kid, my school had two shelves
of science books. That was really cool, but I read all of them
within, like, two grades, and it was hard to get more books because books are heavy,
you need space for them and moving books around is tougher
than what we can do today. With numbers that small, I can fit thousands of books on my own little personal
electronic reader. I can stream hours and hours and days and days of YouTube video without my computer
ever getting measurably heavier. And as information becomes that light, it becomes a lot more democratic, meaning that more teachers and presenters and creators
and viewers than ever before can be involved. Right now, on YouTube, there is an explosion
of content like this happening. The three Vsauce channels
are down there in the corner. But everyone else,
all together, collectively, their views dwarf what I can do alone or with the people that I work with, and that is really, really exciting. It turns out that tapping
into people's curiosity and responsibly answering their questions is a brilliant way to build
fans and an audience and get in viewers. It's even a great way
for brands and companies to build trust. So, calculating the weight of a video is kind of a funny question, but I cannot wait to see
what we ask and answer next. As always, thanks for watching. (Applause)

Bean bags are awesome. But I see a few people out there
who are standing, we've got some over here, and standing takes more
work than lounging. Using the Live Strong
Organization's online database of weight loss resources, you can calculate that by the time I'm done
with this speech, those of you who are standing will have burned 7.5 more calories than those of you who are bean-bagging it. (Laughter) Okay, here's a question, speaking of weight loss,
specifically weight, this speech is live. I'm actually here in front of you guys, we're all here together. But this speech is being recorded and it will become a video
that people can access all over the world on computers, mobile devices, televisions. I weight about 190 pounds. How much will the video weigh? Asking questions like that is what I do every week
on my channel Vsauce. For the last two years, I have been asking really fun questions, mind-boggling questions, and approaching them
as sincerely as I can, celebrating scientific
concepts and scientists. And I research and write and produce and host and edit and upload and run the social media all by myself, but it's not lonely, because Vsauce has
more than 2 million subscribers, and every month, my videos are seen
by more than 20 million people. Yeah. (Applause) It's very exciting. I've found that asking a strange question
is a great way to get people in, not just people, but fans. And fans are different
than just viewers or an audience, because fans want to come back. They subscribe to you on YouTube and they want to watch
everything you've made and everything you plan
to make in the future because we are curious people and sparking curiosity is great bait. It's a great way to catch a human. And once you've caught them, you have this captive
audience that you can, with the goal in mind
of answering the question, accidentally teach a lot of things to. So, let's take a look
at some of my videos. Here are eight of them. But down here in the lower-right corner, "What Color is a Mirror?" When people see that, it's very difficult not to click,
because you think, "Come on, are you serious? How could you possibly
answer that question?" Well, so far, 7.6 million
people have watched this five-minute video
about what color a mirror is. And in that episode, I answer the question and I get a chance to explain
what would normally be kind of dry topics: optics, diffuse versus specular reflection, how light works,
how light works on the retina, and even the etymology of color terms like white and black. Okay, spoiler alert: mirrors are not clear, they are not silvery, like they're often illustrated. Mirrors, technically speaking, are just a tiny, tiny, little bit ... green. You can demonstrate this
by putting two mirrors next to each other, facing so they reflect
back and forth forever. Look down that infinite reflection,
and it will get dimmer, because some light is lost
or absorbed every time, but it will also become greener, because green light, that is light of a wavelength
that we perceive as green, is best reflected by most mirrors. Okay, so, how much does a video weigh? Well, when you stream
a video onto your computer, that information is temporarily stored using electrons. And the number of electrons on your device
won't actually increase or decrease. But it takes energy
to store them in one place, and, thanks to our friend Albert Einstein, we know that energy and mass are related. Okay, so here's the thing: let's say you're watching a YouTube video at a really nice resolution, 720p. Assuming a typical bit rate, we can figure that a minute
of YouTube video is going to need to involve
about 10 million electrons on your device. Plugging all those electrons
and the energy it takes to hold them in the correct place
for you to see the video, into that formula, we can figure out
that one minute of YouTube video increases the mass of your computer by about 10 to the negative 19th grams. Written out, it looks like this. (Whistle) That's like nothing. You could call that nothing,
and you wouldn't really get in trouble, because the best scales
we've ever invented that we could try to use
to actually to detect that change are only accurate to 10
to the negative 9th grams. So, we can't measure it, but we can, like we just did,
calculate it. And that's really cool
because when I was a kid, my school had two shelves
of science books. That was really cool, but I read all of them
within, like, two grades, and it was hard to get more books because books are heavy,
you need space for them and moving books around is tougher
than what we can do today. With numbers that small, I can fit thousands of books on my own little personal
electronic reader. I can stream hours and hours and days and days of YouTube video without my computer
ever getting measurably heavier. And as information becomes that light, it becomes a lot more democratic, meaning that more teachers and presenters and creators
and viewers than ever before can be involved. Right now, on YouTube, there is an explosion
of content like this happening. The three Vsauce channels
are down there in the corner. But everyone else,
all together, collectively, their views dwarf what I can do alone or with the people that I work with, and that is really, really exciting. It turns out that tapping
into people's curiosity and responsibly answering their questions is a brilliant way to build
fans and an audience and get in viewers. It's even a great way
for brands and companies to build trust. So, calculating the weight of a video is kind of a funny question, but I cannot wait to see
what we ask and answer next. As always, thanks for watching. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar So I work on trying to understand how the universe works at the very basic level, the most basic level we can find. So, when you try in your everyday life to try and work out how something works, what you're actually doing is you're looking for what I call hidden structures. For example, you take something like your cell phone, your smart phone, it's a complicated object, and you might wonder how it works. Well, what you can do is go in and actually take it apart. You'll void the warranty, but that's OK. And you'll go in and what you'll find is that it's made of tiny little electronic components. And those electronic components are actually moving around a certain kind of particle that we know that's called the electron, and that's where the name "electronics" comes from. So if you know the actual rules of how to put those things together, you can actually make your smart phone or you could make various other electronic devices as well. So, there are people like myself who, actually for a living, try and do this sort of thing not just for, say, a cell phone or its components, but asking what, say, your hand is made of, or the chair you're sitting in, or the planet Earth, the sun, the stars, the entire universe. And so, using various kinds of instruments and observations and experiments, we've been able to probe deeper and deeper over the years, and we now know that the matter that we're made of and that we see around us is actually made of tiny little elementary particles. And elementary particles interact with each other via the forces of nature, but we've also discovered that those forces of nature themselves actually operate by exchanging elementary particles as well. They're actually particles of force that are exchanged by the particles of matter. And you may have heard this year that there was big news, a major announcement in this story, the Large Hadron Collider, the LHC, a huge experiment in Europe, has actually uncovered a Higgs boson, and that particle's job is to interact with the various elementary particles and give them the masses that we observe. So, this exciting picture is analogous to the one I showed you for the cell phone. We have the components and we have the rules of particle theory, as it's called, by which these all operate and give rise to the various things. Now, we actually think that we've only just scratched the surface of finding this quantum world, the hidden structure of our world. Let me give you three examples of the puzzles we're still working on. So, what I did is I gathered the particles up into the patterns that they tend to form, but we don't know where those patterns come from. We know how to describe the particles, but we don't know where the patterns come from. When you see patterns in science, you look for a hidden structure, so that's one of the things. Also, we now know that there's a huge amount more matter out there than just the things that I was just talking about. That stuff is called dark matter. We don't know what it is, and we'd like to be able to get it and experiment with it and figure out what it is. And then, the other thing I'd like to talk about is the fact that the force of gravity, perhaps the most familiar force we know, when you get down to the quantum level, it actually doesn't operate according to those rules of particle theory. So, given that gravity is actually about the shape of space and time as Einstein taught us, we, in working out what the quantum story of gravity is, which we call quantum gravity, we hope to get to groups of questions like, are there particles of space and time itself and how do they fit together? What are the rules? So, this leads us to things like studying where it all began, 13.7 billion years ago, the Big Bang. We know matter and energy as we understand it was created, but also, space and time itself. So those are the sorts of things we study in this quest. Also, we have things that are around us today, such as black holes, which are very important clues. They're actually holes in space that we'd like to understand. Also, the newly discovered dark energy, which is the tendency of space all through the universe to accelerate its expansion. So scientists are working on these kinds of things, trying to understand what we think is now the case that there's not just hidden structures of matter and energy, but also space and time. So the question is, what are the rules? And there are many approaches to this, and one of them is one you may have heard of, called string theory. And so it is one of many approaches and we don't know if it's right yet, we're not finished developing the theory, but it's given us some really exciting, tantalizing hints. I'd like to tell you about a few of them. So, one of them is simply that you take away the idea of looking for a tiny quantum particle, you look instead for an extended object, a string, which can vibrate. And it actually gives you some exciting opportunities because, for example, it would say if we've missed that hidden structure by not looking closely enough, we wouldn't realize that many different kinds of particles are just different vibrations of the same string, which is a really exciting possibility and a huge simplification. So that's one of the ideas. The other thing that's really exciting about string theory is that one of those particles it describes is actually the missing quantum of gravity that we have been trying to understand. And then the other thing is that strings actually, instead of one wanting just to move in the dimensions, the three space dimensions that we are familiar with, actually seem to want to move in higher dimensions. So we have this idea, then, what would it mean for our world, if this were anything to do with our world, and we don't know that yet? Here's a way that our world would arise from that. You would have our world, and then one of the hidden structures would be hidden chunks in space time that are not visible, those extra dimensions. And then the various particles that we see in the world would come from being vibrations of strings and those patterns we saw that we can't explain come from the fact that the strings can probe and feel the shape of those internal dimensions. So, one of the things, then, is can we actually test this? This is a lovely idea, but how do we confront this with real experiments and observations because we're doing science here? And that's the hard thing. We think that the energy you need to probe the tiny-enough scales to see the strings if they're there, is more than we can hope to get any time soon. But what we can do is we can look for the consequences of those hidden structures, we can look for how those things show up in physics that we can get access to. So, that's why we study things like dark matter, black holes, dark energy, and we also look at remnants of the early universe, the cosmic microwave background that satellites. And, importantly, we look for clues from the various kinds of particle physics experiments, like the LHC. So, one last thing, then, is a new thing that's been going on. String theory may turn out to be useful in other areas of physics. There are new kinds of experiments that start out, say, with our friend the electron, and actually show that in certain circumstances, the electrons interact in a way that give you completely new, weird kinds of behavior. And there are models that show that string theory's actually the best way. In some circumstances, using the rules of string theory, you can actually explain that sort of behavior. So this gives us an exciting possibility, there's real experiments you can do with these electrons that will help us shape the rules for what string theory is. And you might go, "Well, OK, that's going to give us maybe some fancy new kind of electronics that we can make a better cell phone with." But, what I'm saying that those rules may actually be the same rules we're looking for to see if string theory can help us with these bigger questions. So, at the end of the day, the hidden structures of the universe we're looking for, may, one day, be right under our noses. Thank you.

And so, using various kinds of instruments and observations and experiments, we've been able to probe deeper and deeper over the years, and we now know that the matter that we're made of and that we see around us is actually made of tiny little elementary particles. And elementary particles interact with each other via the forces of nature, but we've also discovered that those forces of nature themselves actually operate by exchanging elementary particles as well. They're actually particles of force that are exchanged by the particles of matter. And you may have heard this year that there was big news, a major announcement in this story, the Large Hadron Collider, the LHC, a huge experiment in Europe, has actually uncovered a Higgs boson, and that particle's job is to interact with the various elementary particles and give them the masses that we observe. So, this exciting picture is analogous to the one I showed you for the cell phone. We have the components and we have the rules of particle theory, as it's called, by which these all operate and give rise to the various things. Now, we actually think that we've only just scratched the surface of finding this quantum world, the hidden structure of our world. Let me give you three examples of the puzzles we're still working on. So, what I did is I gathered the particles up into the patterns that they tend to form, but we don't know where those patterns come from. We know how to describe the particles, but we don't know where the patterns come from. When you see patterns in science, you look for a hidden structure, so that's one of the things. Also, we now know that there's a huge amount more matter out there than just the things that I was just talking about. That stuff is called dark matter. We don't know what it is, and we'd like to be able to get it and experiment with it and figure out what it is. And then, the other thing I'd like to talk about is the fact that the force of gravity, perhaps the most familiar force we know, when you get down to the quantum level, it actually doesn't operate according to those rules of particle theory. So, given that gravity is actually about the shape of space and time as Einstein taught us, we, in working out what the quantum story of gravity is, which we call quantum gravity, we hope to get to groups of questions like, are there particles of space and time itself and how do they fit together? What are the rules? So, this leads us to things like studying where it all began, 13.7 billion years ago, the Big Bang. We know matter and energy as we understand it was created, but also, space and time itself. So those are the sorts of things we study in this quest. Also, we have things that are around us today, such as black holes, which are very important clues. They're actually holes in space that we'd like to understand. Also, the newly discovered dark energy, which is the tendency of space all through the universe to accelerate its expansion. So scientists are working on these kinds of things, trying to understand what we think is now the case that there's not just hidden structures of matter and energy, but also space and time. So the question is, what are the rules? And there are many approaches to this, and one of them is one you may have heard of, called string theory. And so it is one of many approaches and we don't know if it's right yet, we're not finished developing the theory, but it's given us some really exciting, tantalizing hints. I'd like to tell you about a few of them. So, one of them is simply that you take away the idea of looking for a tiny quantum particle, you look instead for an extended object, a string, which can vibrate. And it actually gives you some exciting opportunities because, for example, it would say if we've missed that hidden structure by not looking closely enough, we wouldn't realize that many different kinds of particles are just different vibrations of the same string, which is a really exciting possibility and a huge simplification. So that's one of the ideas. The other thing that's really exciting about string theory is that one of those particles it describes is actually the missing quantum of gravity that we have been trying to understand. And then the other thing is that strings actually, instead of one wanting just to move in the dimensions, the three space dimensions that we are familiar with, actually seem to want to move in higher dimensions. So we have this idea, then, what would it mean for our world, if this were anything to do with our world, and we don't know that yet? Here's a way that our world would arise from that. You would have our world, and then one of the hidden structures would be hidden chunks in space time that are not visible, those extra dimensions. And then the various particles that we see in the world would come from being vibrations of strings and those patterns we saw that we can't explain come from the fact that the strings can probe and feel the shape of those internal dimensions. So, one of the things, then, is can we actually test this? This is a lovely idea, but how do we confront this with real experiments and observations because we're doing science here? And that's the hard thing. We think that the energy you need to probe the tiny-enough scales to see the strings if they're there, is more than we can hope to get any time soon. But what we can do is we can look for the consequences of those hidden structures, we can look for how those things show up in physics that we can get access to. So, that's why we study things like dark matter, black holes, dark energy, and we also look at remnants of the early universe, the cosmic microwave background that satellites. And, importantly, we look for clues from the various kinds of particle physics experiments, like the LHC. So, one last thing, then, is a new thing that's been going on. String theory may turn out to be useful in other areas of physics. There are new kinds of experiments that start out, say, with our friend the electron, and actually show that in certain circumstances, the electrons interact in a way that give you completely new, weird kinds of behavior. And there are models that show that string theory's actually the best way. In some circumstances, using the rules of string theory, you can actually explain that sort of behavior. So this gives us an exciting possibility, there's real experiments you can do with these electrons that will help us shape the rules for what string theory is. And you might go, "Well, OK, that's going to give us maybe some fancy new kind of electronics that we can make a better cell phone with." But, what I'm saying that those rules may actually be the same rules we're looking for to see if string theory can help us with these bigger questions. So, at the end of the day, the hidden structures of the universe we're looking for, may, one day, be right under our noses. Thank you.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar So I work on trying to understand how the universe works at the very basic level, the most basic level we can find. So, when you try in your everyday life to try and work out how something works, what you're actually doing is you're looking for what I call hidden structures. For example, you take something like your cell phone, your smart phone, it's a complicated object, and you might wonder how it works. Well, what you can do is go in and actually take it apart. You'll void the warranty, but that's OK. And you'll go in and what you'll find is that it's made of tiny little electronic components. And those electronic components are actually moving around a certain kind of particle that we know that's called the electron, and that's where the name "electronics" comes from. So if you know the actual rules of how to put those things together, you can actually make your smart phone or you could make various other electronic devices as well.

[Music] [Music] when I was 11 I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house my father was listening to BBC news on his small gray radio there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then because the news mostly depressed him the Taliban are gone my father shouted I didn't know what it meant but I could see that my father was very very happy you can go to a real school now he said a morning that I will never forget a real school you see I was six when Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school so for the next 5 years I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister who was no longer allowed to be outside alone to a secret school it was the only way we both could be educated each day we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going we would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping the school was in a house more than 100 of us packed in one small living room it was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer we all knew we were risking Our Lives the teacher the students and our parents from time to time a school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious we always wondered what they knew about us why are we being followed do they know where we live we were scared but still school was where we wanted to be I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was priced and daughters were treasured my grandfather was extraordinary man for his time a total Maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan he insisted that his daughter my mom go to school and for that he was disowned by his father but my educated mother became a teacher there she is she retired two years ago only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood and my father that's him he was the first ever in his family to receive an education there was no question that his children will receive an education including his daughters despite the Taliban despite the risks to him there was greater risk in not educating his children during Taliban years I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future I would want to quit but my father he would say listen my daughter you can lose everything you own in your life your money can be stolen you can be forced to leave your home during a war but the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees we will so do you still not want to continue today I'm 22 I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by Decades of War fewer than 6% of women my age have made it Beyond high school and had my family not been so committed to my education I would be one of them instead I stand Here a proud graduate of midbury college when I returned to Afghanistan my grandfather the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters was among the first to congratulate me he not only brags about my college degree but also that I was the first woman and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Cabo my family Believes In Me I dream big but my family dreams even bigger for me that's why I am a global Ambassador for 10times 10 a global campaign to educate women that's why I co-founded Sola the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan a country where it's still risky for girlss to go to school the exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing an opportunity and I see their parents and their fathers who like my own advocate for them despite and even in the face of daunting opposition like like Ahmed that's not his real name and I cannot show you his face but Ahmed is the father of one of my students less than a month ago he and his daughter were on on their way from Sola to their Village and they literally missed being killed by a roadside Bomb by minutes as he arrived home the phone rang a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school they would try again kill me now if you wish he said but I will not ruin my daughter's future because of your old and backward ideas what I've come to realize about aanas sun and this is something that is often dismissed in the west that behind most most most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success it's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success in fact they're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a a bright future for their daughters but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan we must have the support of men under the Taliban girls who went to school numbered in hundreds remember it was illegal but today more than 3 million girls are in school in Afghanistan aanan looks so different from here in America I find that Americans see the fragility in changes I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the US troops withdrawal but when I'm back in Afghanistan when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them who encourage them I see a promising future and Lasting change to me Afghanistan is a country of Hope and boundless possibilities and every single day the girls of solar remind me of that like me they are dreaming big thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] when I was 11 I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house my father was listening to BBC news on his small gray radio there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then because the news mostly depressed him the Taliban are gone my father shouted I didn't know what it meant but I could see that my father was very very happy you can go to a real school now he said a morning that I will never forget a real school you see I was six when Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school so for the next 5 years I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister who was no longer allowed to be outside alone to a secret school it was the only way we both could be educated each day we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going we would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping the school was in a house more than 100 of us packed in one small living room it was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer we all knew we were risking Our Lives the teacher the students and our parents from time to time a school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious we always wondered what they knew about us why are we being followed do they know where we live we were scared but still school was where we wanted to be I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was priced and daughters were treasured my grandfather was extraordinary man for his time a total Maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan he insisted that his daughter my mom go to school and for that he was disowned by his father but my educated mother became a teacher there she is she retired two years ago only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood and my father that's him he was the first ever in his family to receive an education there was no question that his children will receive an education including his daughters despite the Taliban despite the risks to him there was greater risk in not educating his children during Taliban years I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future I would want to quit but my father he would say listen my daughter you can lose everything you own in your life your money can be stolen you can be forced to leave your home during a war but the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees we will so do you still not want to continue today I'm 22 I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by Decades of War fewer than 6% of women my age have made it Beyond high school and had my family not been so committed to my education I would be one of them instead I stand Here a proud graduate of midbury college when I returned to Afghanistan my grandfather the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters was among the first to congratulate me he not only brags about my college degree but also that I was the first woman and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Cabo my family Believes In Me I dream big but my family dreams even bigger for me that's why I am a global Ambassador for 10times 10 a global campaign to educate women that's why I co-founded Sola the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan a country where it's still risky for girlss to go to school the exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing an opportunity and I see their parents and their fathers who like my own advocate for them despite and even in the face of daunting opposition like like Ahmed that's not his real name and I cannot show you his face but Ahmed is the father of one of my students less than a month ago he and his daughter were on on their way from Sola to their Village and they literally missed being killed by a roadside Bomb by minutes as he arrived home the phone rang a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school they would try again kill me now if you wish he said but I will not ruin my daughter's future because of your old and backward ideas what I've come to realize about aanas sun and this is something that is often dismissed in the west that behind most most most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success it's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success in fact they're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a a bright future for their daughters but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan we must have the support of men under the Taliban girls who went to school numbered in hundreds remember it was illegal but today more than 3 million girls are in school in Afghanistan aanan looks so different from here in America I find that Americans see the fragility in changes I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the US troops withdrawal but when I'm back in Afghanistan when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them who encourage them I see a promising future and Lasting change to me Afghanistan is a country of Hope and boundless possibilities and every single day the girls of solar remind me of that like me they are dreaming big thank you

[Music] [Applause] you should be nice to nerds in fact I'd go so far as to say if you don't already have a nerd in your life you should get one I'm I'm just saying scientists and Engineers change the world I'd like to tell you about a magical place called DARPA where scientists and Engineers defy The Impossible and refuse to fear failure now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize because when you remove the fear of failure impossible things suddenly become possible if you want to know how ask yourself this question what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail if you really ask yourself this question you can't help but feel uncomfortable I feel a little uncomfortable because when you ask it you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you how it keeps us from attemp tempting great things and life gets dull amazing things stop happening sure good things happen but amazing things stop happening now I should be clear I'm not encouraging failure I'm discouraging fear of failure because it's not failure itself that constrains us the path to truly new never been done before things always has failure along the way we're tested and in part that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great Clemens so said life gets interesting when we fail because it's a sign that we've surpassed ourselves in 1895 Lord Kelvin declared that heavier than air flying machines were impossible in October of 1903 the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly and 2 months later on December 17th Orville Wright powered the first airplane across a beach in North Carolina the flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 ft that was 1903 one year later the next Declarations of impossibilities began Ferdinand fos a French army General credited with having one of the most original and subtle Minds in the French army said airplanes are interesting toys but of

supersonically we talk about flying hypersonically not mock 2 or Mach 3 mach 20 at mach 20 we can fly from New York to Long Beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds at that speed the surface of the air foil is the temperature of molten steel 3,500 de F like a blast furnace we are essentially burning the air foil as we fly it and we are flying it or trying to DARPA Hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built it's boosted to near space at top a minitar 4 rocket now the minitar 4 has too much impulse so we have to Bleed It Off by flying the rocket at an 89° angle of attack for portions of the trajectory that's an unnatural act for a rocket the third stage has a camera we call it rocket Cam and it's pointed at the Hypersonic glider this is the actual rocket cam footage from flight one now to conceal the shape we changed the aspect ratio a little bit but this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider as it heads into the atmosphere back towards Earth we've flown twice in the first flight no aerodynamic control of the vehicle but we collected more Hypersonic flight data than in 30 years of groundbased testing combined and in the second flight 3 minutes of fully controlled aerodynamic flight at mach 20 we must fly again because amazing never been done before things require that you fly you can't learn to fly at Mack 20 unless you fly and while there's no substitute for Speed maneuverability is a very close second if a mock 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds to get from New York to Long Beach a hummingbird would take well days you see hummingbirds are not Hypersonic but they are maneuverable in fact the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards it can fly up down forwards backwards even upside down and so if we wanted to fly in this room or place places where humans can't go we'd need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so this is a hummingbird drone it can fly in all directions even backwards it can hover and rotate this prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera it weighs less than one ablea battery it does not eat nectar in 2008 it flew for a whopping 20 seconds a year later 2 minutes then six eventually 11 many prototypes crashed many but there's no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly it's beautiful isn't it wow it's great Matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot failure is part of creating new and amazing things we cannot both fear failure and make amazing new things like a robot with the stability of a dog on rough terrain or maybe even ice a robot that can run like a cheetah or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human or perhaps Spider-Man will one day be gecko man a gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe one square mimer of a gecko's foot pad has 14,000 hairlike structures called sete they are used to help it grip to surfaces using intermolecular forces today we can manufacture structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko's foot the result of four 4x4 in artificial nanog gecko adhesive can support a static load of 660 lb that's enough to stick 6 42 in plasma TVs to your wall no nails so much for velcro right and it's not just passive structures it's entire machines this is a spider mite it's 1 mm long but it looks like Godzilla next to these micro machines in the world of Godzilla spidermites we can make millions of mirrors each 1if the diameter of a human hair moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second to make large screen displays so that we can watch movies like Godzilla in high def and if we can build machines at that scale what what about Eiffel Tower like trusses at the micro scale today we are making metals that are lighter than styrofoam so light they can sit a top a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air so light that you can make a car that two people can lift but so strong that it has the crash worthiness of an SUV from the smallest wisp of air air to the powerful forces of Nature's storms there are 44 lightning strikes per second around the globe each lightning bolt heats the air to 44,000 de F hotter than the surface of the Sun what if we could use these electromagnetic pulses as beacons beacons in a moving network of powerful transmitters experiments suggest that lightning could be the next GPS electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains using a grid the size of your thumb with 32 electrodes on the surface of his brain Tim uses his thoughts B I want to control an advanced prosthetic arm and his thoughts made him reach for Katie this is the first time time a human has controlled a robot with thought alone sorry and it is the first time that Tim has held Katie's hand in seven years that moment mattered to Tim and Katie and this green goo May someday matter to you this green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life it was made in tobacco plants tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever and if it seems far-fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy what about Gamers that could solve problems that experts can't solve last September the gamers of foldit solved the three-dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to AIDS in reesus monkeys now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments for 15 years it was unsolved in the scientific Community The Gamers of Fold It solved it in 15 days now they were able to do so by working together they were able to work together because they're connected by the internet and others also connected to the internet used it as an instrument of democracy and together they changed the fate of their Nation the internet is home to two billion people or 30% of the world's population it allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals it allows us to amplify our voices and our p power as a group but it too had humble beginnings in 1969 the internet was but a dream a few sketches on a piece of paper and then on October 29th the first packet switched message was sent from UCLA to Sri the first two letters of the word login that's all that made it through an l and an O and then a buffer overflow crashed the system two letters an l and an O now a worldwide Force so who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called DARPA they are nerds and they are heroes Among Us they challenge existing perspectives at the edges of Science and under the most demanding of conditions they remind us that we can change the world if we defy The Impossible and we refuse to fear failure they remind us that we all have nerd power sometimes we just forget you see there was a time when you weren't afraid of failure when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing you were good at math you could build things you were an astronaut an adventurer jacqu custo you could jump higher run faster kick harder than anyone you believed in impossible things and you were Fearless you were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero scientists and Engineers can indeed change the world so can you you were born to so go ahead ask yourself what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail now I want to say this is not easy it's hard to hold on to this feeling really hard I guess in some way I sort of believe it's supposed to be hard doubt and fear always creep in we think someone else someone smarter than us someone more capable someone with more resources will solve that problem but there isn't anyone else there's just you and if we're lucky in that moment someone steps into that doubt and fear takes a hand and says let me help you believe Jason Harley did that for me Jason started at DARPA on March 18th 2010 he was with with our transportation team I saw Jason nearly every day sometimes twice a day and more so than most he saw the highs and the lows the celebrations and the disappointments and on one particularly dark day for me Jason sat down and he wrote an email he was encouraging but firm and when he hit send he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make it mattered to me in that moment and still today when I doubt when I feel afraid when I need to reconnect with that feeling I remember his words they were so powerful supero supero supero [Music] super superhero superhero music superhero superhero music superhero [Music] superhero because that's what being a superhero is all [Applause] about there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you and remember be nice to nerds thank you thank you rea thank you I have a couple of questions the um so that glider of yours the mark 20 glider Mark glider the first one uh no control it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere it did what happened on that second flight yeah it also went in the Pacific but this time under control well yeah no we didn't fly it into the Pacific right um no there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed and so in the second flight we were able to get 3 minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it I I imagine you're not planning to open up to passenger service from New York to Long Beach it might be a little warm what do you picture what what do you picture that glider being used for well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this how it's ultimately used will be determined by the military now the purpose of the vehicle though the purpose of the technology is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes and to carry a payload of more than a few pounds yeah like what's the payload it could carry well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be right we got to fly it first but not necessarily just a camera yeah no not necessarily just a camera um it it's it's amazing um the the the the the hummingbird um I mean I'm curious you know you you started your beautiful sequence on flight with with a wing a plane kind of trying to flap its wings and failing horribly and there haven't been that many planes built since that flat Wings why why did we think that this was the time to go bio mimicry and and copy a hummingbird isn't that a very expensive solution for a small well maneuverable flying object so I mean in part we wondered if it was possible to do it and you have to revisit these questions over time the folks at aerovironment tried 300 or more different Wing designs 12 different forms of the avionics took them 10 full prototypes to get something that would actually fly but there's something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something you'd recognize so we often talk about Stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing but when things look just natural you also don't see them ah ah so it's not necessar Ste it's partly the the look actually sure look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters I mean because that's the that's I think as well as the a at looking at that I'm sure some people here are thinking you know technology catches up so quick how long is it before some crazed geek with a little remote control flies R through a window of the White House I mean do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here well look our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise that's what we do it would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we didn't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time it's just the nature of what we do now our responsibility is to push that edge and you know we have to be of course Mindful and responsible of how the technology is developed and ultimately used but we can't simply close our eyes and pretend that it isn't advancing it's advancing I mean you're you're clearly a really inspiring leader and um um you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention but at a personal level I mean in a way I can't imagine doing your job do you wake up in the night sometimes just asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of of your team Brilliance sure I mean I think it would you couldn't be human if you didn't ask those questions you know how do you answer them well I don't always have answers for them right I think that um we learn as time goes on I mean my job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you can have I work with some of the most amazing people and with that exhilaration comes a really deep sense of responsibility and so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what's possible right and this tremendous seriousness of what it means Regina that was jaw dropping as I say thank you so much for coming to thank [Applause] [Music] you

Force so who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called DARPA they are nerds and they are heroes Among Us they challenge existing perspectives at the edges of Science and under the most demanding of conditions they remind us that we can change the world if we defy The Impossible and we refuse to fear failure they remind us that we all have nerd power sometimes we just forget you see there was a time when you weren't afraid of failure when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing you were good at math you could build things you were an astronaut an adventurer jacqu custo you could jump higher run faster kick harder than anyone you believed in impossible things and you were Fearless you were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero scientists and Engineers can indeed change the world so can you you were born to so go ahead ask yourself what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail now I want to say this is not easy it's hard to hold on to this feeling really hard I guess in some way I sort of believe it's supposed to be hard doubt and fear always creep in we think someone else someone smarter than us someone more capable someone with more resources will solve that problem but there isn't anyone else there's just you and if we're lucky in that moment someone steps into that doubt and fear takes a hand and says let me help you believe Jason Harley did that for me Jason started at DARPA on March 18th 2010 he was with with our transportation team I saw Jason nearly every day sometimes twice a day and more so than most he saw the highs and the lows the celebrations and the disappointments and on one particularly dark day for me Jason sat down and he wrote an email he was encouraging but firm and when he hit send he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make it mattered to me in that moment and still today when I doubt when I feel afraid when I need to reconnect with that feeling I remember his words they were so powerful supero supero supero [Music] super superhero superhero music superhero superhero music superhero [Music] superhero because that's what being a superhero is all [Applause] about there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you and remember be nice to nerds thank you thank you rea thank you I have a couple of questions the um so that glider of yours the mark 20 glider Mark glider the first one uh no control it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere it did what happened on that second flight yeah it also went in the Pacific but this time under control well yeah no we didn't fly it into the Pacific right um no there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed and so in the second flight we were able to get 3 minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it I I imagine you're not planning to open up to passenger service from New York to Long Beach it might be a little warm what do you picture what what do you picture that glider being used for well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this how it's ultimately used will be determined by the military now the purpose of the vehicle though the purpose of the technology is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes and to carry a payload of more than a few pounds yeah like what's the payload it could carry well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be right we got to fly it first but not necessarily just a camera yeah no not necessarily just a camera um it it's it's amazing um the the the the the hummingbird um I mean I'm curious you know you you started your beautiful sequence on flight with with a wing a plane kind of trying to flap its wings and failing horribly and there haven't been that many planes built since that flat Wings why why did we think that this was the time to go bio mimicry and and copy a hummingbird isn't that a very expensive solution for a small well maneuverable flying object so I mean in part we wondered if it was possible to do it and you have to revisit these questions over time the folks at aerovironment tried 300 or more different Wing designs 12 different forms of the avionics took them 10 full prototypes to get something that would actually fly but there's something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something you'd recognize so we often talk about Stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing but when things look just natural you also don't see them ah ah so it's not necessar Ste it's partly the the look actually sure look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters I mean because that's the that's I think as well as the a at looking at that I'm sure some people here are thinking you know technology catches up so quick how long is it before some crazed geek with a little remote control flies R through a window of the White House I mean do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here well look our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise that's what we do it would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we didn't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time it's just the nature of what we do now our responsibility is to push that edge and you know we have to be of course Mindful and responsible of how the technology is developed and ultimately used but we can't simply close our eyes and pretend that it isn't advancing it's advancing I mean you're you're clearly a really inspiring leader and um um you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention but at a personal level I mean in a way I can't imagine doing your job do you wake up in the night sometimes just asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of of your team Brilliance sure I mean I think it would you couldn't be human if you didn't ask those questions you know how do you answer them well I don't always have answers for them right I think that um we learn as time goes on I mean my job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you can have I work with some of the most amazing people and with that exhilaration comes a really deep sense of responsibility and so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what's possible right and this tremendous seriousness of what it means Regina that was jaw dropping as I say thank you so much for coming to thank [Applause] [Music] you

[Music] [Applause] you should be nice to nerds in fact I'd go so far as to say if you don't already have a nerd in your life you should get one I'm I'm just saying scientists and Engineers change the world I'd like to tell you about a magical place called DARPA where scientists and Engineers defy The Impossible and refuse to fear failure now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize because when you remove the fear of failure impossible things suddenly become possible if you want to know how ask yourself this question what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail if you really ask yourself this question you can't help but feel uncomfortable I feel a little uncomfortable because when you ask it you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you how it keeps us from attemp tempting great things and life gets dull amazing things stop happening sure good things happen but amazing things stop happening now I should be clear I'm not encouraging failure I'm discouraging fear of failure because it's not failure itself that constrains us the path to truly new never been done before things always has failure along the way we're tested and in part that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great Clemens so said life gets interesting when we fail because it's a sign that we've surpassed ourselves in 1895 Lord Kelvin declared that heavier than air flying machines were impossible in October of 1903 the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly and 2 months later on December 17th Orville Wright powered the first airplane across a beach in North Carolina the flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 ft that was 1903 one year later the next Declarations of impossibilities began Ferdinand fos a French army General credited with having one of the most original and subtle Minds in the French army said airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value 40 years later AO experts coined the term transonic they debed should it have 1 s or two you see they were having trouble in this flight regime and it wasn't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound in 1947 there was no wind tunnel data Beyond Mach 0.85 and yet on Tuesday October 14th 1947 Chuck gagger climbed into the cockpit of his Bell X1 and he flew towards an unknown possibility and in so doing he became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound six of eight Atlas rockets blew up on the pad after 11 complete mission failures we got our first images from space and on that first flight we got more data than in all you two missions combined it took a lot of failures to get there since we took to the sky we have wanted to fly faster and farther and to do so we've had to believe in impossible things and we've had to refuse to fear failure that's still true today today we don't talk about flying trans sonically or even supersonically we talk about flying hypersonically not mock 2 or Mach 3 mach 20 at mach 20 we can fly from New York to Long Beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds at that speed the surface of the air foil is the temperature of molten steel 3,500 de F like a blast furnace we are essentially burning the air foil as we fly it and we are flying it or trying to DARPA Hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built it's boosted to near space at top a minitar 4 rocket now the minitar 4 has too much impulse so we have to Bleed It Off by flying the rocket at an 89° angle of attack for portions of the trajectory that's an unnatural act for a rocket the third stage has a camera we call it rocket Cam and it's pointed at the Hypersonic glider this is the actual rocket cam footage from flight one now to conceal the shape we changed the aspect ratio a little bit but this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider as it heads into the atmosphere back towards Earth we've flown twice in the first flight no aerodynamic control of the vehicle but we collected more Hypersonic flight data than in 30 years of groundbased testing combined and in the second flight 3 minutes of fully controlled aerodynamic flight at mach 20 we must fly again because amazing never been done before things require that you fly you can't learn to fly at Mack 20 unless you fly and while there's no substitute for Speed maneuverability is a very close second if a mock 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds to get from New York to Long Beach a hummingbird would take well days you see hummingbirds are not Hypersonic but they are maneuverable in fact the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards it can fly up down forwards backwards even upside down and so if we wanted to fly in this room or place places where humans can't go we'd need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so this is a hummingbird drone it can fly in all directions even backwards it can hover and rotate this prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera it weighs less than one ablea battery it does not eat nectar in 2008 it flew for a whopping 20 seconds a year later 2 minutes then six eventually 11 many prototypes crashed many but there's no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly it's beautiful isn't it wow it's great Matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot failure is part of creating new and amazing things we cannot both fear failure and make amazing new things like a robot with the stability of a dog on rough terrain or maybe even ice a robot that can run like a cheetah or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human or perhaps Spider-Man will one day be gecko man a gecko can support its entire

and farther and to do so we've had to believe in impossible things and we've had to refuse to fear failure that's still true today today we don't talk about flying trans sonically or even supersonically we talk about flying hypersonically not mock 2 or Mach 3 mach 20 at mach 20 we can fly from New York to Long Beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds at that speed the surface of the air foil is the temperature of molten steel 3,500 de F like a blast furnace we are essentially burning the air foil as we fly it and we are flying it or trying to DARPA Hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built it's boosted to near space at top a minitar 4 rocket now the minitar 4 has too much impulse so we have to Bleed It Off by flying the rocket at an 89° angle of attack for portions of the trajectory that's an unnatural act for a rocket the third stage has a camera we call it rocket Cam and it's pointed at the Hypersonic glider this is the actual rocket cam footage from flight one now to conceal the shape we changed the aspect ratio a little bit but this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider as it heads into the atmosphere back towards Earth we've flown twice in the first flight no aerodynamic control of the vehicle but we collected more Hypersonic flight data than in 30 years of groundbased testing combined and in the second flight 3 minutes of fully controlled aerodynamic flight at mach 20 we must fly again because amazing never been done before things require that you fly you can't learn to fly at Mack 20 unless you fly and while there's no substitute for Speed maneuverability is a very close second if a mock 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds to get from New York to Long Beach a hummingbird would take well days you see hummingbirds are not Hypersonic but they are maneuverable in fact the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards it can fly up down forwards backwards even upside down and so if we wanted to fly in this room or place places where humans can't go we'd need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so this is a hummingbird drone it can fly in all directions even backwards it can hover and rotate this prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera it weighs less than one ablea battery it does not eat nectar in 2008 it flew for a whopping 20 seconds a year later 2 minutes then six eventually 11 many prototypes crashed many but there's no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly it's beautiful isn't it wow it's great Matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot failure is part of creating new and amazing things we cannot both fear failure and make amazing new things like a robot with the stability of a dog on rough terrain or maybe even ice a robot that can run like a cheetah or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human or perhaps Spider-Man will one day be gecko man a gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe one square mimer of a gecko's foot pad has 14,000 hairlike structures called sete they are used to help it grip to surfaces using intermolecular forces today we can manufacture structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko's foot the result of four 4x4 in artificial nanog gecko adhesive can support a static load of 660 lb that's enough to stick 6 42 in plasma TVs to your wall no nails so much for velcro right and it's not just passive structures it's entire machines this is a spider mite it's 1 mm long but it looks like Godzilla next to these micro machines in the world of Godzilla spidermites we can make millions of mirrors each 1if the diameter of a human hair moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second to make large screen displays so that we can watch movies like Godzilla in high def and if we can build machines at that scale what what about Eiffel Tower like trusses at the micro scale today we are making metals that are lighter than styrofoam so light they can sit a top a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air so light that you can make a car that two people can lift but so strong that it has the crash worthiness of an SUV from the smallest wisp of air air to the powerful forces of Nature's storms there are 44 lightning strikes per second around the globe each lightning bolt heats the air to 44,000 de F hotter

that moment mattered to Tim and Katie and this green goo May someday matter to you this green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life it was made in tobacco plants tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever and if it seems far-fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy what about Gamers that could solve problems that experts can't solve last September the gamers of foldit solved the three-dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to AIDS in reesus monkeys now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments for 15 years it was unsolved in the scientific Community The Gamers of Fold It solved it in 15 days now they were able to do so by working together they were able to work together because they're connected by the internet and others also connected to the internet used it as an instrument of democracy and together they changed the fate of their Nation the internet is home to two billion people or 30% of the world's population it allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals it allows us to amplify our voices and our p power as a group but it too had humble beginnings in 1969 the internet was but a dream a few sketches on a piece of paper and then on October 29th the first packet switched message was sent from UCLA to Sri the first two letters of the word login that's all that made it through an l and an O and then a buffer overflow crashed the system two letters an l and an O now a worldwide Force so who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called DARPA they are nerds and they are heroes Among Us they challenge existing perspectives at the edges of Science and under the most demanding of conditions they remind us that we can change the world if we defy The Impossible and we refuse to fear failure they remind us that we all have nerd power sometimes we just forget you see there was a time when you weren't afraid of failure when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing you were good at math you could build things you were an astronaut an adventurer jacqu custo you could jump higher run faster kick harder than anyone you believed in impossible things and you were Fearless you were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero scientists and Engineers can indeed change the world so can you you were born to so go ahead ask yourself what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail now I want to say this is not easy it's hard to hold on to this feeling really hard I guess in some way I sort of believe it's supposed to be hard doubt and fear always creep in we think someone else someone smarter than us someone more capable someone with more resources will solve that problem but there isn't anyone else there's just you and if we're lucky in that moment someone steps into that doubt and fear takes a hand and says let me help you believe Jason Harley did that for me Jason started at DARPA on March 18th 2010 he was with with our transportation team I saw Jason nearly every day sometimes twice a day and more so than most he saw the highs and the lows the celebrations and the disappointments and on one particularly dark day for me Jason sat down and he wrote an email he was encouraging but firm and when he hit send he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make it mattered to me in that moment and still today when I doubt when I feel afraid when I need to reconnect with that feeling I remember his words they were so powerful supero supero supero [Music] super superhero superhero music superhero superhero music superhero [Music] superhero because that's what being a superhero is all [Applause] about there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you and remember be nice to nerds thank you thank you rea thank you I have a couple of questions the um so that glider of yours the mark 20 glider Mark glider the first one uh no control it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere it did what happened on that second flight yeah it also went in the Pacific but this time under control well yeah no we didn't fly it into the Pacific right um no there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed and so in the second flight we were able to get 3 minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it I I imagine you're not planning to open up to passenger service from New York to Long Beach it might be a little warm what do you picture what what do you picture that glider being used for well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this how it's ultimately used will be determined by the military now the purpose of the vehicle though the purpose of the technology is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes and to carry a payload of more than a few pounds yeah like what's the payload it could carry well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be right we got to fly it first but not necessarily just a camera yeah no not necessarily just a camera um it it's it's amazing um the the the the the hummingbird um I mean I'm curious you know you you started your beautiful sequence on flight with with a wing a plane kind of trying to flap its wings and failing horribly and there haven't been that many planes built since that flat Wings why why did we think that this was the time to go bio mimicry and and copy a hummingbird isn't that a very expensive solution for a small well maneuverable flying object so I mean in part we wondered if it was possible to do it and you have to revisit these questions over time the folks at aerovironment tried 300 or more different Wing designs 12 different forms of the avionics took them 10 full prototypes to get something that would actually fly but there's something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something you'd recognize so we often talk about Stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing but when things look just natural you also don't see them ah ah so it's not necessar Ste it's partly the the look actually sure look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters I mean because that's the that's I think as well as the a at looking at that I'm sure some people here are thinking you know technology catches up so quick how long is it before some crazed geek with a little remote control flies R through a window of the White House I mean do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here well look our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise that's what we do it would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we didn't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time it's just the nature of what we do now our responsibility is to push that edge and you know we have to be of course Mindful and responsible of how the technology is developed and ultimately used but we can't simply close our eyes and pretend that it isn't advancing it's advancing I mean you're you're clearly a really inspiring leader and um um you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention but at a personal level I mean in a way I can't imagine doing your job do you wake up in the night sometimes just asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of of your team Brilliance sure I mean I think it would you couldn't be human if you didn't ask those questions you know how do you answer them well I don't always have answers for them right I think that um we learn as time goes on I mean my job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you can have I work with some of the most amazing people and with that exhilaration comes a really deep sense of responsibility and so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what's possible right and this tremendous seriousness of what it means Regina that was jaw dropping as I say thank you so much for coming to thank [Applause] [Music] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] you should be nice to nerds in fact I'd go so far as to say if you don't already have a nerd in your life you should get one I'm I'm just saying scientists and Engineers change the world I'd like to tell you about a magical place called DARPA where scientists and Engineers defy The Impossible and refuse to fear failure now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize because when you remove the fear of failure impossible things suddenly become possible if you want to know how ask yourself this question what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail if you really ask yourself this question you can't help but feel uncomfortable I feel a little uncomfortable because when you ask it you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you how it keeps us from attemp tempting great things and life gets dull amazing things stop happening sure good things happen but amazing things stop happening now I should be clear I'm not encouraging failure I'm discouraging fear of failure because it's not failure itself that constrains us the path to truly new never been done before things always has failure along the way we're tested and in part that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great Clemens so said life gets interesting when we fail because it's a sign that we've surpassed ourselves in 1895 Lord Kelvin declared that heavier than air flying machines were impossible in October of 1903 the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly and 2 months later on December 17th Orville Wright powered the first airplane across a beach in North Carolina the flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 ft that was 1903 one year later the next Declarations of impossibilities began Ferdinand fos a French army General credited with having one of the most original and subtle Minds in the French army said airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value 40 years later AO experts coined the term transonic they debed should it have 1 s or two you see they were having trouble in this flight regime and it wasn't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound in 1947 there was no wind tunnel data Beyond Mach 0.85 and yet on Tuesday October 14th 1947 Chuck gagger climbed into the cockpit of his Bell X1 and he flew towards an unknown possibility and in so doing he became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound six of eight Atlas rockets blew up on the pad after 11 complete mission failures we got our first images from space and on that first flight we got more data than in all you two missions combined it took a lot of failures to get there since we took to the sky we have wanted to fly faster and farther and to do so we've had to believe in impossible things and we've had to refuse to fear failure that's still true today today we don't talk about flying trans sonically or even supersonically we talk about flying hypersonically not mock 2 or Mach 3 mach 20 at mach 20 we can fly from New York to Long Beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds at that speed the surface of the air foil is the temperature of molten steel 3,500 de F like a blast furnace we are essentially burning the air foil as we fly it and we are flying it or trying to DARPA Hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built it's boosted to near space at top a minitar 4 rocket now the minitar 4 has too much impulse so we have to Bleed It Off by flying the rocket at an 89° angle of attack for portions of the trajectory that's an unnatural act for a rocket the third stage has a camera we call it rocket Cam and it's pointed at the Hypersonic glider this is the actual rocket cam footage from flight one now to conceal the shape we changed the aspect ratio a little bit but this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider as it heads into the

would take well days you see hummingbirds are not Hypersonic but they are maneuverable in fact the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards it can fly up down forwards backwards even upside down and so if we wanted to fly in this room or place places where humans can't go we'd need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so this is a hummingbird drone it can fly in all directions even backwards it can hover and rotate this prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera it weighs less than one ablea battery it does not eat nectar in 2008 it flew for a whopping 20

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Mysteries of Vernacular Miniature, something distinctively smaller than other members of its type or class. Miniature traces its roots to the Latin, minium, which meant, "red lead". Minium referred, in particular, to a compound of lead used as a pigment in Medieval times. In those days, because there were no printing presses, groups of scribes were tasked with painstakingly copying all books by hand. Whenever they needed to denote a chapter break or a division of text, scribes would switch from standard black to the red pigment, minium. Another important visual device used to increase the prominence of certain portions of text was to set them off with large, ornate, and colorful capital letters, often surrounded by tiny, detailed paintings. The Italians began to refer to these elaborate and diminutive paintings as miniatura, illuminations. Because of the necessarily small size of the paintings, miniatura began to be associated with all things wee and spawned to other words with the same base, like the Latin minimum, for least. Miniatura was transmuted into English in the 16th century as the word, miniature, and since that time, it has had the exact same meaning we use today.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar One of the grandest scientific tools ever made by mankind is called an atom smasher. And I mean literally grand. The biggest one ever built, the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, is a ring with a circumference of about 18 miles. That's more than the entire length of Manhattan. So what is an atom smasher? It is a device that collides atomic nuclei together at extremely high energy. The most powerful one scientists have ever built can heat matter to the hottest temperatures ever achieved, temperatures last seen at a trillionth of second after the universe began. Our accelerators are full of engineering superlatives. The beam-containing region of the LHC is a vacuum, with lower pressure than what surrounds the international space station, and is 456 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, colder than the temperature of deepest space. A previous accelerator sitting in the LHC tunnel holds the world record for velocity, accelerating an electron to a speed so fast that if it were to race a photon of light, it would take about 14 minutes for the photon to get a lead of about 10 feet. If that doesn't impress you, remember the photon is fastest thing in the universe, it goes about 186,000 miles per second. So how do these subatomic particle accelerators work? Well, they use electric fields. Electric fields make charged particles move in the same way that gravity will pull a dropped baseball. The force from the electric field will pull a particle to make it move. The speed will continue to increase until the charged particle is moving incredibly fast. A simple particle accelerator can be made by hooking two parallel metal plates to a battery. The charge from the battery moves on to the two metal plates and makes an electric field that pulls the particle along. And that's it, you got a particle accelerator. The problem is that an accelerator built this way is very weak. Building a modern accelerator like the LHC this way would take over five trillion standard D-cell batteries. So scientists use much stronger batteries and put them one after another. An earlier accelerator used this method and was about a mile long and was equivalent to 30 billion batteries. However, to make an accelerator that is equivalent to five trillion batteries would require an accelerator 150 miles long. Scientists needed another way. While electric fields would make a particle go faster, magnetic fields make them move in a circular path. If you put an electric field along the circle, you don't need to use miles of electric fields, you can use a single electric field over and over again. The beams go around the circle, and each time they gain more energy. So very high-energy accelerators consist of a short region with accelerating electric fields, combined with long series of magnets that guide the particles in a circle. The strength of the magnets and the radius of the circular path determines the maximum energy of the beam. Once the beam is zooming along, then the real fun begins, the smashing. The reason physicists want to get those particles moving so fast is so that they can slam them into one another. These collisions can teach us about the fundamental rules that govern matter, but they'd be impossible without the feat of engineering that is the particle accelerator.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Nameste. I'm from India, and India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world. It has contributed to the world concepts such as yoga, ayurveda, spicy chicken tikka, and Vedic math. Vedic math is one of the world's easiest and simplest way to do math. We are going to combine together and do some number crunching today. So what we are going to first do is multiply by 11. We're going to do it together, so if you blink, you're going to miss it. So just watch it, OK. So we're going to do 32 times 11, OK. So we split 3, and we split 2, and we add 3 and 2 and paste it on top, and we get the answer as 352. That's it. Let's try another sum. 45 times 11. Let's hear it. Exactly, that's 495. And 75 times 11. So it gives you 7,125, 1 gets carried over and it becomes 825. That's how simple it is. OK, this is the principle behind it where a is the coefficient. Let's move on. OK, now what we're going to do is the base method. OK, this is used to multiply numbers very close to the powers of 10, like 10, 100, 1,000, and so on. So we have a sum here, say 99 times 97. OK, now tell me, is 99 more than 100 or less than 100? Less by how much? So we write minus 01. And 97 is less than 100 by how much? So we write minus 03. So what we're going to do is we're going to cross subtract and get the first part of the answer, like this. We're going to do cross subtraction. 97 minus 01 would give us 96. and we multiply 03 times 01 vertically, and we get an answer of 03. Let's check another sum. Try and do it yourselves. We got 98, which is, is it more than a 100, less than 100? By how much? And 97 is 3. So we got 98, we go crosswise, we got 98 minus 3, or we can do 97 minus 2, they'll all give you the same answer. So that would give us 95. And the second part would be 06. So that's our answer. OK, let's take a bigger number. Let's try this one. Here the base is 1,000. So we got -004, and 997 would be -003. We go crosswise like this, and we get 996 minus 003 would give us 993, and 004 times 003 would give us 012. And that's our answer. Thank you. 14 times 12. OK, here the base is 10. OK, so is 14 more than 10 or less than 10? More, so we got plus 4, and 12, we got plus 2. Again, we apply the same rule, so we do 12 plus 4, which gives us 16, like this. And we multiply 2 and 4, that gives us 8. So now, all of us here, we're going to do mental squaring, OK. Everybody is going to participate here, and we're going to do squares of numbers more than 100 mentally right now. So we got 101, OK, now visualize on the board, what's going to be on the right hand side. Plus 01, so we got that. OK, now we add plus sides, right? Yes? No? So we got 101 plus 01, that would give us 102, and, see here, like this. And 01 is getting squared, right? So that would give us 01, and that's your answer. Try the next one. Let's try 102 squared. Let's try, everybody. So 100, so 102 would be 10404. OK, now the next one, try it everybody together. I'll give you 5 seconds. OK, let's say it together, let's say it together, OK. [10609] 10609 and that's the answer. Woo! 104 squared, how much would that be? Calculate it, 5 seconds. Come on, girls in the back. OK, so the answer would be 10816. OK, let's do the next one: 105 squared. Oh, no, no, no, no, we're going to try over, we're going to try over, OK? OK. I'll give you 5 seconds, just think about it. OK, now we're going to go, OK? 11025. OK, let's going to do the next one, 106 squared. Try it, come one, everybody, it's simple and easy. [11236] OK, let's do it one more time. 11236. Now 107, think, hold on, don't say anything out loud, just think mentally, 107 squared. OK, now let's say it out loud. 11449. And 108 squared. [11664] Fantastic, give yourself a round of applause, come on! And this is the principle behind this, where a and b are the excesses or the deficiency from the base. I'm going to teach you in Vedic math, there are 16 sutras, or word formulas, OK. They are very visual and one of them is called, "vertically and crosswise," through which you can multiply any number by any number in a single line. So I'm going to do a two-digit by a two-digit multiplication. Let's do this. So we got 31 times 12. OK, so we're going to apply the vertically and crosswise sutra. So we're going to do like this: vertically, and then we're going to go crosswise, and then we're going to do vertical again. So, 2 times 1 gives us [2], 2 times 3 gives us [6], and 1 times 1 gives us [1]. 6 plus 1, [7]. 1 times 3 gives us [3]. And that's it, and that's our answer. No more tedious calculations, no more going through the rough work, it's simple in one line. I want to show you a sum again, this time with carry-overs. The same formula, all of us here can do this, OK. Same formula. So let's get started. 4 times 2 gives us [8]. OK, now we go crosswise like this, so we're going to multiply 4 times 1, [4], and 3 times 2, [6] 4 plus 6 gives us [10]. So we put down 0, carry the 1. And 3 times 1 gives us [3], plus 1, [4]. Exactly, that's our answer, 408. OK, thank you for being such a participative audience, and we had a great time number crunching. Now I want to end with a question: whether you'd like math to be dull or boring, or fun and interesting? The choice is yours.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar This is Zeno of Elea, an ancient Greek philosopher famous for inventing a number of paradoxes, arguments that seem logical, but whose conclusion is absurd or contradictory. For more than 2,000 years, Zeno's mind-bending riddles have inspired mathematicians and philosophers to better understand the nature of infinity. One of the best known of Zeno's problems is called the dichotomy paradox, which means, "the paradox of cutting in two" in ancient Greek. It goes something like this: After a long day of sitting around, thinking, Zeno decides to walk from his house to the park. The fresh air clears his mind and help him think better. In order to get to the park, he first has to get half way to the park. This portion of his journey takes some finite amount of time. Once he gets to the halfway point, he needs to walk half the remaining distance. Again, this takes a finite amount of time. Once he gets there, he still needs to walk half the distance that's left, which takes another finite amount of time. This happens again and again and again. You can see that we can keep going like this forever, dividing whatever distance is left into smaller and smaller pieces, each of which takes some finite time to traverse. So, how long does it take Zeno to get to the park? Well, to find out, you need to add the times of each of the pieces of the journey. The problem is, there are infinitely many of these finite-sized pieces. So, shouldn't the total time be infinity? This argument, by the way, is completely general. It says that traveling from any location to any other location should take an infinite amount of time. In other words, it says that all motion is impossible. This conclusion is clearly absurd, but where is the flaw in the logic? To resolve the paradox, it helps to turn the story into a math problem. Let's supposed that Zeno's house is one mile from the park and that Zeno walks at one mile per hour. Common sense tells us that the time for the journey should be one hour. But, let's look at things from Zeno's point of view and divide up the journey into pieces. The first half of the journey takes half an hour, the next part takes quarter of an hour, the third part takes an eighth of an hour, and so on. Summing up all these times, we get a series that looks like this. "Now", Zeno might say, "since there are infinitely many of terms on the right side of the equation, and each individual term is finite, the sum should equal infinity, right?" This is the problem with Zeno's argument. As mathematicians have since realized, it is possible to add up infinitely many finite-sized terms and still get a finite answer. "How?" you ask. Well, let's think of it this way. Let's start with a square that has area of one meter. Now let's chop the square in half, and then chop the remaining half in half, and so on. While we're doing this, let's keep track of the areas of the pieces. The first slice makes two parts, each with an area of one-half The next slice divides one of those halves in half, and so on. But, no matter how many times we slice up the boxes, the total area is still the sum of the areas of all the pieces. Now you can see why we choose this particular way of cutting up the square. We've obtained the same infinite series as we had for the time of Zeno's journey. As we construct more and more blue pieces, to use the math jargon, as we take the limit as n tends to infinity, the entire square becomes covered with blue. But the area of the square is just one unit, and so the infinite sum must equal one. Going back to Zeno's journey, we can now see how how the paradox is resolved. Not only does the infinite series sum to a finite answer, but that finite answer is the same one that common sense tells us is true. Zeno's journey takes one hour.

Once he gets to the halfway point, he needs to walk half the remaining distance. Again, this takes a finite amount of time. Once he gets there, he still needs to walk half the distance that's left, which takes another finite amount of time. This happens again and again and again. You can see that we can keep going like this forever, dividing whatever distance is left into smaller and smaller pieces, each of which takes some finite time to traverse. So, how long does it take Zeno to get to the park? Well, to find out, you need to add the times of each of the pieces of the journey. The problem is, there are infinitely many of these finite-sized pieces. So, shouldn't the total time be infinity? This argument, by the way, is completely general. It says that traveling from any location to any other location should take an infinite amount of time. In other words, it says that all motion is impossible. This conclusion is clearly absurd, but where is the flaw in the logic? To resolve the paradox, it helps to turn the story into a math problem. Let's supposed that Zeno's house is one mile from the park and that Zeno walks at one mile per hour. Common sense tells us that the time for the journey should be one hour. But, let's look at things from Zeno's point of view and divide up the journey into pieces. The first half of the journey takes half an hour, the next part takes quarter of an hour, the third part takes an eighth of an hour, and so on. Summing up all these times, we get a series that looks like this. "Now", Zeno might say, "since there are infinitely many of terms on the right side of the equation, and each individual term is finite, the sum should equal infinity, right?" This is the problem with Zeno's argument. As mathematicians have since realized, it is possible to add up infinitely many finite-sized terms and still get a finite answer. "How?" you ask. Well, let's think of it this way. Let's start with a square that has area of one meter. Now let's chop the square in half, and then chop the remaining half in half, and so on. While we're doing this, let's keep track of the areas of the pieces. The first slice makes two parts, each with an area of one-half The next slice divides one of those halves in half, and so on. But, no matter how many times we slice up the boxes, the total area is still the sum of the areas of all the pieces. Now you can see why we choose this particular way of cutting up the square. We've obtained the same infinite series as we had for the time of Zeno's journey. As we construct more and more blue pieces, to use the math jargon, as we take the limit as n tends to infinity, the entire square becomes covered with blue. But the area of the square is just one unit, and so the infinite sum must equal one. Going back to Zeno's journey, we can now see how how the paradox is resolved. Not only does the infinite series sum to a finite answer, but that finite answer is the same one that common sense tells us is true. Zeno's journey takes one hour.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar This is Zeno of Elea, an ancient Greek philosopher famous for inventing a number of paradoxes, arguments that seem logical, but whose conclusion is absurd or contradictory. For more than 2,000 years, Zeno's mind-bending riddles have inspired mathematicians and philosophers to better understand the nature of infinity. One of the best known of Zeno's problems is called the dichotomy paradox, which means, "the paradox of cutting in two" in ancient Greek. It goes something like this: After a long day of sitting around, thinking, Zeno decides to walk from his house to the park. The fresh air clears his mind and help him think better. In order to get to the park, he first has to get half way to the park. This portion of his journey takes some finite amount of time.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] this man is wearing what we call a bee beard a beard full of bees now this is what many of you might picture when you think about honeybees maybe insects or maybe anything that has more legs than two and let me start by telling you I gotcha I understand that but there are many things to know and I want you to open your minds here keep them open and change your perspective about honey bees notice that this man is not getting stung he probably has a queen bee tied to his chin and the other bees are attracted to it so this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees and that goes deep back for thousands of years we're very co-evolved because we depend on bees for pollination and even more recently as an economic commodity many of you may have heard that honey bees are disappearing not just dying but they're gone we don't even find dead bodies this is called colony collapse disorder and it's bizarre researchers around the globe still do not know what's causing it but what we do know is that with the declining numbers of bees the cost of over 130 Fruit and Vegetable crops that we rely on for food is going up in price so honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture here you can see some pictures of what are called Green roofs or Urban agriculture we're familiar with the image on the left that shows a local neighborhood Garden in the South End that's where I call home have a beehive in the backyard and perhaps a green roof in the future when we're further utilizing urban areas where there are stacks of uh Garden spaces check out this image above the Orange Line in Boston try to spot the Beehive it's there it's on the rooftop right on the corner there and it's been there for a couple of years now the way that Urban beekeeping currently operates is that the beehives are quite hidden and it's not because they need to be it's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea and that's why I want you today to try to think about this think about the benefit of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works so we know flowers we know fruits and vegetables even some alphalpha and hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat rely on pollinators but you've got male and female parts to a plant here and basically pollinators are attracted to plants for their nectar and in the process a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen or that male kind of sperm counterpart along the way and then travel to different flowers and eventually an apple in this case will be produced you can see the orientation the stem is down the blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it but that's a basic overview of how pollination works and let's think about Urban living not today and not in the past but what about in a hundred years what's it going to look like we have huge Grand challenges these days of habitat loss where we have more and more people billions of people in 100 years God knows how many people and how little space there will be to fit all of them so we need to change the way that we see cities and looking at this picture on the left of New York City today you can see how gray and brown it is we have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back into the atmosphere contributing to Global Climate Change no doubt what about in a 100 years if we have green rooftops everywhere and gardening and we create our own crops right in the cities we save on the costs of transportation we save uh on a healthier diet and we also educate and create new jobs locally we need bees for the future of our cities and urban living here's some data that we collected through our company with best bees where we deliver install and manage honeybee hives for anybody who wants them in the city in the countryside and we introduce honeybees and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop or fire escape for even that matter and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is there's a counterintuitive Trend that we noticed in these numbers so let's look at the first metric here overwintering survival now this has been a huge problem for many years basically since the late 1980s when the veroa might came and brought many different viruses bacteria and fungal diseases with it overwintering success is hard and that's when most of the colonies are lost and we found that in the cities bees are surviving better than they are in the country a bit counterintuitive right we think oh bees Countryside agriculture but that's not what the bees are showing the bees like it in the city furthermore they also produce more honey the the urban honey is delicious the bees in Boston on this the rooftop of the seport hotel where we have hundreds of thousands of bees flying overhead right now that I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by are going to all of the local Community Gardens and making delicious healthy honey that just tastes like the flowers in our city so the yield for urban hives in terms of Honey production is higher as well as the overwintering survival compared to rural areas again a bit counterintuitive and looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee Health we can go back to the year 950 and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland so the problems with bees today isn't necessarily something new it has been happening oh since over a thousand years ago but what we don't really notice are these problems in cities so one thing I want to encourage you to think about is the idea of what an urban island is you think in the city maybe the temperature is warmer why are bees doing better in the city this is a big question now to help us understand why they should be in the city perhaps there's more pollen in the city with the trains coming into urban hubs they can carry pollen with them very light pollen and it's just a big supermarket in the city a lot of Linden trees live along the railroad tracks perhaps there fewer pesticides in the cities than there are in urban areas perhaps there other things that we're just not thinking about yet but that's one idea to think about Urban islands and colony collapse disorder is not the only thing affecting honeybees honeybees are dying and it's a huge huge Grand Challenge of our time what you can see up here is a map of the world and we're tracking the spread of this veroa Mite now the veroa is what changed the game in beekeeping and you can see at the top right the years are changing we're coming up to modern times and you can see the spread of the verite from the early 1900s through now it's 1968 and we're pretty much covering Asia 1971 we saw it spread to Europe and South America and then when we get to the 1980s and specifically in 1987 the veroa might finally came to North America into the United States and that is when the game changed for honeybees in the United States many of us will remember our childhood growing up maybe you got stung by a bee you saw bees and flowers think of the kids today their childhood's a bit different they don't experience this the bees just aren't around anymore so we need bees and they're disappearing and it's a big problem what can we do here so what I do is honeybee research I got my PhD studying honeybee health I started in 200 5 studying honeybees in 2006 honeybees started disappearing so suddenly like this little nerd kid going to school working with bugs became very relevant in the world and it worked out that way so my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier I don't research what's killing the bees per se I'm not one of the many researchers around the world who's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees we're looking at ways to make bees healthier through vaccine through yogurt like probiotics and other types of Therapies in ways that can be fed Orly to bees and this process is so easy even a seven-year-old can do it you just mix up some pollen sugar and water and whatever active ingredient you want to put in and you just give it right to the Bees No chemicals involved just immune boosters humans think about our own health in a prospective way we exercise we eat healthy we take vitamins why don't we think about honeybees in that same type of way bring them to areas where they're thriving and try to make them healthier before they get sick I spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines with needles like years years at the bench oh my gosh it's 3:00 a.m. and I'm still pricking bees and then one day I said why don't we just do an oral vaccine it's like GH so that's that's what we do I'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives because they can be anything I mean really open your mind with this you can paint a hive to match your home you can hide a hive inside your home these are three hives on the rooftop of the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel and they're beautiful here I mean we matched the new color of the inside of their rooms to do some type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets and these bees are terrific and they also will use herbs that are growing in the garden that's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking and the honey they do live events they'll use that honey at their bars honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there we also have a classroom hives project where uh this is a nonprofit Venture we're spreading the word around the world for how honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom or into the museum setting behind glass and used as an educational tool this Hive that you see here has been in Fenway High School for many years now the bees fly right into the Outfield of Fenway Park nobody notices it if you're not a flower these bees do not care about you they don't they don't thus they excuse me flying around some other images here and telling a part of the story that really made Urban beekeeping terrific is in New York City beekeeping was illegal until 2010 that's a big problem because what's going to pollinate all of the gardens and the produce locally hands I mean locally in Boston there is a terrific company called Green City Growers and they are going and pollinating their squash by hand with Q-tips and if they miss that 3-day window there's no fruit their clients aren't happy and people go hungry so this is important we have also some images of honey from Brooklyn now this was a mystery in the New York Times where the honey was very red and the New York State forensics Department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a Marino Cherry Factory down the street so you can tailor your honey to taste however you want by planting be friendly flowers Paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping they've had hives on the rooftop of their opera house for many years now and that's what really got people started thinking wow we can do this and we should do this also in London and in Europe across the board they're very advanced in their use of green rooftops and integrating beehives and I'll show you an ending note here I would like to encourage you to open your mind what can you do to save the bees or to help them or to think of sustainable cities in the future we really just change your perspective try to understand that bees are very important that bee isn't going to sting you if you see it the bee dies honey bees die when they sting so they don't want to do it either it's nothing to panic about they're all over the city you could even get your own Hive if you want there are great resources available and there even companies that will help get you set up and Mentor you and it's important for our educational system in the world for students to learn about agriculture worldwide such as this little girl who again is not even getting stung thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] this man is wearing what we call a bee beard a beard full of bees now this is what many of you might picture when you think about honeybees maybe insects or maybe anything that has more legs than two and let me start by telling you I gotcha I understand that but there are many things to know and I want you to open your minds here keep them open and change your perspective about honey bees notice that this man is not getting stung he probably has a queen bee tied to his chin and the other bees are attracted to it so this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees and that goes deep back for thousands of years we're very co-evolved because we depend on bees for pollination and even more recently as an economic commodity many of you may have heard that honey bees are disappearing not just dying but they're gone we don't even find dead bodies this is called colony collapse disorder and it's bizarre researchers around the globe still do not know what's causing it but what we do know is that with the declining numbers of bees the cost of over 130 Fruit and Vegetable crops that we rely on for food is going up in price so honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture here you can see some pictures of what are called Green roofs or Urban agriculture we're familiar with the image on the left that shows a local neighborhood Garden in the South End that's where I call home have a beehive in the backyard and perhaps a green roof in the future when we're further utilizing urban areas where there are stacks of uh Garden spaces check out this image above the Orange Line in Boston try to spot the Beehive it's there it's on the rooftop right on the corner there and it's been there for a couple of years now the way that Urban beekeeping currently operates is that the beehives are quite hidden and it's not because they need to be it's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea and that's why I want you today to try to think about this think about the benefit of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works so we know flowers we know fruits and vegetables even some alphalpha and hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat rely on pollinators but you've got male and female parts to a plant here and basically pollinators are attracted to plants for their nectar and in the process a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen or that male kind of sperm counterpart along the way and then travel to different flowers and eventually an apple in this case will be produced you can see the orientation the stem is down the blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it but that's a basic overview of how pollination works and let's think about Urban living not today and not in the past but what about in a hundred years what's it going to look like we have huge Grand challenges these days of habitat loss where we have more and more people billions of people in 100 years God knows how many people and how little space there will be to fit all of them so we need to change the way that we see cities and looking at this picture on the left of New York City today you can see how gray and brown it is we have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back into the atmosphere contributing to Global Climate Change no doubt what about in a 100 years if we have green rooftops everywhere and gardening and we create our own crops right in the cities we save on the costs of transportation we save uh on a healthier diet and we also educate and create new jobs locally we need bees for the future of our cities and urban living here's some data that we collected through our company with best bees where we deliver install and manage honeybee hives for anybody who wants them in the city in the countryside and we introduce honeybees and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop or fire escape for even that matter and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is there's a counterintuitive Trend that we noticed in these numbers so let's look at the first metric here overwintering survival now this has been a huge problem for many years basically since the late 1980s when the veroa might came and brought many different viruses bacteria and fungal diseases with it overwintering success is hard and that's when most of the colonies are lost and we found that in the cities bees are surviving better than they are in the country a bit counterintuitive right we think oh bees Countryside agriculture but that's not what the bees are showing the bees like it in the city furthermore they also produce more honey the the urban honey is delicious the bees in Boston on this the rooftop of the seport hotel where we have hundreds of thousands of bees flying overhead right now that I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by are going to all of the local Community Gardens and making delicious healthy honey that just tastes like the flowers in our city so the yield for urban hives in terms of Honey production is higher as well as the overwintering survival compared to rural areas again a bit counterintuitive and looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee Health we can go back to the year 950 and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland so the

share with you some images of urban beehives because they can be anything I mean really open your mind with this you can paint a hive to match your home you can hide a hive inside your home these are three hives on the rooftop of the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel and they're beautiful here I mean we matched the new color of the inside of their rooms to do some type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets and these bees are terrific and they also will use herbs that are growing in the garden that's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking and the honey they do live events they'll use that honey at their bars honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there we also have a classroom hives project where uh this is a nonprofit Venture we're spreading the word around the world for how honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom or into the museum setting behind glass and used as an educational tool this Hive that you see here has been in Fenway High School for many years now the bees fly right into the Outfield of Fenway Park nobody notices it if you're not a flower these bees do not care about you they don't they don't thus they excuse me flying around some other images here and telling a part of the story that really made Urban beekeeping terrific is in New York City beekeeping was illegal until 2010 that's a big problem because what's going to pollinate all of the gardens and the produce locally hands I mean locally in Boston there is a terrific company called Green City Growers and they are going and pollinating their squash by hand with Q-tips and if they miss that 3-day window there's no fruit their clients aren't happy and people go hungry so this is important we have also some images of honey from Brooklyn now this was a mystery in the New York Times where the honey was very red and the New York State forensics Department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a Marino Cherry Factory down the street so you can tailor your honey to taste however you want by planting be friendly flowers Paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping they've had hives on the rooftop of their opera house for many years now and that's what really got people started thinking wow we can do this and we should do this also in London and in Europe across the board they're very advanced in their use of green rooftops and integrating beehives and I'll show you an ending note here I would like to encourage you to open your mind what can you do to save the bees or to help them or to think of sustainable cities in the future we really just change your perspective try to understand that bees are very important that bee isn't going to sting you if you see it the bee dies honey bees die when they sting so they don't want to do it either it's nothing to panic about they're all over the city you could even get your own Hive if you want there are great resources available and there even companies that will help get you set up and Mentor you and it's important for our educational system in the world for students to learn about agriculture worldwide such as this little girl who again is not even getting stung thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] this man is wearing what we call a bee beard a beard full of bees now this is what many of you might picture when you think about honeybees maybe insects or maybe anything that has more legs than two and let me start by telling you I gotcha I understand that but there are many things to know and I want you to open your minds here keep them open and change your perspective about honey bees notice that this man is not getting stung he probably has a queen bee tied to his chin and the other bees are attracted to it so this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees and that goes deep back for thousands of years we're very co-evolved because we depend on bees for pollination and even more recently as an economic commodity many of you may have heard that honey bees are disappearing not just dying but they're gone we don't even find dead bodies this is called colony collapse disorder and it's bizarre researchers around the globe still do not know what's causing it but what we do know is that with the declining numbers of bees the cost of over 130 Fruit and Vegetable crops that we rely on for food is going up in price so honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture here you can see some pictures of what are called Green roofs or Urban agriculture we're familiar with the image on the left that shows a local neighborhood Garden in the South End that's where I call home have a beehive in the backyard and perhaps a green roof in the future when we're further utilizing urban areas where there are stacks of uh Garden spaces check out this image above the Orange Line in Boston try to spot the Beehive it's there it's on the rooftop right on the corner there and it's been there for a couple of years now the way that Urban beekeeping currently operates is that the beehives are quite hidden and it's not because they need to be it's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea and that's why I want you today to try to think about this think about the benefit of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works so we know flowers we know fruits and vegetables even some alphalpha and hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat rely on pollinators but you've got male and female parts to a plant here and basically pollinators are attracted to plants for their nectar and in the process a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen or that male kind of sperm counterpart along the way and then travel to different flowers and eventually an apple in this case will be produced you can see the orientation the stem is down the blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it but that's a basic overview of how pollination works and let's think about Urban living not today and not in the past but what about in a hundred years what's it going to look like we have huge Grand challenges these days of habitat loss where we have more and more people billions of people in 100 years God knows how many people and how little space there will be to fit all of them so we need to change the way that we see cities and looking at this picture on the left of New York City today you can see how gray and brown it is we have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back into the atmosphere contributing to Global Climate Change no doubt what about in a 100 years if we have green rooftops everywhere and gardening and we create our own crops right in the cities we save on the costs of transportation we save uh on a healthier diet and we also educate and create new jobs locally we need bees for the future of our cities and urban living here's some data that we collected through our company with best bees where we deliver install and manage honeybee hives for anybody who wants them in the city in the countryside and we introduce honeybees and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop or fire escape for even that matter and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is there's a counterintuitive Trend that we noticed in these numbers so let's look at the first metric here overwintering survival now this has been a huge problem for many years basically since the late 1980s when the veroa might came and brought many different viruses bacteria and fungal diseases with it overwintering success is hard and that's when most of the colonies are lost and we found that in the cities bees are surviving better than they are in the country a bit counterintuitive right we think oh bees Countryside agriculture but that's not what the bees are showing the bees like it in the city furthermore they also produce more honey the the urban honey is delicious the bees in Boston on this the rooftop of the seport hotel where we have hundreds of thousands of bees flying overhead right now that I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by are going to all of the local Community Gardens and making delicious healthy honey that just tastes like the flowers in our city so the yield for urban hives in terms of Honey production is higher as well as the overwintering survival compared to rural areas again a bit counterintuitive and looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee Health we can go back to the year 950 and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland so the problems with bees today isn't necessarily something new it has been happening oh since over a thousand years ago but what we don't really notice are these problems in cities so one thing I want to encourage you to think about is the idea of what an urban island is you think in the city maybe the temperature is warmer why are bees doing better in the city this is a big question now to help us understand why they should be in the city perhaps there's more pollen in the city with the trains coming into urban hubs they can carry pollen with them very light pollen and it's just a big supermarket in the city a lot of Linden trees live along the railroad tracks perhaps there fewer pesticides in the cities than there are in urban areas perhaps there other things that we're just not thinking about yet but that's one idea to think about Urban islands and colony collapse disorder is not the only thing affecting honeybees honeybees are dying and it's a huge huge Grand Challenge of our time what you can see up here is a map of the world and we're tracking the spread of this veroa Mite now the veroa is what changed the game in beekeeping and you can see at the top right the years are changing we're coming up to modern times and you can see the spread of the verite from the early 1900s through now it's 1968 and we're pretty much covering Asia 1971 we saw it spread to Europe and South America and then when we get to the 1980s and specifically in 1987 the veroa might finally came to North America into the United States and that is when the game changed for honeybees in the United States many of us will remember our childhood growing up maybe you got stung by a bee you saw bees and flowers think of the kids today their childhood's a bit different they don't experience this the bees just aren't around anymore so we need bees and they're disappearing and it's a big problem what can we do here so what I do is honeybee research I got my PhD studying honeybee health I started in 200 5 studying honeybees in 2006 honeybees started disappearing so suddenly like this little nerd kid going to school working with bugs became very relevant in the world and it worked out that way so my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier I don't research what's killing the bees per se I'm not one of the many researchers around the world who's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees we're looking at ways to make bees healthier through vaccine through yogurt like probiotics and other types of Therapies in ways that can be fed Orly to bees and this process is so easy even a seven-year-old can do it you just mix up some pollen sugar and water and whatever active ingredient you want to put in and you just give it right to the Bees No chemicals involved just immune boosters humans think about our own health in a prospective way we exercise we eat healthy we take vitamins why don't we think about honeybees in that same type of way bring them to areas where they're thriving and try to make them healthier before they get sick I spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines with needles like years years at the bench oh my gosh it's 3:00 a.m. and I'm still pricking bees and then one day I said why don't we just do an oral vaccine it's like GH so that's that's what we do I'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives because they can be anything I mean really open your mind with this you can paint a hive to match your home you can hide a hive inside your home these are three hives on the rooftop of the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel and they're beautiful here I mean we matched the new color of the inside of their rooms to do some type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets and these bees are terrific and they also will use herbs that are growing in the garden that's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking and the honey they do live events they'll use that honey at their bars honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there we also have a classroom hives project where uh this is a nonprofit Venture we're spreading the word around the world for how honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom or into the museum setting behind glass and used as an educational tool this Hive that you see here has been in Fenway High School for many years now the bees fly right into the Outfield of Fenway Park nobody notices it if you're not a flower these bees do not care about you they

**Transcript**:
by birth and by choice I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life and for the past thirty years I've worked at Ford Motor Company and for most of those years I worried about how am I gonna sell more cars and trucks but today I worry about what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks what happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles triples or even quadruples my life is guided by two great passions and the first is automobiles I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest four-door Lincoln's and leave it in the driveway and it I decided about that time at about age 10 that it would be really cool if I was a test driver so my parents would go to dinner they'd sit down I'd sneak out of the house I jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway and it was a blast and that went on for about two years until I think it was about 12 my dad brought home a Lincoln Mark three and it was snowing that day so he and mom went to dinner and I snuck out and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts or maybe even some figure eights in the snow my dad finished in early that evening and he was walking through the front hall and out the front door just about the same time I hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car and almost ended up in the fraud hall so it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while but I really began to love cars then and my first car was a 1975 electric green Mustang and even though the color was pretty hideous I did love the car and it really cemented my love affair with cars that's continued on this day but cars are really more than a passion of mine they're quite literally in my blood my great-grandfather was Henry Ford and on my mother's side my great-grandfather was Harvey Firestone so when I was born I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me but my great-grandfather Henry Ford really leave that the mission of the Ford Motor Company was to make people's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress and that's a belief that I share my other great passion is the environment and as a young boy I used to go up to northern Michigan and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in and then later wrote about and it really struck me and as the years went by in a very negative way when I would go to some stream that I'd loved and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it and so even at a young age that really resonated with me and and the whole notion of environmental preservation at a very basic level sunk in with me as a high schooler I started to read authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold and Edward Abbey and I really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world but it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict with nature and that was true until I got to college and when I got to college you could imagine my surprise when I would go to class and a number of my professors would say that Ford Motor Company and my family was kind of everything that was wrong with with our country they thought that we were more interested as an industry in profits rather than progress and that we filled the skies with smog and frankly we were the enemy I joined Ford after college after some soul-searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do but I decided I wanted to go and see if I could affect change there and as I look back you know over 30 years ago it was a little naive to think at that age that I could but I wanted to and I really discovered that my professors weren't completely wrong in fact when I got back to Detroit my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced by those in my own company and certainly by those in the end of Drake I had some very interesting conversations as you can imagine there were some within Ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that I needed to stop hanging out with quote environmental wackos I was considered a radical and I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists of course I had no intention of doing that and I kept speaking out about the environment and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability and in time my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today I mean I think most people in the industry understand that we've got to get on with it and the good news is today we are tackling the big issues of cards in the environment not only at Ford but really as an industry we're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights and with new technology we're reducing and I believe someday will eliminate co2 emissions we're starting to sell electric cars which is great we're developing alternative power trains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word economically socially and environmentally and actually although we've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do I can see the day where my two great passions cars and the environment actually come into harmony but unfortunately as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem and as I said we're not there yet we've got a lot of work to do but I can see where we will but even as we're in the process of doing that another huge problem is looming and people aren't noticing and that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened just as the environment is the problem put in its simplest terms is one of mathematics today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world and within our lifetime that numbers going to grow to about 9 billion and at that population level our planet will be dealing with the of growth and with that growth comes some severe practical problems one of which is our transportation system simply won't be able to deal with it when we look at the population growth in terms of cars it becomes even clearer today there are about a hundred million cars on the road worldwide and but with more people and greater prosperity around the world that numbers going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid-century and this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives today the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams and that's a huge waste of time and resources but that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest today the average driver in Beijing has a five-hour commute and last summer many of you probably saw this there was a hundred-mile traffic jam that took 11 days to clear in China in the decades to come seventy-five percent of the world's population will live in cities and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more so you can see the size of the issue that we're facing when you factor in population growth it's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow frankly four billion clean cars on the road are still 4 billion cars and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam so if we make no changes today what is tomorrow look like well I think you probably already have the picture traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge and they're really very very inconvenient but that's kind of all they are but the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and healthcare particularly to people that live in city centers and our quality of life is going to be severely compromised so what's going to solve this well the answer isn't going be more of the same my great-grandfather once said before he invented the Model T if I had asked people then what they wanted they would have answered we want faster horses so the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads when America began moving west we didn't add more wagon trains we built railroads and to connect our country after World War two we didn't build more two-lane highways we built the interstate highway system today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future we are going to build smart cars but we also need to build smart roads smart parking smart public transportation systems and more we don't want to waste our time sitting in traffic sitting at toll booths or looking for parking spots we need an integrated system that uses real-time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers in fact that's the kind of system that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world the city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another and they go underneath the city streets and up above you've got a series of pedestrian walkways on New York City's 34th Street gridlock will soon be replaced with a connected system of vehicle-specific quarters pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created and all of this will will cut down the average rush-hour commute to get across town in New York from about an hour today at rush hour to about 20 minutes now if you look at Hong Kong they have a very interesting system called Octopus there it's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system so parking garages buses trains they all operate within the same system now shared car services are also springing up around the world and these efforts I think are great that we're leaving congestion and there's frankly starting to save some fuel these are all really good ideas that will move us forward but what really inspires me is what's gonna be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other very soon the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and GPS information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network every morning I drive about 30 miles from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn Michigan and every night I go home my commute is a total crapshoot and I often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home but very soon we're gonna see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other so if the car ahead of me and I 94 hits traffic it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way and these systems are being tested right now and frankly they're gonna be ready for primetime pretty soon but the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless so just imagine one day very soon you're gonna be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system so you get in your car and as you get in your car your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive no more driving around looking for one which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today's cars in urban areas is looking for parking spots or think about being in New York City and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smartphone so you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one or being in a future TED Conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time this is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system so I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem but as we found out with addressing co2 issues and also fossil fuels there is no one silver bullet the solution is not going to be more cars more roads or a new rail system it can only be found I believe in a global network of interconnected solutions now I know we can develop the technology that's going to make this work but we've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven't even thought of yet our overall transportation mix and infrastructure must support all the future options we need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue companies entrepreneurs venture capitalists they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity as well as an enormous social problem and just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge and it was really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power how much money and how much serious thought isn't over the last really three years is poured into the green energy field we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock we need people like all of you in this room leading thinkers I mean frankly I really need all of you to think about how you can help solve this this huge issue and we need people from all walks of life not just inventors we need policy makers and government officials to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge this is going to be solved by any one person or one group it's going to really require a national energy policy and frankly for each country because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels traffic jams and also how integrated the the system's already are but we need to get going and we need to get going today and we must have an infrastructure that's designed to support this flexible future you know we've come a long way since the Model T most people never traveled more than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime and since then the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live where we work where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around we don't want to regress and lose that freedom we're on our way to solving and as I said earlier I know we've got a long way to go the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it and that's the environmental issue but I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock because in doing so we're gonna preserve what we've really come to take for granted which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world and and it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this because if you can envision as I do a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today that's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow I believe we're at our best when were confronted with big issues this is a big one and it won't wait so let's get started now thank you

**Transcript**:
by birth and by choice I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life and for the past thirty years I've worked at Ford Motor Company and for most of those years I worried about how am I gonna sell more cars and trucks but today I worry about what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks what happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles triples or even quadruples my life is guided by two great passions and the first is automobiles I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest four-door Lincoln's and leave it in the driveway and it I decided about that time at about age 10 that it would be really cool if I was a test driver so my parents would go to dinner they'd sit down I'd sneak out of the house I jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway and it was a blast and that went on for about two years until I think it was about 12 my dad brought home a Lincoln Mark three and it was snowing that day so he and mom went to dinner and I snuck out and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts or maybe even some figure eights in the snow my dad finished in early that evening and he was walking through the front hall and out the front door just about the same time I hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car and almost ended up in the fraud hall so it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while but I really began to love cars then and my first car was a 1975 electric green Mustang and even though the color was pretty hideous I did love the car and it really cemented my love affair with cars that's continued on this day but cars are really more than a passion of mine they're quite literally in my blood my great-grandfather was Henry Ford and on my mother's side my great-grandfather was Harvey Firestone so when I was born I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me but my great-grandfather Henry Ford really leave that the mission of the Ford Motor Company was to make people's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress and that's a belief that I share my other great passion is the environment and as a young boy I used to go up to northern Michigan and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in and then later wrote about and it really struck me and as the years went by in a very negative way when I would go to some stream that I'd loved and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it and so even at a young age that really resonated with me and and the whole notion of environmental preservation at a very basic level sunk in with me as a high schooler I started to read authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold and Edward Abbey and I really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world but it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict with nature and that was true until I got to college and when I got to college you could imagine my surprise when I would go to class and a number of my professors would say that Ford Motor Company and my family was kind of everything that was wrong with with our country they thought that we were more interested as an industry in profits rather than progress and that we filled the skies with smog and frankly we were the enemy I joined Ford after college after some soul-searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do but I decided I wanted to go and see if I could affect change there and as I look back you know over 30 years ago it was a little naive to think at that age that I could but I wanted to and I really discovered that my professors weren't completely wrong in fact when I got back to Detroit my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced by those in my own company and certainly by those in the end of Drake I had some very interesting conversations as you can imagine there were some within Ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that I needed to stop hanging out with quote environmental wackos I was considered a radical and I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists of course I had no intention of doing that and I kept speaking out about the environment and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability and in time my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today I mean I think most people in the industry understand that we've got to get on with it and the good news is today we are tackling the big issues of cards in the environment not only at Ford but really as an industry we're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights and with new technology we're reducing and I believe someday will eliminate co2 emissions we're starting to sell electric cars which is great we're developing alternative power trains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word economically socially and environmentally and actually although we've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do I can see the day where my two great passions cars and the environment actually come into harmony but unfortunately as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem and as I said we're not there yet we've got a lot of work to do but I can see where we will but even as we're in the process of doing that another huge problem is looming and people aren't noticing and that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened just as the environment is the problem put in its simplest terms is one of mathematics today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world and within our lifetime that numbers going to grow to about 9 billion and at that population level our planet will be dealing with the of growth and with that growth comes some severe practical problems one of which is our transportation system simply won't be able to deal with it when we look at the population growth in terms of cars it becomes even clearer today there are about a hundred million cars on the road worldwide and but with more people and greater prosperity around the world that numbers going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid-century and this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives today the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams and that's a huge waste of time and resources but that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest today the average driver in Beijing has a five-hour commute and last summer many of you probably saw this there was a hundred-mile traffic jam that took 11 days to clear in China in the decades to come seventy-five percent of the world's population will live in cities and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more so you can see the size of the issue that we're facing when you factor in population growth it's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow frankly four billion clean cars on the road are still 4 billion cars and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam so if we make no changes today what is tomorrow look like well I think you probably already have the picture traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge and they're really very very inconvenient but that's kind of all they are but the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and healthcare particularly to people that live in city centers and our quality of life is going to be severely compromised so what's going to solve this well the answer isn't going be more of the same my great-grandfather once said before he invented the Model T if I had asked people then what they wanted they would have answered we want faster horses so the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads when America began moving west we didn't add more wagon trains we built railroads and to connect our country after World War two we didn't build more two-lane highways we built the interstate highway system today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future we are going to build smart cars but we also need to build smart roads smart parking smart public transportation systems and more we don't want to waste our time sitting in traffic sitting at toll booths or looking for parking spots we need an integrated system that uses real-time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers in fact that's the kind of system that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world the city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another and they go underneath the city streets and up above you've got a series of pedestrian walkways on New York City's 34th Street gridlock will soon be replaced with a connected system of vehicle-specific quarters pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created and all of this will will cut down the average rush-hour commute to get across town in New York from about an hour today at rush hour to about 20 minutes now if you look at Hong Kong they have a very interesting system called Octopus there it's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system so parking garages buses trains they all operate within the same system now shared car services are also springing up around the world and these efforts I think are great that we're leaving congestion and there's frankly starting to save some fuel these are all really good ideas that will move us forward but what really inspires me is what's gonna be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other very soon the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and GPS information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network every morning I drive about 30 miles from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn Michigan and every night I go home my commute is a total crapshoot and I often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home but very soon we're gonna see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other so if the car ahead of me and I 94 hits traffic it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way and these systems are being tested right now and frankly they're gonna be ready for primetime pretty soon but the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless so just imagine one day very soon you're gonna be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system so you get in your car and as you get in your car your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive no more driving around looking for one which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today's cars in urban areas is looking for parking spots or think about being in New York City and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smartphone so you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one or being in a future TED Conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time this is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system so I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem but as we found out with addressing co2 issues and also fossil fuels there is no one silver bullet the solution is not going to be more cars more roads or a new rail system it can only be found I believe in a global network of interconnected solutions now I know we can develop the technology that's going to make this work but we've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven't even thought of yet our overall transportation mix and infrastructure must support all the future options we need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue companies entrepreneurs venture capitalists they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity as well as an enormous social problem and just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge and it was really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power how much money and how much serious thought isn't over the last really three years is poured into the green energy field we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock we need people like all of you in this room leading thinkers I mean frankly I really need all of you to think about how you can help solve this this huge issue and we need people from all walks of life not just inventors we need policy makers and government officials to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge this is going to be solved by any one person or one group it's going to really require a national energy policy and frankly for each country because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels traffic jams and also how integrated the the system's already are but we need to get going and we need to get going today and we must have an infrastructure that's designed to support this flexible future you know we've come a long way since the Model T most people never traveled more than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime and since then the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live where we work where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around we don't want to regress and lose that freedom we're on our way to solving and as I said earlier I know we've got a long way to go the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it and that's the environmental issue but I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock because in doing so we're gonna preserve what we've really come to take for granted which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world and and it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this because if you can envision as I do a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today that's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow I believe we're at our best when were confronted with big issues this is a big one and it won't wait so let's get started now thank you

**Transcript**:
by birth and by choice I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life and for the past thirty years I've worked at Ford Motor Company and for most of those years I worried about how am I gonna sell more cars and trucks but today I worry about what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks what happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles triples or even quadruples my life is guided by two great passions and the first is automobiles I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest four-door Lincoln's and leave it in the driveway and it I decided about that time at about age 10 that it would be really cool if I was a test driver so my parents would go to dinner they'd sit down I'd sneak out of the house I jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway and it was a blast and that went on for about two years until I think it was about 12 my dad brought home a Lincoln Mark three and it was snowing that day so he and mom went to dinner and I snuck out and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts or maybe even some figure eights in the snow my dad finished in early that evening and he was walking through the front hall and out the front door just about the same time I hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car and almost ended up in the fraud hall so it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while but I really began to love cars then and my first car was a 1975 electric green Mustang and even though the color was pretty hideous I did love the car and it really cemented my love affair with cars that's continued on this day but cars are really more than a passion of mine they're quite literally in my blood my great-grandfather was Henry Ford and on my mother's side my great-grandfather was Harvey Firestone so when I was born I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me but my great-grandfather Henry Ford really leave that the mission of the Ford Motor Company was to make people's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress and that's a belief that I share my other great passion is the environment and as a young boy I used to go up to northern Michigan and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in and then later wrote about and it really struck me and as the years went by in a very negative way when I would go to some stream that I'd loved and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it and so even at a young age that really resonated with me and and the whole notion of environmental preservation at a very basic level sunk in with me as a high schooler I started to read authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold and Edward Abbey and I really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world but it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict with nature and that was true until I got to college and when I got to college you could imagine my surprise when I would go to class and a number of my professors would say that Ford Motor Company and my family was kind of everything that was wrong with with our country they thought that we were more interested as an industry in profits rather than progress and that we filled the skies with smog and frankly we were the enemy I joined Ford after college after some soul-searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do but I decided I wanted to go and see if I could affect change there and as I look back you know over 30 years ago it was a little naive to think at that age that I could but I wanted to and I really discovered that my professors weren't completely wrong in fact when I got back to Detroit my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced by those in my own company and certainly by those in the end of Drake I had some very interesting conversations as you can imagine there were some within Ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that I needed to stop hanging out with quote environmental wackos I was considered a radical and I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists of course I had no intention of doing that and I kept speaking out about the environment and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability and in time my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today I mean I think most people in the industry understand that we've got to get on with it and the good news is today we are tackling the big issues of cards in the environment not only at Ford but really as an industry we're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights and with new technology we're reducing and I believe someday will eliminate co2 emissions we're starting to sell electric cars which is great we're developing alternative power trains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word economically socially and environmentally and actually although we've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do I can see the day where my two great passions cars and the environment actually come into harmony but unfortunately as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem and as I said we're not there yet we've got a lot of work to do but I can see where we will but even as we're in the process of doing that another huge problem is looming and people aren't noticing and that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened just as the environment is the problem put in its simplest terms is one of mathematics today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world and within our lifetime that numbers going to grow to about 9 billion and at that population level our planet will be dealing with the of growth and with that growth comes some severe practical problems one of which is our transportation system simply won't be able to deal with it when we look at the population growth in terms of cars it becomes even clearer today there are about a hundred million cars on the road worldwide and but with more people and greater prosperity around the world that numbers going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid-century and this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives today the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams and that's a huge waste of time and resources but that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest today the average driver in Beijing has a five-hour commute and last summer many of you probably saw this there was a hundred-mile traffic jam that took 11 days to clear in China in the decades to come seventy-five percent of the world's population will live in cities and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more so you can see the size of the issue that we're facing when you factor in population growth it's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow frankly four billion clean cars on the road are still 4 billion cars and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam so if we make no changes today what is tomorrow look like well I think you probably already have the picture traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge and they're really very very inconvenient but that's kind of all they are but the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and healthcare particularly to people that live in city centers and our quality of life is going to be severely compromised so what's going to solve this well the answer isn't going be more of the same my great-grandfather once said before he invented the Model T if I had asked people then what they wanted they would have answered we want faster horses so the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads when America began moving west we didn't add more wagon trains we built railroads and to connect our country after World War two we didn't build more two-lane highways we built the interstate highway system today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future we are going to build smart cars but we also need to build smart roads smart parking smart public transportation systems and more we don't want to waste our time sitting in traffic sitting at toll booths or looking for parking spots we need an integrated system that uses real-time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers in fact that's the kind of system that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world the city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another and they go underneath the city streets and up above you've got a series of pedestrian walkways on New York City's 34th Street gridlock will soon be replaced with a connected system of vehicle-specific quarters pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created and all of this will will cut down the average rush-hour commute to get across town in New York from about an hour today at rush hour to about 20 minutes now if you look at Hong Kong they have a very interesting system called Octopus there it's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system so parking garages buses trains they all operate within the same system now shared car services are also springing up around the world and these efforts I think are great that we're leaving congestion and there's frankly starting to save some fuel these are all really good ideas that will move us forward but what really inspires me is what's gonna be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other very soon the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and GPS information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network every morning I drive about 30 miles from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn Michigan and every night I go home my commute is a total crapshoot and I often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home but very soon we're gonna see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other so if the car ahead of me and I 94 hits traffic it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way and these systems are being tested right now and frankly they're gonna be ready for primetime pretty soon but the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless so just imagine one day very soon you're gonna be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system so you get in your car and as you get in your car your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive no more driving around looking for one which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today's cars in urban areas is looking for parking spots or think about being in New York City and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smartphone so you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one or being in a future TED Conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time this is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system so I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem but as we found out with addressing co2 issues and also fossil fuels there is no one silver bullet the solution is not going to be more cars more roads or a new rail system it can only be found I believe in a global network of interconnected solutions now I know we can develop the technology that's going to make this work but we've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven't even thought of yet our overall transportation mix and infrastructure must support all the future options we need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue companies entrepreneurs venture capitalists they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity as well as an enormous social problem and just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge and it was really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power how much money and how much serious thought isn't over the last really three years is poured into the green energy field we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock we need people like all of you in this room leading thinkers I mean frankly I really need all of you to think about how you can help solve this this huge issue and we need people from all walks of life not just inventors we need policy makers and government officials to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge this is going to be solved by any one person or one group it's going to really require a national energy policy and frankly for each country because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels traffic jams and also how integrated the the system's already are but we need to get going and we need to get going today and we must have an infrastructure that's designed to support this flexible future you know we've come a long way since the Model T most people never traveled more than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime and since then the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live where we work where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around we don't want to regress and lose that freedom we're on our way to solving and as I said earlier I know we've got a long way to go the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it and that's the environmental issue but I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock because in doing so we're gonna preserve what we've really come to take for granted which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world and and it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this because if you can envision as I do a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today that's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow I believe we're at our best when were confronted with big issues this is a big one and it won't wait so let's get started now thank you
