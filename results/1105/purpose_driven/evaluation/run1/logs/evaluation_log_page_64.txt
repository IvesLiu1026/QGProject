**Transcript**:
hi my name is Cameron Russell and for the last a little while I've been a model actually for ten years and I feel like there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress so luckily I brought an outfit change this is the first outfit change on the Ted stage so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it I think if some of the women were really horrified when I came out you don't have to tell me now but I'll find out later on Twitter I'd also note that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief ten seconds not everybody gets to do that these heels are very uncomfortable so good thing I wasn't going to wear them the worst part is putting a sweater over my head because that's when you'll laugh at me so don't do anything while it's over my head alright so why did I do that that was awkward well hopefully not as awkward as that picture image is powerful but also image is superficial I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds and in this picture I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life I was totally uncomfortable in the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy's hair and of course barring surgery or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work there's very little that we can do to transform how we look and how we look though it is superficial and immutable has a huge impact on our lives so today for me fearless means being honest and I am on this stage because I'm a model I'm on this stage because I'm a pretty white woman and my industry we call that a sexy girl and I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me but with an honest twist so the first question is how do you become a model and I always just say oh I was scouted but that means nothing the real way that I became a model is I want a genetic lottery and I am the recipient of a legacy and maybe you're wondering what is a legacy well for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that were biologically programmed to admire but also as tall slender figures and femininity and white skin and this is a legacy that was built for me and it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point and maybe there are some fashionistas we're like wait Naomi Tyra Joan Smalls Liu Wen and first I commend you on your model knowledge very impressive but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 a very inspired NYU PhD student counted all the models on the runway every single one that was hired and of the 677 models that were hired only 27 or less than 4% were non-white the next question people ways ask me is can I be a model when I grow up and the first answer is I don't know they don't put me in charge of that but the second answer and what I really want to say to these little girls is why you know you can be anything you could be the president of United States or the inventor of the next Internet or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet which would be awesome because to be the first one if after this amazing list they still are like no no camera and I want to be a model well then I say be my boss because I'm not in charge of anything and you could be the editor-in-chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H&M or the next Steven Mizell saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up it's you know out of your control and it's awesome and it's not a career path I will demonstrate for you now ten years of accumulated model knowledge because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons it can just be distilled right into right now so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there like a nice HMI and the client says Cameron we want a walking shot well then this leg goes first nice and long this arm goes back this arm goes for the head is at three quarters and you just go back and forth just do that and then you look back at your imaginary friends three hundred four hundred five hundred times it will look something like this and hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle that was I don't know what happened there unfortunately after you've gone to school and you have a resume you've done a few jobs you can't say anything anymore so if you say you want to be the president of the United States but your resume reads underwear model ten years people give you a funny look the next question people always ask me is do they retouch all the photos and yeah they pretty much retouch all the photos but that is only a small component of what's happening this picture is a very first picture that I ever took and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini and I didn't even have my period yet I know we're getting personal but uh you know I was a young girl this is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier here's me on the same day as this shoot my friend got to come with me here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue here's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine and here's me today and I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me they are constructions and they are constructions by professionals by hair stylist and makeup artists and photographers and stylist and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production and they build this that's not me okay so the next question people always ask me is do you get free stuff I do have too many Aiden shields which I never get to wear except for earlier but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life and that's what we don't like to talk about I grew up in Cambridge and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free when I was a teenager I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a read and of course we got pulled over and all it took was a sorry officer and we were on our way and I got these free things because of how I look not Who I am and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are I live in New York and last year of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked 86% of them were black and Latino and most of them were young men and there are only 177 thousand young black and Latino men in New York so for them it's not a question of will I get stopped but how many times do I get stopped when will I get stopped when I was researching this talk I found out that of the thirteen-year-old girls the United States fifty-three percent don't like their bodies and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they're 17 so the last question people ask me is you know what does it like to be a model and I think the answer that they're looking for is if you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair you will be so happy and fabulous and one we're backstage we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that we say it's really amazing to travel and it's amazing to get to work with creative inspired passionate people and those things are true but they're only one half of the story because the thing that we never say on camera that I have never said on camera is I am insecure and I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day and if you ever are wondering you know if I have thinner thighs and shinier hair will I be happier you just need to meet a group of models because they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes and are the most physically insecure women probably on the planet so when I was writing this talk I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance because on the one hand I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say look I've sieved all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with and it doesn't always make me happy but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I'm one of the biggest beneficiaries but I'm also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it's great I got to come you know before ten or twenty or thirty years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college which seems so important right now if there's a takeaway to this talk I hope is that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures thank you

awful driver and she ran a read and of course we got pulled over and all it took was a sorry officer and we were on our way and I got these free things because of how I look not Who I am and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are I live in New York and last year of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked 86% of them were black and Latino and most of them were young men and there are only 177 thousand young black and Latino men in New York so for them it's not a question of will I get stopped but how many times do I get stopped when will I get stopped when I was researching this talk I found out that of the thirteen-year-old girls the United States fifty-three percent don't like their bodies and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they're 17 so the last question people ask me is you know what does it like to be a model and I think the answer that they're looking for is if you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair you will be so happy and fabulous and one we're backstage we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that we say it's really amazing to travel and it's amazing to get to work with creative inspired passionate people and those things are true but they're only one half of the story because the thing that we never say on camera that I have never said on camera is I am insecure and I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day and if you ever are wondering you know if I have thinner thighs and shinier hair will I be happier you just need to meet a group of models because they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes and are the most physically insecure women probably on the planet so when I was writing this talk I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance because on the one hand I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say look I've sieved all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with and it doesn't always make me happy but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I'm one of the biggest beneficiaries but I'm also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it's great I got to come you know before ten or twenty or thirty years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college which seems so important right now if there's a takeaway to this talk I hope is that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures thank you

**Transcript**:
hi my name is Cameron Russell and for the last a little while I've been a model actually for ten years and I feel like there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress so luckily I brought an outfit change this is the first outfit change on the Ted stage so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it I think if some of the women were really horrified when I came out you don't have to tell me now but I'll find out later on Twitter I'd also note that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief ten seconds not everybody gets to do that these heels are very uncomfortable so good thing I wasn't going to wear them the worst part is putting a sweater over my head because that's when you'll laugh at me so don't do anything while it's over my head alright so why did I do that that was awkward well hopefully not as awkward as that picture image is powerful but also image is superficial I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds and in this picture I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life I was totally uncomfortable in the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy's hair and of course barring surgery or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work there's very little that we can do to transform how we look and how we look though it is superficial and immutable has a huge impact on our lives so today for me fearless means being honest and I am on this stage because I'm a model I'm on this stage because I'm a pretty white woman and my industry we call that a sexy girl and I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me but with an honest twist so the first question is how do you become a model and I always just say oh I was scouted but that means nothing the real way that I became a model is I want a genetic lottery and I am the recipient of a legacy and maybe you're wondering what is a legacy well for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that were biologically programmed to admire but also as tall slender figures and femininity and white skin and this is a legacy that was built for me and it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point and maybe there are some fashionistas we're like wait Naomi Tyra Joan Smalls Liu Wen and first I commend you on your model knowledge very impressive but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 a very inspired NYU PhD student counted all the models on the runway every single one that was hired and of the 677 models that were hired only 27 or less than 4% were non-white the next question people ways ask me is can I be a model when I grow up and the first answer is I don't know they don't put me in charge of that but the second answer and what I really want to say to these little girls is why you know you can be anything you could be the president of United States or the inventor of the next Internet or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet which would be awesome because to be the first one if after this amazing list they still are like no no camera and I want to be a model well then I say be my boss because I'm not in charge of anything and you could be the editor-in-chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H&M or the next Steven Mizell saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up it's you know out of your control and it's awesome and it's not a career path I will demonstrate for you now ten years of accumulated model knowledge because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons it can just be distilled right into right now so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there like a nice HMI and the client says Cameron we want a walking shot well then this leg goes first nice and long this arm goes back this arm goes for the head is at three quarters and you just go back and forth just do that and then you look back at your imaginary friends three hundred four hundred five hundred times it will look something like this and hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle that was I don't know what happened there unfortunately after you've gone to school and you have a resume you've done a few jobs you can't say anything anymore so if you say you want to be the president of the United States but your resume reads underwear model ten years people give you a funny look the next question people always ask me is do they retouch all the photos and yeah they pretty much retouch all the photos but that is only a small component of what's happening this picture is a very first picture that I ever took and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini and I didn't even have my period yet I know we're getting personal but uh you know I was a young girl this is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier here's me on the same day as this shoot my friend got to come with me here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue here's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine and here's me today and I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me they are constructions and they are constructions by professionals by hair stylist and makeup artists and photographers and stylist and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production and they build this that's not me okay so the next question people always ask me is do you get free stuff I do have too many Aiden shields which I never get to wear except for earlier but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life and that's what we don't like to talk about I grew up in Cambridge and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free when I was a teenager I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a read and of course we got pulled over and all it took was a sorry officer and we were on our way and I got these free things because of how I look not Who I am and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are I live in New York and last year of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked 86% of them were black and Latino and most of them were young men and there are only 177 thousand young black and Latino men in New York so for them it's not a question of will I get stopped but how many times do I get stopped when will I get stopped when I was researching this talk I found out that of the thirteen-year-old girls the United States fifty-three percent don't like their bodies and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they're 17 so the last question people ask me is you know what does it like to be a model and I think the answer that they're looking for is if you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair you will be so happy and fabulous and one we're backstage we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that we say it's really amazing to travel and it's amazing to get to work with creative inspired passionate people and those things are true but they're only one half of the story because the thing that we never say on camera that I have never said on camera is I am insecure and I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day and if you ever are wondering you know if I have thinner thighs and shinier hair will I be happier you just need to meet a group of models because they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes and are the most physically insecure women probably on the planet so when I was writing this talk I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance because on the one hand I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say look I've sieved all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with and it doesn't always make me happy but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I'm one of the biggest beneficiaries but I'm also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it's great I got to come you know before ten or twenty or thirty years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college which seems so important right now if there's a takeaway to this talk I hope is that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are how globalized we aren't and why it's important to actually be accurate in making those kinds of assessments and the leading point of view on this whether measured by number of books sold mentions in media or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization is this view that national borders really don't matter very much anymore cross-border integration is close to complete and we live in one world and what's interesting about this view is again it's a view that's held by pro globalizers like Tom Friedman from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted but it's also helped by anti globalizes who see this giant globalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives if it hasn't already done so the other thing I would add is that this is not a new view I'm a little bit of an amateur historian so I spent some time going back trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing and the best earliest quote that I could find was one from David Livingstone writing in the 1850s about how the railroad the steamship and the Telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly with the rest of the world now clearly David Livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time but it does seem useful to ask ourselves just how global are we before we think about where we go from here so the best way I found of trying to get people to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat may not even be close to flat is with some data so one of the things I've been doing over the last few years is really compiling data on things that could either happen within national borders or across national borders and I've looked at the cross-border component as a percentage of the total I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today but let me just give you a few data points I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow one kind of flow of people one kind of flow of capital and of course trade in products and services so let's start off with plain old telephone service of all the voice calling minutes in the world last year what percentage do you think were accounted for by cross-border phone calls pick a percentage in your own mind answer turns out to be 2 percent if you include Internet telephony you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent but it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate or let's turn to people moving across borders one particular thing we might look at in terms of long term flows of people is what percentage of the world's population is accounted for by first-generation immigrants again please pick a percentage turns out to be a little bit higher it's actually about 3% or think of investment take all the real investment that went on in the world in 2010 what percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment not quite 10 percent and then finally the one statistic that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen the export to GDP ratio if you look at the official statistics they typically indicate a little bit above 30 percent however there's a big pro with the official statistics in that if for instance a Japanese component supplier ships something to China to be put into an iPod and then the iPod gets shipped to the US that component ends up getting counted multiple times so nobody knows how bad this bias with the official statistics actually is so I thought I would ask the person who's spearheading the effort to generate data on this bus calamy the director of the World Trade Organization what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of GDP without the double and triple counting and it's actually probably a bit under 20 percent rather than the 30 percent plus numbers that we're talking about so it's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that I talked about in my book world 3.0 that we're very very far from the no border effect benchmark which would imply internationalization levels of the order of 85 90 95 percent so clearly apocalyptically minded authors have overstated the case but it's not just the apocalyptic s-- as i think of them who are prone to this kind of overstatement I've also spent some time serving audiences in different parts of the world on what they actually guessed these numbers to be let me share with you the results of a survey that Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run of its readership as to what people's guesses along these dimensions actually were so a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide first of all there is a suggestion of some error second these are pretty large errors for four quantities whose average value is less than 10% you have people guessing three four times that level even though I'm an economist I find that a pretty large error and third this is not just confined to the readers of the Harvard Business Review I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world and in all cases except one where a group actually underestimated the trade to GDP ratio people have this tendency towards over estimation and so I thought it important to give a name to this and that's what I refer to as global oniy the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars especially because I suspect some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims I think it's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to global oniy couple of different reasons come to mind first of all there's a real dearth of data in the debate let me give you an example when I first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called foreign policy one of the people who wrote in not entirely an agreement was Tom Friedman and since my article was titled why the world isn't flat that wasn't too surprising what was very surprising to me was Tom's critique which was game 'ow it's data are narrow and this caused me to scratch my head because as I went back through his several hundred page book I couldn't find a single figure chart table reference or footnote so my point is I haven't presented a lot of data here to convince you that I'm right but I would urge you to go away and look for your own data to try and actually assess whether some of this these hand-me-down insights that we've been bombarded with actually are correct so dearth of data in the debate is one reason a second reason has to do with peer pressure I remember I decided to write my why the world isn't flat article because I was being interviewed on TV and Mumbai and the interviewers first question to me was Professor Ghemawat why do you still believe that the world is round and I started laughing because I hadn't come across that formulation before and as I was laughing I was thinking I really need a more coherent response especially a national TV I'd better write something about this but what I can't quite capture for you was the pity and disbelief with which the interviewer asked her question the perspective was here is this poor professor he's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years he really has no idea as to what's actually going on in the world so try this out with your friends and acquaintances if you like you'll find that it's very cool to talk about the world being one etc if you raise questions about that formulation you really are considered a bit of an antique and then the final reason which I mentioned especially to a TED audience with some trepidation has to do with what I call techno trances if you listen to techno music for long periods of time it does things to your brainwave activity something similar seems to happen with exaggerated conceptions of how technology is going to overpower in the very immediate run all cultural barriers all political barriers all Geographic barriers because at this point I know you aren't allowed to ask me questions but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students hands go up and people ask yeah but what about Facebook and I got this question often enough that I thought I'd better do some research on Facebook because in some sense it's the ideal kind of technology to think about theoretically makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door what percentage of people's friends on Facebook are actually located in countries other than where people we're analyzing our based the answer is probably somewhere between 10 to 15% not negligible so we don't live in an entirely local or national world but very very far from the 95% level that you would expect and the reason is very simple we don't or I hope we don't form friendships at random on Facebook there the technology is overlaid on a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have and those relationships are what the technology doesn't quite displace those relationships are why we get far fewer than 95% of our friends being located in countries other than where we are so does all this matter or is global Oni just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization related issues I want to suggest that actually global Oni can be very harmful to your health first of all recognizing that the glass is only 10 to 20 percent full it's critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional gains from additional integration whereas if we thought we were all dirty there there would be no particular point to pushing harder it's a little bit like we wouldn't be having a conference on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about at this conference so being accurate about how limited globalization levels are is critical to even being able to notice that there might be room for something more something that would contribute further to global welfare which brings me to my second point avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization so I actually spend most of my world 3.0 book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what I have in mind think of France and the current debate about immigration when you ask people in France what percentage of the French population is immigrants the answer is about 24% that's their guess maybe realizing that the number is just 8% might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue or to take an even more striking example when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations did a survey of Americans asking them to guess what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid the guess was 30% which is slightly in excess of the actual level of u.s. governmental commitments to federal aid the reassuring thing about this particular survey was when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data some of them not all of them seem to become more willing to consider increases in foreign aid so the foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up here because if you think about it what I've been talking about today is this notion very uncontroversial amongst economists that most things are very home biased foreign aid is the most aid to poor people is about the most home biased thing you can find if you look at the OECD countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person and compare it with how much they spend per person per poor person in poor countries the ratio Branko Milanovic at the World Bank that the calculations turns out to be about thirty thousand to one now of course some of us if we truly are cosmopolitan would like to see that ratio being brought down to one is to one I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are if we simply brought that ratio down to fifteen thousand to one we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the Rio summit 20 years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on so in summary while radical openness is great given how closed we are even incremental openness could make things dramatically better thank you very much [Applause] [Music]

**Transcript**:
[Music] I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are how globalized we aren't and why it's important to actually be accurate in making those kinds of assessments and the leading point of view on this whether measured by number of books sold mentions in media or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization is this view that national borders really don't matter very much anymore cross-border integration is close to complete and we live in one world and what's interesting about this view is again it's a view that's held by pro globalizers like Tom Friedman from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted but it's also helped by anti globalizes who see this giant globalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives if it hasn't already done so the other thing I would add is that this is not a new view I'm a little bit of an amateur historian so I spent some time going back trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing and the best earliest quote that I could find was one from David Livingstone writing in the 1850s about how the railroad the steamship and the Telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly with the rest of the world now clearly David Livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time but it does seem useful to ask ourselves just how global are we before we think about where we go from here so the best way I found of trying to get people to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat may not even be close to flat is with some data so one of the things I've been doing over the last few years is really compiling data on things that could either happen within national borders or across national borders and I've looked at the cross-border component as a percentage of the total I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today but let me just give you a few data points I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow one kind of flow of people one kind of flow of capital and of course trade in products and services so let's start off with plain old telephone service of all the voice calling minutes in the world last year what percentage do you think were accounted for by cross-border phone calls pick a percentage in your own mind answer turns out to be 2 percent if you include Internet telephony you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent but it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate or let's turn to people moving across borders one particular thing we might look at in terms of long term flows of people is what percentage of the world's population is accounted for by first-generation immigrants again please pick a percentage turns out to be a little bit higher it's actually about 3% or think of investment take all the real investment that went on in the world in 2010 what percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment not quite 10 percent and then finally the one statistic that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen the export to GDP ratio if you look at the official statistics they typically indicate a little bit above 30 percent however there's a big pro with the official statistics in that if for instance a Japanese component supplier ships something to China to be put into an iPod and then the iPod gets shipped to the US that component ends up getting counted multiple times so nobody knows how bad this bias with the official statistics actually is so I thought I would ask the person who's spearheading the effort to generate data on this bus calamy the director of the World Trade Organization what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of GDP without the double and triple counting and it's actually probably a bit under 20 percent rather than the 30 percent plus numbers that we're talking about so it's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that I talked about in my book world 3.0 that we're very very far from the no border effect benchmark which would imply internationalization levels of the order of 85 90 95 percent so clearly apocalyptically minded authors have overstated the case but it's not just the apocalyptic s-- as i think of them who are prone to this kind of overstatement I've also spent some time serving audiences in different parts of the world on what they actually guessed these numbers to be let me share with you the results of a survey that Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run of its readership as to what people's guesses along these dimensions actually were so a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide first of all there is a suggestion of some error second these are pretty large errors for four quantities whose average value is less than 10% you have people guessing three four times that level even though I'm an economist I find that a pretty large error and third this is not just confined to the readers of the Harvard Business Review I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world and in all cases except one where a group actually underestimated the trade to GDP ratio people have this tendency towards over estimation and so I thought it important to give a name to this and that's what I refer to as global oniy the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars especially because I suspect some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims I think it's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to global oniy couple of different reasons come to mind first of all there's a real dearth of data in the debate let me give you an example when I first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called foreign policy one of the people who wrote in not entirely an agreement was Tom Friedman and since my article was titled why the world isn't flat that wasn't too surprising what was very surprising to me was Tom's critique which was game 'ow it's data are narrow and this caused me to scratch my head because as I went back through his several hundred page book I couldn't find a single figure chart table reference or footnote so my point is I haven't presented a lot of data here to convince you that I'm right but I would urge you to go away and look for your own data to try and actually assess whether some of this these hand-me-down insights that we've been bombarded with actually are correct so dearth of data in the debate is one reason a second reason has to do with peer pressure I remember I decided to write my why the world isn't flat article because I was being interviewed on TV and Mumbai and the interviewers first question to me was Professor Ghemawat why do you still believe that the world is round and I started laughing because I hadn't come across that formulation before and as I was laughing I was thinking I really need a more coherent response especially a national TV I'd better write something about this but what I can't quite capture for you was the pity and disbelief with which the interviewer asked her question the perspective was here is this poor professor he's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years he really has no idea as to what's actually going on in the world so try this out with your friends and acquaintances if you like you'll find that it's very cool to talk about the world being one etc if you raise questions about that formulation you really are considered a bit of an antique and then the final reason which I mentioned especially to a TED audience with some trepidation has to do with what I call techno trances if you listen to techno music for long periods of time it does things to your brainwave activity something similar seems to happen with exaggerated conceptions of how technology is going to overpower in the very immediate run all cultural barriers all political barriers all Geographic barriers because at this point I know you aren't allowed to ask me questions but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students hands go up and people ask yeah but what about Facebook and I got this question often enough that I thought I'd better do some research on Facebook because in some sense it's the ideal kind of technology to think about theoretically makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door what percentage of people's friends on Facebook are actually located in countries other than where people we're analyzing our based the answer is probably somewhere between 10 to 15% not negligible so we don't live in an entirely local or national world but very very far from the 95% level that you would expect and the reason is very simple we don't or I hope we don't form friendships at random on Facebook there the technology is overlaid on a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have and those relationships are what the technology doesn't quite displace those relationships are why we get far fewer than 95% of our friends being located in countries other than where we are so does all this matter or is global Oni just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization related issues I want to suggest that actually global Oni can be very harmful to your health first of all recognizing that the glass is only 10 to 20 percent full it's critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional gains from additional integration whereas if we thought we were all dirty there there would be no particular point to pushing harder it's a little bit like we wouldn't be having a conference on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about at this conference so being accurate about how limited globalization levels are is critical to even being able to notice that there might be room for something more something that would contribute further to global welfare which brings me to my second point avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization so I actually spend most of my world 3.0 book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what I have in mind think of France and the current debate about immigration when you ask people in France what percentage of the French population is immigrants the answer is about 24% that's their guess maybe realizing that the number is just 8% might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue or to take an even more striking example when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations did a survey of Americans asking them to guess what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid the guess was 30% which is slightly in excess of the actual level of u.s. governmental commitments to federal aid the reassuring thing about this particular survey was when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data some of them not all of them seem to become more willing to consider increases in foreign aid so the foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up here because if you think about it what I've been talking about today is this notion very uncontroversial amongst economists that most things are very home biased foreign aid is the most aid to poor people is about the most home biased thing you can find if you look at the OECD countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person and compare it with how much they spend per person per poor person in poor countries the ratio Branko Milanovic at the World Bank that the calculations turns out to be about thirty thousand to one now of course some of us if we truly are cosmopolitan would like to see that ratio being brought down to one is to one I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are if we simply brought that ratio down to fifteen thousand to one we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the Rio summit 20 years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on so in summary while radical openness is great given how closed we are even incremental openness could make things dramatically better thank you very much [Applause] [Music]

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 5: What percentage of people's friends on Facebook are located in countries other than where they are, according to the speaker's research?**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of intent and options. A closer match would be a question that asks why the percentage of friends on Facebook from other countries is lower than expected.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 5** is the closest, although it's not a perfect match.

If I were to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be:

**Question: Why are actually far fewer than 95% of our friends on Facebook located in countries other than where we are?**
Options: A. Globalization does not account for language barriers, B. It is hard to form even technological relationships halfway around the world, C. Facebook access is limited around the world so relationships are confined to a select number of countries, D. The relationships on Facebook are based on pre-existing relationships that are not displaced by technology

This question is not present in the generated MCQs, so I couldn't find an exact match.

it hasn't already done so the other thing I would add is that this is not a new view I'm a little bit of an amateur historian so I spent some time going back trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing and the best earliest quote that I could find was one from David Livingstone writing in the 1850s about how the railroad the steamship and the Telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly with the rest of the world now clearly David Livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time but it does seem useful to ask ourselves just how global are we before we think about where we go from here so the best way I found of trying to get people to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat may not even be close to flat is with some data so one of the things I've been doing over the last few years is really compiling data on things that could either happen within national borders or across national borders and I've looked at the cross-border component as a percentage of the total I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today but let me just give you a few data points I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow one kind of flow of people one kind of flow of capital and of course trade in products and services so let's start off with plain old telephone service of all the voice calling minutes in the world last year what percentage do you think were accounted for by cross-border phone calls pick a percentage in your own mind answer turns out to be 2 percent if you include Internet telephony you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent but it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate or let's turn to people moving across borders one particular thing we might look at in terms of long term flows of people is what percentage of the world's population is accounted for by first-generation immigrants again please pick a percentage turns out to be a little bit higher it's actually about 3% or think of investment take all the real investment that went on in the world in 2010 what percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment not quite 10 percent and then finally the one statistic that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen the export to GDP ratio if you look at the official statistics they typically indicate a little bit above 30 percent however there's a big pro with the official statistics in that if for instance a Japanese component supplier ships something to China to be put into an iPod and then the iPod gets shipped to the US that component ends up getting counted multiple times so nobody knows how bad this bias with the official statistics actually is so I thought I would ask the person who's spearheading the effort to generate data on this bus calamy the director of the World Trade Organization what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of GDP without the double and triple counting and it's actually probably a bit under 20 percent rather than the 30 percent plus numbers that we're talking about so it's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that I talked about in my book world 3.0 that we're very very far from the no border effect benchmark which would imply internationalization levels of the order of 85 90 95 percent so clearly apocalyptically minded authors have overstated the case but it's not just the apocalyptic s-- as i think of them who are prone to this kind of overstatement I've also spent some time serving audiences in different parts of the world on what they actually guessed these numbers to be let me share with you the results of a survey that Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run of its readership as to what people's guesses along these dimensions actually were so a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide first of all there is a suggestion of some error second these are pretty large errors for four quantities whose average value is less than 10% you have people guessing three four times that level even though I'm an economist I find that a pretty large error and third this is not just confined to the readers of the Harvard Business Review I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world and in all cases except one where a group actually underestimated the trade to GDP ratio people have this tendency towards over estimation and so I thought it important to give a name to this and that's what I refer to as global oniy the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars especially because I suspect some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims I think it's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to global oniy couple of different reasons come to mind first of all there's a real dearth of data in the debate let me give you an example when I first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called foreign policy one of the people who wrote in not entirely an agreement was Tom Friedman and since my article was titled why the world isn't flat that wasn't too surprising what was very surprising to me was Tom's critique which was game 'ow it's data are narrow and this caused me to scratch my head because as I went back through his several hundred page book I couldn't find a single figure chart table reference or footnote so my point is I haven't presented a lot of data here to convince you that I'm right but I would urge you to go away and look for your own data to try and actually assess whether some of this these hand-me-down insights that we've been bombarded with actually are correct so dearth of data in the debate is one reason a second reason has to do with peer pressure I remember I decided to write my why the world isn't flat article because I was being interviewed on TV and Mumbai and the interviewers first question to me was Professor Ghemawat why do you still believe that the world is round and I started laughing because I hadn't come across that formulation before and as I was laughing I was thinking I really need a more coherent response especially a national TV I'd better write something about this but what I can't quite capture for you was the pity and disbelief with which the interviewer asked her question the perspective was here is this poor professor he's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years he really has no idea as to what's actually going on in the world so try this out with your friends and acquaintances if you like you'll find that it's very cool to talk about the world being one etc if you raise questions about that formulation you really are considered a bit of an antique and then the final reason which I mentioned especially to a TED audience with some trepidation has to do with what I call techno trances if you listen to techno music for long periods of time it does things to your brainwave activity something similar seems to happen with exaggerated conceptions of how technology is going to overpower in the very immediate run all cultural barriers all political barriers all Geographic barriers because at this point I know you aren't allowed to ask me questions but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students hands go up and people ask yeah but what about Facebook and I got this question often enough that I thought I'd better do some research on Facebook because in some sense it's the ideal kind of technology to think about theoretically makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door what percentage of people's friends on Facebook are actually located in countries other than where people we're analyzing our based the answer is probably somewhere between 10 to 15% not negligible so we don't live in an entirely local or national world but very very far from the 95% level that you would expect and the reason is very simple we don't or I hope we don't form friendships at random on Facebook there the technology is overlaid on a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have and those relationships are what the technology doesn't quite displace those relationships are why we get far fewer than 95% of our friends being located in countries other than where we are so does all this matter or is global Oni just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization related issues I want to suggest that actually global Oni can be very harmful to your health first of all recognizing that the glass is only 10 to 20 percent full it's critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional gains from additional integration whereas if we thought we were all dirty there there would be no particular point to pushing harder it's a little bit like we wouldn't be having a conference on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about at this conference so being accurate about how limited globalization levels are is critical to even being able to notice that there might be room for something more something that would contribute further to global welfare which brings me to my second point avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization so I actually spend most of my world 3.0 book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what I have in mind think of France and the current debate about immigration when you ask people in France what percentage of the French population is immigrants the answer is about 24% that's their guess maybe realizing that the number is just 8% might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue or to take an even more striking example when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations did a survey of Americans asking them to guess what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid the guess was 30% which is slightly in excess of the actual level of u.s. governmental commitments to federal aid the reassuring thing about this particular survey was when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data some of them not all of them seem to become more willing to consider increases in foreign aid so the foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up here because if you think about it what I've been talking about today is this notion very uncontroversial amongst economists that most things are very home biased foreign aid is the most aid to poor people is about the most home biased thing you can find if you look at the OECD countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person and compare it with how much they spend per person per poor person in poor countries the ratio Branko Milanovic at the World Bank that the calculations turns out to be about thirty thousand to one now of course some of us if we truly are cosmopolitan would like to see that ratio being brought down to one is to one I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are if we simply brought that ratio down to fifteen thousand to one we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the Rio summit 20 years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on so in summary while radical openness is great given how closed we are even incremental openness could make things dramatically better thank you very much [Applause] [Music]

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular Inaugurate: to begin or introduce a system, policy, or period or to admit someone formally into public office. The word inaugurate probably begins with the Latin word avis, meaning bird. In ancient Rome, avis was combined with the Latin verb garrire, to talk. The two words together made augur, literally one who talks to birds. Figuratively, however, augur was the name given to a specific religious official, a type of soothsayer or prophet, who foretold events by studying the behavior of birds. No major decision was made without the augur's consultation. He would analyze flight patterns and direction, bird calls, and general bird activities, and then use these signs to interpret the will of the gods. From augur comes the verb inaugurare, to see omens from the flight of birds, and, then later, to consecrate or act when such omens are favorable. Roman officials could only be installed in office when the avian omens were auspicious. Centuries later, the word was eventually transmuted into English as inaugurate. Along the way, it lost its veneer of superstition and was admitted formally into the jargon of politics.

Why is that? As it turns out, the amount of fat we eat doesn't impact our weight or our cholesterol or our risk of heart disease nearly as much as what kind of fat we eat. But let's back up: What is fat? If we were to zoom in on a salmon, which is a fatty fish, past the organs, past the tissues, into the cells, we would see that the stuff we call fat is actually made up of molecules called triglycerides, and they are not all alike. Here's one example. Those three carbons on the left, that's glycerol. Now, you can think of that as the backbone that holds the rest of the molecule together. The three long chains on the right are called fatty acids, and it's subtle differences in the structures of these chains that determine whether a fat is, let's say, solid or liquid; whether or not it goes rancid quickly; and, most importantly, how good or how bad it is for you. Let's take a look at some of these differences. One is length. Fatty acids can be short or long. Another, more important difference is the type of bond between the carbon atoms. Some fatty acids have only single bonds. Others have both single and double bonds. Fatty acids with only single bonds are called saturated, and those with one or more double bonds are called unsaturated. Now, most unsaturated fats are good for you, while saturated fats are bad for you in excess. For saturated fats, the story pretty much ends there but not for unsaturated fats. The double bonds in these molecules have a kind of weird property; they're rigid. So, that means there are two ways to arrange every double bond. The first is like this, where both hydrogens are on same side and both carbons are on the same side. The second way is like this. Now the hydrogens and carbons are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, even though both of these molecules are made up of exactly the same building blocks, they are two completely different substances, and they behave completely differently inside of us. The configuration on the left is called CIS, which you've probably never heard of. The one of the right is called TRANS, and you probably have heard of trans fats before. They don't go rancid, they're more stable during deep frying, and they can change the texture of foods in ways that other fats just can't. They're also terrible for your health, by far worse than saturated fat, even though technically they're a type of unsaturated fat. Now, I know that seems crazy, but your body doesn't care what a molecule looks like on paper. All that matters is the 3-D shape where the molecule fits, where it doesn't, and what pathways it interferes with. So, how do you know if a food has trans fat in it? Well, the only sure way to know is if you see the words, "partially hydrogenated" in the ingredients list. Don't let nutrition labels or advertising fool you. The FDA allows manufacturers to claim that their products contain "0" grams of trans fat even if they actually have up to half a gram per serving. But there are no hard and fast rules about how small a serving can be, and, that means, you'll have to rely on seeing those key words, partially hydrogenated, because that's how trans fats are made, by partially hydrogenating unsaturated fats. So, let's go back to our olive oil and pancake mix from before. Olive oil is 100% fat. Pancake mix is only 11% fat. But olive oil is mostly unsaturated fat, and it has no trans fat at all. On the other hand, more than half the fat in pancake mix is either saturated or trans fat. And, so, even though olive oil has 10 times as much fat as pancake mix, it's healthy for you, whereas pancake mix is not. Now, I'm not trying to pick on pancake mix. There are lots of foods with this type of fat profile. The point is this: It's not how much fat you eat, it's what kind of fat. And what makes a particular fat healthy or unhealthy is its shape.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4: What is the 3-D shape of the molecule called when the hydrogens and carbons are on the same side of the double bond? Options: A. TRANS, B. CIS, C. SATURATED, D. UNSATURATED**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that directly asks about the classification of trans fats.

A closer match can be inferred from **Question 2: What type of bond between carbon atoms is characteristic of saturated fats? Options: A. Single and double bonds, B. Only single bonds, C. Only double bonds, D. Both single and triple bonds** and the transcript content. 

According to the transcript, "Fatty acids with only single bonds are called saturated, and those with one or more double bonds are called unsaturated." and "The one of the right is called TRANS, and you probably have heard of trans fats before. They don't go rancid, they're more stable during deep frying, and they can change the texture of foods in ways that other fats just can't. They're also terrible for your health, by far worse than saturated fat, even though technically they're a type of unsaturated fat."

Considering this information, we can infer that a more suitable match would be a question that asks about the classification of trans fats, which would be **unsaturated fats**.

However, since this question is not explicitly present in the generated MCQs, I will choose the question that best matches this inferred question.

The best match is **Question 8: What type of fat is olive oil mostly composed of? Options: A. Saturated fat, B. Unsaturated fat, C. Trans fat, D. A combination of saturated and unsaturated fat**, as it contains the correct classification of trans fats in its options.

However, please note that this is not an exact match.

If I had to choose an index, I would choose **8**.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the composition of triglycerides, specifically the number of fatty acid chains. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about this, Question 2 does ask about the characteristics of saturated fats, which are composed of triglycerides.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 5, as it does mention the process of hydrogenation, which is related to the composition of triglycerides.

But since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I would say that there is no matching MCQ.

If you want me to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say:

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of relevance to the topic.

The ground truth MCQ asks to rank the three types of fat in order from most to least healthy. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 4 is related to the topic of types of fat and their characteristics.

However, a closer look reveals that Question 4 only asks about the 3-D shape of the molecule when the hydrogens and carbons are on the same side of the double bond. 

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that Question 8 asks about the type of fat that olive oil is mostly composed of. While this question does not directly ask about ranking the types of fat, it does relate to the topic of types of fat and their characteristics, which is also relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

But again, this is not a direct match.

Since there is no direct match, I will choose the question that is most relevant to the topic of types of fat. In this case, I would choose Question 8 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it's not a perfect match.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Olive oil is 100% fat; there's nothing else in it. Pancake mix, on the other hand, is only about 11% fat. And, yet, olive oil is good for you, and pancake mix is not. Why is that? As it turns out, the amount of fat we eat doesn't impact our weight or our cholesterol or our risk of heart disease nearly as much as what kind of fat we eat. But let's back up: What is fat? If we were to zoom in on a salmon, which is a fatty fish, past the organs, past the tissues, into the cells, we would see that the stuff we call fat is actually made up of molecules called triglycerides, and they are not all alike. Here's one example. Those three carbons on the left, that's glycerol. Now, you can think of that as the backbone that holds the rest of the molecule together. The three long chains on the right are called fatty acids, and it's subtle differences in the structures of these chains that determine whether a fat is, let's say, solid or liquid; whether or not it goes rancid quickly; and, most importantly, how good or how bad it is for you. Let's take a look at some of these differences. One is length. Fatty acids can be short or long. Another, more important difference is the type of bond between the carbon atoms. Some fatty acids have only single bonds. Others have both single and double bonds. Fatty acids with only single bonds are called saturated, and those with one or more double bonds are called unsaturated. Now, most unsaturated fats are good for you, while saturated fats are bad for you in excess. For saturated fats, the story pretty much ends there but not for unsaturated fats. The double bonds in these molecules have a kind of weird property; they're rigid. So, that means there are two ways to arrange every double bond. The first is like this, where both hydrogens are on same side and both carbons are on the same side. The second way is like this. Now the hydrogens and carbons are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, even though both of these molecules are made up of exactly the same building blocks, they are two completely different substances, and they behave completely differently inside of us. The configuration on the left is called CIS, which you've probably never heard of. The one of the right is called TRANS, and you probably have heard of trans fats before. They don't go rancid, they're more stable during deep frying, and they can change the texture of foods in ways that other fats just can't. They're also terrible for your health, by far worse than saturated fat, even though technically they're a type of unsaturated fat. Now, I know that seems crazy, but your body doesn't care what a molecule looks like on paper. All that matters is the 3-D shape where the molecule fits, where it doesn't, and what pathways it interferes with. So, how do you know if a food has trans fat in it? Well, the only sure way to know is if you see the words, "partially hydrogenated" in the ingredients list. Don't let nutrition labels or advertising fool you. The FDA allows manufacturers to claim that their products contain "0" grams of trans fat even if they actually have up to half a gram per serving. But there are no hard and fast rules about how small a serving can be, and, that means, you'll have to rely on seeing those key words, partially hydrogenated, because that's how trans fats are made, by partially hydrogenating unsaturated fats. So, let's go back to our olive oil and pancake mix from before. Olive oil is 100% fat. Pancake mix is only 11% fat. But olive oil is mostly unsaturated fat, and it has no trans fat at all. On the other hand, more than half the fat in pancake mix is either saturated or trans fat. And, so, even though olive oil has 10 times as much fat as pancake mix, it's healthy for you, whereas pancake mix is not. Now, I'm not trying to pick on pancake mix. There are lots of foods with this type of fat profile. The point is this: It's not how much fat you eat, it's what kind of fat. And what makes a particular fat healthy or unhealthy is its shape.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the general structure of molecules, whereas the generated MCQs are specific to the topic of fats and their properties.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the concept of molecular structure, I would select Question 4: What is the 3-D shape of the molecule called when the hydrogens and carbons are on the same side of the double bond? Options: A. TRANS, B. CIS, C. SATURATED, D. UNSATURATED.

Although this question is not directly related to the ground truth MCQ, it does mention the 3-D shape of a molecule, which is relevant to the concept of molecules being three-dimensional structures.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby There are all sorts of things that happen every day that might make you ask, "Why? Why do we drive on a parkway and park on a driveway? Why does my hair get frizzy when it's humid? And why do my fingers get all pruney when they're wet?" Often we simply can't know the answers to these questions. But progress can often be made, and, when it comes to your pruney fingers, scientists have a few interesting ideas. The story here begins with an observation made in the 1930s in the emergency room. Doctors noticed that patients with nerve damage to their hands did not get pruney fingertips like most of us do in a bath, which might make you wonder, "Why would primates want wrinkly fingers, presumably when it's rainy or dewy?" What could this trait be for? What if these wrinkles functioned like rain treads? Think about car tires. When the ground is dry, it's generally best to have smooth tires, and race cars do. Smooth tires means more rubber or surface area in contact with the road, which gives them better grip. But in rainy and muddy conditions, it's a different story, and here's where treads come into play. Treads reduce the amount of rubber on the road, but they help channel out water when it rains, lowering the risk of hydroplaning. Well, if your fingers really are like rain treads, you should be able to predict the optimal shape for them, right? So, what would the predicted wrinkle shapes be? That is, are our prunes actually the right shape to be rain treads? Let's take a detour into rivers. When we think of river networks, we usually imagine lots of smaller river channels joining to make larger river channels downstream, which is what happens in concave basins. In these cases, the divides, the regions between the river segments, are disconnected from one another and diverge away from one another uphill. But river networks look fundamentally different on convex promontories or protrusions. Here, the river channels are disconnected from one another and diverge away from one another downstream, not very river-like. In these cases, it's the divides that link together to form a tree, with its trunk uphill at the top of the promontory. Here, it's the divides that look more traditionally river-like. If our pruney fingers are drainage networks, designed to channel out water when they grip, then we expect to find similar shapes on our fingers as we find out there among rivers. There should be a tree network of divides, or ridges, with their trunk near the top of the fingertip and with their more leaky parts reaching out downhill, away from the tip. The channels themselves, through which the water is channeled during a grip, should not connect to one another, and instead should diverge away from one another downhill. If pruney fingers are rain treads, then they should look like the river networks on convex promontories. In fact, that's exactly the morphology we find among pruney fingers! When we grip, then, our pruney wrinkles really do channel out the water. But does it actually help us grip? New behavioral experiments have shown that they do. In a task where subjects had to grasp wet marbles and move them through a hole and out the other side, those with pruney fingers finished the task significantly faster than those with smooth fingers. Pruney fingers not only ought to enhance grip in wet conditions but do. So, pruney fingers may be a crucial part of the primate repertoire. Maybe, once primates lost their claws in favor of fingernails, rain treads were needed to deal with the especially challenging, often wet, grip-heavy forest habitats. By looking closely at the mysteries in our world and trying to find things that look similar, like our wet fingers and rain treads, we can come up with ideas about what's happening. And that's a good way to think about all sorts of questions in life, too.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby There are all sorts of things that happen every day that might make you ask, "Why? Why do we drive on a parkway and park on a driveway? Why does my hair get frizzy when it's humid? And why do my fingers get all pruney when they're wet?" Often we simply can't know the answers to these questions. But progress can often be made, and, when it comes to your pruney fingers, scientists have a few interesting ideas. The story here begins with an observation made in the 1930s in the emergency room. Doctors noticed that patients with nerve damage to their hands did not get pruney fingertips like most of us do in a bath, which might make you wonder, "Why would primates want wrinkly fingers, presumably when it's rainy or dewy?" What could this trait be for? What if these wrinkles functioned like rain treads? Think about car tires. When the ground is dry, it's generally best to have smooth tires, and race cars do. Smooth tires means more rubber or surface area in contact with the road, which gives them better grip. But in rainy and muddy conditions, it's a different story, and here's where treads come into play. Treads reduce the amount of rubber on the road, but they help channel out water when it rains, lowering the risk of hydroplaning. Well, if your fingers really are like rain treads, you should be able to predict the optimal shape for them, right? So, what would the predicted wrinkle shapes be? That is, are our prunes actually the right shape to be rain treads? Let's take a detour into rivers. When we think of river networks, we usually imagine lots of smaller river channels joining to make larger river channels downstream, which is what happens in concave basins. In these cases, the divides, the regions between the river segments, are disconnected from one another and diverge away from one another uphill. But river networks look fundamentally different on convex promontories or protrusions. Here, the river channels are disconnected from one another and diverge away from one another downstream, not very river-like. In these cases, it's the divides that link together to form a tree, with its trunk uphill at the top of the promontory. Here, it's the divides that look more traditionally river-like. If our pruney fingers are drainage networks, designed to channel out water when they grip, then we expect to find similar shapes on our fingers as we find out there among rivers. There should be a tree network of divides, or ridges, with their trunk near the top of the fingertip and with their more leaky parts reaching out downhill, away from the tip. The channels themselves, through which the water is channeled during a grip, should not connect to one another, and instead should diverge away from one another downhill. If pruney fingers are rain treads, then they should look like the river networks on convex promontories. In fact, that's exactly the morphology we find among pruney fingers! When we grip, then, our pruney wrinkles really do channel out the water. But does it actually help us grip? New behavioral experiments have shown that they do. In a task where subjects had to grasp wet marbles and move them through a hole and out the other side, those with pruney fingers finished the task significantly faster than those with smooth fingers. Pruney fingers not only ought to enhance grip in wet conditions but do. So, pruney fingers may be a crucial part of the primate repertoire. Maybe, once primates lost their claws in favor of fingernails, rain treads were needed to deal with the especially challenging, often wet, grip-heavy forest habitats. By looking closely at the mysteries in our world and trying to find things that look similar, like our wet fingers and rain treads, we can come up with ideas about what's happening. And that's a good way to think about all sorts of questions in life, too.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: What is the proposed explanation for the evolution of pruney fingers in primates? 

Although the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the intent and content of the question are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the advantage of pruney fingers for primates, while Question 6 asks about the proposed explanation for the evolution of pruney fingers in primates. Both questions are related to the purpose or benefit of pruney fingers for primates.

However, a more similar question would be one that asks about the advantage or benefit of pruney fingers, rather than their evolution. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 6, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

[Music] [Applause] so I want to talk to you about two things tonight number one teaching surgery and doing surgery is really hard and second that language is one one of the most profound things that separate us all over the world and in my little corner of the world these two things are actually related and I want to tell you how tonight now nobody wants an operation who here has had surgery did you want it keep your hands up if you wanted an operation nobody wants an operation in particular nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions that cause a lot of pain that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school that leave a big scar but if you have to have an operation what you really want is a minimally invasive operation that's what I want to talk to you about tonight how doing and teaching this type of surgery led us on a search for a better Universal translator now this type of surgery is hard and it starts by putting people to sleep putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen blowing them up like a balloon sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen it's dangerous stuff and taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen so let's see what it looks like so this is gallbladder surgery we perform a million of these a year in the United States alone this is the real thing there's no blood and you can see how focused The Sur are how much concentration it takes you can see it in their faces it's hard to teach and it's not all that easy to learn we do about five million of these in the United States and maybe 20 million of these worldwide all right you've all heard this the term he's a born surgeon let me tell you surgeons are not born surgeons are not made either we have no little tanks where we're making surgeons surgeons are trained one step at a time it starts with a foundation basic skills we build on that and we take people hopefully to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant then we teach them to be a surgeon in training and when they do all of that for about five years they get the coveted board certification if you need surgery you want to be operated on by a board certified surgeon you get your board certificate and you can go out into practice and eventually if you're lucky you achieve Mastery now that Foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery Society in the United States sages started in the late 1990s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong Foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to go on and do procedures now the science behind this is so potent that it became required by the American Board of surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified it's not a lecture it's not a course it's all of that plus a high stakes assessment it's hard now just this past year one of our partners the American College of Surgeons teamed up with us to make an announcement that all surgeons should be fls certified before they do minimally invasive surgery and are we talking about just people here in the US and Canada no we just said all surgeons so to lift this Education and Training worldwide is a very large task something I'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world sages does surgery all over the world teaching and educating surgeons so we have a problem and one of the problems is distance we can't travel everywhere we need to make the world a smaller place and I think that we can develop some tools to do so and one of the tools I like personally is using video so I was inspired by a friend this is Alan oranic from Toronto and he proved that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video conferencing so here's Allan teaching an English speaking surgeon in Africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery very inspiring but for this examination which is really hard we have a problem even people who say they speak English only 14% pass because for them it's not a surgery test it's an English test let me bring it to you locally I work at the Cambridge hospital it's a primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility we have more than a 100 translators covering 63 languages and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital it's a big labor intensive effort if you think about the worldwide burden of trying to talk to your patients not just teaching surgeons just trying to talk to your patients there aren't enough translators in the world we need to employ technology to assist us in this Quest at our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors to people who just got here last week and you have no idea how hard it is to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to and there isn't always a translator available so we need tools we need a universal translator one of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world it's really about setting up a dialogue we have a lot to learn here in the United States we spend more money per person for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world maybe we have something to learn as well so I'm passionate about teaching these fls skills all over the world this past year I've been in Latin America been in China talking about fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery and Everywhere I Go the barrier is we want this but we need it in our language so here's what we think we want to do imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously I want to talk to the people in Asia Latin America Africa Europe seamlessly accurately and in a cost effective fashion using technology and it has to be bidirectional they have to be able to teach us something as well it's a big task so we looked for a universal translator I thought there would be one out there your web page has Translation your cell phone has translation but nothing that's good enough to teach surgery because we need a lexicon what is a lexicon a lexicon is a body words that describes a domain I need to have a health care lexicon and in that I need a surgery lexicon that's a tall order we have to work at it so let me show you what we're doing this is research can't buy it we're working with the folks at IBM research from the accessibility Center to string together Technologies to work towards the universal translator it starts with a framework system where with a surgeon delivers the lecture using a framework of captioning technology we then add another technology to do video conferencing but we don't have the words yet so we add a third technology and now we've got the words and we can apply the Special Sauce the translation we get the words up in a window and then apply the magic we work with the fourth technology and we currently have access to 11 language pairs more to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place and I'd like to show you our prototype of stringing all of these technologies that don't necessarily always talk to each other to become something useful fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery module five manual Skills Practice students May display captions in their native language if you're in Latin America you click I want it in Spanish button and out ites in real time in Spanish but if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time by using technology in a constructive fashion you could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian on and on and on simultaneously without the use of human translators but that's the lectures if you remember what I told you about fls at the beginning it's knowledge and skill SKS the difference in an operation between doing something successfully and not may be moving your hand this much so we're going to take it one step further we brought my friend Allan back today we're going to practice suturing this is how you hold the needle grab the needle at the tip it's important to be accurate aim for the black dots Orient your Loop this way now go ahead and cut very good Oscar I'll see you next week so that's what we're working on and our quest for the universal translator we want it to be bidirectional we have a need to learn as well as to teach I can think of a million uses for a tool like this as we think about intersecting Technologies everybody has a cell phone with a camera we could use this everywhere whether it be health care patient care engineering law conferencing translating videos this is ubiquitous tool in order to break down our barriers we have to learn to talk to people to demand that people work on translation we need it for our everyday life in order to make the world a smaller place thank you very much [Applause] [Music]

dioxide in their abdomen blowing them up like a balloon sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen it's dangerous stuff and taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen so let's see what it looks like so this is gallbladder surgery we perform a million of these a year in the United States alone this is the real thing there's no blood and you can see how focused The Sur are how much concentration it takes you can see it in their faces it's hard to teach and it's not all that easy to learn we do about five million of these in the United States and maybe 20 million of these worldwide all right you've all heard this the term he's a born surgeon let me tell you surgeons are not born surgeons are not made either we have no little tanks where we're making surgeons surgeons are trained one step at a time it starts with a foundation basic skills we build on that and we take people hopefully to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant then we teach them to be a surgeon in training and when they do all of that for about five years they get the coveted board certification if you need surgery you want to be operated on by a board certified surgeon you get your board certificate and you can go out into practice and eventually if you're lucky you achieve Mastery now that Foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery Society in the United States sages started in the late 1990s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong Foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to go on and do procedures now the science behind this is so potent that it became required by the American Board of surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified it's not a lecture it's not a course it's all of that plus a high stakes assessment it's hard now just this past year one of our partners the American College of Surgeons teamed up with us to make an announcement that all surgeons should be fls certified before they do minimally invasive surgery and are we talking about just people here in the US and Canada no we just said all surgeons so to lift this Education and Training worldwide is a very large task something I'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world sages does surgery all over the world teaching and educating surgeons so we have a problem and one of the problems is distance we can't travel everywhere we need to make the world a smaller place and I think that we can develop some tools to do so and one of the tools I like personally is using video so I was inspired by a friend this is Alan oranic from Toronto and he proved that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video conferencing so here's Allan teaching an English speaking surgeon in Africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery very inspiring but for this examination which is really hard we have a problem even people who say they speak English only 14% pass because for them it's not a surgery test it's an English test let me bring it to you locally I work at the Cambridge hospital it's a primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility we have more than a 100 translators covering 63 languages and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital it's a big labor intensive effort if you think about the worldwide burden of trying to talk to your patients not just teaching surgeons just trying to talk to your patients there aren't enough translators in the world we need to employ technology to assist us in this Quest at our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors to people who just got here last week and you have no idea how hard it is to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to and there isn't always a translator available so we need tools we need a universal translator one of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world it's really about setting up a dialogue we have a lot to learn here in the United States we spend more money per person for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world maybe we have something to learn as well so I'm passionate about teaching these fls skills all over the world this past year I've been in Latin America been in China talking about fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery and Everywhere I Go the barrier is we want this but we need it in our language so here's what we think we want to do imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously I want to talk to the people in Asia Latin America Africa Europe seamlessly accurately and in a cost effective fashion using technology and it has to be bidirectional they have to be able to teach us something as well it's a big task so we looked for a universal translator I thought there would be one out there your web page has Translation your cell phone has translation but nothing that's good enough to teach surgery because we need a lexicon what is a lexicon a lexicon is a body words that describes a domain I need to have a health care lexicon and in that I need a surgery lexicon that's a tall order we have to work at it so let me show you what we're doing this is research can't buy it we're working with the folks at IBM research from the accessibility Center to string together Technologies to work towards the universal translator it starts with a framework system where with a surgeon delivers the lecture using a framework of captioning technology we then add another technology to do video conferencing but we don't have the words yet so we add a third technology and now we've got the words and we can apply the Special Sauce the translation we get the words up in a window and then apply the magic we work with the fourth technology and we currently have access to 11 language pairs more to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place and I'd like to show you our prototype of stringing all of these technologies that don't necessarily always talk to each other to become something useful fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery module five manual Skills Practice students May display captions in their native language if you're in Latin America you click I want it in Spanish button and out ites in real time in Spanish but if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time by using technology in a constructive

fls at the beginning it's knowledge and skill SKS the difference in an operation between doing something successfully and not may be moving your hand this much so we're going to take it one step

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of laparoscopic surgeries, although it does not specifically address the percentage of laparoscopic surgeries performed outside of the United States.

The most similar generated MCQ is:
Question 2: What type of surgery is hard to teach and perform, and is the focus of the speaker's talk? Options: A. Open-heart surgery, B. Gallbladder surgery, C. Brain surgery, D. Joint replacement surgery

Although this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, it is related to the topic of laparoscopic surgeries, which is the focus of the speaker's talk. The correct answer to this question is actually "minimally invasive surgery" or "laparoscopic surgery," which is not among the options provided.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2

Please note that the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new MCQ that specifically addresses the percentage of laparoscopic surgeries performed outside of the United States would be more accurate.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the definition of a "surgery lexicon." The most similar generated MCQ is Question 7, which asks about the name of the technology that the speaker is working on to develop a universal translator. Although this question is not directly related to the definition of a "surgery lexicon," it does mention the concept of a lexicon in the context of the speaker's talk.

However, a closer examination of the transcript reveals that Question 7 is not the best match. A better match would be a question that asks about the definition of a lexicon in the context of the speaker's talk.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the definition of a lexicon. Therefore, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 7, but with the caveat that it is not a good match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 7 (with reservations)

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so I want to talk to you about two things tonight number one teaching surgery and doing surgery is really hard and second that language is one one of the most profound things that separate us all over the world and in my little corner of the world these two things are actually related and I want to tell you how tonight now nobody wants an operation who here has had surgery did you want it keep your hands up if you wanted an operation nobody wants an operation in particular nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions that cause a lot of pain that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school that leave a big scar but if you have to have an operation what you really want is a minimally invasive operation that's what I want to talk to you about tonight how doing and teaching this type of surgery led us on a search for a better Universal translator now this type of surgery is hard and it starts by putting people to sleep putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen blowing them up like a balloon sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen it's dangerous stuff and taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen so let's see what it looks like so this is gallbladder surgery we perform a million of these a year in the United States alone this is the real thing there's no blood and you can see how focused The Sur are how much concentration it takes you can see it in their faces it's hard to teach and it's not all that easy to learn we do about five million of these in the United States and maybe 20 million of these worldwide all right you've all heard this the term he's a born surgeon let me tell you surgeons are not born surgeons are not made either we have no little tanks where we're making surgeons surgeons are trained one step at a time it starts with a foundation basic skills we build on that and we take people hopefully to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant then we teach them to be a surgeon in training and when they do all of that for about five years they get the coveted board certification if you need surgery you want to be operated on by a board certified surgeon you get your board certificate and you can go out into practice and eventually if you're lucky you achieve Mastery now that Foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery Society in the United States sages started in the late 1990s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong Foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to go on and do procedures now the science behind this is so potent that it became required by the American Board of surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified it's not a lecture it's not a course it's all of that plus a high stakes assessment it's hard now just this past year one of our partners the American College of Surgeons teamed up with us to make an announcement that all surgeons should be fls certified before they do minimally invasive surgery and are we talking about just people here in the US and Canada no we just said all surgeons so to lift this Education and Training worldwide is a very large task something I'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world sages does surgery all over the world teaching and educating surgeons so we have a problem and one of the problems is distance we can't travel everywhere we need to make the world a smaller place and I think that we can develop some tools to do so and one of the tools I like personally is using video so I was inspired by a friend this is Alan oranic from Toronto and he proved that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video conferencing so here's Allan teaching an English speaking surgeon in Africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery very inspiring but for this examination which is really hard we have a problem even people who say they speak English only 14% pass because for them it's not a surgery test it's an English test let me bring it to you locally I work at the Cambridge hospital it's a primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility we have more than a 100 translators covering 63 languages and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital it's a big labor intensive effort if you think about the worldwide burden of trying to talk to your patients not just teaching surgeons just trying to talk to your patients there aren't enough translators in the world we need to employ technology to assist us in this Quest at our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors to people who just got here last week and you have no idea how hard it is to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to and there isn't always a translator available so we need tools we need a universal translator one of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world it's really about setting up a dialogue we have a lot to learn here in the United States we spend more money per person for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world maybe we have something to learn as well so I'm passionate about teaching these fls skills all over the world this past year I've been in Latin America been in China talking about fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery and Everywhere I Go the barrier is we want this but we need it in our language so here's what we think we want to do imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously I want to talk to the people in Asia Latin America Africa Europe seamlessly accurately and in a cost effective fashion using technology and it has to be bidirectional they have to be able to teach us something as well it's a big task so we looked for a universal translator I thought there would be one out there your web page has Translation your cell phone has translation but nothing that's good enough to teach surgery because we need a lexicon what is a lexicon a lexicon is a body words that describes a domain I need to have a health care lexicon and in that I need a surgery lexicon that's a tall order we have to work at it so let me show you what we're doing this is research can't buy it we're working with the folks at IBM research from the accessibility Center to string together Technologies to work towards the universal translator it starts with a framework system where with a surgeon delivers the lecture using a framework of captioning technology we then add another technology to do video conferencing but we don't have the words yet so we add a third technology and now we've got the words and we can apply the Special Sauce the translation we get the words up in a window and then apply the magic we work with the fourth technology and we currently have access to 11 language pairs more to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place and I'd like to show you our prototype of stringing all of these technologies that don't necessarily always talk to each other to become something useful fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery module five manual Skills Practice students May display captions in their native language if you're in Latin America you click I want it in Spanish button and out ites in real time in Spanish but if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time by using technology in a constructive fashion you could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian on and on and on simultaneously without the use of human translators but that's the lectures if you remember what I told you about fls at the beginning it's knowledge and skill SKS the difference in an operation between doing something successfully and not may be moving your hand this much so we're going to take it one step further we brought my friend Allan back today we're going to practice suturing this is how you hold the needle grab the needle at the tip it's important to be accurate aim for the black dots Orient your Loop this way now go ahead and cut very good Oscar I'll see you next week so that's what we're working on and our quest for the universal translator we want it to be bidirectional we have a need to learn as well as to teach I can think of a million uses for a tool like this as we think about intersecting Technologies everybody has a cell phone with a camera we could use this everywhere whether it be health care patient care engineering law conferencing translating videos this is ubiquitous tool in order to break down our barriers we have to learn to talk to people to demand that people work on translation we need it for our everyday life in order to make the world a smaller place thank you very much [Applause] [Music]

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby We are constantly asked for our opinions. Which team do you think will win the Super Bowl? Who wore it better on the red carpet? Who are you going to vote for for mayor? Public opinion polls are everywhere. Important decision makers in American government have long relied on public opinion polls throughout elections and important legislation. The problem is public opinion isn't easy to track and, often times, isn't even right. In 1948, the Chicago Daily Tribune ran a now famous headline: "Dewey Defeats Truman," they cried in big, bold, black and white letters. The problem is that Dewey hadn't defeated Truman. The Tribune had relied on polls to come to their conclusion. Whoops! This happens all the time because public opinion polls are either inaccurate or misleading. So, why are they wrong? And why do we keep using them? First, let's start with an important term: sample. A sample is the group of people that respond to questions during a public opinion poll. A poll's quality rests largely on its sample, and a sample can be bad in a few key ways. It can be too small, too narrow, or the poll itself can be too difficult. Polls that are too small are bad for obvious reasons. And while you can't possibly ask every single person in America for their opinion, the more people you ask, the more accurate your prediction. Polls that are too narrow, that only ask a certain type of person a question, are bad, too. Consider a poll about whether or not the potato is the best vegetable in America. If you only asked people in Idaho, where the state food is the potato, chances are that you would get a much different answer than if you asked people in the state of New Mexico, where the state vegetable is beans. Getting the right kind of diversity in your sample means making sure that your sample has a range of ages, races, genders, and geographic regions, just to name a few. Finally, polls that are too hard can't tell you much either. If you're asking people for their opinions on things about which they have no prior knowledge, the results will be pointless. You're better off shaking a Magic 8 ball. It's not just the people you're asking that can cause bias, though. The person doing the asking is part of the problem, too. That's called interviewer bias. Interviewer bias is all about the effect that the person asking the questions has on the sample. Humans generally don't like confrontation. People worry that their answers may make them look bad. Therefore, we find that people tend to give socially desirable responses, not necessarily their honest opinions, because they don't want to come across as heartless, racist, or bigoted. And the way we word our questions matters too. When polls purposely sway the answers one way or the other, it's called a push poll because it pushes people to answer a certain way. "Would you vote for candidate Smith?" is a perfectly normal question. "Would you vote for candidate Smith if you knew that he robs senior citizens?" is a push poll. So, if polls are open to all sorts of manipulation and inaccuracies, why are they still so prevalent? Despite their flaws, public opinion polls provide us with some sense of the thoughts and moods of large groups of people. They offer politicians the chance to pass legislation they think a majority of Americans will support. They help fashionistas on TV know which star wore the dress better on the red carpet. Finally, they make us, the people who get polled, feel as though our voice has been heard. So, next time you get a phone call asking your opinion, or if you see a poll online, take some time to think about who is asking and why they're asking. Then, take that poll, and its results, with a grain of salt or a potato.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although the options in Question 5 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question content and intent are similar. Both the ground truth MCQ and Question 5 ask about the concept of a push poll, which is a poll designed to influence the answer. 

However, a more similar generated MCQ would be one that includes options similar to the ground truth MCQ, such as a question with neutral options (e.g., "Do you like hamburgers?") and an option that is trying to sway the answer (e.g., "Do you like those ABCD ACME hamburgers that turn people green?"). 

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of options. Nevertheless, Question 5 is the most similar in terms of question content and intent.

We used a tablet and one of the many stop motion apps out there. How do you get from point A to point B? We started off by taking a bunch of pictures of Celeste in place. Then, just like stop motion animation, the character is moved just a bit before the next picture is taken, which, in this case, creates a sliding effect. Here we use the oldest trick in the book. By alternating between photos of Celeste on-screen and off-screen, we've made her childhood dream of teleportation a reality. With a little creativity, there are a million ways you can used homemade special effects to make something as simple as getting from point A to point B much more fun. If you're at a loss for ideas, try finding inspiration in your surroundings, like the refrigerator and your coat rack. You can even try incorporating everyday objects from around your house, like, say, umbrellas or binder clips. Wherever there is an object, there is an opportunity to make it come to life. When humans are used in stop motion animation, that's called pixilation, a term coined in the mid-twentieth century, well before the word pixel was a part of our vocabulary. But these sorts of special effects are as old as the art of film making, and thanks to today's technologies, can be reproduced in your very own kitchen. Moving an object from point A to point B is a fundamental principle of animation. To learn more about the process and the tools we used, visit the "Dig Deeper" section on ed.ted.com.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has some similarity with the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about an example of "how to get from point A to point B" that is NOT shown in the video. The generated MCQs do not have a direct match for this question. However, Question 8 talks about the oldest trick in the book used to create the illusion of teleportation, which is one of the methods mentioned in the transcript for getting from point A to point B.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 8. However, please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that asks about an example of "how to get from point A to point B" that is NOT shown in the video.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although the ground truth MCQ and Question 8 do not exactly match in terms of question content, they both relate to creating an illusion in animation. The ground truth MCQ asks about the type of sequence of images that creates the illusion of flying, while Question 8 asks about the oldest trick in the book used to create the illusion of teleportation in animation. 

However, in terms of options and overall intent, Question 8 is the closest match. Option C in the ground truth MCQ mentions "Alternating pictures of Celeste on-screen and off-screen," which is similar to Option A in Question 8, "Alternating between photos of the object on-screen and off-screen."

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Imagine a place so dark you can't see the nose on your face. Eyes opened or closed, it's all the same because the sun never shines there. Up ahead, you see a light. When you creep in to investigate, a blue light flits around you. "I could watch this forever," you think. But you can't because the mouth of an anglerfish has just sprung open and eaten you alive. You are just one of many creatures at the bottom of the ocean who learn too late to appreciate the power of bioluminescence. Bioluminescence refers to the ability of certain living things to create light. The human body can make stuff like ear wax and toe nails, but these organisms can turn parts of their body into glow sticks. It's like nature made them ready to rave. Why? In one way or another, bioluminescence improves a living thing's chances of survival. Take the firefly. It's ability to glow green helps it attract a mate on a warm, summer night, but it's just one of many living things that can glow. The railroad worm, Phrixothrix hirtus, can light up its body in two colors: red and green. Would you eat something that looks like an airport runway? Neither would any sensible predator. The flashing lights keep the worm safe. Then there's the deep sea shrimp, Acantherphyra purpurea. When it feels threatened, it spews a cloud of glowing goo from its mouth. Who doesn't run the other way when they've just been puked on? Plus, that puke attracts bigger predators who want to eat the shrimp's enemy. So what if you can't bioluminesce? No problem! There are other ways for living things to make bioluminescence work for them, even if they weren't born with the equipment to glow. Let's revisit the anglerfish moments before it tried to eat you. That glowing bait on top of its head? It comes from a pocket of skin called the esca. The esca holds bioluminescent bacteria. The anglerfish can't glow there by itself, so it holds a sack of glowing bacteria instead. Remember the firefly? It can actually make itself glow. Inside its lantern are two chemicals, a luciferin and a luciferase. When firefly luciferase and luciferin mix together in the presence of oxygen and fuel for the cell, called ATP, the chemical reaction gives off energy in the form of light. Once scientists figured out how the firefly creates its luciferase and luciferin, they used genetic engineering to make this light-producing reaction occur inside other living things that can't glow. For example, they inserted the genes, or instructions, for a cell to create firefly luciferase and luciferin into a tobacco plant. Once there, the tobacco plant followed the instructions slipped into its DNA and lit up like a Christmas tree. The beauty of bioluminescence, unlike the light from the sun or an incandescent bulb, is that it's not hot. It takes place in a range of temperatures that don't burn a living thing. And unlike a glow stick, which fades out as the chemicals inside get used up, bioluminescent reactions use replenishable resources. That's one reason engineers are trying to develop bioluminescent trees. Just think, if planted on the side of highways, they could light the way, using only oxygen and other freely available, clean resources to run. Talk about survival advantage! That could help our planet live longer. Do you find yourself thinking of other ways to put bioluminescence to good use? That glow stick you swing at a rave may help you find a mate, but how else can bioluminescence improve your survival? If you start thinking in this way, you have seen the light.

The anglerfish can't glow there by itself, so it holds a sack of glowing bacteria instead. Remember the firefly? It can actually make itself glow. Inside its lantern are two chemicals, a luciferin and a luciferase. When firefly luciferase and luciferin mix together in the presence of oxygen and fuel for the cell, called ATP, the chemical reaction gives off energy in the form of light. Once scientists figured out how the firefly creates its luciferase and luciferin, they used genetic engineering to make this light-producing reaction occur inside other living things that can't glow. For example, they inserted the genes, or instructions, for a cell to create firefly luciferase and luciferin into a tobacco plant. Once there, the tobacco plant followed the instructions slipped into its DNA and lit up like a Christmas tree. The beauty of bioluminescence, unlike the light from the sun or an incandescent bulb, is that it's not hot. It takes place in a range of temperatures that don't burn a living thing. And unlike a glow stick, which fades out as the chemicals inside get used up, bioluminescent reactions use replenishable resources. That's one reason engineers are trying to develop bioluminescent trees. Just think, if planted on the side of highways, they could light the way, using only oxygen and other freely available, clean resources to run. Talk about survival advantage! That could help our planet live longer. Do you find yourself thinking of other ways to put bioluminescence to good use? That glow stick you swing at a rave may help you find a mate, but how else can bioluminescence improve your survival? If you start thinking in this way, you have seen the light.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Today, we're going to look at the world of Rome through the eyes of a young girl. Here she is, drawing a picture of herself in the atrium of her father's enormous house. Her name is Domitia, and she is just 5 years old. She has an older brother who is fourteen, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, named after her dad. Girls don't get these long names that boys have. What is worse is that Dad insists on calling all his daughters Domitia. "Domitia!" His call to Domitia drawing on the column, Domitia III. She has an older sister, Domitia II, who is 7 years old. And then there's Domitia I, who is ten. There would have been a Domitia IV, but mom died trying to give birth to her three years ago. Confused? The Romans were too. They could work out ancestry through the male line with the nice, tripartite names such as Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. But they got in a real mess over which Domitia was married to whom and was either the great aunt or the great stepmother and so on to whom when they came to write it down. Domitia III is not just drawing on the pillar, she's also watching the action. You see, it's early, in the time of day when all her dad's clients and friends come to see him at home to pay their respects. Lucius Popidius Secundus, a 17 year old, he wants to marry Domitia II within the next five to seven years, has come as well. He seems to be wooing not his future wife, but her dad. Poor Lucius, he does not know that Domitia's dad thinks he and his family are wealthy but still scumbags from the Subura. Afterall, it is the part of Rome full of barbers and prostitutes. Suddenly, all the men are leaving with Dad. It's the second hour and time for him to be in court with a sturdy audience of clients to applaud his rhetoric and hiss at his opponent. The house is now quieter. The men won't return for seven hours, not until dinner time. But what happens in the house for those seven hours? What do Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia do all day? Not an easy question! Everything written down by the Romans that we have today was written by men. This makes constructing the lives of women difficult. However, we can't have a history of just Roman men, so here it goes. We can begin in the atrium. There is a massive loom, on which Dad's latest wife is working on a new toga. Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia are tasked with spinning the wool that will be used to weave this mighty garment, 30 or more feet long and elliptical in shape. Romans loved the idea that their wives work wool. We know that because it's written on the gravestones of so many Roman women. Unlike women in Greece, Roman women go out the house and move about the city. They go to the baths in the morning to avoid the men or to separate baths that are for women only. Some do go in for the latest fad of the AD 70s: nude bathing with men present. Where they have no place is where the men are: in the Forum, in the Law Court, or in the Senate House. Their place in public is in the porticos with gardens, with sculpture, and with pathways for walking in. When Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia want to leave the house to go somewhere, like the Portico of Livia, they must get ready. Domitia II and Domitia III are ready, but Domitia I, who is betrothed to be married in two years to darling Philatus, isn't ready. She's not slow, she just has more to do. Being betrothed means she wears the insignia of betrothal: engagement rings and all the gifts Pilatus has given her - jewels, earrings, necklaces, and the pendants. She may even wear her myrtle crown. All this bling shouts, "I'm getting married to that 19 year old who gave me all this stuff I'm wearing!" While as they wait, Domitia II and Domitia III play with their dolls that mirror the image of their sister decked out to be married. One day, these dolls will be dedicated to the household gods on the day of their wedding. Okay, we're ready. The girls step into litters carried by some burly slaves. They also have a chaperone with them and will be meeting an aunt at the Porticus of Livia. Carried high on the shoulders of these slaves, the girls look out through the curtains to see the crowded streets below them. They traverse the city, pass the Coliseum, but then turn off to climb up the hill to the Porticus of Livia. It was built by Livia, the wife of the first emperor Augustus, on the site of the house of Vedius Pollio. He wasn't such a great guy. He once tried to feed a slave to the eels in his fish pond for simply dropping a dish. Luckily, the emperor was at the dinner and tamed his temper. The litters are placed on the ground and the girls get out and arm in arm, two by two, they ascend the steps into the enclosed garden with many columns. Domitia III shot off and is drawing on a column. Domitia II joins her but seeks to read the graffiti higher up on the column. She spots a drawing of gladiators and tries to imagine seeing them fighting, something she will never be permitted to do, except from the very rear of the Coliseum. From there, she will have a good view of the 50,000 spectators but will see little by way of blood and gore. If she really wanted a decent view, she could become a vestal virgin and would sit right down the front. But a career tending the sacred flame of Vesta is not to everybody's taste. Domitia I has met another ten year old also decked out in the insignia of betrothal. Home time. When they get there after the eighth hour, something is up. A smashed dish lies on the floor. All the slaves are being gathered together in the atrium and await the arrival of their master. Dad is going to go mad. He will not hit his children, but like many other Romans, he believes that slaves have to be punished. The whip lies ready for his arrival. No one knows who smashed the dish, but Dad will call the undertaker to torture it out of them, if he must. The doorkeeper opens the front door to the house. A hush comes over the anxious slaves. In walks not their master but, instead, a pregnant teenager. It is the master's eldest daughter, age 15, who is already a veteran of marriage and child birth. Guess what her name is. There is a five to ten percent chance she won't survive giving birth to her child, but, for now, she has come to dinner with her family. As a teenage mother, she has proved that she is a successful wife by bringing children and descendants for her husband, who will carry on his name in the future. The family head off to the dining room and are served dinner. It would seem Dad has had an invite to dinner elsewhere. With dinner concluded, the girls crossed the atrium to bid farewell to their older sister who is carried home in a litter, escorted by some of Dad's bodyguards. Returning to the house, the girls cross the atrium. The slaves, young and old, male and female, await the return of their owner. When he returns, he may exact vengeance, ensuring his power over the slaves is maintained through violence and terror, to which any slave could be subjected. But, for the girls, they head upstairs for the night, ready for bed.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the significance of male and female names in Ancient Rome. The closest generated MCQ is Question 1, which asks about the name of the Roman family's father. However, this question does not address the significance of male and female names.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that asks about the naming conventions of the Domitia sisters, but such a question is not present in the list.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 1, but with the understanding that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 1 (with reservations)

Note: A more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically addresses the significance of male and female names in Ancient Rome, which is not present in the provided list.

One day, these dolls will be dedicated to the household gods on the day of their wedding. Okay, we're ready. The girls step into litters carried by some burly slaves. They also have a chaperone with them and will be meeting an aunt at the Porticus of Livia. Carried high on the shoulders of these slaves, the girls look out through the curtains to see the crowded streets below them. They traverse the city, pass the Coliseum, but then turn off to climb up the hill to the Porticus of Livia. It was built by Livia, the wife of the first emperor Augustus, on the site of the house of Vedius Pollio. He wasn't such a great guy. He once tried to feed a slave to the eels in his fish pond for simply dropping a dish. Luckily, the emperor was at the dinner and tamed his temper. The litters are placed on the ground and the girls get out and arm in arm, two by two, they ascend the steps into the enclosed garden with many columns. Domitia III shot off and is drawing on a column. Domitia II joins her but seeks to read the graffiti higher up on the column. She spots a drawing of gladiators and tries to imagine seeing them fighting, something she will never be permitted to do, except from the very rear of the Coliseum. From there, she will have a good view of the 50,000 spectators but will see little by way of blood and gore. If she really wanted a decent view, she could become a vestal virgin and would sit right down the front. But a career tending the sacred flame of Vesta is not to everybody's taste. Domitia I has met another ten year old also decked out in the insignia of betrothal. Home time. When they get there after the eighth hour, something is up. A smashed dish lies on the floor. All the slaves are being gathered together in the atrium and await the arrival of their master. Dad is going to go mad. He will not hit his children, but like many other Romans, he believes that slaves have to be punished. The whip lies ready for his arrival. No one knows who smashed the dish, but Dad will call the undertaker to torture it out of them, if he must. The doorkeeper opens the front door to the house. A hush comes over the anxious slaves. In walks not their master but, instead, a pregnant teenager. It is the master's eldest daughter, age 15, who is already a veteran of marriage and child birth. Guess what her name is. There is a five to ten percent chance she won't survive giving birth to her child, but, for now, she has come to dinner with her family. As a teenage mother, she has proved that she is a successful wife by bringing children and descendants for her husband, who will carry on his name in the future. The family head off to the dining room and are served dinner. It would seem Dad has had an invite to dinner elsewhere. With dinner concluded, the girls crossed the atrium to bid farewell to their older sister who is carried home in a litter, escorted by some of Dad's bodyguards. Returning to the house, the girls cross the atrium. The slaves, young and old, male and female, await the return of their owner. When he returns, he may exact vengeance, ensuring his power over the slaves is maintained through violence and terror, to which any slave could be subjected. But, for the girls, they head upstairs for the night, ready for bed.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks, "Where do the men go at the second hour?" The correct answer is "Court." 

A related generated MCQ is Question 2, which mentions the atrium and the tasks assigned to Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia. Although it does not directly ask about the men's destination at the second hour, it does describe the scene in the atrium after the men have left.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that asks about the men's activities or destinations. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 9, which mentions the master's punishment for the slaves. This question is related to the scene where the men return home and the master might exact vengeance on the slaves. However, this is still a stretch, and the generated MCQ does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

In conclusion, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, and I couldn't find a suitable replacement.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Today, we're going to look at the world of Rome through the eyes of a young girl. Here she is, drawing a picture of herself in the atrium of her father's enormous house. Her name is Domitia, and she is just 5 years old. She has an older brother who is fourteen, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, named after her dad. Girls don't get these long names that boys have. What is worse is that Dad insists on calling all his daughters Domitia. "Domitia!" His call to Domitia drawing on the column, Domitia III. She has an older sister, Domitia II, who is 7 years old. And then there's Domitia I, who is ten. There would have been a Domitia IV, but mom died trying to give birth to her three years ago. Confused? The Romans were too. They could work out ancestry through the male line with the nice, tripartite names such as Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. But they got in a real mess over which Domitia was married to whom and was either the great aunt or the great stepmother and so on to whom when they came to write it down. Domitia III is not just drawing on the pillar, she's also watching the action. You see, it's early, in the time of day when all her dad's clients and friends come to see him at home to pay their respects. Lucius Popidius Secundus, a 17 year old, he wants to marry Domitia II within the next five to seven years, has come as well. He seems to be wooing not his future wife, but her dad. Poor Lucius, he does not know that Domitia's dad thinks he and his family are wealthy but still scumbags from the Subura. Afterall, it is the part of Rome full of barbers and prostitutes. Suddenly, all the men are leaving with Dad. It's the second hour and time for him to be in court with a sturdy audience of clients to applaud his rhetoric and hiss at his opponent. The house is now quieter. The men won't return for seven hours, not until dinner time. But what happens in the house for those seven hours? What do Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia do all day? Not an easy question! Everything written down by the Romans that we have today was written by men. This makes constructing the lives of women difficult. However, we can't have a history of just Roman men, so here it goes. We can begin in the atrium. There is a massive loom, on which Dad's latest wife is working on a new toga. Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia are tasked with spinning the wool that will be used to weave this mighty garment, 30 or more feet long and elliptical in shape. Romans loved the idea that their wives work wool. We know that because it's written on the gravestones of so many Roman women. Unlike women in Greece, Roman women go out the house and move about the city. They go to the baths in the morning to avoid the men or to separate baths that are for women only. Some do go in for the latest fad of the AD 70s: nude bathing with men present. Where they have no place is where the men are: in the Forum, in the Law Court, or in the Senate House. Their place in public is in the porticos with gardens, with sculpture, and with pathways for walking in. When Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia want to leave the house to go somewhere, like the Portico of Livia, they must get ready. Domitia II and Domitia III are ready, but Domitia I, who is betrothed to be married in two years to darling Philatus, isn't ready. She's not slow, she just has more to do. Being betrothed means she wears the insignia of betrothal: engagement rings and all the gifts Pilatus has given her - jewels, earrings, necklaces, and the pendants. She may even wear her myrtle crown. All this bling shouts, "I'm getting married to that 19 year old who gave me all this stuff I'm wearing!" While as they wait, Domitia II and Domitia III play with their dolls that mirror the image of their sister decked out to be married. One day, these dolls will be dedicated to the household gods on the day of their wedding. Okay, we're ready. The girls step into litters carried by some burly slaves.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although the options in Question 4 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ, the question intent is similar. The ground truth MCQ asks how the public knows that a woman is betrothed to be married, and Question 4 asks about the significance of Domitia I wearing the insignia of betrothal. Both questions are related to the topic of betrothal and its public representation.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 4, but I would also suggest generating new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Your car, the heating system in your house, your gas stove. Most of the energy you use comes from fossil fuels, which present a couple of problems. First, there are limited supplies of fossil fuels, so the more we use, the less we've got. And second, the use of fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change because it releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Biofuels come from natural, renewable sources like plants, so they have the potential to reduce our reliance on those limited supply fossil fuels and reduce the risk of climate change. Most biofuels today are made from corn grain that is fermented into ethanol. But we have a limited supply of this corn, so it's not a solution to the limited supply part of the quandary. It also takes a lot of resources to grow corn grain. Strike 2! A potential solution: Using cellulose instead of corn grain to make ethanol. Cellulose is far more abundant than corn grain and takes less energy to produce. In fact, it's the most abundant organic molecule on the planet! Cellulose is the main ingredient found in a plant's cell wall. Plants generate cellulose from water and carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. So, where as using fossil fuels produce carbon dioxide, using cellulose-based ethanol might help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The main obstacle is that the cellulose molecule, a long, connected chain of glucose sugar protected by a tough, molecular sheath, is difficult to break apart. Creating cellulose-based ethanol means first unwrapping that protective sheath and then chopping up the cellulose into its individual glucose molecule. Only once we have unpacked each glucose molecule, can we begin fermentation. But some microorganisms, like bacteria or fungi, break down cellulose for energy all the time. For example, dairy cows eat foods like hay or alfalfa, which are full of cellulose. Microbes that live in their stomachs produce an enzyme called cellulase, which breaks apart the cellulose molecules so that the cow can use what's left for energy. Researchers are now studying these kinds of microorganisms in the hopes of finding better ways to break down cellulose so we can use it for our own energy needs. The solution, they think, lies in finding microbes in nature that can produce the kinds of cellulase enzymes that we need. This process of searching for species in nature that can produce valuable products is called bioprospecting. To test whether or not a sample of microbes can break down cellulose effectively, researchers first grow the microbe in a test tube. Then, they add a source of cellulose as the sole form of energy. If the microbe can't produce cellulase and break down cellulose, the test tube will remain unchanged. But if the microbe produces the enzymes we are looking for, it will be able to break down cellulose, use it for energy, and thrive in its test tube environment. If our microbial sample can break down the cellulose in the test tube, there is a chance we could use it to create a renewable and sustainable source of fuel for our cars from cellulose.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Your car, the heating system in your house, your gas stove. Most of the energy you use comes from fossil fuels, which present a couple of problems. First, there are limited supplies of fossil fuels, so the more we use, the less we've got. And second, the use of fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change because it releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Biofuels come from natural, renewable sources like plants, so they have the potential to reduce our reliance on those limited supply fossil fuels and reduce the risk of climate change. Most biofuels today are made from corn grain that is fermented into ethanol. But we have a limited supply of this corn, so it's not a solution to the limited supply part of the quandary. It also takes a lot of resources to grow corn grain. Strike 2! A potential solution: Using cellulose instead of corn grain to make ethanol. Cellulose is far more abundant than corn grain and takes less energy to produce. In fact, it's the most abundant organic molecule on the planet! Cellulose is the main ingredient found in a plant's cell wall. Plants generate cellulose from water and carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. So, where as using fossil fuels produce carbon dioxide, using cellulose-based ethanol might help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The main obstacle is that the cellulose molecule, a long, connected chain of glucose sugar protected by a tough, molecular sheath, is difficult to break apart. Creating cellulose-based ethanol means first unwrapping that protective sheath and then chopping up the cellulose into its individual glucose molecule. Only once we have unpacked each glucose molecule, can we begin fermentation. But some microorganisms, like bacteria or fungi, break down cellulose for energy all the time. For example, dairy cows eat foods like hay or alfalfa, which are full of cellulose. Microbes that live in their stomachs produce an enzyme called cellulase, which breaks apart the cellulose molecules so that the cow can use what's left for energy. Researchers are now studying these kinds of microorganisms in the hopes of finding better ways to break down cellulose so we can use it for our own energy needs. The solution, they think, lies in finding microbes in nature that can produce the kinds of cellulase enzymes that we need. This process of searching for species in nature that can produce valuable products is called bioprospecting. To test whether or not a sample of microbes can break down cellulose effectively, researchers first grow the microbe in a test tube. Then, they add a source of cellulose as the sole form of energy. If the microbe can't produce cellulase and break down cellulose, the test tube will remain unchanged. But if the microbe produces the enzymes we are looking for, it will be able to break down cellulose, use it for energy, and thrive in its test tube environment. If our microbial sample can break down the cellulose in the test tube, there is a chance we could use it to create a renewable and sustainable source of fuel for our cars from cellulose.

**Transcript**:
so raise your hand if you know someone in your immediate family or circle of friends who suffers from some form of mental illness I thought so not surprised and raise your hand if you think that basic research on fruit flies has anything to do with understanding mental illness and humans yeah I thought so I'm also not surprised I can see I got my work cut out for me here as we heard from dr. ensel this morning psychiatric disorders like autism depression and schizophrenia take a terrible toll on human suffering we know much less about their treatment and the understanding of their basic mechanisms than we do about diseases of the body think about it in 2013 the second decade of the millennium if you're concerned about a cancer diagnosis and you go to your doctor you get bone scans biopsies and blood tests in 2013 if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis you go to your doctor and what do you get a questionnaire part of the reason for this is that we have an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders we tend to view them and the popular press aids and abets this view as chemical imbalances in the brain as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup full of dopamine serotonin and norepinephrine this view is conditioned by the fact that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders like prozac act by globally changing brain chemistry as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup but that can't be the answer because these drugs actually don't work all that well a lot of people won't take them or stop taking them because of their unpleasant side effects these drugs have so many side effects because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder is a bit like trying to change your engine oil by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block some of it will dribble into the right place but a lot of it will do more harm than good now an emerging view that you also heard about from dr. ensel this morning is that psychiatric disorders are actually disturbances of neural circuits that mediate emotion mood and affect when we think about cognition we analogize the brain to a computer that's no problem well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion it's just that we don't tend to think about it that way but we know we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatric disorders because of the overwhelming dominance of this chemical imbalance hypothesis now it's not that chemicals are not important in psychiatric disorders it's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup rather they're released in very specific locations and they act on specific synapses to change the flow of information in the brain so if we ever really want to understand the biological basis of psychiatric disorders we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain where these chemicals act otherwise we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences now to begin to overcome our ignorant of the role of brain chemistry and brain circuitry it's helpful to work on what we biologists call model organisms animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to molecularly identify and pinpoint specific classes of neurons as you heard about an Alan Jones's talk this morning moreover once we can do that we can actually activate specific neurons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons so if we inhibit a particular type of neuron and we find that a behavior is blocked we can conclude that those neurons are necessary for that behavior on the other hand if we activate a group of neurons and we find that that produces behavior we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior so in this way by doing this kind of tests we can draw cause-and-effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particularly havior something that is extremely difficult if not impossible to do right now in humans but can an organism like a fruit fly which is it's a great model organism because it's got a small brain it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors it breeds quickly and it's cheap but can an organism like this teach us anything about emotion like states do these ordinance even have emotion like States or are they just little digital robots Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behaviors as he wrote in his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals and my eponymous colleague Seymour Benzer believed it as well Seymour is the man that introduced the use of Drosophila here at Caltech in the 60s as a model organism to study the connection between genes and behavior seem were recruited me to Caltech in the late 1980s he was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here and Seymour taught me both to love flies and also to play with science so how do we how do we ask this question it's one thing to believe that flies have emotion like States but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not now in humans we often infer emotional states as you'll hear later today from facial expressions however it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies it's kind of like landing on Mars and looking out the window of your spaceship at all the little green men who are surrounding it and trying to figure out how do I find out if they have emotions or not what can we do it's not so easy well one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion like states such as arousal and see if we can identify any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties so three important ones that I can think of our persistence gradations and intensity and valence persistence means long lasting we all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone rotations of intensity means what it sounds like you can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of emotion of an emotion if you're a little bit unhappy the corners of your mouth turned down and you sniffle and if you're very unhappy tears pour down your face and you might sob valence means good or bad positive or negative so we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table you know the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger the more vigorously you try to swat it away and it seems to keep getting irritated so we built a device which we call a puff oh man in which we could deliver little grief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench and blow them away and what we found is that if we gave these flies in the puffs I'm at several puffs in a row they became somewhat hyperactive and continue to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped and took a while to come to calm down so we quantified this behavior using look custom locomotor tracking software developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona who's in the electrical engineering division here Caltech and what this quantification showed us is that upon experiencing a train of these air puffs the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyper activity which is persistent long lasting and also appears to be graded more puffs or more intense puffs make the state last for a longer period of time so now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state so we decided to use our puffs a mat and our automated tracking software to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs and this is one of the great things about fruit flies there are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation so doing this screen we discovered one mutant that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor that's right flies like people have dopamine and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and I have dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain including an attention arousal reward and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse Parkinson's disease and ADHD now in genetics it's a little counterintuitive we tend to infer the normal function of something by what doesn't happen when we take it away by the opposite of what we see when we take it away so when we take away the dopamine receptor and the Flies take longer to calm down from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine is to cause the Flies to calm down faster after the puffs and that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans indeed if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies by feeding them cocaine after getting the appropriate DEA license oh my god we find indeed that these cocaine fed flies calm down faster than normal flies do and that's also reminiscent of ADHD which is often treated with drugs like ritalin that act similarly to cocaine so slowly I began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder now how far does this analogy go as many of you know individuals afflicted with ADHD also have learning disabilities is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies remarkably the answer is yes as Seymour showed back in the 1970s flies like songbirds as you just heard are capable of learning you can train a fly to avoid an odor shown here in blue if you pair that odor with a shock then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose between a tube with the shock paired odor and another odor it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock well if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies they don't learn their learning score is zero they flunk out of Caltech now so that means that these flies have two abnormalities or phenotypes as we geneticists call them that one finds an ADHD hyperactivity and learning disability now what's the causal relationship if anything between these phenotypes in ADHD it's often assumed that the hyperactivity causes the learning disability the kids can't sit still long enough to focus so they don't learn but it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities that caused the hyperactivity because the kids can't learn they look for other things to distract their attention and a final possibility is that there no relationship at all between learning disabilities and hyperactivity but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD now people have been wondering about this for a long time in humans but in flies we can actually test this and the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics we take our dopamine receptor mutant flies and we genetically restore or cure the dopamine receptor by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene back into the fly brain but in each fly we put it back only into certain neurons and not in others and then we test each of their these flies for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity remarkably we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities if we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back in this elliptical structure called the central complex the Flies are no longer hyperactive but they still can't learn on the other hand if we put the receptor back in a different structure called the mushroom body the learning deficit is rescued the Flies learn well but they're still hyperactive what that tells us is that dopamine is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup rather it's acting to control two different functions on two different circuits so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies that the same receptor is controlling two different functions in two different regions of the brain whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans we don't know but these kinds of results should at least cause us to consider that possibility so these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup and it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders just by changing the flavor of the soup what we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge to try to design a new generation of treatments that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders if we can do that we may be able to cure these disorders without the unpleasant side effects putting the oil back in our metal engines just where it's needed thank you very much

**Transcript**:
so raise your hand if you know someone in your immediate family or circle of friends who suffers from some form of mental illness I thought so not surprised and raise your hand if you think that basic research on fruit flies has anything to do with understanding mental illness and humans yeah I thought so I'm also not surprised I can see I got my work cut out for me here as we heard from dr. ensel this morning psychiatric disorders like autism depression and schizophrenia take a terrible toll on human suffering we know much less about their treatment and the understanding of their basic mechanisms than we do about diseases of the body think about it in 2013 the second decade of the millennium if you're concerned about a cancer diagnosis and you go to your doctor you get bone scans biopsies and blood tests in 2013 if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis you go to your doctor and what do you get a questionnaire part of the reason for this is that we have an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders we tend to view them and the popular press aids and abets this view as chemical imbalances in the brain as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup full of dopamine serotonin and norepinephrine this view is conditioned by the fact that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders like prozac act by globally changing brain chemistry as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup but that can't be the answer because these drugs actually don't work all that well a lot of people won't take them or stop taking them because of their unpleasant side effects these drugs have so many side effects because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder is a bit like trying to change your engine oil by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block some of it will dribble into the right place but a lot of it will do more harm than good now an emerging view that you also heard about from dr. ensel this morning is that psychiatric disorders are actually disturbances of neural circuits that mediate emotion mood and affect when we think about cognition we analogize the brain to a computer that's no problem well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion it's just that we don't tend to think about it that way but we know we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatric disorders because of the overwhelming dominance of this chemical imbalance hypothesis now it's not that chemicals are not important in psychiatric disorders it's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup rather they're released in very specific locations and they act on specific synapses to change the flow of information in the brain so if we ever really want to understand the biological basis of psychiatric disorders we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain where these chemicals act otherwise we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences now to begin to overcome our ignorant of the role of brain chemistry and brain circuitry it's helpful to work on what we biologists call model organisms animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to molecularly identify and pinpoint specific classes of neurons as you heard about an Alan Jones's talk this morning moreover once we can do that we can actually activate specific neurons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons so if we inhibit a particular type of neuron and we find that a behavior is blocked we can conclude that those neurons are necessary for that behavior on the other hand if we activate a group of neurons and we find that that produces behavior we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior so in this way by doing this kind of tests we can draw cause-and-effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particularly havior something that is extremely difficult if not impossible to do right now in humans but can an organism like a fruit fly which is it's a great model organism because it's got a small brain it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors it breeds quickly and it's cheap but can an organism like this teach us anything about emotion like states do these ordinance even have emotion like States or are they just little digital robots Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behaviors as he wrote in his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals and my eponymous colleague Seymour Benzer believed it as well Seymour is the man that introduced the use of Drosophila here at Caltech in the 60s as a model organism to study the connection between genes and behavior seem were recruited me to Caltech in the late 1980s he was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here and Seymour taught me both to love flies and also to play with science so how do we how do we ask this question it's one thing to believe that flies have emotion like States but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not now in humans we often infer emotional states as you'll hear later today from facial expressions however it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies it's kind of like landing on Mars and looking out the window of your spaceship at all the little green men who are surrounding it and trying to figure out how do I find out if they have emotions or not what can we do it's not so easy well one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion like states such as arousal and see if we can identify any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties so three important ones that I can think of our persistence gradations and intensity and valence persistence means long lasting we all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone rotations of intensity means what it sounds like you can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of emotion of an emotion if you're a little bit unhappy the corners of your mouth turned down and you sniffle and if you're very unhappy tears pour down your face and you might sob valence means good or bad positive or negative so we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table you know the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger the more vigorously you try to swat it away and it seems to keep getting irritated so we built a device which we call a puff oh man in which we could deliver little grief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench and blow them away and what we found is that if we gave these flies in the puffs I'm at several puffs in a row they became somewhat hyperactive and continue to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped and took a while to come to calm down so we quantified this behavior using look custom locomotor tracking software developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona who's in the electrical engineering division here Caltech and what this quantification showed us is that upon experiencing a train of these air puffs the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyper activity which is persistent long lasting and also appears to be graded more puffs or more intense puffs make the state last for a longer period of time so now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state so we decided to use our puffs a mat and our automated tracking software to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs and this is one of the great things about fruit flies there are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation so doing this screen we discovered one mutant that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor that's right flies like people have dopamine and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and I have dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain including an attention arousal reward and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse Parkinson's disease and ADHD now in genetics it's a little counterintuitive we tend to infer the normal function of something by what doesn't happen when we take it away by the opposite of what we see when we take it away so when we take away the dopamine receptor and the Flies take longer to calm down from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine is to cause the Flies to calm down faster after the puffs and that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans indeed if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies by feeding them cocaine after getting the appropriate DEA license oh my god we find indeed that these cocaine fed flies calm down faster than normal flies do and that's also reminiscent of ADHD which is often treated with drugs like ritalin that act similarly to cocaine so slowly I began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder now how far does this analogy go as many of you know individuals afflicted with ADHD also have learning disabilities is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies remarkably the answer is yes as Seymour showed back in the 1970s flies like songbirds as you just heard are capable of learning you can train a fly to avoid an odor shown here in blue if you pair that odor with a shock then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose between a tube with the shock paired odor and another odor it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock well if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies they don't learn their learning score is zero they flunk out of Caltech now so that means that these flies have two abnormalities or phenotypes as we geneticists call them that one finds an ADHD hyperactivity and learning disability now what's the causal relationship if anything between these phenotypes in ADHD it's often assumed that the hyperactivity causes the learning disability the kids can't sit still long enough to focus so they don't learn but it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities that caused the hyperactivity because the kids can't learn they look for other things to distract their attention and a final possibility is that there no relationship at all between learning disabilities and hyperactivity but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD now people have been wondering about this for a long time in humans but in flies we can actually test this and the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics we take our dopamine receptor mutant flies and we genetically restore or cure the dopamine receptor by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene back into the fly brain but in each fly we put it back only into certain neurons and not in others and then we test each of their these flies for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity remarkably we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities if we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back in this elliptical structure called the central complex the Flies are no longer hyperactive but they still can't learn on the other hand if we put the receptor back in a different structure called the mushroom body the learning deficit is rescued the Flies learn well but they're still hyperactive what that tells us is that dopamine is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup rather it's acting to control two different functions on two different circuits so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies that the same receptor is controlling two different functions in two different regions of the brain whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans we don't know but these kinds of results should at least cause us to consider that possibility so these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup and it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders just by changing the flavor of the soup what we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge to try to design a new generation of treatments that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders if we can do that we may be able to cure these disorders without the unpleasant side effects putting the oil back in our metal engines just where it's needed thank you very much

hyperactive and continue to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped and took a while to come to calm down so we quantified this behavior using look custom locomotor tracking software developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona who's in the electrical engineering division here Caltech and what this quantification showed us is that upon experiencing a train of these air puffs the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyper activity which is persistent long lasting and also appears to be graded more puffs or more intense puffs make the state last for a longer period of time so now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state so we decided to use our puffs a mat and our automated tracking software to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs and this is one of the great things about fruit flies there are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation so doing this screen we discovered one mutant that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor that's right flies like people have dopamine and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and I have dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain including an attention arousal reward and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse Parkinson's disease and ADHD now in genetics it's a little counterintuitive we tend to infer the normal function of something by what doesn't happen when we take it away by the opposite of what we see when we take it away so when we take away the dopamine receptor and the Flies take longer to calm down from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine is to cause the Flies to calm down faster after the puffs and that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans indeed if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies by feeding them cocaine after getting the appropriate DEA license oh my god we find indeed that these cocaine fed flies calm down faster than normal flies do and that's also reminiscent of ADHD which is often treated with drugs like ritalin that act similarly to cocaine so slowly I began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder now how far does this analogy go as many of you know individuals afflicted with ADHD also have learning disabilities is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies remarkably the answer is yes as Seymour showed back in the 1970s flies like songbirds as you just heard are capable of learning you can train a fly to avoid an odor shown here in blue if you pair that odor with a shock then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose between a tube with the shock paired odor and another odor it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock well if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies they don't learn their learning score is zero they flunk out of Caltech now so that means that these flies have two abnormalities or phenotypes as we geneticists call them that one finds an ADHD hyperactivity and learning disability now what's the causal relationship if anything between these phenotypes in ADHD it's often assumed that the hyperactivity causes the learning disability the kids can't sit still long enough to focus so they don't learn but it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities that caused the hyperactivity because the kids can't learn they look for other things to distract their attention and a final possibility is that there no relationship at all between learning disabilities and hyperactivity but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD now people have been wondering about this for a long time in humans but in flies we can actually test this and the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics we take our dopamine receptor mutant flies and we genetically restore or cure the dopamine receptor by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene back into the fly brain but in each fly we put it back only into certain neurons and not in others and then we test each of their these flies for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity remarkably we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities if we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back in this elliptical structure called the central complex the Flies are no longer hyperactive but they still can't learn on the other hand if we put the receptor back in a different structure called the mushroom body the learning deficit is rescued the Flies learn well but they're still hyperactive what that tells us is that dopamine is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup rather it's acting to control two different functions on two different circuits so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies that the same receptor is controlling two different functions in two different regions of the brain whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans we don't know but these kinds of results should at least cause us to consider that possibility so these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup and it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders just by changing the flavor of the soup what we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge to try to design a new generation of treatments that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders if we can do that we may be able to cure these disorders without the unpleasant side effects putting the oil back in our metal engines just where

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is related to the concept of persistence in emotion-like states.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the definition of persistence in relation to emotion-like states. While there isn't a direct match, Question 4 mentions the result of the speaker's screen of hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies, which includes a finding related to persistence (i.e., "They found one mutant fly that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs."). However, this question does not directly ask about the definition of persistence.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the concept of persistence, I would suggest Question 4. However, please note that it is not a direct match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4

Please note that it would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that directly asks about the definition of persistence in relation to emotion-like states, rather than relying on a related but not identical question.

so raise your hand if you know someone in your immediate family or circle of friends who suffers from some form of mental illness I thought so not surprised and raise your hand if you think that basic research on fruit flies has anything to do with understanding mental illness and humans yeah I thought so I'm also not surprised I can see I got my work cut out for me here as we heard from dr. ensel this morning psychiatric disorders like autism depression and schizophrenia take a terrible toll on human suffering we know much less about their treatment and the understanding of their basic mechanisms than we do about diseases of the body think about it in 2013 the second decade of the millennium if you're concerned about a cancer diagnosis and you go to your doctor you get bone scans biopsies and blood tests in 2013 if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis you go to your doctor and what do you get a questionnaire part of the reason for this is that we have an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders we tend to view them and the popular press aids and abets this view as chemical imbalances in the brain as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup full of dopamine serotonin and norepinephrine this view is conditioned by the fact that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders like prozac act by globally changing brain chemistry as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup but that can't be the answer because these drugs actually don't work all that well a lot of people won't take them or stop taking them because of their unpleasant side effects these drugs have so many side effects because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder is a bit like trying to change your engine oil by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block some of it will dribble into the right place but a lot of it will do more harm than good now an emerging view that you also heard about from dr. ensel this morning is that psychiatric disorders are actually disturbances of neural circuits that mediate emotion mood and affect when we think about cognition we analogize the brain to a computer that's no problem well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion it's just that we don't tend to think about it that way but we know we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatric disorders because of the overwhelming dominance of this chemical imbalance hypothesis now it's not that chemicals are not important in psychiatric disorders it's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup rather they're released in very specific locations and they act on specific synapses to change the flow of information in the brain so if we ever really want to understand the biological basis of psychiatric disorders we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain where these chemicals act otherwise we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences now to begin to overcome our ignorant of the role of brain chemistry and brain circuitry it's helpful to work on what we biologists call model organisms animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to molecularly identify and pinpoint specific classes of neurons as you heard about an Alan Jones's talk this morning moreover once we can do that we can actually activate specific neurons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons so if we inhibit a particular type of neuron and we find that a behavior is blocked we can conclude that those neurons are necessary for that behavior on the other hand if we activate a group of neurons and we find that that produces behavior we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior so in this way by doing this kind of tests we can draw cause-and-effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particularly havior something that is extremely difficult if not impossible to do right now in humans but can an organism like a fruit fly which is it's a great model organism because it's got a small brain it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors it breeds quickly and it's cheap but can an organism like this teach us anything about emotion like states do these ordinance even have emotion like States or are they just little digital robots Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behaviors as he wrote in his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals and my eponymous colleague Seymour Benzer believed it as well Seymour is the man that introduced the use of Drosophila here at Caltech in the 60s as a model organism to study the connection between genes and behavior seem were recruited me to Caltech in the late 1980s he was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here and Seymour taught me both to love flies and also to play with science so how do we how do we ask this question it's one thing to believe that flies have emotion like States but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not now in humans we often infer emotional states as you'll hear later today from facial expressions however it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies it's kind of like landing on Mars and looking out the window of your spaceship at all the little green men who are surrounding it and trying to figure out how do I find out if they have emotions or not what can we do it's not so easy well one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion like states such as arousal and see if we can identify any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties so three important ones that I can think of our persistence gradations and intensity and valence persistence means long lasting we all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone rotations of intensity means what it sounds like you can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of emotion of an emotion if you're a little bit unhappy the corners of your mouth turned down and you sniffle and if you're very unhappy tears pour down your face and you might sob valence means good or bad positive or negative so we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table you know the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger the more vigorously you try to swat it away and it seems to keep getting irritated so we built a device which we call a puff oh man in which we could deliver little grief air puffs

to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench and blow them away and what we found is that if we gave these flies in the puffs I'm at several puffs in a row they became somewhat hyperactive and continue to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped and took a while to come to calm down so we quantified this behavior using look custom locomotor tracking software developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona who's in the electrical engineering division here Caltech and what this quantification showed us is that upon experiencing a train of these air puffs the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyper activity which is persistent long lasting and also appears to be graded more puffs or more intense puffs make the state last for a longer period of time so now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state so we decided to use our puffs a mat and our automated tracking software to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs and this is one of the great things about fruit flies there are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation so doing this screen we discovered one mutant that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor that's right flies like people have dopamine and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and I have dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain including an attention arousal reward and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse Parkinson's disease and ADHD now in genetics it's a little counterintuitive we tend to infer the normal function of something by what doesn't happen when we take it away by the opposite of what we see when we take it away so when we take away the dopamine receptor and the Flies take longer to calm down from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine is to cause the Flies to calm down faster after the puffs and that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans indeed if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies by feeding them cocaine after getting the appropriate DEA license oh my god we find indeed that these cocaine fed flies calm down faster than normal flies do and that's also reminiscent of ADHD which is often treated with drugs like ritalin that act similarly to cocaine so slowly I began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder now how far does this analogy go as many of you know individuals afflicted with ADHD also have learning disabilities is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies remarkably the answer is yes as Seymour showed back in the 1970s flies like songbirds as you just heard are capable of learning you can train a fly to avoid an odor shown here in blue if you pair that odor with a shock then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose between a tube with the shock paired odor and another odor it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock well if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies they don't learn their learning score is zero they flunk out of Caltech now so that means that these flies have two abnormalities or phenotypes as we geneticists call them that one finds an ADHD hyperactivity and learning disability now what's the causal relationship if anything between these phenotypes in ADHD it's often assumed that the hyperactivity causes the learning disability the kids can't sit still long enough to focus so they don't learn but it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities that caused the hyperactivity because the kids can't learn they look for other things to distract their attention and a final possibility is that there no relationship at all between learning disabilities and hyperactivity but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD now people have been wondering about this for a long time in humans but in flies we can actually test this and the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics we take our dopamine receptor mutant flies and we genetically restore or cure the dopamine receptor by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene back into the fly brain but in each fly we put it back only into certain neurons and not in others and then we test each of their these flies for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity remarkably we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities if we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back in this elliptical structure called the central complex the Flies are no longer hyperactive but they still can't learn on the other hand if we put the receptor back in a different structure called the mushroom body the learning deficit is rescued the Flies learn well but they're still hyperactive what that tells us is that dopamine is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup rather it's acting to control two different functions on two different circuits so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies that the same receptor is controlling two different functions in two different regions of the brain whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans we don't know but these kinds of results should at least cause us to consider that possibility so these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup and it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders just by changing the flavor of the soup what we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge to try to design a new generation of treatments that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders if we can do that we may be able to cure these disorders without the unpleasant side effects putting the oil back in our metal engines just where it's needed thank you very much

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

This question is about the result of the speaker's experiment where they genetically restored the dopamine receptor in the fly brain, which is related to the ground truth MCQ about what David Anderson and his team discovered in their tests with dopamine receptors in fruit flies. 

The correct option in Question 7 is not explicitly stated, but based on the ground truth MCQ, the correct answer would be a combination of options A and B, which is that the flies were no longer hyperactive but still couldn't learn when the receptor was restored in one part of the brain, and they learned well but were still hyperactive when it was restored in another part of the brain. 

This indicates that the same receptor controls two separate functions in two different regions of the brain, which is the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ. 

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 7.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] when I was considering a career in the art world I took a course in London and one of my supervisors was this IRAs Italian called Petro who drank too much smoked too much and swore much too much but he was a a passionate teacher and I remember one of our earlier classes with him he was projecting images on the wall asking us to to think about them and he put up an image of a painting it's a landscape with figures semi-dressed drinking wine there was a nude woman in the in the lower foreground and on on the hillside in the back there was a figure of the mythological God bacus and he said what is this and I no one else said so I put up my hand and I said it's a banal B Tian he said it's a what I thought maybe I pronounced it wrong it's a bar Canal by tishan he said it's a what I said it's a a bakanal bitian he said you both Bess Bookworm it's a orgy as I said he swore too much there was an important lesson for me in that Petro was suspicious of formal art training art history training because he was he feared that it filled people up with jargon and then they just classified things rather than looking at them and he wanted wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary and he wanted us to use our eyes and he was especially Evangelical about this message because he was losing his sight he wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects what is it how is it made why was it made how is it used and these were important lessons to me when I subse became a professional art historian my my kind of Eureka moment came a few years later when I was studying the art of the Courts of Northern Europe and of course it was very much uh discussed in terms of the paintings and the sculptures and the architecture of the day but as I began to read historical documents and contemporary descriptions I found there was a kind of a missing component for everywhere I came across descriptions of tapestries tapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages and really well into the 18th century and it was pretty apparent why tapestries were portable you could roll them up send them ahead of you and in the time it took to hang them up you could transform a cold dank interior into a richly colored setting tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be Associated or even themselves and in addition to that tapestries were hugely expensive they required scores of Highly skilled Weavers working over extended periods of time with very expensive materials the wools the silks even Gold and Silver Thread so all in all in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda well I became a a tapestry historian in due course I ended up as a curator at the Metropolitan Museum because I saw the Met as one of the few places where I could organize really big exhibitions about the subject I cared so passionately about and in about 1997 the then director Philipe deont belloo gave me the go-ahead to organize an exhibition for 2002 we normally have these very long leadin times it wasn't straightforward it's no longer a question of chucking a tapestry in the back of a car they have to be wound on huge rollers shipped in oversized Freight some of them were so big we had to to get them into the museum we had to take them up the the great steps at the front we thought very hard about how to present this Unknown Subject to a modern audience the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded the placing of Lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread the labeling you know we live in an age where we're so used to television images and photographs a one hit image these were big complex things of almost like cartoons with multiple narratives we had to draw our audience in get them to slow down to explore the objects there was a lot of skepticism on the opening night I overheard one of the senior members of Staff saying this is going to be a bomb but in reality in the course of the coming weeks and months hundreds of thousands of people came to see the show the exhibition was designed to be an experience and tapestr are hard to reproduce in photographs so I want you to use your imaginations thinking of these wall High objects some of them 10 m wide depicting lavish Court scenes with c and dandies who look quite at home in the pages of of the fashion Press today thick woods with Hunters crashing through the undergrowth in pursuit of wild boes and deer violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism I remember taking my son's school class he was eight at the time and all the little boys they kind of you know they were little boys and then the thing that caught their attention was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog pooping in the foreground kind of an iny face joke by the artist and there you just imagine them but it brought it alive to them I think they suddenly saw that these these weren't just old faded tapestries these were images of the world in the past and it was the same for our audience and for me as a curator I felt proud I I felt i' shift did the needle a little through this experience that could only be created in a museum i' opened up the eyes of my audience historians artists press the general public to the beauty of this of this lost medium a few years later I was invited to be the director of the museum and after I got over that who me the tapestry geek I don't wear a tie I realized in fact I believed passionately in that curated Museum experience we live in an age of ubiquitous information and sort of Just Add Water expertise but there is nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well- told narrative what the curator does the interpretation of a a complex esoteric subject in a way that retains the Integrity of the subject but makes it unpacks it for a general audience and that to me today is now the The Challenge and the fun of my of my job supporting the vision of my curators whether it's an exhibition of samurai swords early Byzantine artifacts Renaissance portraits or the show we heard mentioned earlier the Queen show with which we enjoyed so much success last summer that was an interesting case in the late spring early summer of of 2010 shortly after McQueen's suicide our curator of costume Andrew Bolton came to see me and and said I've been thinking of doing a show on McQueen and now is the moment we have to we have to do it fast it wasn't easy uh uh McQueen had worked throughout his career with a small team of designers and managers who were very protective of his legacy Pat Andrew went to London and worked with them over the summer and won their confidence and that of the designers who created his amazing fashion shows which were works of performance art in their own right and we proceeded to do something at the Museum I think we've never done before it wasn't just just standard installation in fact we RI down the galleries to recreate entirely different settings uh a recreation of his first Studio a Hall of Mirrors a curiosity box a sunken ship a burnt out interior with videos and soundtracks that range from operatic Aras to pigs fornicating and in this extraordinary setting the costumes were like actors and actresses or living sculptures it could have been a train wreck it could have looked like shot windows on Fifth Avenue at Christmas but because of the way that Andrew connected with the McQueen team he was channeling the rawness and the Brilliance of McQueen and the show was quite Transcendent and it became a phenomenon in in its own right by the end of the show we had people queuing for four or five hours to get into the show but no one really complained I heard over and over again wow that was worth it it was such a visceral emotive experience now I've described two very immersive exhibitions but I also believe that collections individual objects can also have that same power the Met was set up not as a museum of American art but of an encyclopedic Museum and today 140 years later that vision is as preent as ever because of course we live in a world of crisis of Challenge and we're exposed to it through the 24/7 news reels it's in our galleries that we can unpack the the civilizations the cultures that that we are seeing the current manifestation of whether it's Libya Egypt Syria it's in our galleries that we can explain and give greater understanding I mean our new Islamic galleries are a case in point opened 10 years almost to the week after 911 I think for most Americans knowledge of the uh Islamic world was pretty slight before 9/11 and then it was thrust upon us in one of America's Darkest Hours and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event now in our galleries we Show 14 centuries of the development of different Islamic cultures across ofast Geographic spread and again hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last October I I'm often asked is digital media replacing the museum and I think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion I mean don't get me wrong I'm I'm a huge advocate of the web it gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe but nothing replaces the authenticity of the object presented with passion scholarship bringing people face to face with our objects is a way of bringing them face to face with people across time across space whose lives may have been very different to our own but who like us had hopes and dreams frustrations and achievements in their lives and I think this is a process that helps us better understand our ourselves helps us make better decisions about where we're going the Great Hall at the Met is one of the great portals of the world or inspiring like a medieval Cathedral from there you can walk in any direction to almost any culture i frequently go out into the Hall in the Galleries and I watch our visitors coming in some of them are comfortable they feel at home they know what they're looking for others are very uneasy it's an intimidating place they feel that the institution is elitist I'm working to try and break down that sense of that elitism I want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind where they're prepared to be a little bit lost to explore to see the UNF familiar in the familiar or to try the unknown because for us it's all about bringing them face to face with great works of art capturing them at that moment of discomfort when the inclination is kind of to reach for your iPhone or your blackberry but to create a Zone where their curiosity can expand and whether it's in the the expression of a Greek sculpture that reminds you of a friend or a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry or to be bring it back to my tutor Petro those dancing figures who are indeed knocking back the wine and that nude figure in the left foreground wow she is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality in that moment our scholarship can tell you that this is a banal but if we're doing our job right and you've checked the Jaron at the front door trust your instinct you know it's an orgy thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] when I was considering a career in the art world I took a course in London and one of my supervisors was this IRAs Italian called Petro who drank too much smoked too much and swore much too much but he was a a passionate teacher and I remember one of our earlier classes with him he was projecting images on the wall asking us to to think about them and he put up an image of a painting it's a landscape with figures semi-dressed drinking wine there was a nude woman in the in the lower foreground and on on the hillside in the back there was a figure of the mythological God bacus and he said what is this and I no one else said so I put up my hand and I said it's a banal B Tian he said it's a what I thought maybe I pronounced it wrong it's a bar Canal by tishan he said it's a what I said it's a a bakanal bitian he said you both Bess Bookworm it's a orgy as I said he swore too much there was an important lesson for me in that Petro was suspicious of formal art training art history training because he was he feared that it filled people up with jargon and then they just classified things rather than looking at them and he wanted wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary and he wanted us to use our eyes and he was especially Evangelical about this message because he was losing his sight he wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects what is it how is it made why was it made how is it used and these were important lessons to me when I subse became a professional art historian my my kind of Eureka moment came a few years later when I was studying the art of the Courts of Northern Europe and of course it was very much uh discussed in terms of the paintings and the sculptures and the architecture of the day but as I began to read historical documents and contemporary descriptions I found there was a kind of a missing component for everywhere I came across descriptions of tapestries tapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages and really well into the 18th century and it was pretty apparent why tapestries were portable you could roll them up send them ahead of you and in the time it took to hang them up you could transform a cold dank interior into a richly colored setting tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be Associated or even themselves and in addition to that tapestries were hugely expensive they required scores of Highly skilled Weavers working over extended periods of time with very expensive materials the wools the silks even Gold and Silver Thread so all in all in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda well I became a a tapestry historian in due course I ended up as a curator at the Metropolitan Museum because I saw the Met as one of the few places where I could organize really big exhibitions about the subject I cared so passionately about and in about 1997 the then director Philipe deont belloo gave me the go-ahead to organize an exhibition for 2002 we normally have these very long leadin times it wasn't

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] when I was considering a career in the art world I took a course in London and one of my supervisors was this IRAs Italian called Petro who drank too much smoked too much and swore much too much but he was a a passionate teacher and I remember one of our earlier classes with him he was projecting images on the wall asking us to to think about them and he put up an image of a painting it's a landscape with figures semi-dressed drinking wine there was a nude woman in the in the lower foreground and on on the hillside in the back there was a figure of the mythological God bacus and he said what is this and I no one else said so I put up my hand and I said it's a banal B Tian he said it's a what I thought maybe I pronounced it wrong it's a bar Canal by tishan he said it's a what I said it's a a bakanal bitian he said you both Bess Bookworm it's a orgy as I said he swore too much there was an important lesson for me in that Petro was suspicious of formal art training art history training because he was he feared that it filled people up with jargon and then they just classified things rather than looking at them and he wanted wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary and he wanted us to use our eyes and he was especially Evangelical about this message because he was losing his sight he wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects what is it how is it made why was it made how is it used and these were important lessons to me when I subse became a professional art historian my my kind of Eureka moment came a few years later when I was studying the art of the Courts of Northern Europe and of course it was very much uh discussed in terms of the paintings and the sculptures and the architecture of the day but as I began to read historical documents and contemporary descriptions I found there was a kind of a missing component for everywhere I came across descriptions of tapestries tapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages and really well into the 18th century and it was pretty apparent why tapestries were portable you could roll them up send them ahead of you and in the time it took to hang them up you could transform a cold dank interior into a richly colored setting tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be Associated or even themselves and in addition to that tapestries were hugely expensive they required scores of Highly skilled Weavers working over extended periods of time with very expensive materials the wools the silks even Gold and Silver Thread so all in all in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda well I became a a tapestry historian in due course I ended up as a curator at the Metropolitan Museum because I saw the Met as one of the few places where I could organize really big exhibitions about the subject I cared so passionately about and in about 1997 the then director Philipe deont belloo gave me the go-ahead to organize an exhibition for 2002 we normally have these very long leadin times it wasn't straightforward it's no longer a question of chucking a tapestry in the back of a car they have to be wound on huge rollers shipped in oversized Freight some of them were so big we had to to get them into the museum we had to take them up the the great steps at the front we thought very hard about how to present this Unknown Subject to a modern audience the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded the placing of Lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread the labeling you know we live in an age where we're so used to television images and photographs a one hit image these were big complex things of almost like cartoons with multiple narratives we had to draw our audience in get them to slow down to explore the objects there was a lot of skepticism on the opening night I overheard one of the senior members of Staff saying this is going to be a bomb but in reality in the course of the coming weeks and months hundreds of thousands of people came to see the show the exhibition was designed to be an experience and tapestr are hard to reproduce in photographs so I want you to use your imaginations thinking of these wall High objects some of them 10 m wide depicting lavish Court scenes with c and dandies who look quite at home in the pages of of the fashion Press today thick woods with Hunters crashing through the undergrowth in pursuit of wild boes and deer violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism I remember taking my son's school class he was eight at the time and all the little boys they kind of you know they were little boys and then the thing that caught their attention was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog pooping in the foreground kind of an iny face joke by the artist and there you just imagine them but it brought it alive to them I think they suddenly saw that these these weren't just old faded tapestries these were images of the world in the past and it was the same for our audience and for me as a curator I felt proud I I felt i' shift did the needle a little through this experience that could only be created in a museum i' opened up the eyes of my audience historians artists press the general public to the beauty of this of this lost medium a few years later I was invited to be the director of the museum and after I got over that who me the tapestry geek I don't wear a tie I realized in fact I believed passionately in that curated Museum experience we live in an age of ubiquitous information and sort of Just Add Water expertise but there is nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well- told narrative what the curator does the interpretation of a a complex esoteric subject in a way that retains the Integrity of the subject but makes it unpacks it for a general audience and that to me today is now the The Challenge and the fun of my of my job supporting the vision of my curators whether it's an exhibition of samurai swords early Byzantine artifacts Renaissance portraits or the show we heard mentioned earlier the Queen show with which we enjoyed so much success last summer that was an interesting case in the late spring early summer of of 2010 shortly after McQueen's suicide our curator of costume Andrew Bolton came to see me and and said I've been thinking of doing a show on McQueen and now is the moment we have to we have to do it fast it wasn't easy uh uh McQueen had worked throughout his career with a small team of designers and managers who were very protective of his legacy Pat Andrew went to London and worked with them over the summer and won their confidence and that of the designers who created his amazing fashion shows which were works of performance art in their own right and we proceeded to do something at the Museum I think we've never done before it wasn't just just standard installation in fact we RI down the galleries to recreate entirely different settings uh a recreation of his first Studio a Hall of Mirrors a curiosity box a sunken ship a burnt out interior with videos and soundtracks that range from operatic Aras to pigs fornicating and in this extraordinary setting the costumes were like actors and actresses or living sculptures it could have been a train wreck it could have looked like shot windows on Fifth Avenue at Christmas but because of the way that Andrew connected with the McQueen team he was channeling the rawness and the Brilliance of McQueen and the show was quite Transcendent and it became a phenomenon in in its own right by the end of the show we had people queuing for four or five hours to get into the show but no one really complained I heard over and over again wow that was worth it it was such a visceral emotive experience now I've described two very immersive exhibitions but I also believe that collections individual objects can also have that same power the Met was set up not as a museum of American art but of an encyclopedic Museum and today 140 years later that vision is as preent as ever because of course we live in a world of crisis of Challenge and we're exposed to it through the 24/7 news reels it's in our galleries that we can

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Earwig, an insect, generally classified within the order dermaptera. The common name of the insects we know as earwigs is exactly that, common, and is based mainly in folklore. It's rumored that these so-called earwigs crawl into your ear at night and tunnel into your brain, but this is false. Sure, an earwig may, on rare occasion, climb into the ear of an unsuspecting sleeper, but, really, who can blame them? Ear canals are warm and dark, the perfect home for a creepy-crawly like this one. The important thing to remember is that even if an earwig found its way into your ear, it would never eat through your eardrum. Despite the erroneous origins of these trumped-up folk tales, they've been in place a long time. The word earwig comes from the Old English word earwicga, a compound of ear, meaning ear, of course, and wigca. Scholars believe that wigca shares a root with words like wiggle and wag, and that it most likely referred to a creature that moves quickly. Unfortunately for this innocent little insect, even its scientific name gives it a bad rap. Because of the large, pencil-like cerci on the tail and of its abdomen, scientists associate earwigs with a pair of scissors, calling them forficula auricularia, literally little scissors of the ear.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby One of the reasons that I'm fascinated by the ocean is that it's really an alien world on our own planet. From our perspective, sitting on the shoreline or even out on a boat, we're given only the tiniest glimpses at the real action that's happening beneath the surface of the waves. And even if you were able to go down there, you wouldn't see very much because light doesn't travel very far in the ocean. So, to answer questions about how the ocean works, in my research, we use sound. We use sonars that send out pulses of sound made up of a number of different frequencies, or pitches, that are shown with different colors. That sound bounces off things in the habitat and comes back to us. If it were to bounce off this dolphin, the signal we got back would look very much like the one we sent out where all the colors are represented pretty evenly. However, if we were to bounce that same sound off of a squid, which in this case is about the same size as that dolphin, we'd instead only get the lowest frequencies back strongly, shown here in the red. And if we were to look at the prey of that squid, the tiny little krill that they're eating, we would instead only get the highest frequencies back. And so by looking at this, we can tell what kinds of animals are in the ocean, we can look at how dense they are, where they are distributed, look at their interactions and even their behavior to start to study the ecology of the ocean. When we do that, we come up with something sort of surprising: on average, there isn't very much food in the ocean. So even in places which we think of as rich, the coasts, we're talking about two parts of every million contain food. So what does that mean? Well, that means that in the volume of this theater, there would be one tub of movie theater popcorn available to be eaten. But of course, it wouldn't be collected for you neatly in this bucket. Instead, you'd actually have to be swimming through this entire volume Willy Wonka style, picking off individual kernels of popcorn, or perhaps if you were lucky, getting a hold of a few small clumps. But, of course, if you were in the ocean, this popcorn wouldn't be sitting here waiting for you to eat it. It would, instead, be trying to avoid becoming your dinner. So I want to know how do animals solve this challenge? We're going to talk about animals in the Bering Sea. This is where you may have see "Deadliest Catch" framed, in the northernmost part of the Pacific Ocean. We've been looking specifically at krill, one of the most important food items in this habitat. These half-inch long shrimp-like critters are about the caloric equivalent of a heavily buttered kernel of popcorn. And they're eaten by everything from birds and fur seals that pick them up one at a time to large whales that engulf them in huge mouthfuls. So I'm going to focus in the area around three breeding colonies for birds and fur seals in the southeastern Bering Sea. And this is a map of that habitat that we made making maps of food the way we've always made maps of food. This is how many krill are in this area of the ocean. Red areas represent lots of krill and purple basically none. And you can see that around the northern two most islands, which are highlighted with white circles because they are so tiny, it looks like there's a lot of food to be eaten. And yet, the fur seals and birds on these islands are crashing. Their populations are declining despite decades of protection. And while on that southern island at the very bottom of the screen it doesn't look like there's anything to eat, those populations are doing incredibly well. So this left us with a dilemma. Our observations of food don't make any sense in the context of our observations of these animals. So we started to think about how we could do this differently. And this map shows not how many krill there are, but how many clumps of krill there are, how aggregated are they. And what you get is a very different picture of the landscape. Now that southern island looks like a pretty good place to be, and when we combine this with other information about prey, it starts to explain the population observations. But we can also ask that question differently. We can have the animals tell us what's important. By tagging and tracking these animals and looking at how they use this habitat, we are able to say, "What matters to you?" about the prey. And what they've told us is that how many krill there are really isn't important. It is how closely spaced those krill are because that's how they are able to make a living. We see the same pattern when we look in very different ocean, further south in the Pacific, in the warm waters around the Hawaiian islands. So a very different habitat, and yet the same story. Under some conditions, the physics and the nutrients, the fertilizer, set up aggregations in the plants, the phytoplankton. And when that happens, these very dense aggregations of phytoplankton attract their predators, which themselves form very dense layers. That changes the behavior and distribution of their predators as well, starting to set up how this entire ecosystem functions. Finally, the predators that eat these small fish, shrimp, and squid, we're talking about two- to three-inch long prey here, changes how they use their habitat and how they forage. And so we see changes in the spinner dolphins that are related to the changes we're seeing in the plant life. And just by measuring the plants, we can actually predict very well what's going to happen in the top predator three steps away in the food web. But what's interesting is that even the densest aggregations of their prey aren't enough for spinner dolphins to make it. It's a pretty tough life there in the ocean. So these animals actually work together to herd their prey into even denser aggregations, starting with patches that they find in the first place. And that's what you're going to see in this visualization. We have a group of 20 dolphins, you notice they're all set up in pairs, that are working together to basically bulldoze prey to accumulate it on top of itself. And once they do that, they form a circle around that prey to maintain that really dense patch that is a couple thousand times higher density than the background that they started with before individual pairs of dolphins start to take turns feeding inside this circle of prey that they've created. And so, this work is showing us that animals can first give us the answers that aggregation is critical to how they make their living. And by looking more deeply at the ocean, we're starting to understand our interactions with it and finding more effective ways of conserving it. Thank you.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby One of the reasons that I'm fascinated by the ocean is that it's really an alien world on our own planet. From our perspective, sitting on the shoreline or even out on a boat, we're given only the tiniest glimpses at the real action that's happening beneath the surface of the waves. And even if you were able to go down there, you wouldn't see very much because light doesn't travel very far in the ocean. So, to answer questions about how the ocean works, in my research, we use sound. We use sonars that send out pulses of sound made up of a number of different frequencies, or pitches, that are shown with different colors. That sound bounces off things in the habitat and comes back to us. If it were to bounce off this dolphin, the signal we got back would look very much like the one we sent out where all the colors are represented pretty evenly. However, if we were to bounce that same sound off of a squid, which in this case is about the same size as that dolphin, we'd instead only get the lowest frequencies back strongly, shown here in the red. And if we were to look at the prey of that squid, the tiny little krill that they're eating, we would instead only get the highest frequencies back. And so by looking at this, we can tell what kinds of animals are in the ocean, we can look at how dense they are, where they are distributed, look at their interactions and even their behavior to start to study the ecology of the ocean. When we do that, we come up with something sort of surprising: on average, there isn't very much food in the ocean. So even in places which we think of as rich, the coasts, we're talking about two parts of every million contain food. So what does that mean? Well, that means that in the volume of this theater, there would be one tub of movie theater popcorn available to be eaten. But of course, it wouldn't be collected for you neatly in this bucket. Instead, you'd actually have to be swimming through this entire volume Willy Wonka style, picking off individual kernels of popcorn, or perhaps if you were lucky, getting a hold of a few small clumps. But, of course, if you were in the ocean, this popcorn wouldn't be sitting here waiting for you to eat it. It would, instead, be trying to avoid becoming your dinner. So I want to know how do animals solve this challenge? We're going to talk about animals in the Bering Sea. This is where you may have see "Deadliest Catch" framed, in the northernmost part of the Pacific Ocean. We've been looking specifically at krill, one of the most important food items in this habitat. These half-inch long shrimp-like critters are about the caloric equivalent of a heavily buttered kernel of popcorn. And they're eaten by everything from birds and fur seals that pick them up one at a time to large whales that engulf them in huge mouthfuls. So I'm going to focus in the area around three breeding colonies for birds and fur seals in the southeastern Bering Sea. And this is a map of that habitat that we made making maps of food the way we've always made maps of food. This is how many krill are in this area of the ocean. Red areas represent lots of krill and purple basically none. And you can see that around the northern two most islands, which are highlighted with white circles because they are so tiny, it looks like there's a lot of food to be eaten. And yet, the fur seals and birds on these islands are crashing. Their populations are declining despite decades of protection. And while on that southern island at the very bottom of the screen it doesn't look like there's anything to eat, those populations are doing incredibly well. So this left us with a dilemma. Our observations of food don't make any sense in the context of our observations of these animals. So we started to think about how we could do this differently. And this map shows not how many krill there are, but how many clumps of krill there are, how aggregated are they. And what you get is a very different picture of the landscape. Now that southern island looks like a pretty good place to be, and when we combine this with other information about prey, it starts to explain the population observations. But we can also ask that question differently. We can have the animals tell us what's important. By tagging and tracking these animals and looking at how they use this habitat, we are able to say, "What matters to you?" about the prey. And what they've told us is that how many krill there are really isn't important. It is how closely spaced those krill are because that's how they are able to make a living. We see the same pattern when we look in very different ocean, further south in the Pacific, in the warm waters around the Hawaiian islands. So a very different habitat, and yet the same story. Under some conditions, the physics and the nutrients, the fertilizer, set up aggregations in the plants, the phytoplankton. And when that happens, these very dense aggregations of phytoplankton attract their predators, which themselves form very dense layers. That changes the behavior and distribution of their predators as well, starting to set up how this entire ecosystem functions. Finally, the predators that eat these small fish, shrimp, and squid, we're talking about two- to three-inch long prey here, changes how they use their habitat and how they forage. And so we see changes in the spinner dolphins that are related to the changes we're seeing in the plant life. And just by measuring the plants, we can actually predict very well what's going to happen in the top predator three steps away in the food web. But what's interesting is that even the densest aggregations of their prey aren't enough for spinner dolphins to make it. It's a pretty tough life there in the ocean. So these animals actually work together to herd their prey into even denser aggregations, starting with patches that they find in the first place. And that's what you're going to see in this visualization. We have a group of 20 dolphins, you notice they're all set up in pairs, that are working together to basically bulldoze prey to accumulate it on top of itself. And once they do that, they form a circle around that prey to maintain that really dense patch that is a couple thousand times higher density than the background that they started with before individual pairs of dolphins start to take turns feeding inside this circle of prey that they've created. And so, this work is showing us that animals can first give us the answers that aggregation is critical to how they make their living. And by looking more deeply at the ocean, we're starting to understand our interactions with it and finding more effective ways of conserving it. Thank you.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the color(s) that the sonar returns if it bounces off a group of krill. Although none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 2 mentions the use of sonars that send out pulses of sound, which is related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more relevant question would be one that asks about the characteristics of the sonar signal when it bounces off different objects, such as krill. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask this question.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 2, but with the caveat that it is not a direct match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2

Please note that this is not a direct match, and a new generated MCQ that asks about the color(s) of the sonar signal when it bounces off krill would be a more accurate match.

**Transcript**:
We all know that there are certain virtues that are good for us. Intelligence, wisdom, bravery, justice, respect, responsibility, honesty, unselfishness, compassion, patience, and perseverance always have been and always will be positive virtues. Think of some people who have those traits. Maybe it's Martin Luther King or Abraham Lincoln or George Washington. I bet you know a lot of facts about these historical figures, but maybe you've never taken the time to think about their character. Let's talk about Sybil Ludington. She's a little-known revolutionary figure, but boy, was she something! She rode 40 miles through the damp, cold night of April 26, 1777 to alert the colonial militia of a British attack. Her action was similar to that of Paul Revere, only she rode twice as far and was only 16 years old. That takes some real guts! Beriah Green? Anyone ever heard of Beriah Green? He was president of the first integrated school in the United States. He also spent the majority of his life fighting for the immediate abolition of slavery. He used his voice, pen, and good deed to fight slavery. Beriah Green was fiercely devoted to abolition before it was popular because he believed it was the right thing to do. And then there's Abraham Lincoln. You know he was president during the Civil War. He wrote the Emancipation Proclaimation and is credited with freeing the slaves. He went to war with the South to save the Union. He helped the country get through one of its most difficult times. He kept the United States united. But, above all that, Abraham Lincoln showed great leadership. Could any of these people have done the deeds they're famous for without bravery, compassion, dedication, or wisdom? No! History can teach us much more than just the facts. It's full of examples of how to live better. And for you, even if you're not freeing the slaves or riding 40 miles on horseback, bravery and wisdom will help you get an A on that test, ask out that cute boy, and get that great job.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the definition of a virtue, while the generated MCQs are focused on specific historical figures and events mentioned in the transcript.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the overall theme of the transcript, I would say that Question 8 is the closest match. Question 8 asks about what history can teach us, and one of the options (B. How to live better) is related to the idea of virtues and moral values. Nevertheless, it's still a stretch to consider Question 8 as a match for the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would say that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ, and a new question that specifically asks about the definition of a virtue would be needed to match the ground truth MCQ.

Index: None (or 8, if we consider a loose connection)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, based on the available options, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match.

Question 6 asks about Abraham Lincoln's war with the South during the Civil War, which is related to the topic of demonstrating virtues, as seen in the ground truth MCQ. Although it does not specifically ask about George Washington or the virtue of intelligence, it is the closest match in terms of discussing historical figures and their actions.

However, it's essential to note that the generated MCQs do not directly address the virtues demonstrated by historical figures, as seen in the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **6**

Please note that this is not an ideal match, and a more accurate match would require generated MCQs that directly address the virtues demonstrated by historical figures.

**Transcript**:
so it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language it has generated considerable insight in physics in biology and in economics but not that much in the humanities and in history I think there's the belief that is just impossible that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind but you cannot measure history but I don't think that's right I want to show you a couple of examples why so my collaborator Aires and I were considering the flow in fact the two kings separated by centuries will speak a very different language that's a powerful historical force so the king of England after the great will use the vocabulary and grammar that is quite different from the king of hip-hop jay-z now it's just the way it is language changes over time and it's a powerful force so Aries and I wanted to know more about that so we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule past tense conjugation so you just add eg to a verb at the end to signify the past today I walk yesterday I walked but some verbs are irregular yesterday I thought well now what's interesting about that is irregular verbs between Alfred and JZ have become more regular like the verb to Wed that you see here has become regular so everything I followed the fate of over 100 irregular verbs through 12 centuries of English language and we saw that there's actually a very simple mathematical pattern that captures this complex historical change namely if a verb is a hundred times more frequent than another it regularizes ten times slower that's a piece of history but it comes in a mathematical wrapping now in some cases math can even help explain or proposed explanations for historical forces so here's chief tinker and I were considering the magnitude of Wars during the last two centuries there's actually a well known regularity to them where the number of wars that are hundred times deadlier is ten times smaller so there are thirty wars that are about as deadly as the six days war there's only four wars that are 100 times deadlier like world war 1 so what kind of historical mechanism can produce that what's the region of this so Steve and I through mathematical analysis proposed that there's actually a very simple phenomena at the root of this which which lies in our brains this is a well-known feature which we perceive quantities in relative ways the quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a sound for instance committing 10,000 soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot it's relatively enormous if you've already committed 1,000 soldiers previously but it doesn't sound so much it's not relatively enough it won't make a difference if you've already committed a hundred thousand soldiers previously so you see that because of the way we perceive quantities as the war drags on the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties will increase not linearly like 10,000 11,000 12,000 but exponentially 10,000 later 20,000 Native 40,000 and so that explains this pattern that we've seen before so here mathematics is able to link the well-known feature of the individual mind with a long-term pattern a historical pattern that unfolds over centuries and across continents so this type of examples today they're just few of them but I think that in the next decade they will become commonplace the reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at very fast pace so there's about 130 million books that have been written since the dawn of time companies like Google have which as many of them above 20 million actually and when the stuff of history is available in digital form it makes it possible for mathematical analysis to very quickly and very conveniently reveal trends in our history in our culture so I think as in the next decade in the sciences and the humanities will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about mankind and I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that it will be able to reveal new trends in our history sometimes to explain them and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen thank you very much

**Transcript**:
hi my name is Cameron Russell and for the last a little while I've been a model actually for ten years and I feel like there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress so luckily I brought an outfit change this is the first outfit change on the Ted stage so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it I think if some of the women were really horrified when I came out you don't have to tell me now but I'll find out later on Twitter I'd also note that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief ten seconds not everybody gets to do that these heels are very uncomfortable so good thing I wasn't going to wear them the worst part is putting a sweater over my head because that's when you'll laugh at me so don't do anything while it's over my head alright so why did I do that that was awkward well hopefully not as awkward as that picture image is powerful but also image is superficial I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds and in this picture I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life I was totally uncomfortable in the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy's hair and of course barring surgery or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work there's very little that we can do to transform how we look and how we look though it is superficial and immutable has a huge impact on our lives so today for me fearless means being honest and I am on this stage because I'm a model I'm on this stage because I'm a pretty white woman and my industry we call that a sexy girl and I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me but with an honest twist so the first question is how do you become a model and I always just say oh I was scouted but that means nothing the real way that I became a model is I want a genetic lottery and I am the recipient of a legacy and maybe you're wondering what is a legacy well for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that were biologically programmed to admire but also as tall slender figures and femininity and white skin and this is a legacy that was built for me and it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point and maybe there are some fashionistas we're like wait Naomi Tyra Joan Smalls Liu Wen and first I commend you on your model knowledge very impressive but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 a very inspired NYU PhD student counted all the models on the runway every single one that was hired and of the 677 models that were hired only 27 or less than 4% were non-white the next question people ways ask me is can I be a model when I grow up and the first answer is I don't know they don't put me in charge of that but the second answer and what I really want to say to these little girls is why you know you can be anything you could be the president of United States or the inventor of the next Internet or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet which would be awesome because to be the first one if after this amazing list they still are like no no camera and I want to be a model well then I say be my boss because I'm not in charge of anything and you could be the editor-in-chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H&M or the next Steven Mizell saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up it's you know out of your control and it's awesome and it's not a career path I will demonstrate for you now ten years of accumulated model knowledge because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons it can just be distilled right into right now so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there like a nice HMI and the client says Cameron we want a walking shot well then this leg goes first nice and long this arm goes back this arm goes for the head is at three quarters and you just go back and forth just do that and then you look back at your imaginary friends three hundred four hundred five hundred times it will look something like this and hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle that was I don't know what happened there unfortunately after you've gone to school and you have a resume you've done a few jobs you can't say anything anymore so if you say you want to be the president of the United States but your resume reads underwear model ten years people give you a funny look the next question people always ask me is do they retouch all the photos and yeah they pretty much retouch all the photos but that is only a small component of what's happening this picture is a very first picture that I ever took and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini and I didn't even have my period yet I know we're getting personal but uh you know I was a young girl this is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier here's me on the same day as this shoot my friend got to come with me here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue here's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine and here's me today and I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me they are constructions and they are constructions by professionals by hair stylist and makeup artists and photographers and stylist and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production and they build this that's not me okay so the next question people always ask me is do you get free stuff I do have too many Aiden shields which I never get to wear except for earlier but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life and that's what we don't like to talk about I grew up in Cambridge and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free when I was a teenager I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a read and of course we got pulled over and all it took was a sorry officer and we were on our way and I got these free things because of how I look not Who I am and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are I live in New York and last year of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked 86% of them were black and Latino and most of them were young men and there are only 177 thousand young black and Latino men in New York so for them it's not a question of will I get stopped but how many times do I get stopped when will I get stopped when I was researching this talk I found out that of the thirteen-year-old girls the United States fifty-three percent don't like their bodies and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they're 17 so the last question people ask me is you know what does it like to be a model and I think the answer that they're looking for is if you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair you will be so happy and fabulous and one we're backstage we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that we say it's really amazing to travel and it's amazing to get to work with creative inspired passionate people and those things are true but they're only one half of the story because the thing that we never say on camera that I have never said on camera is I am insecure and I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day and if you ever are wondering you know if I have thinner thighs and shinier hair will I be happier you just need to meet a group of models because they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes and are the most physically insecure women probably on the planet so when I was writing this talk I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance because on the one hand I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say look I've sieved all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with and it doesn't always make me happy but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I'm one of the biggest beneficiaries but I'm also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it's great I got to come you know before ten or twenty or thirty years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college which seems so important right now if there's a takeaway to this talk I hope is that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures thank you

**Transcript**:
hi my name is Cameron Russell and for the last a little while I've been a model actually for ten years and I feel like there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress so luckily I brought an outfit change this is the first outfit change on the Ted stage so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it I think if some of the women were really horrified when I came out you don't have to tell me now but I'll find out later on Twitter I'd also note that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief ten seconds not everybody gets to do that these heels are very uncomfortable so good thing I wasn't going to wear them the worst part is putting a sweater over my head because that's when you'll laugh at me so don't do anything while it's over my head alright so why did I do that that was awkward well hopefully not as awkward as that picture image is powerful but also image is superficial I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds and in this picture I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life I was totally uncomfortable in the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy's hair and of course barring surgery or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work there's very little that we can do to transform how we look and how we look though it is superficial and immutable has a huge impact on our lives so today for me fearless means being honest and I am on this stage because I'm a model I'm on this stage because I'm a pretty white woman and my industry we call that a sexy girl and I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me but with an honest twist so the first question is how do you become a model and I always just say oh I was scouted but that means nothing the real way that I became a model is I want a genetic lottery and I am the recipient of a legacy and maybe you're wondering what is a legacy well for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that were biologically programmed to admire but also as tall slender figures and femininity and white skin and this is a legacy that was built for me and it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point and maybe there are some fashionistas we're like wait Naomi Tyra Joan Smalls Liu Wen and first I commend you on your model knowledge very impressive but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 a very inspired NYU PhD student counted all the models on the runway every single one that was hired and of the 677 models that were hired only 27 or less than 4% were non-white the next question people ways ask me is can I be a model when I grow up and the first answer is I don't know they don't put me in charge of that but the second answer and what I really want to say to these little girls is why you know you can be anything you could be the president of United States or the inventor of the next Internet or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet which would be awesome because to be the first one if after this amazing list they still are like no no camera and I want to be a model well then I say be my boss because I'm not in charge of anything and you could be the editor-in-chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H&M or the next Steven Mizell saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up it's you know out of your control and it's awesome and it's not a career path I will demonstrate for you now ten years of accumulated model knowledge because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons it can just be distilled right into right now so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there like a nice HMI and the client says Cameron we want a walking shot well then this leg goes first nice and long this arm goes back this arm goes for the head is at three quarters and you just go back and forth just do that and then you look back at your imaginary friends three hundred four hundred five hundred times it will look something like this and hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle that was I don't know what happened there unfortunately after you've gone to school and you have a resume you've done a few jobs you can't say anything anymore so if you say you want to be the president of the United States but your resume reads underwear model ten years people give you a funny look the next question people always ask me is do they retouch all the photos and yeah they pretty much retouch all the photos but that is only a small component of what's happening this picture is a very first picture that I ever took and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini and I didn't even have my period yet I know we're getting personal but uh you know I was a young girl this is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier here's me on the same day as this shoot my friend got to come with me here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue here's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine and here's me today and I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me they are constructions and they are constructions by professionals by hair stylist and makeup artists and photographers and stylist and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production and they build this that's not me okay so the next question people always ask me is do you get free stuff I do have too many Aiden shields which I never get to wear except for earlier but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life and that's what we don't like to talk about I grew up in Cambridge and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free when I was a teenager I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a read and of course we got pulled over and all it took was a sorry officer and we were on our way and I got these free things because of how I look not Who I am and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are I live in New York and last year of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked 86% of them were black and Latino and most of them were young men and there are only 177 thousand young black and Latino men in New York so for them it's not a question of will I get stopped but how many times do I get stopped when will I get stopped when I was researching this talk I found out that of the thirteen-year-old girls the United States fifty-three percent don't like their bodies and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they're 17 so the last question people ask me is you know what does it like to be a model and I think the answer that they're looking for is if you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair you will be so happy and fabulous and one we're backstage we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that we say it's really amazing to travel and it's amazing to get to work with creative inspired passionate people and those things are true but they're only one half of the story because the thing that we never say on camera that I have never said on camera is I am insecure and I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day and if you ever are wondering you know if I have thinner thighs and shinier hair will I be happier you just need to meet a group of models because they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes and are the most physically insecure women probably on the planet so when I was writing this talk I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance because on the one hand I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say look I've sieved all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with and it doesn't always make me happy but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I'm one of the biggest beneficiaries but I'm also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it's great I got to come you know before ten or twenty or thirty years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college which seems so important right now if there's a takeaway to this talk I hope is that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures thank you

beneficiaries but I'm also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it's great I got to come you know before ten or twenty or thirty years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college which seems so important right now if there's a takeaway to this talk I hope is that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are how globalized we aren't and why it's important to actually be accurate in making those kinds of assessments and the leading point of view on this whether measured by number of books sold mentions in media or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization is this view that national borders really don't matter very much anymore cross-border integration is close to complete and we live in one world and what's interesting about this view is again it's a view that's held by pro globalizers like Tom Friedman from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted but it's also helped by anti globalizes who see this giant globalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives if it hasn't already done so the other thing I would add is that this is not a new view I'm a little bit of an amateur historian so I spent some time going back trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing and the best earliest quote that I could find was one from David Livingstone writing in the 1850s about how the railroad the steamship and the Telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly with the rest of the world now clearly David Livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time but it does seem useful to ask ourselves just how global are we before we think about where we go from here so the best way I found of trying to get people to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat may not even be close to flat is with some data so one of the things I've been doing over the last few years is really compiling data on things that could either happen within national borders or across national borders and I've looked at the cross-border component as a percentage of the total I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today but let me just give you a few data points I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow one kind of flow of people one kind of flow of capital and of course trade in products and services so let's start off with plain old telephone service of all the voice calling minutes in the world last year what percentage do you think were accounted for by cross-border phone calls pick a percentage in your own mind answer turns out to be 2 percent if you include Internet telephony you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent but it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate or let's turn to people moving across borders one particular thing we might look at in terms of long term flows of people is what percentage of the world's population is accounted for by first-generation immigrants again please pick a percentage turns out to be a little bit higher it's actually about 3% or think of investment take all the real investment that went on in the world in 2010 what percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment not quite 10 percent and then finally the one statistic that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen the export to GDP ratio if you look at the official statistics they typically indicate a little bit above 30 percent however there's a big pro with the official statistics in that if for instance a Japanese component supplier ships something to China to be put into an iPod and then the iPod gets shipped to the US that component ends up getting counted multiple times so nobody knows how bad this bias with the official statistics actually is so I thought I would ask the person who's spearheading the effort to generate data on this bus calamy the director of the World Trade Organization what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of GDP without the double and triple counting and it's actually probably a bit under 20 percent rather than the 30 percent plus numbers that we're talking about so it's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that I talked about in my book world 3.0 that we're very very far from the no border effect benchmark which would imply internationalization levels of the order of 85 90 95 percent so clearly apocalyptically minded authors have overstated the case but it's not just the apocalyptic s-- as i think of them who are prone to this kind of overstatement I've also spent some time serving audiences in different parts of the world on what they actually guessed these numbers to be let me share with you the results of a survey that Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run of its readership as to what people's guesses along these dimensions actually were so a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide first of all there is a suggestion of some error second these are pretty large errors for four quantities whose average value is less than 10% you have people guessing three four times that level even though I'm an economist I find that a pretty large error and third this is not just confined to the readers of the Harvard Business Review I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world and in all cases except one where a group actually underestimated the trade to GDP ratio people have this tendency towards over estimation and so I thought it important to give a name to this and that's what I refer to as global oniy the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars especially because I suspect some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims I think it's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to global oniy couple of different reasons come to mind first of all there's a real dearth of data in the debate let me give you an example when I first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called foreign policy one of the people who wrote in not entirely an agreement was Tom Friedman and since my article was titled why the world isn't flat that wasn't too surprising what was very surprising to me was Tom's critique which was game 'ow it's data are narrow and this caused me to scratch my head because as I went back through his several hundred page book I couldn't find a single figure chart table reference or footnote so my point is I haven't presented a lot of data here to convince you that I'm right but I would urge you to go away and look for your own data to try and actually assess whether some of this these hand-me-down insights that we've been bombarded with actually are correct so dearth of data in the debate is one reason a second reason has to do with peer pressure I remember I decided to write my why the world isn't flat article because I was being interviewed on TV and Mumbai and the interviewers first question to me was Professor Ghemawat why do you still believe that the world is round and I started laughing because I hadn't come across that formulation before and as I was laughing I was thinking I really need a more coherent response especially a national TV I'd better write something about this but what I can't quite capture for you was the pity and disbelief with which the interviewer asked her question the perspective was here is this poor professor he's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years he really has no idea as to what's actually going on in the world so try this out with your friends and acquaintances if you like you'll find that it's very cool to talk about the world being one etc if you raise questions about that formulation you really are considered a bit of an antique and then the final reason which I mentioned especially to a TED audience with some trepidation has to do with what I call techno trances if you listen to techno music for long periods of time it does things to your brainwave activity something similar seems to happen with exaggerated conceptions of how technology is going to overpower in the very immediate run all cultural barriers all political barriers all Geographic barriers because at this point I know you aren't allowed to ask me questions but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students hands go up and people ask yeah but what about Facebook and I got this question often enough that I thought I'd better do some research on Facebook because in some sense it's the ideal kind of technology to think about theoretically makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door what percentage of people's friends on Facebook are actually located in countries other than where people we're analyzing our based the answer is probably somewhere between 10 to 15% not negligible so we don't live in an entirely local or national world but very very far from the 95% level that you would expect and the reason is very simple we don't or I hope we don't form friendships at random on Facebook there the technology is overlaid on a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have and those relationships are what the technology doesn't quite displace those relationships are why we get far fewer than 95% of our friends being located in countries other than where we are so does all this matter or is global Oni just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization related issues I want to suggest that actually global Oni can be very harmful to your health first of all recognizing that the glass is only 10 to 20 percent full it's critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional gains from additional integration whereas if we thought we were all dirty there there would be no particular point to pushing harder it's a little bit like we wouldn't be having a conference on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about at this conference so being accurate about how limited globalization levels are is critical to even being able to notice that there might be room for something more something that would contribute further to global welfare which brings me to my second point avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization so I actually spend most of my world 3.0 book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what I have in mind think of France and the current debate about immigration when you ask people in France what percentage of the French population is immigrants the answer is about 24% that's their guess maybe realizing that the number is just 8% might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue or to take an even more striking example when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations did a survey of Americans asking them to guess what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid the guess was 30% which is slightly in excess of the actual level of u.s. governmental commitments to federal aid the reassuring thing about this particular survey was when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data some of them not all of them seem to become more willing to consider increases in foreign aid so the foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up here because if you think about it what I've been talking about today is this notion very uncontroversial amongst economists that most things are very home biased foreign aid is the most aid to poor people is about the most home biased thing you can find if you look at the OECD countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person and compare it with how much they spend per person per poor person in poor countries the ratio Branko Milanovic at the World Bank that the calculations turns out to be about thirty thousand to one now of course some of us if we truly are cosmopolitan would like to see that ratio being brought down to one is to one I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are if we simply brought that ratio down to fifteen thousand to one we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the Rio summit 20 years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on so in summary while radical openness is great given how closed we are even incremental openness could make things dramatically better thank you very much [Applause] [Music]

**Transcript**:
[Music] I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are how globalized we aren't and why it's important to actually be accurate in making those kinds of assessments and the leading point of view on this whether measured by number of books sold mentions in media or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization is this view that national borders really don't matter very much anymore cross-border integration is close to complete and we live in one world and what's interesting about this view is again it's a view that's held by pro globalizers like Tom Friedman from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted but it's also helped by anti globalizes who see this giant globalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives if it hasn't already done so the other thing I would add is that this is not a new view I'm a little bit of an amateur historian so I spent some time going back trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing and the best earliest quote that I could find was one from David Livingstone writing in the 1850s about how the railroad the steamship and the Telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly with the rest of the world now clearly David Livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time but it does seem useful to ask ourselves just how global are we before we think about where we go from here so the best way I found of trying to get people to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat may not even be close to flat is with some data so one of the things I've been doing over the last few years is really compiling data on things that could either happen within national borders or across national borders and I've looked at the cross-border component as a percentage of the total I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today but let me just give you a few data points I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow one kind of flow of people one kind of flow of capital and of course trade in products and services so let's start off with plain old telephone service of all the voice calling minutes in the world last year what percentage do you think were accounted for by cross-border phone calls pick a percentage in your own mind answer turns out to be 2 percent if you include Internet telephony you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent but it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate or let's turn to people moving across borders one particular thing we might look at in terms of long term flows of people is what percentage of the world's population is accounted for by first-generation immigrants again please pick a percentage turns out to be a little bit higher it's actually about 3% or think of investment take all the real investment that went on in the world in 2010 what percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment not quite 10 percent and then finally the one statistic that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen the export to GDP ratio if you look at the official statistics they typically indicate a little bit above 30 percent however there's a big pro with the official statistics in that if for instance a Japanese component supplier ships something to China to be put into an iPod and then the iPod gets shipped to the US that component ends up getting counted multiple times so nobody knows how bad this bias with the official statistics actually is so I thought I would ask the person who's spearheading the effort to generate data on this bus calamy the director of the World Trade Organization what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of GDP without the double and triple counting and it's actually probably a bit under 20 percent rather than the 30 percent plus numbers that we're talking about so it's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that I talked about in my book world 3.0 that we're very very far from the no border effect benchmark which would imply internationalization levels of the order of 85 90 95 percent so clearly apocalyptically minded authors have overstated the case but it's not just the apocalyptic s-- as i think of them who are prone to this kind of overstatement I've also spent some time serving audiences in different parts of the world on what they actually guessed these numbers to be let me share with you the results of a survey that Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run of its readership as to what people's guesses along these dimensions actually were so a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide first of all there is a suggestion of some error second these are pretty large errors for four quantities whose average value is less than 10% you have people guessing three four times that level even though I'm an economist I find that a pretty large error and third this is not just confined to the readers of the Harvard Business Review I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world and in all cases except one where a group actually underestimated the trade to GDP ratio people have this tendency towards over estimation and so I thought it important to give a name to this and that's what I refer to as global oniy the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars especially because I suspect some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims I think it's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to global oniy couple of different reasons come to mind first of all there's a real dearth of data in the debate let me give you an example when I first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called foreign policy one of the people who wrote in not entirely an agreement was Tom Friedman and since my article was titled why the world isn't flat that wasn't too surprising what was very surprising to me was Tom's critique which was game 'ow it's data are narrow and this caused me to scratch my head because as I went back through his several hundred page book I couldn't find a single figure chart table reference or footnote so my point is I haven't presented a lot of data here to convince you that I'm right but I would urge you to go away and look for your own data to try and actually assess whether some of this these hand-me-down insights that we've been bombarded with actually are correct so dearth of data in the debate is one reason a second reason has to do with peer pressure I remember I decided to write my why the world isn't flat article because I was being interviewed on TV and Mumbai and the interviewers first question to me was Professor Ghemawat why do you still believe that the world is round and I started laughing because I hadn't come across that formulation before and as I was laughing I was thinking I really need a more coherent response especially a national TV I'd better write something about this but what I can't quite capture for you was the pity and disbelief with which the interviewer asked her question the perspective was here is this poor professor he's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years he really has no idea as to what's actually going on in the world so try this out with your friends and acquaintances if you like you'll find that it's very cool to talk about the world being one etc if you raise questions about that formulation you really are considered a bit of an antique and then the final reason which I mentioned especially to a TED audience with some trepidation has to do with what I call techno trances if you listen to techno music for long periods of time it does things to your brainwave activity something similar seems to happen with exaggerated conceptions of how technology is going to overpower in the very immediate run all cultural barriers all political barriers all Geographic barriers because at this point I know you aren't allowed to ask me questions but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students hands go up and people ask yeah but what about Facebook and I got this question often enough that I thought I'd better do some research on Facebook because in some sense it's the ideal kind of technology to think about theoretically makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door what percentage of people's friends on Facebook are actually located in countries other than where people we're analyzing our based the answer is probably somewhere between 10 to 15% not negligible so we don't live in an entirely local or national world but very very far from the 95% level that you would expect and the reason is very simple we don't or I hope we don't form friendships at random on Facebook there the technology is overlaid on a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have and those relationships are what the technology doesn't quite displace those relationships are why we get far fewer than 95% of our friends being located in countries other than where we are so does all this matter or is global Oni just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization related issues I want to suggest that actually global Oni can be very harmful to your health first of all recognizing that the glass is only 10 to 20 percent full it's critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional gains from additional integration whereas if we thought we were all dirty there there would be no particular point to pushing harder it's a little bit like we wouldn't be having a conference on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about at this conference so being accurate about how limited globalization levels are is critical to even being able to notice that there might be room for something more something that would contribute further to global welfare which brings me to my second point avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization so I actually spend most of my world 3.0 book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what I have in mind think of France and the current debate about immigration when you ask people in France what percentage of the French population is immigrants the answer is about 24% that's their guess maybe realizing that the number is just 8% might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue or to take an even more striking example when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations did a survey of Americans asking them to guess what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid the guess was 30% which is slightly in excess of the actual level of u.s. governmental commitments to federal aid the reassuring thing about this particular survey was when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data some of them not all of them seem to become more willing to consider increases in foreign aid so the foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up here because if you think about it what I've been talking about today is this notion very uncontroversial amongst economists that most things are very home biased foreign aid is the most aid to poor people is about the most home biased thing you can find if you look at the OECD countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person and compare it with how much they spend per person per poor person in poor countries the ratio Branko Milanovic at the World Bank that the calculations turns out to be about thirty thousand to one now of course some of us if we truly are cosmopolitan would like to see that ratio being brought down to one is to one I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are if we simply brought that ratio down to fifteen thousand to one we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the Rio summit 20 years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on so in summary while radical openness is great given how closed we are even incremental openness could make things dramatically better thank you very much [Applause] [Music]

generate data on this bus calamy the director of the World Trade Organization what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of GDP without the double and triple counting and it's actually probably a bit under 20 percent rather than the 30 percent plus numbers that we're talking about so it's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that I talked about in my book world 3.0 that we're very very far from the no border effect benchmark which would imply internationalization levels of the order of 85 90 95 percent so clearly apocalyptically minded authors have overstated the case but it's not just the apocalyptic s-- as i think of them who are prone to this kind of overstatement I've also spent some time serving audiences in different parts of the world on what they actually guessed these numbers to be let me share with you the results of a survey that Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run of its readership as to what people's guesses along these dimensions actually were so a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide first of all there is a suggestion of some error second these are pretty large errors for four quantities whose average value is less than 10% you have people guessing three four times that level even though I'm an economist I find that a pretty large error and third this is not just confined to the readers of the Harvard Business Review I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world and in all cases except one where a group actually underestimated the trade to GDP ratio people have this tendency towards over estimation and so I thought it important to give a name to this and that's what I refer to as global oniy the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars especially because I suspect some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims I think it's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to global oniy couple of different reasons come to mind first of all there's a real dearth of data in the debate let me give you an example when I first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called foreign policy one of the people who wrote in not entirely an agreement was Tom Friedman and since my article was titled why the world isn't flat that wasn't too surprising what was very surprising to me was Tom's critique which was game 'ow it's data are narrow and this caused me to scratch my head because as I went back through his several hundred page book I couldn't find a single figure chart table reference or footnote so my point is I haven't presented a lot of data here to convince you that I'm right but I would urge you to go away and look for your own data to try and actually assess whether some of this these hand-me-down insights that we've been bombarded with actually are correct so dearth of data in the debate is one reason a second reason has to do with peer pressure I remember I decided to write my why the world isn't flat article because I was being interviewed on TV and Mumbai and the interviewers first question to me was Professor Ghemawat why do you still believe that the world is round and I started laughing because I hadn't come across that formulation before and as I was laughing I was thinking I really need a more coherent response especially a national TV I'd better write something about this but what I can't quite capture for you was the pity and disbelief with which the interviewer asked her question the perspective was here is this poor professor he's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years he really has no idea as to what's actually going on in the world so try this out with your friends and acquaintances if you like you'll find that it's very cool to talk about the world being one etc if you raise questions about that formulation you really are considered a bit of an antique and then the final reason which I mentioned especially to a TED audience with some trepidation has to do with what I call techno trances if you listen to techno music for long periods of time it does things to your brainwave activity something similar seems to happen with exaggerated conceptions of how technology is going to overpower in the very immediate run all cultural barriers all political barriers all Geographic barriers because at this point I know you aren't allowed to ask me questions but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students hands go up and people ask yeah but what about Facebook and I got this question often enough that I thought I'd better do some research on Facebook because in some sense it's the ideal kind of technology to think about theoretically makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door what percentage of people's friends on Facebook are actually located in countries other than where people we're analyzing our based the answer is probably somewhere between 10 to 15% not negligible so we don't live in an entirely local or national world but very very far from the 95% level that you would expect and the reason is very simple we don't or I hope we don't form friendships at random on Facebook there the technology is overlaid on a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have and those relationships are what the technology doesn't quite displace those relationships are why we get far fewer than 95% of our friends being located in countries other than where we are so does all this matter or is global Oni just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization related issues I want to suggest that actually global Oni can be very harmful to your health first of all recognizing that the glass is only 10 to 20 percent full it's critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional gains from additional integration whereas if we thought we were all dirty there there would be no particular point to pushing harder it's a little bit like we wouldn't be having a conference on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about at this conference so being accurate about how limited globalization levels are is critical to even being able to notice that there might be room for something more something that would contribute further to global welfare which brings me to my second point avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization so I actually spend most of my world 3.0 book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what I have in mind think of France and the current debate about immigration when you ask people in France what percentage of the French population is immigrants the answer is about 24% that's their guess maybe realizing that the number is just 8% might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue or to take an even more striking example when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations did a survey of Americans asking them to guess what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid the guess was 30% which is slightly in excess of the actual level of u.s. governmental commitments to federal aid the reassuring thing about this particular survey was when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data some of them not all of them seem to become more willing to consider increases in foreign aid so the foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up here because if you think about it what I've been talking about today is this notion very uncontroversial amongst economists that most things are very home biased foreign aid is the most aid to poor people is about the most home biased thing you can find if you look at the OECD countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person and compare it with how much they spend per person per poor person in poor countries the ratio Branko Milanovic at the World Bank that the calculations turns out to be about thirty thousand to one now of course some of us if we truly are cosmopolitan would like to see that ratio being brought down to one is to one I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are if we simply brought that ratio down to fifteen thousand to one we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the Rio summit 20 years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on so in summary while radical openness is great given how closed we are even incremental openness could make things dramatically better thank you very much [Applause] [Music]

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular Inaugurate: to begin or introduce a system, policy, or period or to admit someone formally into public office. The word inaugurate probably begins with the Latin word avis, meaning bird. In ancient Rome, avis was combined with the Latin verb garrire, to talk. The two words together made augur, literally one who talks to birds. Figuratively, however, augur was the name given to a specific religious official, a type of soothsayer or prophet, who foretold events by studying the behavior of birds. No major decision was made without the augur's consultation. He would analyze flight patterns and direction, bird calls, and general bird activities, and then use these signs to interpret the will of the gods. From augur comes the verb inaugurare, to see omens from the flight of birds, and, then later, to consecrate or act when such omens are favorable. Roman officials could only be installed in office when the avian omens were auspicious. Centuries later, the word was eventually transmuted into English as inaugurate. Along the way, it lost its veneer of superstition and was admitted formally into the jargon of politics.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Olive oil is 100% fat; there's nothing else in it. Pancake mix, on the other hand, is only about 11% fat. And, yet, olive oil is good for you, and pancake mix is not. Why is that? As it turns out, the amount of fat we eat doesn't impact our weight or our cholesterol or our risk of heart disease nearly as much as what kind of fat we eat. But let's back up: What is fat? If we were to zoom in on a salmon, which is a fatty fish, past the organs, past the tissues, into the cells, we would see that the stuff we call fat is actually made up of molecules called triglycerides, and they are not all alike. Here's one example. Those three carbons on the left, that's glycerol. Now, you can think of that as the backbone that holds the rest of the molecule together. The three long chains on the right are called fatty acids, and it's subtle differences in the structures of these chains that determine whether a fat is, let's say, solid or liquid; whether or not it goes rancid quickly; and, most importantly, how good or how bad it is for you. Let's take a look at some of these differences. One is length. Fatty acids can be short or long. Another, more important difference is the type of bond between the carbon atoms. Some fatty acids have only single bonds. Others have both single and double bonds. Fatty acids with only single bonds are called saturated, and those with one or more double bonds are called unsaturated. Now, most unsaturated fats are good for you, while saturated fats are bad for you in excess. For saturated fats, the story pretty much ends there but not for unsaturated fats. The double bonds in these molecules have a kind of weird property; they're rigid. So, that means there are two ways to arrange every double bond. The first is like this, where both hydrogens are on same side and both carbons are on the same side. The second way is like this. Now the hydrogens and carbons are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, even though both of these molecules are made up of exactly the same building blocks, they are two completely different substances, and they behave completely differently inside of us. The configuration on the left is called CIS, which you've probably never heard of. The one of the right is called TRANS, and you probably have heard of trans fats before. They don't go rancid, they're more stable during deep frying, and they can change the texture of foods in ways that other fats just can't. They're also terrible for your health, by far worse than saturated fat, even though technically they're a type of unsaturated fat. Now, I know that seems crazy, but your body doesn't care what a molecule looks like on paper. All that matters is the 3-D shape where the molecule fits, where it doesn't, and what pathways it interferes with. So, how do you know if a food has trans fat in it? Well, the only sure way to know is if you see the words, "partially hydrogenated" in the ingredients list. Don't let nutrition labels or advertising fool you. The FDA allows manufacturers to claim that their products contain "0" grams of trans fat even if they actually have up to half a gram per serving. But there are no hard and fast rules about how small a serving can be, and, that means, you'll have to rely on seeing those key words, partially hydrogenated, because that's how trans fats are made, by partially hydrogenating unsaturated fats. So, let's go back to our olive oil and pancake mix from before. Olive oil is 100% fat. Pancake mix is only 11% fat. But olive oil is mostly unsaturated fat, and it has no trans fat at all. On the other hand, more than half the fat in pancake mix is either saturated or trans fat. And, so, even though olive oil has 10 times as much fat as pancake mix, it's healthy for you, whereas pancake mix is not. Now, I'm not trying to pick on pancake mix. There are lots of foods with this type of fat profile. The point is this: It's not how much fat you eat, it's what kind of fat. And what makes a particular fat healthy or unhealthy is its shape.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Trans fats are a type of what kind of fat?
Options: A. Saturated fats, B. Unsaturated fats, C. Cis fats, D. Nitrogen fats
Correct Option: B

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Olive oil is 100% fat; there's nothing else in it. Pancake mix, on the other hand, is only about 11% fat. And, yet, olive oil is good for you, and pancake mix is not. Why is that? As it turns out, the amount of fat we eat doesn't impact our weight or our cholesterol or our risk of heart disease nearly as much as what kind of fat we eat. But let's back up: What is fat? If we were to zoom in on a salmon, which is a fatty fish, past the organs, past the tissues, into the cells, we would see that the stuff we call fat is actually made up of molecules called triglycerides, and they are not all alike. Here's one example. Those three carbons on the left, that's glycerol. Now, you can think of that as the backbone that holds the rest of the molecule together. The three long chains on the right are called fatty acids, and it's subtle differences in the structures of these chains that determine whether a fat is, let's say, solid or liquid; whether or not it goes rancid quickly; and, most importantly, how good or how bad it is for you. Let's take a look at some of these differences. One is length. Fatty acids can be short or long. Another, more important difference is the type of bond between the carbon atoms. Some fatty acids have only single bonds. Others have both single and double bonds. Fatty acids with only single bonds are called saturated, and those with one or more double bonds are called unsaturated. Now, most unsaturated fats are good for you, while saturated fats are bad for you in excess. For saturated fats, the story pretty much ends there but not for unsaturated fats. The double bonds in these molecules have a kind of weird property; they're rigid. So, that means there are two ways to arrange every double bond. The first is like this, where both hydrogens are on same side and both carbons are on the same side. The second way is like this. Now the hydrogens and carbons are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, even though both of these molecules are made up of exactly the same building blocks, they are two completely different substances, and they behave completely differently inside of us. The configuration on the left is called CIS, which you've probably never heard of. The one of the right is called TRANS, and you probably have heard of trans fats before. They don't go rancid, they're more stable during deep frying, and they can change the texture of foods in ways that other fats just can't. They're also terrible for your health, by far worse than saturated fat, even though technically they're a type of unsaturated fat. Now, I know that seems crazy, but your body doesn't care what a molecule looks like on paper. All that matters is the 3-D shape where the molecule fits, where it doesn't, and what pathways it interferes with. So, how do you know if a food has trans fat in it? Well, the only sure way to know is if you see the words, "partially hydrogenated" in the ingredients list. Don't let nutrition labels or advertising fool you. The FDA allows manufacturers to claim that their products contain "0" grams of trans fat even if they actually have up to half a gram per serving. But there are no hard and fast rules about how small a serving can be, and, that means, you'll have to rely on seeing those key words, partially hydrogenated, because that's how trans fats are made, by partially hydrogenating unsaturated fats. So, let's go back to our olive oil and pancake mix from before. Olive oil is 100% fat. Pancake mix is only 11% fat. But olive oil is mostly unsaturated fat, and it has no trans fat at all. On the other hand, more than half the fat in pancake mix is either saturated or trans fat. And, so, even though olive oil has 10 times as much fat as pancake mix, it's healthy for you, whereas pancake mix is not. Now, I'm not trying to pick on pancake mix. There are lots of foods with this type of fat profile. The point is this: It's not how much fat you eat, it's what kind of fat. And what makes a particular fat healthy or unhealthy is its shape.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby There are all sorts of things that happen every day that might make you ask, "Why? Why do we drive on a parkway and park on a driveway? Why does my hair get frizzy when it's humid? And why do my fingers get all pruney when they're wet?" Often we simply can't know the answers to these questions. But progress can often be made, and, when it comes to your pruney fingers, scientists have a few interesting ideas. The story here begins with an observation made in the 1930s in the emergency room. Doctors noticed that patients with nerve damage to their hands did not get pruney fingertips like most of us do in a bath, which might make you wonder, "Why would primates want wrinkly fingers, presumably when it's rainy or dewy?" What could this trait be for? What if these wrinkles functioned like rain treads? Think about car tires. When the ground is dry, it's generally best to have smooth tires, and race cars do. Smooth tires means more rubber or surface area in contact with the road, which gives them better grip. But in rainy and muddy conditions, it's a different story, and here's where treads come into play. Treads reduce the amount of rubber on the road, but they help channel out water when it rains, lowering the risk of hydroplaning. Well, if your fingers really are like rain treads, you should be able to predict the optimal shape for them, right? So, what would the predicted wrinkle shapes be? That is, are our prunes actually the right shape to be rain treads? Let's take a detour into rivers. When we think of river networks, we usually imagine lots of smaller river channels joining to make larger river channels downstream, which is what happens in concave basins. In these cases, the divides, the regions between the river segments, are disconnected from one another and diverge away from one another uphill. But river networks look fundamentally different on convex promontories or protrusions. Here, the river channels are disconnected from one another and diverge away from one another downstream, not very river-like. In these cases, it's the divides that link together to form a tree, with its trunk uphill at the top of the promontory. Here, it's the divides that look more traditionally river-like. If our pruney fingers are drainage networks, designed to channel out water when they grip, then we expect to find similar shapes on our fingers as we find out there among rivers. There should be a tree network of divides, or ridges, with their trunk near the top of the fingertip and with their more leaky parts reaching out downhill, away from the tip. The channels themselves, through which the water is channeled during a grip, should not connect to one another, and instead should diverge away from one another downhill. If pruney fingers are rain treads, then they should look like the river networks on convex promontories. In fact, that's exactly the morphology we find among pruney fingers! When we grip, then, our pruney wrinkles really do channel out the water. But does it actually help us grip? New behavioral experiments have shown that they do. In a task where subjects had to grasp wet marbles and move them through a hole and out the other side, those with pruney fingers finished the task significantly faster than those with smooth fingers. Pruney fingers not only ought to enhance grip in wet conditions but do. So, pruney fingers may be a crucial part of the primate repertoire. Maybe, once primates lost their claws in favor of fingernails, rain treads were needed to deal with the especially challenging, often wet, grip-heavy forest habitats. By looking closely at the mysteries in our world and trying to find things that look similar, like our wet fingers and rain treads, we can come up with ideas about what's happening. And that's a good way to think about all sorts of questions in life, too.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby There are all sorts of things that happen every day that might make you ask, "Why? Why do we drive on a parkway and park on a driveway? Why does my hair get frizzy when it's humid? And why do my fingers get all pruney when they're wet?" Often we simply can't know the answers to these questions. But progress can often be made, and, when it comes to your pruney fingers, scientists have a few interesting ideas. The story here begins with an observation made in the 1930s in the emergency room. Doctors noticed that patients with nerve damage to their hands did not get pruney fingertips like most of us do in a bath, which might make you wonder, "Why would primates want wrinkly fingers, presumably when it's rainy or dewy?" What could this trait be for? What if these wrinkles functioned like rain treads? Think about car tires. When the ground is dry, it's generally best to have smooth tires, and race cars do. Smooth tires means more rubber or surface area in contact with the road, which gives them better grip. But in rainy and muddy conditions, it's a different story, and here's where treads come into play. Treads reduce the amount of rubber on the road, but they help channel out water when it rains, lowering the risk of hydroplaning.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so I want to talk to you about two things tonight number one teaching surgery and doing surgery is really hard and second that language is one one of the most profound things that separate us all over the world and in my little corner of the world these two things are actually related and I want to tell you how tonight now nobody wants an operation who here has had surgery did you want it keep your hands up if you wanted an operation nobody wants an operation in particular nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions that cause a lot of pain that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school that leave a big scar but if you have to have an operation what you really want is a minimally invasive operation that's what I want to talk to you about tonight how doing and teaching this type of surgery led us on a search for a better Universal translator now this type of surgery is hard and it starts by putting people to sleep putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen blowing them up like a balloon sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen it's dangerous stuff and taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen so let's see what it looks like so this is gallbladder surgery we perform a million of these a year in the United States alone this is the real thing there's no blood and you can see how focused The Sur are how much concentration it takes you can see it in their faces it's hard to teach and it's not all that easy to learn we do about five million of these in the United States and maybe 20 million of these worldwide all right you've all heard this the term he's a born surgeon let me tell you surgeons are not born surgeons are not made either we have no little tanks where we're making surgeons surgeons are trained one step at a time it starts with a foundation basic skills we build on that and we take people hopefully to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant then we teach them to be a surgeon in training and when they do all of that for about five years they get the coveted board certification if you need surgery you want to be operated on by a board certified surgeon you get your board certificate and you can go out into practice and eventually if you're lucky you achieve Mastery now that Foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery Society in the United States sages started in the late 1990s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong Foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to go on and do procedures now the science behind this is so potent that it became required by the American Board of surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified it's not a lecture it's not a course it's all of that plus a high stakes assessment it's hard now just this past year one of our partners the American College of Surgeons teamed up with us to make an announcement that all surgeons should be fls certified before they do minimally invasive surgery and are we talking about just people here in the US and Canada no we just said all surgeons so to lift this Education and Training worldwide is a very large task something I'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world sages does surgery all over the world teaching and educating surgeons so we have a problem and one of the problems is distance we can't travel everywhere we need to make the world a smaller place and I think that we can develop some tools to do so and one of the tools I like personally is using video so I was inspired by a friend this is Alan oranic from Toronto and he proved that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video conferencing so here's Allan teaching an English speaking surgeon in Africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery very inspiring but for this examination which is really hard we have a problem even people who say they speak English only 14% pass because for them it's not a surgery test it's an English test let me bring it to you locally I work at the Cambridge hospital it's a primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility we have more than a 100 translators covering 63 languages and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital it's a big labor intensive effort if you think about the worldwide burden of trying to talk to your patients not just teaching surgeons just trying to talk to your patients there aren't enough translators in the world we need to employ technology to assist us in this Quest at our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors to people who just got here last week and you have no idea how hard it is to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to and there isn't always a translator available so we need tools we need a universal translator one of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world it's really about setting up a dialogue we have a lot to learn here in the United States we spend more money per person for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world maybe we have something to learn as well so I'm passionate about teaching these fls skills all over the world this past year I've been in Latin America been in China talking about fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery and Everywhere I Go the barrier is we want this but we need it in our language so here's what we think we want to do imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously I want to talk to the people in Asia Latin America Africa Europe seamlessly accurately and in a cost effective fashion using technology and it has to be bidirectional they have to be able to teach us something as well it's a big task so we looked for a universal translator I thought there would be one out there your web page has Translation your cell phone has translation but nothing that's good enough to teach surgery because we need a lexicon what is a lexicon a lexicon is a body words that describes a domain I need to have a health care lexicon and in that I need a surgery lexicon that's a tall order we have to work at it so let me show you what we're doing this is research can't buy it we're working with the folks at IBM research from the accessibility Center to string together Technologies to work towards the universal translator it starts with a framework system where with a surgeon delivers the lecture using a framework of captioning technology we then add another technology to do video conferencing but we don't have the words yet so we add a third technology and now we've got the words and we can apply the Special Sauce the translation we get the words up in a window and then apply the magic we work with the fourth technology and we currently have access to 11 language pairs more to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place and I'd like to show you our prototype of stringing all of these technologies that don't necessarily always talk to each other to become something useful fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery module five manual Skills Practice students May display captions in their native language if you're in Latin America you click I want it in Spanish button and out ites in real time in Spanish but if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time by using technology in a constructive fashion you could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian on and on and on simultaneously without the use of human translators but that's the lectures if you remember what I told you about fls at the beginning it's knowledge and skill SKS the difference in an operation between doing something successfully and not may be moving your hand this much so we're going to take it one step further we brought my friend Allan back today we're going to practice suturing this is how you hold the needle grab the needle at the tip it's important to be accurate aim for the black dots Orient your Loop this way now go ahead and cut very good Oscar I'll see you next week so that's what we're working on and our quest for the universal translator we want it to be bidirectional we have a need to learn as well as to teach I can think of a million uses for a tool like this as we think about intersecting Technologies everybody has a cell phone with a camera we could use this everywhere whether it be health care patient care engineering law conferencing translating videos this is ubiquitous tool in order to break down our barriers we have to learn to talk to people to demand that people work on translation we need it for our everyday life in order to make the world a smaller place thank you very much [Applause] [Music]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so I want to talk to you about two things tonight number one teaching surgery and doing surgery is really hard and second that language is one one of the most profound things that separate us all over the world and in my little corner of the world these two things are actually related and I want to tell you how tonight now nobody wants an operation who here has had surgery did you want it keep your hands up if you wanted an operation nobody wants an operation in particular nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions that cause a lot of pain that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school that leave a big scar but if you have to have an operation what you really want is a minimally invasive operation that's what I want to talk to you about tonight how doing and teaching this type of surgery led us on a search for a better Universal translator now this type of surgery is hard and it starts by putting people to sleep putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen blowing them up like a balloon sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen it's dangerous stuff and taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen so let's see what it looks like so this is gallbladder surgery we perform a million of these a year in the United States alone this is the real thing there's no blood and you can see how focused The Sur are how much concentration it takes you can see it in their faces it's hard to teach and it's not all that easy to learn we do about five million of these in the United States and maybe 20 million of these worldwide all right you've all heard this the term he's a born surgeon let me tell you surgeons are not born surgeons are not made either we have no little tanks where we're making surgeons surgeons are trained one step at a time it starts with a foundation basic skills we build on that and we take people hopefully to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant then we teach them to be a surgeon in training and when they do all of that for about five years they get the coveted board certification if you need surgery you want to be operated on by a board certified surgeon you get your board certificate and you can go out into practice and eventually if you're lucky you achieve Mastery now that Foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery Society in the United States sages started in the late 1990s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong Foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to go on and do procedures now the science behind this is so potent that it became required by the American Board of surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified it's not a lecture it's not a course it's all of that plus a high stakes assessment it's hard now just this past year one of our partners the American College of Surgeons teamed up with us to make an announcement that all surgeons should be fls certified before they do minimally invasive surgery and are we talking about just people here in the US and Canada no we just said all surgeons so to lift this Education and Training worldwide is a very large task something I'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world sages does surgery all over the world teaching and educating surgeons so we have a problem and one of the problems is distance we can't travel everywhere we need to make the world a smaller place and I think that we can develop some tools to do so and one of the tools I like personally is using video so I was inspired by a friend this is Alan oranic from Toronto and he proved that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video conferencing so here's Allan teaching an English speaking surgeon in Africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery very inspiring but for this examination which is really hard we have a problem even people who say they speak English only 14% pass because for them it's not a surgery test it's an English test let me bring it to you locally I work at the Cambridge hospital it's a primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility we have more than a 100 translators covering 63 languages and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital it's a big labor intensive effort if you think about the worldwide burden of trying to talk to your patients not just teaching surgeons just trying to talk to your patients there aren't enough translators in the world we need to employ technology to assist us in this Quest at our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors to people who just got here last week and you have no idea how hard it is to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to and there isn't always a translator available so we need tools we need a universal translator one of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world it's really about setting up a dialogue we have a lot to learn here in the United States we spend more money per person for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world maybe we have something to learn as well so I'm passionate about teaching these fls skills all over the world this past year I've been in Latin America been in China talking about fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery and Everywhere I Go the barrier is we want this but we need it in our language so here's what we think we want to do imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously I want to talk to the people in Asia Latin America Africa Europe seamlessly accurately and in a cost effective fashion using technology and it has to be bidirectional they have to be able to teach us something as well it's a big task so we looked for a universal translator I thought there would be one out there your web page has Translation your cell phone has translation but nothing that's good enough to teach surgery because we need a lexicon what is a lexicon a lexicon is a body words that describes a domain I need to have a health care lexicon and in that I need a surgery lexicon that's a tall order we have to work at it so let me show you what we're doing this is research can't buy it we're working with the folks at IBM research from the accessibility Center to string together Technologies to work towards the universal translator it starts with a framework system where with a surgeon delivers the lecture using a framework of captioning technology we then add another technology to do video conferencing but we don't have the words yet so we add a third technology and now we've got the words and we can apply the Special Sauce the translation we get the words up in a window and then apply the magic we work with the fourth technology and we currently have access to 11 language pairs more to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place and I'd like to show you our prototype of stringing all of these technologies that don't necessarily always talk to each other to become something useful fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery module five manual Skills Practice students May display captions in their native language if you're in Latin America you click I want it in Spanish button and out ites in real time in Spanish but if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time by using technology in a constructive fashion you could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian on and on and on simultaneously without the use of human translators but that's the lectures if you remember what I told you about fls at the beginning it's knowledge and skill SKS the difference in an operation between doing something successfully and not may be moving your hand this much so we're going to take it one step further we brought my friend Allan back today we're going to practice suturing this is how you hold the needle grab the needle at the tip it's important to be accurate aim for the black dots Orient your Loop this way now go ahead and cut very good Oscar I'll see you next week so that's what we're working on and our quest for the universal translator we want it to be bidirectional we have a need to learn as well as to teach I can think of a million uses for a tool like this as we think about intersecting Technologies everybody has a cell phone with a camera we could use this everywhere whether it be health care patient care engineering law conferencing translating videos this is ubiquitous tool in order to break down our barriers we have to learn to talk to people to demand that people work on translation we need it for our everyday life in order to make the world a smaller place thank you very much [Applause] [Music]

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby We are constantly asked for our opinions. Which team do you think will win the Super Bowl? Who wore it better on the red carpet? Who are you going to vote for for mayor? Public opinion polls are everywhere. Important decision makers in American government have long relied on public opinion polls throughout elections and important legislation. The problem is public opinion isn't easy to track and, often times, isn't even right. In 1948, the Chicago Daily Tribune ran a now famous headline: "Dewey Defeats Truman," they cried in big, bold, black and white letters. The problem is that Dewey hadn't defeated Truman. The Tribune had relied on polls to come to their conclusion. Whoops! This happens all the time because public opinion polls are either inaccurate or misleading. So, why are they wrong? And why do we keep using them? First, let's start with an important term: sample. A sample is the group of people that respond to questions during a public opinion poll. A poll's quality rests largely on its sample, and a sample can be bad in a few key ways. It can be too small, too narrow, or the poll itself can be too difficult. Polls that are too small are bad for obvious reasons. And while you can't possibly ask every single person in America for their opinion, the more people you ask, the more accurate your prediction. Polls that are too narrow, that only ask a certain type of person a question, are bad, too. Consider a poll about whether or not the potato is the best vegetable in America. If you only asked people in Idaho, where the state food is the potato, chances are that you would get a much different answer than if you asked people in the state of New Mexico, where the state vegetable is beans. Getting the right kind of diversity in your sample means making sure that your sample has a range of ages, races, genders, and geographic regions, just to name a few. Finally, polls that are too hard can't tell you much either. If you're asking people for their opinions on things about which they have no prior knowledge, the results will be pointless. You're better off shaking a Magic 8 ball. It's not just the people you're asking that can cause bias, though. The person doing the asking is part of the problem, too. That's called interviewer bias. Interviewer bias is all about the effect that the person asking the questions has on the sample. Humans generally don't like confrontation. People worry that their answers may make them look bad. Therefore, we find that people tend to give socially desirable responses, not necessarily their honest opinions, because they don't want to come across as heartless, racist, or bigoted. And the way we word our questions matters too. When polls purposely sway the answers one way or the other, it's called a push poll because it pushes people to answer a certain way. "Would you vote for candidate Smith?" is a perfectly normal question. "Would you vote for candidate Smith if you knew that he robs senior citizens?" is a push poll. So, if polls are open to all sorts of manipulation and inaccuracies, why are they still so prevalent? Despite their flaws, public opinion polls provide us with some sense of the thoughts and moods of large groups of people. They offer politicians the chance to pass legislation they think a majority of Americans will support. They help fashionistas on TV know which star wore the dress better on the red carpet. Finally, they make us, the people who get polled, feel as though our voice has been heard. So, next time you get a phone call asking your opinion, or if you see a poll online, take some time to think about who is asking and why they're asking. Then, take that poll, and its results, with a grain of salt or a potato.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby We are constantly asked for our opinions. Which team do you think will win the Super Bowl? Who wore it better on the red carpet? Who are you going to vote for for mayor? Public opinion polls are everywhere. Important decision makers in American government have long relied on public opinion polls throughout elections and important legislation. The problem is public opinion isn't easy to track and, often times, isn't even right. In 1948, the Chicago Daily Tribune ran a now famous headline: "Dewey Defeats Truman," they cried in big, bold, black and white letters. The problem is that Dewey hadn't defeated Truman. The Tribune had relied on polls to come to their conclusion. Whoops! This happens all the time because public opinion polls are either inaccurate or misleading. So, why are they wrong? And why do we keep using them? First, let's start with an important term: sample. A sample is the group of people that respond to questions during a public opinion poll. A poll's quality rests largely on its sample, and a sample can be bad in a few key ways. It can be too small, too narrow, or the poll itself can be too difficult. Polls that are too small are bad for obvious reasons. And while you can't possibly ask every single person in America for their opinion, the more people you ask, the more accurate your prediction. Polls that are too narrow, that only ask a certain type of person a question, are bad, too. Consider a poll about whether or not the potato is the best vegetable in America. If you only asked people in Idaho, where the state food is the potato, chances are that you would get a much different answer than if you asked people in the state of New Mexico, where the state vegetable is beans. Getting the right kind of diversity in your sample means making sure that your sample has a range of ages, races, genders, and geographic regions, just to name a few. Finally, polls that are too hard can't tell you much either. If you're asking people for their opinions on things about which they have no prior knowledge, the results will be pointless. You're better off shaking a Magic 8 ball. It's not just the people you're asking that can cause bias, though. The person doing the asking is part of the problem, too. That's called interviewer bias. Interviewer bias is all about the effect that the person asking the questions has on the sample. Humans generally don't like confrontation. People worry that their answers may make them look bad. Therefore, we find that people tend to give socially desirable responses, not necessarily their honest opinions, because they don't want to come across as heartless, racist, or bigoted. And the way we word our questions matters too. When polls purposely sway the answers one way or the other, it's called a push poll because it pushes people to answer a certain way. "Would you vote for candidate Smith?" is a perfectly normal question. "Would you vote for candidate Smith if you knew that he robs senior citizens?" is a push poll. So, if polls are open to all sorts of manipulation and inaccuracies, why are they still so prevalent? Despite their flaws, public opinion polls provide us with some sense of the thoughts and moods of large groups of people. They offer politicians the chance to pass legislation they think a majority of Americans will support. They help fashionistas on TV know which star wore the dress better on the red carpet. Finally, they make us, the people who get polled, feel as though our voice has been heard. So, next time you get a phone call asking your opinion, or if you see a poll online, take some time to think about who is asking and why they're asking. Then, take that poll, and its results, with a grain of salt or a potato.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby How do you get from point A to point B? Why not spice it up with homemade special effects? A film is simply a series of images played in sequence to create the illusion of motion. If you manipulate those images, crazy things can happen. We used a tablet and one of the many stop motion apps out there. How do you get from point A to point B? We started off by taking a bunch of pictures of Celeste in place. Then, just like stop motion animation, the character is moved just a bit before the next picture is taken, which, in this case, creates a sliding effect. Here we use the oldest trick in the book. By alternating between photos of Celeste on-screen and off-screen, we've made her childhood dream of teleportation a reality. With a little creativity, there are a million ways you can used homemade special effects to make something as simple as getting from point A to point B much more fun. If you're at a loss for ideas, try finding inspiration in your surroundings, like the refrigerator and your coat rack. You can even try incorporating everyday objects from around your house, like, say, umbrellas or binder clips. Wherever there is an object, there is an opportunity to make it come to life. When humans are used in stop motion animation, that's called pixilation, a term coined in the mid-twentieth century, well before the word pixel was a part of our vocabulary. But these sorts of special effects are as old as the art of film making, and thanks to today's technologies, can be reproduced in your very own kitchen. Moving an object from point A to point B is a fundamental principle of animation. To learn more about the process and the tools we used, visit the "Dig Deeper" section on ed.ted.com.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Imagine a place so dark you can't see the nose on your face. Eyes opened or closed, it's all the same because the sun never shines there. Up ahead, you see a light. When you creep in to investigate, a blue light flits around you. "I could watch this forever," you think. But you can't because the mouth of an anglerfish has just sprung open and eaten you alive. You are just one of many creatures at the bottom of the ocean who learn too late to appreciate the power of bioluminescence. Bioluminescence refers to the ability of certain living things to create light. The human body can make stuff like ear wax and toe nails, but these organisms can turn parts of their body into glow sticks. It's like nature made them ready to rave. Why? In one way or another, bioluminescence improves a living thing's chances of survival. Take the firefly. It's ability to glow green helps it attract a mate on a warm, summer night, but it's just one of many living things that can glow. The railroad worm, Phrixothrix hirtus, can light up its body in two colors: red and green. Would you eat something that looks like an airport runway? Neither would any sensible predator. The flashing lights keep the worm safe. Then there's the deep sea shrimp, Acantherphyra purpurea. When it feels threatened, it spews a cloud of glowing goo from its mouth. Who doesn't run the other way when they've just been puked on? Plus, that puke attracts bigger predators who want to eat the shrimp's enemy. So what if you can't bioluminesce? No problem! There are other ways for living things to make bioluminescence work for them, even if they weren't born with the equipment to glow. Let's revisit the anglerfish moments before it tried to eat you. That glowing bait on top of its head? It comes from a pocket of skin called the esca. The esca holds bioluminescent bacteria. The anglerfish can't glow there by itself, so it holds a sack of glowing bacteria instead. Remember the firefly? It can actually make itself glow. Inside its lantern are two chemicals, a luciferin and a luciferase. When firefly luciferase and luciferin mix together in the presence of oxygen and fuel for the cell, called ATP, the chemical reaction gives off energy in the form of light. Once scientists figured out how the firefly creates its luciferase and luciferin, they used genetic engineering to make this light-producing reaction occur inside other living things that can't glow. For example, they inserted the genes, or instructions, for a cell to create firefly luciferase and luciferin into a tobacco plant. Once there, the tobacco plant followed the instructions slipped into its DNA and lit up like a Christmas tree. The beauty of bioluminescence, unlike the light from the sun or an incandescent bulb, is that it's not hot. It takes place in a range of temperatures that don't burn a living thing. And unlike a glow stick, which fades out as the chemicals inside get used up, bioluminescent reactions use replenishable resources. That's one reason engineers are trying to develop bioluminescent trees. Just think, if planted on the side of highways, they could light the way, using only oxygen and other freely available, clean resources to run. Talk about survival advantage! That could help our planet live longer. Do you find yourself thinking of other ways to put bioluminescence to good use? That glow stick you swing at a rave may help you find a mate, but how else can bioluminescence improve your survival? If you start thinking in this way, you have seen the light.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Imagine a place so dark you can't see the nose on your face. Eyes opened or closed, it's all the same because the sun never shines there. Up ahead, you see a light. When you creep in to investigate, a blue light flits around you. "I could watch this forever," you think. But you can't because the mouth of an anglerfish has just sprung open and eaten you alive. You are just one of many creatures at the bottom of the ocean who learn too late to appreciate the power of bioluminescence. Bioluminescence refers to the ability of certain living things to create light. The human body can make stuff like ear wax and toe nails, but these organisms can turn parts of their body into glow sticks. It's like nature made them ready to rave. Why? In one way or another, bioluminescence improves a living thing's chances of survival. Take the firefly. It's ability to glow green helps it attract a mate on a warm, summer night, but it's just one of many living things that can glow. The railroad worm, Phrixothrix hirtus, can light up its body in two colors: red and green. Would you eat something that looks like an airport runway? Neither would any sensible predator. The flashing lights keep the worm safe. Then there's the deep sea shrimp, Acantherphyra purpurea. When it feels threatened, it spews a cloud of glowing goo from its mouth. Who doesn't run the other way when they've just been puked on? Plus, that puke attracts bigger predators who want to eat the shrimp's enemy. So what if you can't bioluminesce? No problem! There are other ways for living things to make bioluminescence work for them, even if they weren't born with the equipment to glow. Let's revisit the anglerfish moments before it tried to eat you. That glowing bait on top of its head? It comes from a pocket of skin called the esca. The esca holds bioluminescent bacteria. The anglerfish can't glow there by itself, so it holds a sack of glowing bacteria instead. Remember the firefly? It can actually make itself glow. Inside its lantern are two chemicals, a luciferin and a luciferase. When firefly luciferase and luciferin mix together in the presence of oxygen and fuel for the cell, called ATP, the chemical reaction gives off energy in the form of light. Once scientists figured out how the firefly creates its luciferase and luciferin, they used genetic engineering to make this light-producing reaction occur inside other living things that can't glow. For example, they inserted the genes, or instructions, for a cell to create firefly luciferase and luciferin into a tobacco plant. Once there, the tobacco plant followed the instructions slipped into its DNA and lit up like a Christmas tree. The beauty of bioluminescence, unlike the light from the sun or an incandescent bulb, is that it's not hot. It takes place in a range of temperatures that don't burn a living thing. And unlike a glow stick, which fades out as the chemicals inside get used up, bioluminescent reactions use replenishable resources. That's one reason engineers are trying to develop bioluminescent trees. Just think, if planted on the side of highways, they could light the way, using only oxygen and other freely available, clean resources to run. Talk about survival advantage! That could help our planet live longer. Do you find yourself thinking of other ways to put bioluminescence to good use? That glow stick you swing at a rave may help you find a mate, but how else can bioluminescence improve your survival? If you start thinking in this way, you have seen the light.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Today, we're going to look at the world of Rome through the eyes of a young girl. Here she is, drawing a picture of herself in the atrium of her father's enormous house. Her name is Domitia, and she is just 5 years old. She has an older brother who is fourteen, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, named after her dad. Girls don't get these long names that boys have. What is worse is that Dad insists on calling all his daughters Domitia. "Domitia!" His call to Domitia drawing on the column, Domitia III. She has an older sister, Domitia II, who is 7 years old. And then there's Domitia I, who is ten. There would have been a Domitia IV, but mom died trying to give birth to her three years ago. Confused? The Romans were too. They could work out ancestry through the male line with the nice, tripartite names such as Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. But they got in a real mess over which Domitia was married to whom and was either the great aunt or the great stepmother and so on to whom when they came to write it down. Domitia III is not just drawing on the pillar, she's also watching the action. You see, it's early, in the time of day when all her dad's clients and friends come to see him at home to pay their respects. Lucius Popidius Secundus, a 17 year old, he wants to marry Domitia II within the next five to seven years, has come as well. He seems to be wooing not his future wife, but her dad. Poor Lucius, he does not know that Domitia's dad thinks he and his family are wealthy but still scumbags from the Subura. Afterall, it is the part of Rome full of barbers and prostitutes. Suddenly, all the men are leaving with Dad. It's the second hour and time for him to be in court with a sturdy audience of clients to applaud his rhetoric and hiss at his opponent. The house is now quieter. The men won't return for seven hours, not until dinner time. But what happens in the house for those seven hours? What do Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia do all day? Not an easy question! Everything written down by the Romans that we have today was written by men. This makes constructing the lives of women difficult. However, we can't have a history of just Roman men, so here it goes. We can begin in the atrium. There is a massive loom, on which Dad's latest wife is working on a new toga. Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia are tasked with spinning the wool that will be used to weave this mighty garment, 30 or more feet long and elliptical in shape. Romans loved the idea that their wives work wool. We know that because it's written on the gravestones of so many Roman women. Unlike women in Greece, Roman women go out the house and move about the city. They go to the baths in the morning to avoid the men or to separate baths that are for women only. Some do go in for the latest fad of the AD 70s: nude bathing with men present. Where they have no place is where the men are: in the Forum, in the Law Court, or in the Senate House. Their place in public is in the porticos with gardens, with sculpture, and with pathways for walking in. When Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia want to leave the house to go somewhere, like the Portico of Livia, they must get ready. Domitia II and Domitia III are ready, but Domitia I, who is betrothed to be married in two years to darling Philatus, isn't ready. She's not slow, she just has more to do. Being betrothed means she wears the insignia of betrothal: engagement rings and all the gifts Pilatus has given her - jewels, earrings, necklaces, and the pendants. She may even wear her myrtle crown. All this bling shouts, "I'm getting married to that 19 year old who gave me all this stuff I'm wearing!" While as they wait, Domitia II and Domitia III play with their dolls that mirror the image of their sister decked out to be married. One day, these dolls will be dedicated to the household gods on the day of their wedding. Okay, we're ready. The girls step into litters carried by some burly slaves. They also have a chaperone with them and will be meeting an aunt at the Porticus of Livia. Carried high on the shoulders of these slaves, the girls look out through the curtains to see the crowded streets below them. They traverse the city, pass the Coliseum, but then turn off to climb up the hill to the Porticus of Livia. It was built by Livia, the wife of the first emperor Augustus, on the site of the house of Vedius Pollio. He wasn't such a great guy. He once tried to feed a slave to the eels in his fish pond for simply dropping a dish. Luckily, the emperor was at the dinner and tamed his temper. The litters are placed on the ground and the girls get out and arm in arm, two by two, they ascend the steps into the enclosed garden with many columns. Domitia III shot off and is drawing on a column. Domitia II joins her but seeks to read the graffiti higher up on the column. She spots a drawing of gladiators and tries to imagine seeing them fighting, something she will never be permitted to do, except from the very rear of the Coliseum. From there, she will have a good view of the 50,000 spectators but will see little by way of blood and gore. If she really wanted a decent view, she could become a vestal virgin and would sit right down the front. But a career tending the sacred flame of Vesta is not to everybody's taste. Domitia I has met another ten year old also decked out in the insignia of betrothal. Home time. When they get there after the eighth hour, something is up. A smashed dish lies on the floor. All the slaves are being gathered together in the atrium and await the arrival of their master. Dad is going to go mad. He will not hit his children, but like many other Romans, he believes that slaves have to be punished. The whip lies ready for his arrival. No one knows who smashed the dish, but Dad will call the undertaker to torture it out of them, if he must. The doorkeeper opens the front door to the house. A hush comes over the anxious slaves. In walks not their master but, instead, a pregnant teenager. It is the master's eldest daughter, age 15, who is already a veteran of marriage and child birth. Guess what her name is. There is a five to ten percent chance she won't survive giving birth to her child, but, for now, she has come to dinner with her family. As a teenage mother, she has proved that she is a successful wife by bringing children and descendants for her husband, who will carry on his name in the future. The family head off to the dining room and are served dinner. It would seem Dad has had an invite to dinner elsewhere. With dinner concluded, the girls crossed the atrium to bid farewell to their older sister who is carried home in a litter, escorted by some of Dad's bodyguards. Returning to the house, the girls cross the atrium. The slaves, young and old, male and female, await the return of their owner. When he returns, he may exact vengeance, ensuring his power over the slaves is maintained through violence and terror, to which any slave could be subjected. But, for the girls, they head upstairs for the night, ready for bed.

Being betrothed means she wears the insignia of betrothal: engagement rings and all the gifts Pilatus has given her - jewels, earrings, necklaces, and the pendants. She may even wear her myrtle crown. All this bling shouts, "I'm getting married to that 19 year old who gave me all this stuff I'm wearing!" While as they wait, Domitia II and Domitia III play with their dolls that mirror the image of their sister decked out to be married. One day, these dolls will be dedicated to the household gods on the day of their wedding. Okay, we're ready. The girls step into litters carried by some burly slaves. They also have a chaperone with them and will be meeting an aunt at the Porticus of Livia. Carried high on the shoulders of these slaves, the girls look out through the curtains to see the crowded streets below them. They traverse the city, pass the Coliseum, but then turn off to climb up the hill to the Porticus of Livia. It was built by Livia, the wife of the first emperor Augustus, on the site of the house of Vedius Pollio. He wasn't such a great guy. He once tried to feed a slave to the eels in his fish pond for simply dropping a dish. Luckily, the emperor was at the dinner and tamed his temper. The litters are placed on the ground and the girls get out and arm in arm, two by two, they ascend the steps into the enclosed garden with many columns. Domitia III shot off and is drawing on a column. Domitia II joins her but seeks to read the graffiti higher up on the column. She spots a drawing of gladiators and tries to imagine seeing them fighting, something she will never be permitted to do, except from the very rear of the Coliseum. From there, she will have a good view of the 50,000 spectators but will see little by way of blood and gore. If she really wanted a decent view, she could become a vestal virgin and would sit right down the front. But a career tending the sacred flame of Vesta is not to everybody's taste. Domitia I has met another ten year old also decked out in the insignia of betrothal. Home time. When they get there after the eighth hour, something is up. A smashed dish lies on the floor. All the slaves are being gathered together in the atrium and await the arrival of their master. Dad is going to go mad. He will not hit his children, but like many other Romans, he believes that slaves have to be punished. The whip lies ready for his arrival. No one knows who smashed the dish, but Dad will call the undertaker to torture it out of them, if he must. The doorkeeper opens the front door to the house. A hush comes over the anxious slaves. In walks not their master but, instead, a pregnant teenager. It is the master's eldest daughter, age 15, who is already a veteran of marriage and child birth. Guess what her name is. There is a five to ten percent chance she won't survive giving birth to her child, but, for now, she has come to dinner with her family. As a teenage mother, she has proved that she is a successful wife by bringing children and descendants for her husband, who will carry on his name in the future. The family head off to the dining room and are served dinner. It would seem Dad has had an invite to dinner elsewhere. With dinner concluded, the girls crossed the atrium to bid farewell to their older sister who is carried home in a litter, escorted by some of Dad's bodyguards. Returning to the house, the girls cross the atrium. The slaves, young and old, male and female, await the return of their owner. When he returns, he may exact vengeance, ensuring his power over the slaves is maintained through violence and terror, to which any slave could be subjected. But, for the girls, they head upstairs for the night, ready for bed.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Today, we're going to look at the world of Rome through the eyes of a young girl. Here she is, drawing a picture of herself in the atrium of her father's enormous house. Her name is Domitia, and she is just 5 years old. She has an older brother who is fourteen, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, named after her dad. Girls don't get these long names that boys have. What is worse is that Dad insists on calling all his daughters Domitia. "Domitia!" His call to Domitia drawing on the column, Domitia III. She has an older sister, Domitia II, who is 7 years old. And then there's Domitia I, who is ten. There would have been a Domitia IV, but mom died trying to give birth to her three years ago. Confused? The Romans were too. They could work out ancestry through the male line with the nice, tripartite names such as Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. But they got in a real mess over which Domitia was married to whom and was either the great aunt or the great stepmother and so on to whom when they came to write it down. Domitia III is not just drawing on the pillar, she's also watching the action. You see, it's early, in the time of day when all her dad's clients and friends come to see him at home to pay their respects. Lucius Popidius Secundus, a 17 year old, he wants to marry Domitia II within the next five to seven years, has come as well. He seems to be wooing not his future wife, but her dad. Poor Lucius, he does not know that Domitia's dad thinks he and his family are wealthy but still scumbags from the Subura. Afterall, it is the part of Rome full of barbers and prostitutes. Suddenly, all the men are leaving with Dad. It's the second hour and time for him to be in court with a sturdy audience of clients to applaud his rhetoric and hiss at his opponent. The house is now quieter. The men won't return for seven hours, not until dinner time. But what happens in the house for those seven hours? What do Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia do all day? Not an easy question! Everything written down by the Romans that we have today was written by men. This makes constructing the lives of women difficult. However, we can't have a history of just Roman men, so here it goes. We can begin in the atrium. There is a massive loom, on which Dad's latest wife is working on a new toga. Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia are tasked with spinning the wool that will be used to weave this mighty garment, 30 or more feet long and elliptical in shape. Romans loved the idea that their wives work wool. We know that because it's written on the gravestones of so many Roman women. Unlike women in Greece, Roman women go out the house and move about the city. They go to the baths in the morning to avoid the men or to separate baths that are for women only. Some do go in for the latest fad of the AD 70s: nude bathing with men present. Where they have no place is where the men are: in the Forum, in the Law Court, or in the Senate House. Their place in public is in the porticos with gardens, with sculpture, and with pathways for walking in. When Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia want to leave the house to go somewhere, like the Portico of Livia, they must get ready. Domitia II and Domitia III are ready, but Domitia I, who is betrothed to be married in two years to darling Philatus, isn't ready. She's not slow, she just has more to do.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Your car, the heating system in your house, your gas stove. Most of the energy you use comes from fossil fuels, which present a couple of problems. First, there are limited supplies of fossil fuels, so the more we use, the less we've got. And second, the use of fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change because it releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Biofuels come from natural, renewable sources like plants, so they have the potential to reduce our reliance on those limited supply fossil fuels and reduce the risk of climate change. Most biofuels today are made from corn grain that is fermented into ethanol. But we have a limited supply of this corn, so it's not a solution to the limited supply part of the quandary. It also takes a lot of resources to grow corn grain. Strike 2! A potential solution: Using cellulose instead of corn grain to make ethanol. Cellulose is far more abundant than corn grain and takes less energy to produce. In fact, it's the most abundant organic molecule on the planet! Cellulose is the main ingredient found in a plant's cell wall. Plants generate cellulose from water and carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. So, where as using fossil fuels produce carbon dioxide, using cellulose-based ethanol might help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The main obstacle is that the cellulose molecule, a long, connected chain of glucose sugar protected by a tough, molecular sheath, is difficult to break apart. Creating cellulose-based ethanol means first unwrapping that protective sheath and then chopping up the cellulose into its individual glucose molecule. Only once we have unpacked each glucose molecule, can we begin fermentation. But some microorganisms, like bacteria or fungi, break down cellulose for energy all the time. For example, dairy cows eat foods like hay or alfalfa, which are full of cellulose. Microbes that live in their stomachs produce an enzyme called cellulase, which breaks apart the cellulose molecules so that the cow can use what's left for energy. Researchers are now studying these kinds of microorganisms in the hopes of finding better ways to break down cellulose so we can use it for our own energy needs. The solution, they think, lies in finding microbes in nature that can produce the kinds of cellulase enzymes that we need. This process of searching for species in nature that can produce valuable products is called bioprospecting. To test whether or not a sample of microbes can break down cellulose effectively, researchers first grow the microbe in a test tube. Then, they add a source of cellulose as the sole form of energy. If the microbe can't produce cellulase and break down cellulose, the test tube will remain unchanged. But if the microbe produces the enzymes we are looking for, it will be able to break down cellulose, use it for energy, and thrive in its test tube environment. If our microbial sample can break down the cellulose in the test tube, there is a chance we could use it to create a renewable and sustainable source of fuel for our cars from cellulose.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why do scientists want to replace corn as a source of biofuels?
Options: A. There is an unlimited supply of corn but it takes too many resources to grow it, B. Corn is the leading cause of climate change, C. Corn has a limited supply and requires a large amount of resources to grow it, D. Corn is not a renewable resource and would not work as a biofuel
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the main obstacle to creating cellulose-based ethanol?

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Your car, the heating system in your house, your gas stove. Most of the energy you use comes from fossil fuels, which present a couple of problems. First, there are limited supplies of fossil fuels, so the more we use, the less we've got. And second, the use of fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change because it releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Biofuels come from natural, renewable sources like plants, so they have the potential to reduce our reliance on those limited supply fossil fuels and reduce the risk of climate change. Most biofuels today are made from corn grain that is fermented into ethanol. But we have a limited supply of this corn, so it's not a solution to the limited supply part of the quandary. It also takes a lot of resources to grow corn grain. Strike 2! A potential solution: Using cellulose instead of corn grain to make ethanol. Cellulose is far more abundant than corn grain and takes less energy to produce. In fact, it's the most abundant organic molecule on the planet! Cellulose is the main ingredient found in a plant's cell wall. Plants generate cellulose from water and carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. So, where as using fossil fuels produce carbon dioxide, using cellulose-based ethanol might help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The main obstacle is that the cellulose molecule, a long, connected chain of glucose sugar protected by a tough, molecular sheath, is difficult to break apart. Creating cellulose-based ethanol means first unwrapping that protective sheath and then chopping up the cellulose into its individual glucose molecule. Only once we have unpacked each glucose molecule, can we begin fermentation. But some microorganisms, like bacteria or fungi, break down cellulose for energy all the time. For example, dairy cows eat foods like hay or alfalfa, which are full of cellulose. Microbes that live in their stomachs produce an enzyme called cellulase, which breaks apart the cellulose molecules so that the cow can use what's left for energy. Researchers are now studying these kinds of microorganisms in the hopes of finding better ways to break down cellulose so we can use it for our own energy needs. The solution, they think, lies in finding microbes in nature that can produce the kinds of cellulase enzymes that we need. This process of searching for species in nature that can produce valuable products is called bioprospecting. To test whether or not a sample of microbes can break down cellulose effectively, researchers first grow the microbe in a test tube. Then, they add a source of cellulose as the sole form of energy. If the microbe can't produce cellulase and break down cellulose, the test tube will remain unchanged. But if the microbe produces the enzymes we are looking for, it will be able to break down cellulose, use it for energy, and thrive in its test tube environment. If our microbial sample can break down the cellulose in the test tube, there is a chance we could use it to create a renewable and sustainable source of fuel for our cars from cellulose.

**Transcript**:
so raise your hand if you know someone in your immediate family or circle of friends who suffers from some form of mental illness I thought so not surprised and raise your hand if you think that basic research on fruit flies has anything to do with understanding mental illness and humans yeah I thought so I'm also not surprised I can see I got my work cut out for me here as we heard from dr. ensel this morning psychiatric disorders like autism depression and schizophrenia take a terrible toll on human suffering we know much less about their treatment and the understanding of their basic mechanisms than we do about diseases of the body think about it in 2013 the second decade of the millennium if you're concerned about a cancer diagnosis and you go to your doctor you get bone scans biopsies and blood tests in 2013 if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis you go to your doctor and what do you get a questionnaire part of the reason for this is that we have an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders we tend to view them and the popular press aids and abets this view as chemical imbalances in the brain as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup full of dopamine serotonin and norepinephrine this view is conditioned by the fact that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders like prozac act by globally changing brain chemistry as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup but that can't be the answer because these drugs actually don't work all that well a lot of people won't take them or stop taking them because of their unpleasant side effects these drugs have so many side effects because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder is a bit like trying to change your engine oil by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block some of it will dribble into the right place but a lot of it will do more harm than good now an emerging view that you also heard about from dr. ensel this morning is that psychiatric disorders are actually disturbances of neural circuits that mediate emotion mood and affect when we think about cognition we analogize the brain to a computer that's no problem well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion it's just that we don't tend to think about it that way but we know we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatric disorders because of the overwhelming dominance of this chemical imbalance hypothesis now it's not that chemicals are not important in psychiatric disorders it's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup rather they're released in very specific locations and they act on specific synapses to change the flow of information in the brain so if we ever really want to understand the biological basis of psychiatric disorders we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain where these chemicals act otherwise we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences now to begin to overcome our ignorant of the role of brain chemistry and brain circuitry it's helpful to work on what we biologists call model organisms animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to molecularly identify and pinpoint specific classes of neurons as you heard about an Alan Jones's talk this morning moreover once we can do that we can actually activate specific neurons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons so if we inhibit a particular type of neuron and we find that a behavior is blocked we can conclude that those neurons are necessary for that behavior on the other hand if we activate a group of neurons and we find that that produces behavior we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior so in this way by doing this kind of tests we can draw cause-and-effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particularly havior something that is extremely difficult if not impossible to do right now in humans but can an organism like a fruit fly which is it's a great model organism because it's got a small brain it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors it breeds quickly and it's cheap but can an organism like this teach us anything about emotion like states do these ordinance even have emotion like States or are they just little digital robots Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behaviors as he wrote in his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals and my eponymous colleague Seymour Benzer believed it as well Seymour is the man that introduced the use of Drosophila here at Caltech in the 60s as a model organism to study the connection between genes and behavior seem were recruited me to Caltech in the late 1980s he was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here and Seymour taught me both to love flies and also to play with science so how do we how do we ask this question it's one thing to believe that flies have emotion like States but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not now in humans we often infer emotional states as you'll hear later today from facial expressions however it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies it's kind of like landing on Mars and looking out the window of your spaceship at all the little green men who are surrounding it and trying to figure out how do I find out if they have emotions or not what can we do it's not so easy well one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion like states such as arousal and see if we can identify any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties so three important ones that I can think of our persistence gradations and intensity and valence persistence means long lasting we all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone rotations of intensity means what it sounds like you can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of emotion of an emotion if you're a little bit unhappy the corners of your mouth turned down and you sniffle and if you're very unhappy tears pour down your face and you might sob valence means good or bad positive or negative so we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table you know the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger the more vigorously you try to swat it away and it seems to keep getting irritated so we built a device which we call a puff oh man in which we could deliver little grief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench and blow them away and what we found is that if we gave these flies in the puffs I'm at several puffs in a row they became somewhat hyperactive and continue to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped and took a while to come to calm down so we quantified this behavior using look custom locomotor tracking software developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona who's in the electrical engineering division here Caltech and what this quantification showed us is that upon experiencing a train of these air puffs the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyper activity which is persistent long lasting and also appears to be graded more puffs or more intense puffs make the state last for a longer period of time so now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state so we decided to use our puffs a mat and our automated tracking software to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs and this is one of the great things about fruit flies there are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation so doing this screen we discovered one mutant that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor that's right flies like people have dopamine and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and I have dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain including an attention arousal reward and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse Parkinson's disease and ADHD now in genetics it's a little counterintuitive we tend to infer the normal function of something by what doesn't happen when we take it away by the opposite of what we see when we take it away so when we take away the dopamine receptor and the Flies take longer to calm down from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine is to cause the Flies to calm down faster after the puffs and that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans indeed if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies by feeding them cocaine after getting the appropriate DEA license oh my god we find indeed that these cocaine fed flies calm down faster than normal flies do and that's also reminiscent of ADHD which is often treated with drugs like ritalin that act similarly to cocaine so slowly I began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder now how far does this analogy go as many of you know individuals afflicted with ADHD also have learning disabilities is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies remarkably the answer is yes as Seymour showed back in the 1970s flies like songbirds as you just heard are capable of learning you can train a fly to avoid an odor shown here in blue if you pair that odor with a shock then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose between a tube with the shock paired odor and another odor it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock well if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies they don't learn their learning score is zero they flunk out of Caltech now so that means that these flies have two abnormalities or phenotypes as we geneticists call them that one finds an ADHD hyperactivity and learning disability now what's the causal relationship if anything between these phenotypes in ADHD it's often assumed that the hyperactivity causes the learning disability the kids can't sit still long enough to focus so they don't learn but it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities that caused the hyperactivity because the kids can't learn they look for other things to distract their attention and a final possibility is that there no relationship at all between learning disabilities and hyperactivity but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD now people have been wondering about this for a long time in humans but in flies we can actually test this and the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics we take our dopamine receptor mutant flies and we genetically restore or cure the dopamine receptor by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene back into the fly brain but in each fly we put it back only into certain neurons and not in others and then we test each of their these flies for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity remarkably we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities if we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back in this elliptical structure called the central complex the Flies are no longer hyperactive but they still can't learn on the other hand if we put the receptor back in a different structure called the mushroom body the learning deficit is rescued the Flies learn well but they're still hyperactive what that tells us is that dopamine is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup rather it's acting to control two different functions on two different circuits so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies that the same receptor is controlling two different functions in two different regions of the brain whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans we don't know but these kinds of results should at least cause us to consider that possibility so these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup and it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders just by changing the flavor of the soup what we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge to try to design a new generation of treatments that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders if we can do that we may be able to cure these disorders without the unpleasant side effects putting the oil back in our metal engines just where it's needed thank you very much

**Transcript**:
so raise your hand if you know someone in your immediate family or circle of friends who suffers from some form of mental illness I thought so not surprised and raise your hand if you think that basic research on fruit flies has anything to do with understanding mental illness and humans yeah I thought so I'm also not surprised I can see I got my work cut out for me here as we heard from dr. ensel this morning psychiatric disorders like autism depression and schizophrenia take a terrible toll on human suffering we know much less about their treatment and the understanding of their basic mechanisms than we do about diseases of the body think about it in 2013 the second decade of the millennium if you're concerned about a cancer diagnosis and you go to your doctor you get bone scans biopsies and blood tests in 2013 if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis you go to your doctor and what do you get a questionnaire part of the reason for this is that we have an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders we tend to view them and the popular press aids and abets this view as chemical imbalances in the brain as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup full of dopamine serotonin and norepinephrine this view is conditioned by the fact that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders like prozac act by globally changing brain chemistry as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup but that can't be the answer because these drugs actually don't work all that well a lot of people won't take them or stop taking them because of their unpleasant side effects these drugs have so many side effects because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder is a bit like trying to change your engine oil by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block some of it will dribble into the right place but a lot of it will do more harm than good now an emerging view that you also heard about from dr. ensel this morning is that psychiatric disorders are actually disturbances of neural circuits that mediate emotion mood and affect when we think about cognition we analogize the brain to a computer that's no problem well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion it's just that we don't tend to think about it that way but we know we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatric disorders because of the overwhelming dominance of this chemical imbalance hypothesis now it's not that chemicals are not important in psychiatric disorders it's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup rather they're released in very specific locations and they act on specific synapses to change the flow of information in the brain so if we ever really want to understand the biological basis of psychiatric disorders we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain where these chemicals act otherwise we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences now to begin to overcome our ignorant of the role of brain chemistry and brain circuitry it's helpful to work on what we biologists call model organisms animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to molecularly identify and pinpoint specific classes of neurons as you heard about an Alan Jones's talk this morning moreover once we can do that we can actually activate specific neurons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons so if we inhibit a particular type of neuron and we find that a behavior is blocked we can conclude that those neurons are necessary for that behavior on the other hand if we activate a group of neurons and we find that that produces behavior we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior so in this way by doing this kind of tests we can draw cause-and-effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particularly havior something that is extremely difficult if not impossible to do right now in humans but can an organism like a fruit fly which is it's a great model organism because it's got a small brain it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors it breeds quickly and it's cheap but can an organism like this teach us anything about emotion like states do these ordinance even have emotion like States or are they just little digital robots Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behaviors as he wrote in his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals and my eponymous colleague Seymour Benzer believed it as well Seymour is the man that introduced the use of Drosophila here at Caltech in the 60s as a model organism to study the connection between genes and behavior seem were recruited me to Caltech in the late 1980s he was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here and Seymour taught me both to love flies and also to play with science so how do we how do we ask this question it's one thing to believe that flies have emotion like States but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not now in humans we often infer emotional states as you'll hear later today from facial expressions however it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies it's kind of like landing on Mars and looking out the window of your spaceship at all the little green men who are surrounding it and trying to figure out how do I find out if they have emotions or not what can we do it's not so easy well one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion like states such as arousal and see if we can identify any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties so three important ones that I can think of our persistence gradations and intensity and valence persistence means long lasting we all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone rotations of intensity means what it sounds like you can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of emotion of an emotion if you're a little bit unhappy the corners of your mouth turned down and you sniffle and if you're very unhappy tears pour down your face and you might sob valence means good or bad positive or negative so we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table you know the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger the more vigorously you try to swat it away and it seems to keep getting irritated so we built a device which we call a puff oh man in which we could deliver little grief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench and blow them away and what we found is that if we gave these flies in the puffs I'm at several puffs in a row they became somewhat hyperactive and continue to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped and took a while to come to calm down so we quantified this behavior using look custom locomotor tracking

of their these flies for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity remarkably we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities if we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back in this elliptical structure called the central complex the Flies are no longer hyperactive but they still can't learn on the other hand if we put the receptor back in a different structure called the mushroom body the learning deficit is rescued the Flies learn well but they're still hyperactive what that tells us is that dopamine is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup rather it's acting to control two different functions on two different circuits so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies that the same receptor is controlling two different functions in two different regions of the brain whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans we don't know but these kinds of results should at least cause us to consider that possibility so these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup and it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders just by changing the flavor of the soup what we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge to try to design a new generation of treatments that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders if we can do that we may be able to cure these disorders without the unpleasant side effects putting the oil back in our metal engines just where it's needed thank you very much

**Transcript**:
so raise your hand if you know someone in your immediate family or circle of friends who suffers from some form of mental illness I thought so not surprised and raise your hand if you think that basic research on fruit flies has anything to do with understanding mental illness and humans yeah I thought so I'm also not surprised I can see I got my work cut out for me here as we heard from dr. ensel this morning psychiatric disorders like autism depression and schizophrenia take a terrible toll on human suffering we know much less about their treatment and the understanding of their basic mechanisms than we do about diseases of the body think about it in 2013 the second decade of the millennium if you're concerned about a cancer diagnosis and you go to your doctor you get bone scans biopsies and blood tests in 2013 if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis you go to your doctor and what do you get a questionnaire part of the reason for this is that we have an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders we tend to view them and the popular press aids and abets this view as chemical imbalances in the brain as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup full of dopamine serotonin and norepinephrine this view is conditioned by the fact that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders like prozac act by globally changing brain chemistry as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup but that can't be the answer because these drugs actually don't work all that well a lot of people won't take them or stop taking them because of their unpleasant side effects these drugs have so many side effects because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder is a bit like trying to change your engine oil by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block some of it will dribble into the right place but a lot of it will do more harm than good now an emerging view that you also heard about from dr. ensel this morning is that psychiatric disorders are actually disturbances of neural circuits that mediate emotion mood and affect when we think about cognition we analogize the brain to a computer that's no problem well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion it's just that we don't tend to think about it that way but we know we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatric disorders because of the overwhelming dominance of this chemical imbalance hypothesis now it's not that chemicals are not important in psychiatric disorders it's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup rather they're released in very specific locations and they act on specific synapses to change the flow of information in the brain so if we ever really want to understand the biological basis of psychiatric disorders we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain where these chemicals act otherwise we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences now to begin to overcome our ignorant of the role of brain chemistry and brain circuitry it's helpful to work on what we biologists call model organisms animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to molecularly identify and pinpoint specific classes of neurons as you heard about an Alan Jones's talk this morning moreover once we can do that we can actually activate specific neurons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons so if we inhibit a particular type of neuron and we find that a behavior is blocked we can conclude that those neurons are necessary for that behavior on the other hand if we activate a group of neurons and we find that that produces behavior we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior so in this way by doing this kind of tests we can draw cause-and-effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particularly havior something that is extremely difficult if not impossible to do right now in humans but can an organism like a fruit fly which is it's a great model organism because it's got a small brain it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors it breeds quickly and it's cheap but can an organism like this teach us anything about emotion like states do these ordinance even have emotion like States or are they just little digital robots Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behaviors as he wrote in his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals and my eponymous colleague Seymour Benzer believed it as well Seymour is the man that introduced the use of Drosophila here at Caltech in the 60s as a model organism to study the connection between genes and behavior seem were recruited me to Caltech in the late 1980s he was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here and Seymour taught me both to love flies and also to play with science so how do we how do we ask this question it's one thing to believe that flies have emotion like States but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not now in humans we often infer emotional states as you'll hear later today from facial expressions however it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies it's kind of like landing on Mars and looking out the window of your spaceship at all the little green men who are surrounding it and trying to figure out how do I find out if they have emotions or not what can we do it's not so easy well one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion like states such as arousal and see if we can identify any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties so three important ones that I can think of our persistence gradations and intensity and valence persistence means long lasting we all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone rotations of intensity means what it sounds like you can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of emotion of an emotion if you're a little bit unhappy the corners of your mouth turned down and you sniffle and if you're very unhappy tears pour down your face and you might sob valence means good or bad positive or negative so we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table you know the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger the more vigorously you try to swat it away and it seems to keep getting irritated so we built a device which we call a puff oh man in which we could deliver little grief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench and blow them away and what we found is that if we gave these flies in the puffs I'm at several puffs in a row they became somewhat hyperactive and continue to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped and took a while to come to calm down so we quantified this behavior using look custom locomotor tracking software developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona who's in the electrical engineering division here Caltech and what this quantification showed us is that upon experiencing a train of these air puffs the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyper activity which is persistent long lasting and also appears to be graded more puffs or more intense puffs make the state last for a longer period of time so now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state so we decided to use our puffs a mat and our automated tracking software to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs and this is one of the great things about fruit flies there are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation so doing this screen we discovered one mutant that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor that's right flies like people have dopamine and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and I have dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain including an attention arousal reward and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse Parkinson's disease and ADHD now in genetics it's a little counterintuitive we tend to infer the normal function of something by what doesn't happen when we take it away by the opposite of what we see when we take it away so when we take away the dopamine receptor and the Flies take longer to calm down from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine is to cause the Flies to calm down faster after the puffs and that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans indeed if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies by feeding them cocaine after getting the appropriate DEA license oh my god we find indeed that these cocaine fed flies calm down faster than normal flies do and that's also reminiscent of ADHD which is often treated with drugs like ritalin that act similarly to cocaine so slowly I began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder now how far does this analogy go as many of you know individuals afflicted with ADHD also have learning disabilities is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies remarkably the answer is yes as Seymour showed back in the 1970s flies like songbirds as you just heard are capable of learning you can train a fly to avoid an odor shown here in blue if you pair that odor with a shock then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose between a tube with the shock paired odor and another odor it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock well if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies they don't learn their learning score is zero they flunk out of Caltech now so that means that these flies have two abnormalities or phenotypes as we geneticists call them that one finds an ADHD hyperactivity and learning disability now what's the causal relationship if anything between these phenotypes in ADHD it's often assumed that the hyperactivity causes the learning disability the kids can't sit still long enough to focus so they don't learn but it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities that caused the hyperactivity because the kids can't learn they look for other things to distract their attention and a final possibility is that there no relationship at all between learning disabilities and hyperactivity but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD now people have been wondering about this for a long time in humans but in flies we can actually test this and the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics we take our dopamine receptor mutant flies and we genetically restore or cure the dopamine receptor by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene back into the fly brain but in each fly we put it back only into certain neurons and not in others and then we test each

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] when I was considering a career in the art world I took a course in London and one of my supervisors was this IRAs Italian called Petro who drank too much smoked too much and swore much too much but he was a a passionate teacher and I remember one of our earlier classes with him he was projecting images on the wall asking us to to think about them and he put up an image of a painting it's a landscape with figures semi-dressed drinking wine there was a nude woman in the in the lower foreground and on on the hillside in the back there was a figure of the mythological God bacus and he said what is this and I no one else said so I put up my hand and I said it's a banal B Tian he said it's a what I thought maybe I pronounced it wrong it's a bar Canal by tishan he said it's a what I said it's a a bakanal bitian he said you both Bess Bookworm it's a orgy as I said he swore too much there was an important lesson for me in that Petro was suspicious of formal art training art history training because he was he feared that it filled people up with jargon and then they just classified things rather than looking at them and he wanted wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary and he wanted us to use our eyes and he was especially Evangelical about this message because he was losing his sight he wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects what is it how is it made why was it made how is it used and these were important lessons to me when I subse became a professional art historian my my kind of Eureka moment came a few years later when I was studying the art of the Courts of Northern Europe and of course it was very much uh discussed in terms of the paintings and the sculptures and the architecture of the day but as I began to read historical documents and contemporary descriptions I found there was a kind of a missing component for everywhere I came across descriptions of tapestries tapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages and really well into the 18th century and it was pretty apparent why tapestries were portable you could roll them up send them ahead of you and in the time it took to hang them up you could transform a cold dank interior into a richly colored setting tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be Associated or even themselves and in addition to that tapestries were hugely expensive they required scores of Highly skilled Weavers working over extended periods of time with very expensive materials the wools the silks even Gold and Silver Thread so all in all in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda well I became a a tapestry historian in due course I ended up as a curator at the Metropolitan Museum because I saw the Met as one of the few places where I could organize really big exhibitions about the subject I cared so passionately about and in about 1997 the then director Philipe deont belloo gave me the go-ahead to organize an exhibition for 2002 we normally have these very long leadin times it wasn't straightforward it's no longer a question of chucking a tapestry in the back of a car they have to be wound on huge rollers shipped in oversized Freight some of them were so big we had to to get them into the museum we had to take them up the the great steps at the front we thought very hard about how to present this Unknown Subject to a modern audience the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded the placing of Lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread the labeling you know we live in an age where we're so used to television images and photographs a one hit image these were big complex things of almost like cartoons with multiple narratives we had to draw our audience in get them to slow down to explore the objects there was a lot of skepticism on the opening night I overheard one of the senior members of Staff saying this is going to be a bomb but in reality in the course of the coming weeks and months hundreds of thousands of people came to see the show the exhibition was designed to be an experience and tapestr are hard to reproduce in photographs so I want you to use your imaginations thinking of these wall High objects some of them 10 m wide depicting lavish Court scenes with c and dandies who look quite at home in the pages of of the fashion Press today thick woods with Hunters crashing through the undergrowth in pursuit of wild boes and deer violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism I remember taking my son's school class he was eight at the time and all the little boys they kind of you know they were little boys and then the thing that caught their attention was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog pooping in the foreground kind of an iny face joke by the artist and there you just imagine them but it brought it alive to them I think they suddenly saw that these these weren't just old faded tapestries these were images of the world in the past and it was the same for our audience and for me as a curator I felt proud I I felt i' shift did the needle a little through this experience that could only be created in a museum i' opened up the eyes of my audience historians artists press the general public to the beauty of this of this lost medium a few years later I was invited to be the director of the museum and after I got over that who me the tapestry geek I don't wear a tie I realized in fact I believed passionately in that curated Museum experience we live in an age of ubiquitous information and sort of Just Add Water expertise but there is nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well- told narrative what the curator does the interpretation of a a complex esoteric subject in a way that retains the Integrity of the subject but makes it unpacks it for a general audience and that to me today is now the The Challenge and the fun of my of my job supporting the vision of my curators whether it's an exhibition of samurai swords early Byzantine artifacts Renaissance portraits or the show we heard mentioned earlier the Queen show with which we enjoyed so much success last summer that was an interesting case in the late spring early summer of of 2010 shortly after McQueen's suicide our curator of costume Andrew Bolton came to see me and and said I've been thinking of doing a show on McQueen and now is the moment we have to we have to do it fast it wasn't easy uh uh McQueen had worked throughout his career with a small team of designers and managers who were very protective of his legacy Pat Andrew went to London and worked with them over the summer and won their confidence and that of the designers who created his amazing fashion shows which were works of performance art in their own right and we proceeded to do something at the Museum I think we've never done before it wasn't just just standard installation in fact we RI down the galleries to recreate entirely different settings uh a recreation of his first Studio a Hall of Mirrors a curiosity box a sunken ship a burnt out interior with videos and soundtracks that range from operatic Aras to pigs fornicating and in this extraordinary setting the costumes were like actors and actresses or living sculptures it could have been a train wreck it could have looked like shot windows on Fifth Avenue at Christmas but because of the way that Andrew connected with the McQueen team he was channeling the rawness and the Brilliance of McQueen and the show was quite Transcendent and it became a phenomenon in in its own right by the end of the show we had people queuing for four or five hours to get into the show but no one really complained I heard over and over again wow that was worth it it was such a visceral emotive experience now I've described two very immersive exhibitions but I also believe that collections individual objects can also have that same power the Met was set up not as a museum of American art but of an encyclopedic Museum and today 140 years later that vision is as preent as ever because of course we live in a world of crisis of Challenge and we're exposed to it through the 24/7 news reels it's in our galleries that we can unpack the the civilizations the cultures that that we are seeing the current manifestation of whether it's Libya Egypt Syria it's in our galleries that we can explain and give greater understanding I mean our new Islamic galleries are a case in point opened 10 years almost to the week after 911 I think for most Americans knowledge of the uh Islamic world was pretty slight before 9/11 and then it was thrust upon us in one of America's Darkest Hours and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event now in our galleries we Show 14 centuries of the development of different Islamic cultures across ofast Geographic spread and again hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last October I I'm often asked is digital media replacing the museum and I think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion I mean don't get me wrong I'm I'm a huge advocate of the web it gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe but nothing replaces the authenticity of the object presented with passion scholarship bringing people face to face with our objects is a way of bringing them face to face with people across time across space whose lives may have been very different to our own but who like us had hopes and dreams frustrations and achievements in their lives and I think this is a process that helps us better understand our ourselves helps us make better decisions about where we're going the Great Hall at the Met is one of the great portals of the world or inspiring like a medieval Cathedral from there you can walk in any direction to almost any culture i frequently go out into the Hall in the Galleries and I watch our visitors coming in some of them are comfortable they feel at home they know what they're looking for others are very uneasy it's an intimidating place they feel that the institution is elitist I'm working to try and break down that sense of that elitism I want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind where they're prepared to be a little bit lost to explore to see the UNF familiar in the familiar or to try the unknown because for us it's all about bringing them face to face with great works of art capturing them at that moment of discomfort when the inclination is kind of to reach for your iPhone or your blackberry but to create a Zone where their curiosity can expand and whether it's in the the expression of a Greek sculpture that reminds you of a friend or a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry or to be bring it back to my tutor Petro those dancing figures who are indeed knocking back the wine and that nude figure in the left foreground wow she is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality in that moment our scholarship can tell you that this is a banal but if we're doing our job right and you've checked the Jaron at the front door trust your instinct you know it's an orgy thank you

people came to see the show the exhibition was designed to be an experience and tapestr are hard to reproduce in photographs so I want you to use your imaginations thinking of these wall High objects some of them 10 m wide depicting lavish Court scenes with c and dandies who look quite at home in the pages of of the fashion Press today thick woods with Hunters crashing through the undergrowth in pursuit of wild boes and deer violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism I remember taking my son's school class he was eight at the time and all the little boys they kind of you know they were little boys and then the thing that caught their attention was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog pooping in the foreground kind of an iny face joke by the artist and there you just imagine them but it brought it alive to them I think they suddenly saw that these these weren't just old faded tapestries these were images of the world in the past and it was the same for our audience and for me as a curator I felt proud I I felt i' shift did the needle a little through this experience that could only be created in a museum i' opened up the eyes of my audience historians artists press the general public to the beauty of this of this lost medium a few years later I was invited to be the director of the museum and after I got over that who me the tapestry geek I don't wear a tie I realized in fact I believed passionately in that curated Museum experience we live in an age of ubiquitous information and sort of Just Add Water expertise but there is nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well- told narrative what the curator does the interpretation of a a complex esoteric subject in a way that retains the Integrity of the subject but makes it unpacks it for a general audience and that to me today is now the The Challenge and the fun of my of my job supporting the vision of my curators whether it's an exhibition of samurai swords early Byzantine artifacts Renaissance portraits or the show we heard mentioned earlier the Queen show with which we enjoyed so much success last summer that was an interesting case in the late spring early summer of of 2010 shortly after McQueen's suicide our curator of costume Andrew Bolton came to see me and and said I've been thinking of doing a show on McQueen and now is the moment we have to we have to do it fast it wasn't easy uh uh McQueen had worked throughout his career with a small team of designers and managers who were very protective of his legacy Pat Andrew went to London and worked with them over the summer and won their confidence and that of the designers who created his amazing fashion shows which were works of performance art in their own right and we proceeded to do something at the Museum I think we've never done before it wasn't just just standard installation in fact we RI down the galleries to recreate entirely different settings uh a recreation of his first Studio a Hall of Mirrors a curiosity box a sunken ship a burnt out interior with videos and soundtracks that range from operatic Aras to pigs fornicating and in this extraordinary setting the costumes were like actors and actresses or living sculptures it could have been a train wreck it could have looked like shot windows on Fifth Avenue at Christmas but because of the way that Andrew connected with the McQueen team he was channeling the rawness and the Brilliance of McQueen and the show was quite Transcendent and it became a phenomenon in in its own right by the end of the show we had people queuing for four or five hours to get into the show but no one really complained I heard over and over again wow that was worth it it was such a visceral emotive experience now I've described two very immersive exhibitions but I also believe that collections individual objects can also have that same power the Met was set up not as a museum of American art but of an encyclopedic Museum and today 140 years later that vision is as preent as ever because of course we live in a world of crisis of Challenge and we're exposed to it through the 24/7 news reels it's in our galleries that we can unpack the the civilizations the cultures that that we are seeing the current manifestation of whether it's Libya Egypt Syria it's in our galleries that we can explain and give greater understanding I mean our new Islamic galleries are a case in point opened 10 years almost to the week after 911 I think for most Americans knowledge of the uh Islamic world was pretty slight before 9/11 and then it was thrust upon us in one of America's Darkest Hours and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event now in our galleries we Show 14 centuries of the development of different Islamic cultures across ofast Geographic spread and again hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last October I I'm often asked is digital media replacing the museum and I think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion I mean don't get me wrong I'm I'm a huge advocate of the web it gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe but nothing replaces the authenticity of the object presented with passion scholarship bringing people face to face with our objects is a way of bringing them face to face with people across time across space whose lives may have been very different to our own but who like us had hopes and dreams frustrations and achievements in their lives and I think this is a process that helps us better understand our ourselves helps us make better decisions about where we're going the Great Hall at the Met is one of the great portals of the world or inspiring like a medieval Cathedral from there you can walk in any direction to almost any culture i frequently go out into the Hall in the Galleries and I watch our visitors coming in some of them are comfortable they feel at home they know what they're looking for others are very uneasy it's an intimidating place they feel that the institution is elitist I'm working to try and break down that sense of that elitism I want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind where they're prepared to be a little bit lost to explore to see the UNF familiar in the familiar or to try the unknown because for us it's all about bringing them face to face with great works of art capturing them at that moment of discomfort when the inclination is kind of to reach for your iPhone or your blackberry but to create a Zone where their curiosity can expand and whether it's in the the expression of a Greek sculpture that reminds you of a friend or a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry or to be bring it back to my tutor Petro those dancing figures who are indeed knocking back the wine and that nude figure in the left foreground wow she is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality in that moment our scholarship can tell you that this is a banal but if we're doing our job right and you've checked the Jaron at the front door trust your instinct you know it's an orgy thank you

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Earwig, an insect, generally classified within the order dermaptera. The common name of the insects we know as earwigs is exactly that, common, and is based mainly in folklore. It's rumored that these so-called earwigs crawl into your ear at night and tunnel into your brain, but this is false. Sure, an earwig may, on rare occasion, climb into the ear of an unsuspecting sleeper, but, really, who can blame them? Ear canals are warm and dark, the perfect home for a creepy-crawly like this one. The important thing to remember is that even if an earwig found its way into your ear, it would never eat through your eardrum. Despite the erroneous origins of these trumped-up folk tales, they've been in place a long time. The word earwig comes from the Old English word earwicga, a compound of ear, meaning ear, of course, and wigca. Scholars believe that wigca shares a root with words like wiggle and wag, and that it most likely referred to a creature that moves quickly. Unfortunately for this innocent little insect, even its scientific name gives it a bad rap. Because of the large, pencil-like cerci on the tail and of its abdomen, scientists associate earwigs with a pair of scissors, calling them forficula auricularia, literally little scissors of the ear.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby One of the reasons that I'm fascinated by the ocean is that it's really an alien world on our own planet. From our perspective, sitting on the shoreline or even out on a boat, we're given only the tiniest glimpses at the real action that's happening beneath the surface of the waves. And even if you were able to go down there, you wouldn't see very much because light doesn't travel very far in the ocean. So, to answer questions about how the ocean works, in my research, we use sound. We use sonars that send out pulses of sound made up of a number of different frequencies, or pitches, that are shown with different colors. That sound bounces off things in the habitat and comes back to us. If it were to bounce off this dolphin, the signal we got back would look very much like the one we sent out where all the colors are represented pretty evenly. However, if we were to bounce that same sound off of a squid, which in this case is about the same size as that dolphin, we'd instead only get the lowest frequencies back strongly, shown here in the red. And if we were to look at the prey of that squid, the tiny little krill that they're eating, we would instead only get the highest frequencies back. And so by looking at this, we can tell what kinds of animals are in the ocean, we can look at how dense they are, where they are distributed, look at their interactions and even their behavior to start to study the ecology of the ocean. When we do that, we come up with something sort of surprising: on average, there isn't very much food in the ocean. So even in places which we think of as rich, the coasts, we're talking about two parts of every million contain food. So what does that mean? Well, that means that in the volume of this theater, there would be one tub of movie theater popcorn available to be eaten. But of course, it wouldn't be collected for you neatly in this bucket. Instead, you'd actually have to be swimming through this entire volume Willy Wonka style, picking off individual kernels of popcorn, or perhaps if you were lucky, getting a hold of a few small clumps. But, of course, if you were in the ocean, this popcorn wouldn't be sitting here waiting for you to eat it. It would, instead, be trying to avoid becoming your dinner. So I want to know how do animals solve this challenge? We're going to talk about animals in the Bering Sea. This is where you may have see "Deadliest Catch" framed, in the northernmost part of the Pacific Ocean. We've been looking specifically at krill, one of the most important food items in this habitat. These half-inch long shrimp-like critters are about the caloric equivalent of a heavily buttered kernel of popcorn. And they're eaten by everything from birds and fur seals that pick them up one at a time to large whales that engulf them in huge mouthfuls. So I'm going to focus in the area around three breeding colonies for birds and fur seals in the southeastern Bering Sea. And this is a map of that habitat that we made making maps of food the way we've always made maps of food. This is how many krill are in this area of the ocean. Red areas represent lots of krill and purple basically none. And you can see that around the northern two most islands, which are highlighted with white circles because they are so tiny, it looks like there's a lot of food to be eaten. And yet, the fur seals and birds on these islands are crashing. Their populations are declining despite decades of protection. And while on that southern island at the very bottom of the screen it doesn't look like there's anything to eat, those populations are doing incredibly well. So this left us with a dilemma. Our observations of food don't make any sense in the context of our observations of these animals. So we started to think about how we could do this differently. And this map shows not how many krill there are, but how many clumps of krill there are, how aggregated are they. And what you get is a very different picture of the landscape. Now that southern island looks like a pretty good place to be, and when we combine this with other information about prey, it starts to explain the population observations. But we can also ask that question differently. We can have the animals tell us what's important. By tagging and tracking these animals and looking at how they use this habitat, we are able to say, "What matters to you?" about the prey. And what they've told us is that how many krill there are really isn't important. It is how closely spaced those krill are because that's how they are able to make a living. We see the same pattern when we look in very different ocean, further south in the Pacific, in the warm waters around the Hawaiian islands. So a very different habitat, and yet the same story. Under some conditions, the physics and the nutrients, the fertilizer, set up aggregations in the plants, the phytoplankton. And when that happens, these very dense aggregations of phytoplankton attract their predators, which themselves form very dense layers. That changes the behavior and distribution of their predators as well, starting to set up how this entire ecosystem functions. Finally, the predators that eat these small fish, shrimp, and squid, we're talking about two- to three-inch long prey here, changes how they use their habitat and how they forage. And so we see changes in the spinner dolphins that are related to the changes we're seeing in the plant life. And just by measuring the plants, we can actually predict very well what's going to happen in the top predator three steps away in the food web. But what's interesting is that even the densest aggregations of their prey aren't enough for spinner dolphins to make it. It's a pretty tough life there in the ocean. So these animals actually work together to herd their prey into even denser aggregations, starting with patches that they find in the first place. And that's what you're going to see in this visualization. We have a group of 20 dolphins, you notice they're all set up in pairs, that are working together to basically bulldoze prey to accumulate it on top of itself. And once they do that, they form a circle around that prey to maintain that really dense patch that is a couple thousand times higher density than the background that they started with before individual pairs of dolphins start to take turns feeding inside this circle of prey that they've created. And so, this work is showing us that animals can first give us the answers that aggregation is critical to how they make their living. And by looking more deeply at the ocean, we're starting to understand our interactions with it and finding more effective ways of conserving it. Thank you.

And yet, the fur seals and birds on these islands are crashing. Their populations are declining despite decades of protection. And while on that southern island at the very bottom of the screen it doesn't look like there's anything to eat, those populations are doing incredibly well. So this left us with a dilemma. Our observations of food don't make any sense in the context of our observations of these animals. So we started to think about how we could do this differently. And this map shows not how many krill there are, but how many clumps of krill there are, how aggregated are they. And what you get is a very different picture of the landscape. Now that southern island looks like a pretty good place to be, and when we combine this with other information about prey, it starts to explain the population observations. But we can also ask that question differently. We can have the animals tell us what's important. By tagging and tracking these animals and looking at how they use this habitat, we are able to say, "What matters to you?" about the prey. And what they've told us is that how many krill there are really isn't important. It is how closely spaced those krill are because that's how they are able to make a living. We see the same pattern when we look in very different ocean, further south in the Pacific, in the warm waters around the Hawaiian islands. So a very different habitat, and yet the same story. Under some conditions, the physics and the nutrients, the fertilizer, set up aggregations in the plants, the phytoplankton. And when that happens, these very dense aggregations of phytoplankton attract their predators, which themselves form very dense layers. That changes the behavior and distribution of their predators as well, starting to set up how this entire ecosystem functions. Finally, the predators that eat these small fish, shrimp, and squid, we're talking about two- to three-inch long prey here, changes how they use their habitat and how they forage. And so we see changes in the spinner dolphins that are related to the changes we're seeing in the plant life. And just by measuring the plants, we can actually predict very well what's going to happen in the top predator three steps away in the food web. But what's interesting is that even the densest aggregations of their prey aren't enough for spinner dolphins to make it. It's a pretty tough life there in the ocean. So these animals actually work together to herd their prey into even denser aggregations, starting with patches that they find in the first place. And that's what you're going to see in this visualization. We have a group of 20 dolphins, you notice they're all set up in pairs, that are working together to basically bulldoze prey to accumulate it on top of itself. And once they do that, they form a circle around that prey to maintain that really dense patch that is a couple thousand times higher density than the background that they started with before individual pairs of dolphins start to take turns feeding inside this circle of prey that they've created. And so, this work is showing us that animals can first give us the answers that aggregation is critical to how they make their living. And by looking more deeply at the ocean, we're starting to understand our interactions with it and finding more effective ways of conserving it. Thank you.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby One of the reasons that I'm fascinated by the ocean is that it's really an alien world on our own planet. From our perspective, sitting on the shoreline or even out on a boat, we're given only the tiniest glimpses at the real action that's happening beneath the surface of the waves. And even if you were able to go down there, you wouldn't see very much because light doesn't travel very far in the ocean. So, to answer questions about how the ocean works, in my research, we use sound. We use sonars that send out pulses of sound made up of a number of different frequencies, or pitches, that are shown with different colors. That sound bounces off things in the habitat and comes back to us. If it were to bounce off this dolphin, the signal we got back would look very much like the one we sent out where all the colors are represented pretty evenly. However, if we were to bounce that same sound off of a squid, which in this case is about the same size as that dolphin, we'd instead only get the lowest frequencies back strongly, shown here in the red. And if we were to look at the prey of that squid, the tiny little krill that they're eating, we would instead only get the highest frequencies back. And so by looking at this, we can tell what kinds of animals are in the ocean, we can look at how dense they are, where they are distributed, look at their interactions and even their behavior to start to study the ecology of the ocean. When we do that, we come up with something sort of surprising: on average, there isn't very much food in the ocean. So even in places which we think of as rich, the coasts, we're talking about two parts of every million contain food. So what does that mean? Well, that means that in the volume of this theater, there would be one tub of movie theater popcorn available to be eaten. But of course, it wouldn't be collected for you neatly in this bucket. Instead, you'd actually have to be swimming through this entire volume Willy Wonka style, picking off individual kernels of popcorn, or perhaps if you were lucky, getting a hold of a few small clumps. But, of course, if you were in the ocean, this popcorn wouldn't be sitting here waiting for you to eat it. It would, instead, be trying to avoid becoming your dinner. So I want to know how do animals solve this challenge? We're going to talk about animals in the Bering Sea. This is where you may have see "Deadliest Catch" framed, in the northernmost part of the Pacific Ocean. We've been looking specifically at krill, one of the most important food items in this habitat. These half-inch long shrimp-like critters are about the caloric equivalent of a heavily buttered kernel of popcorn. And they're eaten by everything from birds and fur seals that pick them up one at a time to large whales that engulf them in huge mouthfuls. So I'm going to focus in the area around three breeding colonies for birds and fur seals in the southeastern Bering Sea. And this is a map of that habitat that we made making maps of food the way we've always made maps of food. This is how many krill are in this area of the ocean. Red areas represent lots of krill and purple basically none. And you can see that around the northern two most islands, which are highlighted with white circles because they are so tiny, it looks like there's a lot of food to be eaten.

**Transcript**:
We all know that there are certain virtues that are good for us. Intelligence, wisdom, bravery, justice, respect, responsibility, honesty, unselfishness, compassion, patience, and perseverance always have been and always will be positive virtues. Think of some people who have those traits. Maybe it's Martin Luther King or Abraham Lincoln or George Washington. I bet you know a lot of facts about these historical figures, but maybe you've never taken the time to think about their character. Let's talk about Sybil Ludington. She's a little-known revolutionary figure, but boy, was she something! She rode 40 miles through the damp, cold night of April 26, 1777 to alert the colonial militia of a British attack. Her action was similar to that of Paul Revere, only she rode twice as far and was only 16 years old. That takes some real guts! Beriah Green? Anyone ever heard of Beriah Green? He was president of the first integrated school in the United States. He also spent the majority of his life fighting for the immediate abolition of slavery. He used his voice, pen, and good deed to fight slavery. Beriah Green was fiercely devoted to abolition before it was popular because he believed it was the right thing to do. And then there's Abraham Lincoln. You know he was president during the Civil War. He wrote the Emancipation Proclaimation and is credited with freeing the slaves. He went to war with the South to save the Union. He helped the country get through one of its most difficult times. He kept the United States united. But, above all that, Abraham Lincoln showed great leadership. Could any of these people have done the deeds they're famous for without bravery, compassion, dedication, or wisdom? No! History can teach us much more than just the facts. It's full of examples of how to live better. And for you, even if you're not freeing the slaves or riding 40 miles on horseback, bravery and wisdom will help you get an A on that test, ask out that cute boy, and get that great job.

so it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language it has generated considerable insight in physics in biology and in economics but not that much in the humanities and in history I think there's the belief that is just impossible that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind but you cannot measure history but I don't think that's right I want to show you a couple of examples why so my collaborator Aires and I were considering the flow in fact the two kings separated by centuries will speak a very different language that's a powerful historical force so the king of England after the great will use the vocabulary and grammar that is quite different from the king of hip-hop jay-z now it's just the way it is language changes over time and it's a powerful force so Aries and I wanted to know more about that so we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule past tense conjugation so you just add eg to a verb at the end to signify the past today I walk yesterday I walked but some verbs are irregular yesterday I thought well now what's interesting about that is irregular verbs between Alfred and JZ have become more regular like the verb to Wed that you see here has become regular so everything I followed the fate of over 100 irregular verbs through 12 centuries of English language and we saw that there's actually a very simple mathematical pattern that captures this complex historical change namely if a verb is a hundred times more frequent than another it regularizes ten times slower that's a piece of history but it comes in a mathematical wrapping now in some cases math can even help explain or proposed explanations for historical forces so here's chief tinker and I were considering the magnitude of Wars during the last two centuries there's actually a well known regularity to them where the number of wars that are hundred times deadlier is ten times smaller so there are thirty wars that are about as deadly as the six days war there's only four wars that are 100 times deadlier like world war 1 so what kind of historical mechanism can produce that what's the region of this so Steve and I through mathematical analysis proposed that there's actually a very simple phenomena at the root of this which which lies in our brains this is a well-known feature which we perceive quantities in relative ways the quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a sound for instance committing 10,000 soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot it's relatively enormous if you've already committed 1,000 soldiers previously but it doesn't sound so much it's not relatively enough it won't make a difference if you've already committed a hundred thousand soldiers previously so you see that because of the way we perceive quantities as the war drags on the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties will increase not linearly like 10,000 11,000 12,000 but exponentially 10,000 later 20,000 Native 40,000 and so that explains this pattern that we've seen before so here mathematics is able to link the well-known feature of the individual mind with a long-term pattern a historical pattern that unfolds over centuries and across continents so this type of examples today they're just few of them but I think that in the next decade they will become commonplace the reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at very fast pace so there's about 130 million books that have been written since the dawn of time companies like Google have which as many of them above 20 million actually and when the stuff of history is available in digital form it makes it possible for mathematical analysis to very quickly and very conveniently reveal trends in our history in our culture so I think as in the next decade in the sciences and the humanities will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about mankind and I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that it will be able to reveal new trends in our history sometimes to explain them and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen thank you very much
