 (GASPS)   So, what is empathy and why is it 
 VERY different than sympathy?   Empathy fuels connection.   Sympathy drives disconnection.   It's very interesting.   Theresa Wiseman is a nursing scholar   who studied very diverse professions 
 where empathy is relevant   and came up with 
 four qualities of empathy.   Perspective taking - ability to take 
 the perspective of another person,   or recognise their perspective 
 as their truth.   Staying out of judgment -   not easy when you enjoy it 
 as much as most of us do.   (AUDIENCE CHUCKLES)   Recognising emotion in other people, 
 then communicating that.   Empathy is feeling WITH people.   I always think of empathy 
 as this kind of sacred space.   When someone's in a deep hole 
 and they shout from the bottom...   ..And we look and we say, "Hey!" 
 And climb down...   Sympathy is, "Ooh!" 
 (LAUGHTER)   "It's bad, uh-huh?" 
 (LAUGHTER)   "Uh... No. You want a sandwich?"   Empathy is a choice 
 and it's a vulnerable choice.   In order to connect with you,   I have to connect with something 
 in myself that knows that feeling.   Rarely, if ever, does an empathic 
 response begin with, "At least..."   (LAUGHTER)   Yeah. And we do it all the time 
 because, you know what?   Someone shared something with us 
 that's incredibly painful   and we're trying 
 to "silver lining" it.   I don't think that's a verb, 
 but I'm using it as one.   We're trying to put a silver lining 
 around it.   So, "I had a miscarriage."   "At least you know 
 you can get pregnant."   "I think my marriage 
 is falling apart."   "At least you have a marriage."   (LAUGHTER)   "John's getting kicked out 
 of school."   "At least Sarah is an A-student."   One of the things we do sometimes   in the face of very difficult 
 conversations   is we try to make things better.   If I share something with you that's 
 very difficult, I'd rather you say,   "I don't even know what to say. 
 I'm just so glad you told me."   Because the truth is, rarely can 
 a response make something better.   What makes something better 
 is connection.

**Transcript**:
In well-meaning attempts to boost our confidence ahead of challenging moments, people often try to draw our attention to our strengths: our intelligence, our competence, our experience. But this can – curiously – have some awkward consequences. There’s a type of under-confidence that arises specifically when we grow too attached to our own dignity and become anxious around any situation that might seem to threaten it. We hold back from challenges in which there is any risk of ending up looking ridiculous which comprises, of course, almost all the most interesting situations. In a foreign city, we might grow reluctant to ask anyone to guide us to the nice bars, because they might think us an ignorant, pitiable, lost tourist. We might long to kiss someone but never let on out of a fear that they could dismiss us as a predatory loser. Or at work, we don’t apply for a promotion, in case the senior management deems us delusionally arrogant. In a concerted bid never to look foolish, we don’t venture very far from our cocoon, and thereby – from time to time at least – miss out on the best opportunities of our lives. At the heart of our under-confidence is a skewed picture of how dignified it is normal for a person to be. We imagine that it might be possible, after a certain age, to place ourselves beyond mockery. We trust that it's an option to lead a good life without regularly making a complete idiot of ourselves. One of the most charming books ever written in early modern Europe is called 'In Praise of Folly' by the Dutch scholar and philosopher, Erasmus. In its pages, Erasmus advances a hugely liberating argument. In a warm tone, he reminds us that everyone, however important and learned they might be, is a fool. No one is spared, not even the author. However well-schooled he himself was, Erasmus remained – he insists – as much of a nitwit as anyone else: his judgement is faulty, his passions get the better of him, he is prey to superstition and irrational fear, he is shy whenever he has to meet new people, he drops things at elegant dinners. This is deeply cheering, for it means that our own repeated idiocies don't have to exclude us from the best company. Looking like a prick, making blunders and doing bizarre things in the night doesn’t render us unfit for society; it just makes us a bit more like the greatest scholar of the northern European Renaissance. There’s a similarly uplifting message to be pulled from the work of Pieter Brueghel. His central work, 'The Dutch Proverbs,' presents a comically disenchanted view of human nature. Everyone, he suggests, is pretty much deranged: here’s a man throwing his money into the river; there’s a soldier squatting on the fire and burning his trousers; someone is intently bashing his head against a brick wall; someone else is biting a pillar. Importantly, the painting is not an attack on just a few unusually awful people-- it’s a picture of parts of all of us. Brueghel’s and Erasmus’s work proposes that the way to greater confidence isn’t to reassure ourselves of our own dignity-- it’s to grow at peace with the inevitable nature of our ridiculousness. We are idiots now, we have been idiots in the past, and we will be idiots again in the future... and that's OK. There aren’t any other available options for human beings to be. Once we learn to see ourselves as already, and by nature, foolish, it really doesn’t matter so much if we do one more thing that might make us look a bit stupid. The person we try to kiss could indeed think us ridiculous. The individual we asked directions from in a foreign city might regard us with contempt. But if these people did so, it wouldn’t be news to us-- they would only be confirming what we had already gracefully accepted in our hearts long ago: that we, like them – and every other person on the earth – are a nitwit. The risk of trying and failing would have its sting substantially removed. A fear of humiliation would no longer stalk us in the shadows of our minds. We would grow free to give things a go by accepting that failure was the acceptable norm. And every so often, amidst the endless rebuffs we’d have factored in from the outset, it would work: we’d get a kiss, we’d make a friend, we’d get a raise. The road to greater confidence begins with a ritual of telling oneself solemnly every morning before heading out for the day, that one is a muttonhead, a cretin, a dumbbell and an imbecile. One or two more acts of folly should, thereafter, not matter very much at all.

for many kids growing up in America's schools it's easy to get the message that good grades are everything straight A's along with freely high SAT scores are seen as the key to gaining entry into elite colleges and prestigious careers but does a 4.0 ensure success later in life the u.s. grading system was created more than a century ago as a measure of academic achievement but in recent years grades have become an overwhelming source of anxiety a 2002 University of Michigan study revealed 80% of students based their self-worth on their grades the lower their grades the lower their self-esteem and self-esteem isn't the only thing that suffers research shows that chasing after perfect grades discourages creativity and reduces academic risk-taking over time some kids even lose their desire to learn their only motivation to study just enough to ace the next test the constant quest for perfect grades can lead to high stress and mental health problems a recent study by New York University's College of Nursing tracked students attending to highly selective private high schools 80% of students reported feeling a great deal of stress or somewhat stressed on a daily basis some students feel the need to resort to cheating to boost their GPAs in a national survey of 24,000 students from 70 high schools 64% admitted to cheating on a test with college entrance exams like the SAT and a CT the pressure can be just as intense while one might think students with the highest scores do better in college that's not always true a 2014 study followed more than a hundred and twenty-three thousand students who attended universities with test optional admissions policies the goal was to compare kids who submitted test scores to those who didn't the researchers found that when it came to grades and graduation rates the SAT and a CT test scores didn't correlate with how well student performed in college students with top grades in high school but only mediocre test scores actually did better in college than students with higher test scores but lower grades that's because high school grades demonstrate a pattern of commitment to hard work but a test taken once during an afternoon only reflects performance on a single given day what about top academic achievers do valedictorians go on to have disproportionately more success than their peers a Boston College researcher tracked more than eighty valedictorians over 14 years to find out how they fared in the real world overall the best and brightest ended up well-adjusted successful adults with professional careers but none that were categorized as visionaries or trailblazers many of the valedictorians admitted they weren't the smartest students instead they described themselves the hardest workers who gave the teachers what they wanted rather than exploring the material on a deeper level and taking risks if grades don't correlate with long-term success and they take a toll on well being is there a better approach in a worldwide study of student assessment Finland constantly ranks at or near the top and academic achievement far ahead of the us in Finland tests and grades play a much smaller role and Finland is still credited as one of the best systems in the world ninety-three percent of students graduate from academic or vocational secondary schools for the first six years of school in Finland there's no measure of a student's academic abilities the only standardized test given is a final exam at the end of senior year in high school yet Finland students rank top 10 in the world for academic performance year over year a growing number of educators in the US are calling for new ways to teach kids instead of simply memorizing information experts say kids need to learn to think for themselves and develop the motivation to succeed tests and grades are unavoidable for most American students but they aren't everything for many the key to success will be finding a lifelong passion for learning that extends beyond good grades test scores and graduation day [Music]

for many kids growing up in America's schools it's easy to get the message that good grades are everything straight A's along with freely high SAT scores are seen as the key to gaining entry into elite colleges and prestigious careers but does a 4.0 ensure success later in life the u.s. grading system was created more than a century ago as a measure of academic achievement but in recent years grades have become an overwhelming source of anxiety a 2002 University of Michigan study revealed 80% of students based their self-worth on their grades the lower their grades the lower their self-esteem and self-esteem isn't the only thing that suffers research shows that chasing after perfect grades discourages creativity and reduces academic risk-taking over time some kids even lose their desire to learn their only motivation to study just enough to ace the next test the constant quest for perfect grades can lead to high stress and mental health problems a recent study by New York University's College of Nursing tracked students attending to highly selective private high schools 80% of students reported feeling a great deal of stress or somewhat stressed on a daily basis some students feel the need to resort to cheating to boost their GPAs in a national survey of 24,000 students from 70 high schools 64% admitted to cheating on a test with college entrance exams like the SAT and a CT the pressure can be just as intense while one might think students with the highest scores do better in college that's not always true a 2014 study followed more than a hundred and twenty-three thousand students who attended universities with test optional admissions policies the goal was to compare kids who submitted test scores to those who didn't the researchers found that when it came to grades and graduation rates the SAT and a CT test scores didn't correlate with how well student performed in college students with top grades in high school but only mediocre test scores actually did better in college than students with higher test scores but lower grades that's because high school grades demonstrate a pattern of commitment to hard work but a test taken once during an afternoon only reflects performance on a single given day what about top academic achievers do valedictorians go on to have disproportionately more success than their peers a Boston College researcher tracked more than eighty valedictorians over 14 years to find out how they fared in the real world overall the best and brightest ended up well-adjusted successful adults with professional careers but none that were categorized as visionaries or trailblazers many of the valedictorians admitted they weren't the smartest students instead they described themselves the hardest workers who gave the teachers what they wanted rather than exploring the material on a deeper level and taking risks if grades don't correlate with long-term success and they take a toll on well being is there a better approach in a worldwide study of student assessment Finland constantly ranks at or near the top and academic achievement far ahead of the us in Finland tests and grades play a much smaller role and Finland is still credited as one of the best systems in the world ninety-three percent of students graduate from academic or vocational secondary schools for the first six years of school in Finland there's no measure of a student's academic abilities the only standardized test given is a final exam at the end of senior year in high school yet Finland students rank top 10 in the world for academic performance year over year a growing number of educators in the US are calling for new ways to teach kids instead of simply memorizing information experts say kids need to learn to think for themselves and develop the motivation to succeed tests and grades are unavoidable for most American students but they aren't everything for many the key to success will be finding a lifelong passion for learning that extends beyond good grades test scores and graduation day [Music]

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the options in Question 2 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that specifically asks about the likelihood of crashing while talking on the phone.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses the likelihood of crashing while talking on the phone. However, since such a question is not available, I will choose the closest match based on the content.

In this case, I would choose Question 2 as the closest match, but I must note that it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

However, upon closer inspection, I noticed that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs do not specifically ask about the likelihood of crashing while talking on the phone.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can try to find a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

In this case, I would say that Question 8 is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, as it mentions talking on the phone as a distraction while driving. However, it does not directly ask about the likelihood of crashing.

Therefore, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: None of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose a somewhat related MCQ, I would say Question 8.

**Transcript**:
Back in Ancient Rome, the philosopher Cicero
described gratitude as the mother of all virtues. This concept of being thankful has been stressed
in religion and philosophy for a long time. Back in 1820 Scottish philosopher Thomas Brown
defined gratitude as “that delightful emotion of love to him who has conferred a kindness
on us.” But scientifically, gratitude doesn’t qualify
as a basic emotion like joy, sadness or anger. There’s no universal facial expression for
it. As an emotion, gratitude is a little hard to define. Today the Oxford Dictionary defines gratitude
as “the quality or condition of being thankful; the appreciation of an inclination to return
kindness.” And we’ve only really started to study gratitude scientifically in the past
30 years. In a 2015 study, participants were asked to
imagine how they would feel if a complete stranger saved their life. I mean, how would
you feel? The participants had to rate how grateful they were to strangers who provided
them with gifts of food and clothing – all while they had their brain scanned in an fMRI
machine. Researchers found their ratings of gratitude
positively correlated with activity in brain areas associated with fairness and value judgements.
It makes sense because gratitude is often thought of as a moral emotion. There are even benefits in just noting how
grateful you are. Another study asked people to write down three things that went well
that day and why for one week. At the end of the week people were slightly happier than
at the beginning, and over time, their happiness scores kept improving. After one month they
were 5% happier and after six months they were 9% happier. Just from one week of writing
a journal. A similar study with participants with heart
disease found that keeping a gratitude journal increased their heart health and quality of
sleep, perhaps because it reduces stress. “Counting your blessings” quite literally
makes people happier and healthier. And some people are even hardwired to be more
thankful. In a recent study of 77 couples, those with a particular genetic variation
that affects the secretion of oxytocin expressed more gratitude towards their partners. Oxytocin
is thought to play a big role in promoting close social bonds, so gratitude is part of
the glue that keeps these relationships together. So if you think it’s the thought that counts,
think again. Science shows there are some pretty amazing benefits to our mind, body
and relationships when we say those two small words – thank you.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 2 does not specifically ask about basic emotions, I will continue to analyze the generated MCQs.

A more relevant question is Question 9, which mentions basic emotions in its options.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 9: What is the main message of the transcript about gratitude? Options: A. Gratitude is a basic emotion like joy or sadness, B. Gratitude is a moral emotion that has many benefits for our mind, body, and relationships, C. Gratitude is a universal facial expression, D. Gratitude is not related to our relationships or well-being Correct Option: B

This question is the most similar because it mentions basic emotions in its options and is related to the definition of gratitude.

However, if I had to choose a question that only asks about basic emotions, I would say that there is no exact match among the generated MCQs.

But if I had to choose the closest one, I would say:

 Question 9 is the closest, but not an exact match.

If the generated MCQs were modified to include a question that asks specifically about basic emotions, it would be a better match.

 Nevertheless, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ:

disease found that keeping a gratitude journal increased their heart health and quality of
sleep, perhaps because it reduces stress. “Counting your blessings” quite literally
makes people happier and healthier. And some people are even hardwired to be more
thankful. In a recent study of 77 couples, those with a particular genetic variation
that affects the secretion of oxytocin expressed more gratitude towards their partners. Oxytocin
is thought to play a big role in promoting close social bonds, so gratitude is part of
the glue that keeps these relationships together. So if you think it’s the thought that counts,
think again. Science shows there are some pretty amazing benefits to our mind, body
and relationships when we say those two small words – thank you.

it. As an emotion, gratitude is a little hard to define. Today the Oxford Dictionary defines gratitude
as “the quality or condition of being thankful; the appreciation of an inclination to return
kindness.” And we’ve only really started to study gratitude scientifically in the past

imagine how they would feel if a complete stranger saved their life. I mean, how would
you feel? The participants had to rate how grateful they were to strangers who provided
them with gifts of food and clothing – all while they had their brain scanned in an fMRI
machine. Researchers found their ratings of gratitude
positively correlated with activity in brain areas associated with fairness and value judgements.
It makes sense because gratitude is often thought of as a moral emotion. There are even benefits in just noting how
grateful you are. Another study asked people to write down three things that went well
that day and why for one week. At the end of the week people were slightly happier than
at the beginning, and over time, their happiness scores kept improving. After one month they
were 5% happier and after six months they were 9% happier. Just from one week of writing

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 2 does not specifically ask about basic emotions, I will continue to analyze the generated MCQs.

A more relevant question is Question 9, which mentions basic emotions in its options.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 9: What is the main message of the transcript about gratitude? Options: A. Gratitude is a basic emotion like joy or sadness, B. Gratitude is a moral emotion that has many benefits for our mind, body, and relationships, C. Gratitude is a universal facial expression, D. Gratitude is not related to our relationships or well-being Correct Option: B

This question is the most similar because it mentions basic emotions in its options and is related to the definition of gratitude.

However, if I had to choose a question that only asks about basic emotions, I would say that there is no exact match among the generated MCQs.

But if I had to choose the closest one, I would say:

 Question 9 is the closest, but not an exact match.

If the generated MCQs were modified to include a question that asks specifically about basic emotions, it would be a better match.

 Nevertheless, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ:

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 9

**Transcript**:
Back in Ancient Rome, the philosopher Cicero
described gratitude as the mother of all virtues. This concept of being thankful has been stressed
in religion and philosophy for a long time. Back in 1820 Scottish philosopher Thomas Brown
defined gratitude as “that delightful emotion of love to him who has conferred a kindness
on us.” But scientifically, gratitude doesn’t qualify
as a basic emotion like joy, sadness or anger. There’s no universal facial expression for
it. As an emotion, gratitude is a little hard to define. Today the Oxford Dictionary defines gratitude
as “the quality or condition of being thankful; the appreciation of an inclination to return
kindness.” And we’ve only really started to study gratitude scientifically in the past
30 years. In a 2015 study, participants were asked to
imagine how they would feel if a complete stranger saved their life. I mean, how would
you feel? The participants had to rate how grateful they were to strangers who provided
them with gifts of food and clothing – all while they had their brain scanned in an fMRI
machine. Researchers found their ratings of gratitude
positively correlated with activity in brain areas associated with fairness and value judgements.
It makes sense because gratitude is often thought of as a moral emotion. There are even benefits in just noting how
grateful you are. Another study asked people to write down three things that went well
that day and why for one week. At the end of the week people were slightly happier than
at the beginning, and over time, their happiness scores kept improving. After one month they
were 5% happier and after six months they were 9% happier. Just from one week of writing
a journal. A similar study with participants with heart
disease found that keeping a gratitude journal increased their heart health and quality of
sleep, perhaps because it reduces stress. “Counting your blessings” quite literally
makes people happier and healthier. And some people are even hardwired to be more
thankful. In a recent study of 77 couples, those with a particular genetic variation
that affects the secretion of oxytocin expressed more gratitude towards their partners. Oxytocin
is thought to play a big role in promoting close social bonds, so gratitude is part of
the glue that keeps these relationships together. So if you think it’s the thought that counts,
think again. Science shows there are some pretty amazing benefits to our mind, body
and relationships when we say those two small words – thank you.

this video is sponsored by Skillshare curries burgers sushi pizzas tortillas as a species food is central not only to our survival but also to our cultures we love food but as much as we love food we also love to throw it away the UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that globally almost one third of food produced for consumption never gets eaten and in the u.s. that number is even higher forty percent of the u.s. is available food supply gets wasted every year as a report from the NRDC notes that's like buying five bags of groceries at the store and then just leaving two of them in the parking lot every time you shop so today we're going to look at food waste with three questions why is excessive food waste happening what are its environmental consequences and how can we fix it if all the food currently getting thrown in the landfill every year was instead diverted into meals for those in need we'd be able to feed as many as 1.8 billion people on top of that food waste has been estimated to be responsible for roughly 8 percent of global emissions if it was a country it would rank third under China in the United States for yearly greenhouse gas emissions it's large emissions footprint not only comes from all the energy needed to ship process and produce the food that ends up in the trash but also from the potent methane fumes that food emits as it decomposes in landfills so food waste is one of the many issues at the crossroads of climate action and social justice but food doesn't just sprout out of the ground and then magically end up in the trash there's a long chain of business and consumer interactions that at any point might turn perfectly edible food into waste simply put food transforms into trash in two general areas as it travels from farm to wait before the point-of-sale and after the point-of-sale if we look at this chart the majority of the food waste generated in the United States comes after the point-of-sale but let's look at the food loss before that on farms and in grocery stores in order to understand how this all starts before I transitioned to making YouTube videos full time I worked in a number of food-related positions where I saw firsthand how the drive for perfect abundant produce perpetuated an unnecessary trend of food waste as a farmhand at a number of different farms when I saw insect bites on arugula leaves or blemishes on peppers and tomatoes I knew they were destined to rot all that time effort and fuel wasted because the farm manager knew that better-looking produce will always sell over and perfect ones these cosmetically challenged products as they've come to be known can often end up left on the ground by harvesters or even make their way to landfills and into piles of food that decomposes and generate harmful emissions but the aesthetics of produce are just one part of the picture market prices for food can also affect weather crops make it through the harvest according to one recent study that analyzed on-farm food loss in California thirty three point seven percent of produce remains unharvested every year that's the equivalent of growing 300 acres of cantaloupe and leaving 100 acres of it to decay in the fields which according to an article from civil eats is exactly what happened to 6th generation farmer Canon Michel Michel couldn't justify paying workers to pick the cantaloupe because the cost of labour packing and shipping would have been more than the price he could get for the fruit and even if the food does make it off farms it still has to navigate the gauntlet of grocery store aisles one of the best ways to sell food is through the illusion of abundance people shop visually and to most that last Apple on the Shelf was left there because there was something wrong with it not because it just happened to be the last one in order to appear abundant grocery stores often over buy food to trick people into purchasing items as a result produce inevitably goes to waste as it sits out all day like glorified window dressing farmer Delaney's iock explains this dilemma and the documentary just eat it and there is an hour left in the market that one bunch of chard would sit there and no one would buy but if I had 30 bunches of chard all like bursting out I probably sell like 25 so what is that saving people are totally impulse shopping so at the grocery store and farmers markets vendors face an uphill battle against the old saying pile it high and watch it fly they need to produce an excess of food to sell their goods but that excess can at times lead to more waste after the point of sale the plague of food waste continues indeed household restaurant and food service waste accounts for 69 percent of the United States's annual food waste as a consumer and lover of food I've tried hard to minimize my waste but it can be easy to cook or by excess that ends up in the compost or trash for a family of four household food waste costs one thousand eight hundred dollars annually and with the average plate size expanding by 36 percent since 1960 and with refrigerators growing 30 percent in volume since 1972 it's tempting to buy more food just to fill up the space over buying and the inevitable cleaning out the refrigerator activity that comes with it can also be attributed to buy one get one promotions or purchasing in our appliances supermarkets and even our plates are all nudging us to buy or in addition to over buying in the United States there's also a severe lack of clarity when it comes to dealing with expiration dates and spoiled goods there are no federal laws regulating cell buy or expiration dates as a result labels can mean basically anything depending on where you buy your food in Missoula Montana for example milk sell by date is set at 12 days after pasteurization even though the standard is 21 to 24 days that's because in most cases these dates are set by the milk producer and not a regulatory service as one grocery vendor in Missoula laments the 12 day sell by date tells a consumer nothing it's just an arbitrary number somebody came up with with no scientific backing whatsoever this lack of clear information regarding when a product actually goes bad means that households throw out perfectly edible food well before it expires in short there are marketing labeling cultural and psychological forces all coming to play in order to make food waste a large problem in the United States ultimately there are many vectors by which food becomes waste whether in your own home or even before it makes it onto a grocery store shelf but there is hope there are very tangible solutions to these problems at all levels of the supply chain at the individual level solutions look like creating a plan to use all the food you buy or using sites like eat by date to truly understand whether your food has expired and then composting it instead of throwing it in the trash you can even get involved with groups like Food Not Bombs which has local chapters all over the world that recover food from local restaurants and stores and give it to those in need on the supply side solutions look like reducing food demand by eliminating buy-one-get-one promotions donating food that's not fit for sale or even using boxes and props to maintain the illusion of abundance without needed excess produce and on a policy level this means actions like standardizing expiration dates to accurately reflect the science behind foodborne illnesses food waste is a preventable problem an addressing food waste means tackling both climate change and hunger in the process we don't necessarily need fancy farming technologies to create more food for people who go hungry we just need to work together on every level to more equitably distribute the resources we already have and in doing so we not only mitigate climate change but also create stronger communities when I started making YouTube videos my

this video is sponsored by Skillshare curries burgers sushi pizzas tortillas as a species food is central not only to our survival but also to our cultures we love food but as much as we love food we also love to throw it away the UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that globally almost one third of food produced for consumption never gets eaten and in the u.s. that number is even higher forty percent of the u.s. is available food supply gets wasted every year as a report from the NRDC notes that's like buying five bags of groceries at the store and then just leaving two of them in the parking lot every time you shop so today we're going to look at food waste with three questions why is excessive food waste happening what are its environmental consequences and how can we fix it if all the food currently getting thrown in the landfill every year was instead diverted into meals for those in need we'd be able to feed as many as 1.8 billion people on top of that food waste has been estimated to be responsible for roughly 8 percent of global emissions if it was a country it would rank third under China in the United States for yearly greenhouse gas emissions it's large emissions footprint not only comes from all the energy needed to ship process and produce the food that ends up in the trash but also from the potent methane fumes that food emits as it decomposes in landfills so food waste is one of the many issues at the crossroads of climate action and social justice but food doesn't just sprout out of the ground and then magically end up in the trash there's a long chain of business and consumer interactions that at any point might turn perfectly edible food into waste simply put food transforms into trash in two general areas as it travels from farm to wait before the point-of-sale and after the point-of-sale if we look at this chart the majority of the food waste generated in the United States comes after the point-of-sale but let's look at the food loss before that on farms and in grocery stores in order to understand how this all starts before I transitioned to making YouTube videos full time I worked in a number of food-related positions where I saw firsthand how the drive for perfect abundant produce perpetuated an unnecessary trend of food waste as a farmhand at a number of different farms when I saw insect bites on arugula leaves or blemishes on peppers and tomatoes I knew they were destined to rot all that time effort and fuel wasted because the farm manager knew that better-looking produce will always sell over and perfect ones these cosmetically challenged products as they've come to be known can often end up left on the ground by harvesters or even make their way to landfills and into piles of food that decomposes and generate harmful emissions but the aesthetics of produce are just one part of the picture market prices for food can also affect weather crops make it through the harvest according to one recent study that analyzed on-farm food loss in California thirty three point seven percent of produce remains unharvested every year that's the equivalent of growing 300 acres of cantaloupe and leaving 100 acres of it to decay in the fields which according to an article from civil eats is exactly what happened to 6th generation farmer Canon Michel Michel couldn't justify paying workers to pick the cantaloupe because the cost of labour packing and shipping would have been more than the price he could get for the fruit and even if the food does make it off farms it still has to navigate the gauntlet of grocery store aisles one of the best ways to sell food is through the illusion of abundance people shop visually and to most that last Apple on the Shelf was left there because there was something wrong with it not because it just happened to be the last one in order to appear abundant grocery stores often over buy food to trick people into purchasing items as a result produce inevitably goes to waste as it sits out all day like glorified window dressing farmer Delaney's iock explains this dilemma and the documentary just eat it and there is an hour left in the market that one bunch of chard would sit there and no one would buy but if I had 30 bunches of chard all like bursting out I probably sell like 25 so what is that saving people are totally impulse shopping so at the grocery store and farmers markets vendors face an uphill battle against the old saying pile it high and watch it fly they need to produce an excess of food to sell their goods but that excess can at times lead to more waste after the point of sale the plague of food waste continues indeed household restaurant and food service waste accounts for 69 percent of the United States's annual food waste as a consumer and lover of food I've tried hard to minimize my waste but it can be easy to cook or by excess that ends up in the compost or trash for a family of four household food waste costs one thousand eight hundred dollars annually and with the average plate size expanding by 36 percent since 1960 and with refrigerators growing 30 percent in volume since 1972 it's tempting to buy more food just to fill up the space over buying and the inevitable cleaning out the refrigerator activity that comes with it can also be attributed to buy one get one promotions or purchasing

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 3 does not cover all the aspects of the ground truth MCQ, I re-examined the generated MCQs and found that Question 5, Question 3, and Question 4 together cover the aspects of the ground truth MCQ. But, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match.

But then I noticed that Question 7 is a better match because it has an option "D. All of the above" which is similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, the question intent is not exactly the same.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs again, I found that none of the questions directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible match based on the question intent and content.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 7, but it's not an exact match.

However, if I had to choose an answer, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 7

look at the food loss before that on farms and in grocery stores in order to understand how this all starts before I transitioned to making YouTube videos full time I worked in a number of food-related positions where I saw firsthand how the drive for perfect abundant produce perpetuated an unnecessary trend of food waste as a farmhand at a number of different farms when I saw insect bites on arugula leaves or blemishes on peppers and tomatoes I knew they were destined to rot all that time effort and fuel wasted because the farm manager knew that better-looking produce will always sell over and perfect ones these cosmetically challenged products as they've come to be known can often end up left on the ground by harvesters or even make their way to landfills and into piles of food that decomposes and generate harmful emissions but the aesthetics of produce are just one part of the picture market prices for food can also affect weather crops make it through the harvest according to one recent study that analyzed on-farm food loss in California thirty three point seven percent of produce remains unharvested every year that's the equivalent of growing 300 acres of cantaloupe and leaving 100 acres of it to decay in the fields which according to an article from civil eats is exactly what happened to 6th generation farmer Canon Michel Michel couldn't justify paying workers to pick the cantaloupe because the cost of labour packing and shipping would have been more than the price he could get for the fruit and even if the food does make it off farms it still has to navigate the gauntlet of grocery store aisles one of the best ways to sell food is through the illusion of abundance people shop visually and to most that last Apple on the Shelf was left there because there was something wrong with it not because it just happened to be the last one in order to appear abundant grocery stores often over buy food to trick people into purchasing items as a result produce inevitably goes to waste as it sits out all day like glorified window dressing farmer Delaney's iock explains this dilemma and the documentary just eat it and there is an hour left in the market that one bunch of chard would sit there and no one would buy but if I had 30 bunches of chard all like bursting out I probably sell like 25 so what is that saving people are totally impulse shopping so at the grocery store and farmers markets vendors face an uphill battle against the old saying pile it high and watch it fly they need to produce an excess of food to sell their goods but that excess can at times lead to more waste after the point of sale the plague of food waste continues indeed household restaurant and food service waste accounts for 69 percent of the United States's annual food waste as a consumer and lover of food I've tried hard to minimize my waste but it can be easy to cook or by excess that ends up in the compost or trash for a family of four household food waste costs one thousand eight hundred dollars annually and with the average plate size expanding by 36 percent since 1960 and with refrigerators growing 30 percent in volume since 1972 it's tempting to buy more food just to fill up the space over buying and the inevitable cleaning out the refrigerator activity that comes with it can also be attributed to buy one get one promotions or purchasing in our appliances supermarkets and even our plates are all nudging us to buy or in addition to over buying in the United States there's also a severe lack of clarity when it comes to dealing with expiration dates and spoiled goods there are no federal laws regulating cell buy or expiration dates as a result labels can mean basically anything depending on where you buy your food in Missoula Montana for example milk sell by date is set at 12 days after pasteurization even though the standard is 21 to 24 days that's because in most cases these dates are set by the milk producer and not a regulatory service as one grocery vendor in Missoula laments the 12 day sell by date tells a consumer nothing it's just an arbitrary number somebody came up with with no scientific backing whatsoever this lack of clear information regarding when a product actually goes bad means that households throw out perfectly edible food well before it expires in short there are marketing labeling cultural and psychological forces all coming to play in order to make food waste a large problem in the United States ultimately there are many vectors by which food becomes waste whether in your own home or even before it makes it onto a grocery store shelf but there is hope there are very tangible solutions to these problems at all levels of the supply chain at the individual level solutions look like creating a plan to use all the food you buy or using sites like eat by date to truly understand whether your food has expired and then composting it instead of throwing it in the trash you can even get involved with groups like Food Not Bombs which has local chapters all over the world that recover food from local restaurants and stores and give it to those in need on the supply side solutions look like reducing food demand by eliminating buy-one-get-one promotions donating food that's not fit for sale or even using boxes and props to maintain the illusion of abundance without needed excess produce and on a policy level this means actions like standardizing expiration dates to accurately reflect the science behind foodborne illnesses food waste is a preventable problem an addressing food waste means tackling both climate change and hunger in the process we don't necessarily need fancy farming technologies to create more food for people who go hungry we just need to work together on every level to more equitably distribute the resources we already have and in doing so we not only mitigate climate change but also create stronger communities when I started making YouTube videos my

**Transcript**:
People have been keeping track of time, pretty much since people were people. At first we just needed to have an idea of what season it was, and maybe what season was coming up next, and around when. But after the invention of agriculture, it started being important to keep track of each day of the year. Once you start trying to count the days of the year though, it doesn't take long to notice a problem: You just can't make a consistent calendar with the same number of days every year, because there aren't a whole number of days in the year. That is why today's date exists! We have to add an extra day to the calendar every now and then and we do it on February 29th. The main issue is that the Earth's orbit and its rotation don't have anything to do with each other. When our planet spins once around on its axis we call that a day and when it completes a full orbit of the sun, we call that a solar year. Now it'd be nice if Earth always got back to the same place in its orbit after a set number of complete rotations, which would be an exact number of days... but it doesn't. Earth orbits the sun once every 365.2425 rotations, so if your calendar has a whole number of days, like 365 or 366 than you're counting either too few days or too many. And if you're counting wrong, then things like the solstices, the longest and shortest days of the year, which always happen at the same point in the Earth's orbit, will move around the calendar. That makes it a little tricky to plan for events that you want to happen on the same day every year, say a solstice celebration. And if that wasn't complicated enough, a lot of ancient cultures, like the Babylonians, Chinese, and Romans, used calendars based on the moon. But, the behavior of the moon, again, has nothing to do with our rotation or our orbit. The moon goes through a little more than 12 cycles, each a little more than 29 days, in the time that it takes for the Earth to go around the sun. And that means they had a similar problem: 12 lunar months a year is too few, but 13 lunar months in a year is too many. So most people using a lunar calendar would have 12 months most years but then, they'd add an extra month every couple of years to keep things, like harvest, around roughly the same solar date. Then there were the Romans, always trying to keep things interesting. Instead of having a system in place, for how often there should be an extra month, they left it up to their highest religious authority: the Pontifex Maximus. Which kinda worked for a while, at least until Julius Caesar came along. The Romans thought adding those extra months was super bad luck, so they didn't want to do it while they were at war, and Julius was at war all the time. So, the calendar got way off from where it should have been. Eventually, Caesar decided that the Romans should just use a brand new calendar, that relied on a set system of, when and where to add extra days. And that's how we got the Julian Calendar, which Western Europe and Christian churches used for a really long time. Most Julian years had 365 days, but like we said earlier, the year is about a quarter of a day longer than that, so every 4th year got an extra 366th day. Seems like a good fix, but things are not that simple. The four year system ends up slightly over-estimating the length of the year by about 10 minutes Something the designers of the Julian calendar knew about but they decided it wasn't worth complicating the calendar over. It's 10 minutes a year, what could go wrong? Well, 10 minutes a year, over a lot of years, can really add up. By the late 1500s, around 1600 years after Caesar the calendar was about 13 days off from where it should have been. That's when Pope Gregory XIII, the Pontifex Maximus of the Catholic Church at the time, decided that the Julian calendar needed an overhaul. So he put together the Gregorian calendar, the one that we still use today, which is really just the Julian Calendar with a couple of changes. The Gregorian calendar's new rules were: Every 4 years add an extra day, except, don't add it when the year is divisible by 100 except, actually, do add it if the year is divisible by 400. So 1700, 1800, and 1900, weren't leap years because they were all divisible by 100, but not by 400. The year 2000 was a leap year since 2000 is divisible by 400. And, of course, 2016 is a leap year as well. If we were still using the Julian calendar, 2016 would still be a leap year But the calendar would now be behind by 16 days So this video would have been uploaded on February 13th, 2016 not February 29th. so it wouldn't have made any sense. But the universe is complicated and does not care about our calendars. So the Gregorian calendar is still a little bit too long we will add a day about every 7,700 years, but don't hold your breath for a new calendar. The Gregorian calendar was only introduced when the Julian one was 13 days off from the true date. And that won't happen to the Gregorian calendar for another 100,000 years or so.

**Transcript**:
Whenever something looks interesting,  beautiful there's a natural impulse to want to capture and preserve it, which means in this day and age that we will likely to reach for our phones and take picture. Though this might seem like an ideal solution, there is a big problem associated with it. We're likely to be so busy taking the pictures we forget to look at the world whose beauty and interest prompted us to take a photograph in the first place. These problems seem to be very much of today a consequence of the tiny phones in our pockets. But, they would notice right in at beginning of the history of photography when the average camera was the size of a grandfather clock. The first person to notice them was the english art critic John Ruskin He was very impressed by cameras at first, but gradually he grew very suspicious of them believing they blinded us of our surroundings To try to correct this blindness Ruskin recommended that all of us take up drawing not with the view to becoming great artists but simply because through the act of trying to recreate on paper what we see in the world we studied it in a way we never do when we simply take a photograph Summing up what he attempted to do in four years of teaching and writing manuals on drawing Ruskin wrote: "Let two persons go out for a walk;" "the one a good sketcher, the other having no taste of the kind." "Let them go down a green lane." "There will be a great difference in the scene as perceived by the two individuals." "The one will see a lane and trees; he will perceive the trees to be green," "though he will think nothing about it;" "he will see that the sun shines, and that it has a cheerful effect," "and that's all." "But what will the sketcher see?" "His eye is accustomed to search into the cause of beauty," "and penetrate the minutest parts of loveliness." "He looks up, and observes how the showery and subdivided sunshine" "comes sprinkled down among the gleaming leaves overhead," "till the air is filled with an emerald light," "he would see here and there a bough is seen emerging from the veil of leaves," "he would see the jewel brightness of the emerald moss," "and the variegated and fantastic lichens, " "white and blue, purple and red, " "all mellowed and mingled into a single garment of beauty." "Then come the cavernous trunks, and the twisted roots" "that grasp with their snake-like coils at the steep bank, " "whose turfy slope is inlaid with flowers of a thousand dyes." "Is not this worth seeing?" "Yet if you are not a sketcher you will pass along the green lane," "and when you come home again, have nothing to say or to think about it," "but that you went down such and such a lane."

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Generated MCQ 2 and 5 do not completely match but both question 2 and 5 are related to the ground truth MCQ. However question 2 and 5 options do not have all the information of the ground truth MCQ.**

However if I have to choose one I will choose **Generated MCQ 2** 

The reason for this choice is that Generated MCQ 2 is the only question that mentions John Ruskin's solution to the problem of people becoming too focused on taking pictures, which is related to the ground truth MCQ. However, the options in Generated MCQ 2 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ.

Generated MCQ 2 is the closest match, but it is not a perfect match. To create a perfect match, a new generated MCQ would be needed that combines the information from Generated MCQ 2 and the ground truth MCQ.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Tired? We all know the feeling; irritable, groggy and exceptionally lazy. Chances are you didn't sleep enough last night, or the past few nights. But what exactly is "enough sleep?" And more importantly, can you ever "catch up" on it? While the very function of sleep is still debated by scientists, we do know that it's necessary to function efficiently and productively. After all, we spend 24 years of our lifetime sleeping, it had better be important. Researchers have tested how much is required each night by assigning groups of people to four, five, and eight hours of sleep over extended periods of time. After 14 days, those with eight hours of sleep exhibited few attention lapses of cognitive issues; however, those with six or four hours of sleep showed a steady decline. In fact, after only two weeks, the six hour group showed a similar reaction time to a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%, which is considered legally drunk. The four hour sleepers suffered even more, occasionally falling asleep during their cognitive tests. In both groups, brain function decreased day by day, almost linearly with no sign of leveling off. Scientists have dubbed this cumulative effect as sleep debt. So can we recover from it? After a night or two of little sleep, studies show that the body and brain can fully recover with a few nights of good sleep. However, with long term sleep deprivation on the scale of weeks to months, the recovery of cognitive function is much slower, requiring many more nights of quality sleep. On the timescale of months to years, it is unknown whether brain function can be fully repaired, or if it causes permanent damage. Paradoxically, with chronic sleep deprivation, your sleepiness or how tired you feel does eventually level off, meaning that you become less and less aware of your objective impairment over time. So how long should you sleep? Most studies tend to show that seven to eight hours of sleep is the average ideal for humans. Apart from the cognitive issues, individuals who consistently sleep less than seven hours a night have an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, not to mention a 12% higher risk of death. On the flip side, studies have shown that while sleeping more than eight hours does not impair brain function, it also carries an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, and a 30% increased risk of mortality! So too much sleep may also be a bad thing. But variation most certainly exists, and our genetics play a large role. In fact, individuals genuinely unaffected by only six hours of sleep were found to have a mutation of a specific gene. When scientists genetically engineered mice to express this gene, they were able to stay awake for an extra 1.2 hours than normal mice. It turns out these short sleepers have more biologically intense sleep sessions than the average person. Ultimately, while it's important to know the ideal average of seven to eight hours exists, let your body and brain help you figure out its own needs. After all, no one shoe size fits all.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 8 is not the most similar, however Question 8's options include the correct answer for the ground truth MCQ.**

The most similar generated MCQ is **Question 8's Option C**: "It will help you to conquer the hurdles of sleep deprivation" is not the correct answer, however another option in the same question is: "to be more efficient and productive" 

However since that is not the main question in Question 8, I will look at other questions.

**Question 1** is the most similar generated MCQ, as it discusses the primary function of sleep, which is closely related to the ground truth MCQ's topic of the importance of sleep.

The correct answer for Question 1 does not match the correct answer for the ground truth MCQ, however the topic is the most similar.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although Question 4 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the average number of years spent sleeping throughout a lifetime, while Question 4 asks about the average ideal hours of sleep per night for humans. However, Question 4 is related to the topic of sleep duration, which is also the focus of the ground truth MCQ.

There is no generated MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ, so Question 4 is the closest match based on the available options.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 2: According to the transcript, what is the effect of 6 hours of sleep on cognitive function compared to a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%?**

Options: A. The 6 hour group shows a similar reaction time to a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05%, B. The 6 hour group shows a similar reaction time to a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%, C. The 6 hour group shows a faster reaction time than a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%, D. The 6 hour group shows a slower reaction time than a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%

Correct Option: B

This generated MCQ is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ because it:

1. Addresses the same topic of sleep deprivation and its effects on cognitive function.
2. Specifically mentions the comparison between 6 hours of sleep and a blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%, which is also mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.
3. Has similar options that require the test-taker to understand the relationship between sleep deprivation and cognitive impairment.

However, it's worth noting that the ground truth MCQ is more comprehensive and asks about the issues that arise when someone does not get enough sleep, whereas the generated MCQ is more specific and asks about the effect of 6 hours of sleep on cognitive function.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content, I would suggest:

**Question 8: According to the transcript, what is the benefit of getting better quality sleep each night?**

Options: A. It will help you to be more productive, B. It will help you to be more efficient, C. It will help you to conquer the hurdles of sleep deprivation, D. All of the above

Correct Option: D

This generated MCQ is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content, as it asks about the benefits of getting better quality sleep and mentions the concept of sleep deprivation. However, the options are not as specific as the ground truth MCQ, and the question is more focused on the benefits of good sleep rather than the issues that arise from sleep deprivation.

Therefore, based on the provided generated MCQs, I would recommend **Question 2** as the most similar to the ground truth MCQ, with **Question 8** being a close second.

**Transcript**:
Tired? We all know the feeling; irritable, groggy and exceptionally lazy. Chances are you didn't sleep enough last night, or the past few nights. But what exactly is "enough sleep?" And more importantly, can you ever "catch up" on it? While the very function of sleep is still debated by scientists, we do know that it's necessary to function efficiently and productively. After all, we spend 24 years of our lifetime sleeping, it had better be important. Researchers have tested how much is required each night by assigning groups of people to four, five, and eight hours of sleep over extended periods of time. After 14 days, those with eight hours of sleep exhibited few attention lapses of cognitive issues; however, those with six or four hours of sleep showed a steady decline. In fact, after only two weeks, the six hour group showed a similar reaction time to a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%, which is considered legally drunk. The four hour sleepers suffered even more, occasionally falling asleep during their cognitive tests. In both groups, brain function decreased day by day, almost linearly with no sign of leveling off. Scientists have dubbed this cumulative effect as sleep debt. So can we recover from it? After a night or two of little sleep, studies show that the body and brain can fully recover with a few nights of good sleep. However, with long term sleep deprivation on the scale of weeks to months, the recovery of cognitive function is much slower, requiring many more nights of quality sleep. On the timescale of months to years, it is unknown whether brain function can be fully repaired, or if it causes permanent damage. Paradoxically, with chronic sleep deprivation, your sleepiness or how tired you feel does eventually level off, meaning that you become less and less aware of your objective impairment over time. So how long should you sleep? Most studies tend to show that seven to eight hours of sleep is the average ideal for humans. Apart from the cognitive issues, individuals who consistently sleep less than seven hours a night have an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, not to mention a 12% higher risk of death. On the flip side, studies have shown that while sleeping more than eight hours does not impair brain function, it also carries an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, and a 30% increased risk of mortality! So too much sleep may also be a bad thing. But variation most certainly exists, and our genetics play a large role. In fact, individuals genuinely unaffected by only six hours of sleep were found to have a mutation of a specific gene. When scientists genetically engineered mice to express this gene, they were able to stay awake for an extra 1.2 hours than normal mice. It turns out these short sleepers have more biologically intense sleep sessions than the average person. Ultimately, while it's important to know the ideal average of seven to eight hours exists, let your body and brain help you figure out its own needs. After all, no one shoe size fits all.

**Transcript**:
From twigs to electrical toothbrushes humans have been cleaning our teeth since the ancient Egyptians in 5000 BCE. But, what if you just straight-up stopped brushing your teeth at all for the rest of your life? Within minutes of stopping, the food debris and moist environment from your saliva creates an ideal environment for bacteria to survive. Streptococci is one of the most common bacteria found in our mouth and it's normally not harmful, until it metabolizes sugar or protein from food debris. But after a full day, these bacteria would have already produced significant amounts of plaque from sugars. Plaque is the slimy layer of biofilm that you can feel on your teeth when you "accidentally" forget to brush sometimes. And this plaque actually helps the bacteria adhere to your teeth, which allows them to produce even more plaque creating a cycle of bacteria and plaque build up. After a week, all this build-up will cause some pretty serious bad breath. Not to mention that the plaque begins to harden and form tartar that lead to your teeth appearing yellow. At this point, you're also causing significant damage to tooth enamel as the bacteria break down sugar to produce lactic acid. Enamel is the hard mineralized outer layer of the tooth. And once it breaks down, you can't make any more. After a month, your decaying teeth will form cavities. These holes in your teeth get deeper and deeper if left untreated, leading to gingivitis, an early form of gum disease. This is because the immune system attacks your gums and teeth in response to the bacteria build up. Your cavities will fill up with pus, which is a protein-rich fluid filled with dead white blood cells and your gums will be extremely sensitive at this point, turning red when you touch it and bleeding with any significant pressure. After an entire year of neglect, you now have Periodontitis. The inner layer of the gum and bone are broken down by enzymes and pull away from the teeth to form pockets, which only further allow collected food debris and bacteria to gather. This causes the immune system to go into overdrive and destroys your gums and ligaments, resulting in advanced Periodontitis where your teeth become loose and begin to fall out. Any longer, and the issues can spread beyond your mouth and into your blood, causing inflammation throughout your organs and increasing the likelihood of erectile disfunction, head and neck cancer, chronic heart disease, and even dementia development. Combine your lack of brushing with a poor diet high in processed foods, and especially sugar, which is much more common now than early Homo sapiens would have experienced, and you have a much more accelerated breeding ground for bacteria, putting your whole body's health at risk. Brush your teeth kids! [Mitch] Thank you guys for watching if you have any burning questions.

**Transcript**:
You ever notice this instruction that’s
in nearly every baking recipe? Preheating your oven to 350 degrees is sort
of a basic requirement for baking in America. Our ovens even do it automatically as we turn
them on, but have you ever stopped and asked yourself ... What’s so special about this number? I love to bake, but I’m certainly not a
pastry chef, so let’s meet someone with a bit more experience. This is Michael Laiskonis, the creative director
at the Institute of Culinary Education. He's a pastry chef. So temperature is really important in baking
not only to develop color and flavor, but also to control the moisture in our products. As the temperature rises and moisture is lost
at the surface, we get browning and also the creation of flavor compounds that didn't exist
in that product previously. This happens because of a chemical process
known as the maillard reaction, which occurs when proteins and sugars are
transformed by heat and moisture. When sugar molecules are exposed to the heat
in your oven they start to reduce – or break down – and interact with the proteins. That’s when you can see 
your pastry turning golden brown. But it’s not just about that physical transformation. You can taste the effects of the maillard
reaction too – that's what gives us the flavors
of the golden crust on a piece of bread or a nice sear on a steak or that mellow richness
of, say, caramelized onions. The trick behind that reaction is to find the perfect temperature that sets
it into action without over or under-doing it. These recipes might make you think that Maillard reaction occurs at 350 degrees, but actually ... So these Maillard reactions tend to occur at
a fairly low temperature – around 230 to 240 degrees Fahrenheit. You want to manipulate the rate at which
this reaction occurs both at the surface and internally to get the results you want. If we bake too cool, the entire cookie, for example, will dry out before
we get that surface drying that will lead to browning. If we bake things in too hot an oven, the opposite
occurs and we get burning. To get it just right we preheat the oven to 350 degrees
so the Maillard reaction has time to occur throughout the entire cookie. For most home cooks and to also account for
the fact that everyone's oven is slightly different, I think 350 is a great benchmark to work from. It’s a safe standard for most
people, but the number can also be altered to yield slightly different
results. Some pastry chefs might bake at 325 if they want a lighter colored cookie,
and some push it to 375 for a crispier outside. A lot of things that contemporary bakers tend
to forget is not too long ago, in history, we didn't have as much control over our ovens
or being a pastry chef meant being able to build a fire and maintain an oven temperature. Before the 1900’s, when ovens didn’t have
temperature regulators, recipe writers instructed bakers to “cook in a moderate” “hot”
or “slow” oven depending on the food. After the second world war, the temperature gauge was developed and it became widely popular across households. Modern ovens typically ranged from 200 to
550 degrees, so over time, recipe writers converted these temperature guidelines to actual numbers -- they settled on the 350 mark for “moderate”
which was the sweet spot for baking. Using these more specific numbers is really
a result of better oven design and better oven control. And the more you understand about what goes on inside your oven, the better results you'll get. And who doesn't want a better cookie? Hey everyone, thanks for watching. If you're interested in more food content, head on over our sister channel Eater. They've got this cool series where they test out different kitchen gadgets and they recently put up a video on pressure cookers.

You ever notice this instruction that’s
in nearly every baking recipe? Preheating your oven to 350 degrees is sort
of a basic requirement for baking in America. Our ovens even do it automatically as we turn
them on, but have you ever stopped and asked yourself ... What’s so special about this number? I love to bake, but I’m certainly not a
pastry chef, so let’s meet someone with a bit more experience. This is Michael Laiskonis, the creative director
at the Institute of Culinary Education. He's a pastry chef. So temperature is really important in baking
not only to develop color and flavor, but also to control the moisture in our products. As the temperature rises and moisture is lost
at the surface, we get browning and also the creation of flavor compounds that didn't exist
in that product previously. This happens because of a chemical process
known as the maillard reaction, which occurs when proteins and sugars are
transformed by heat and moisture. When sugar molecules are exposed to the heat
in your oven they start to reduce – or break down – and interact with the proteins. That’s when you can see 
your pastry turning golden brown. But it’s not just about that physical transformation. You can taste the effects of the maillard
reaction too – that's what gives us the flavors
of the golden crust on a piece of bread or a nice sear on a steak or that mellow richness
of, say, caramelized onions. The trick behind that reaction is to find the perfect temperature that sets
it into action without over or under-doing it. These recipes might make you think that Maillard reaction occurs at 350 degrees, but actually ... So these Maillard reactions tend to occur at
a fairly low temperature – around 230 to 240 degrees Fahrenheit. You want to manipulate the rate at which
this reaction occurs both at the surface and internally to get the results you want. If we bake too cool, the entire cookie, for example, will dry out before
we get that surface drying that will lead to browning. If we bake things in too hot an oven, the opposite
occurs and we get burning. To get it just right we preheat the oven to 350 degrees
so the Maillard reaction has time to occur throughout the entire cookie. For most home cooks and to also account for
the fact that everyone's oven is slightly different, I think 350 is a great benchmark to work from. It’s a safe standard for most
people, but the number can also be altered to yield slightly different
results. Some pastry chefs might bake at 325 if they want a lighter colored cookie,
and some push it to 375 for a crispier outside. A lot of things that contemporary bakers tend
to forget is not too long ago, in history, we didn't have as much control over our ovens
or being a pastry chef meant being able to build a fire and maintain an oven temperature. Before the 1900’s, when ovens didn’t have
temperature regulators, recipe writers instructed bakers to “cook in a moderate” “hot”
or “slow” oven depending on the food. After the second world war, the temperature gauge was developed and it became widely popular across households. Modern ovens typically ranged from 200 to
550 degrees, so over time, recipe writers converted these temperature guidelines to actual numbers -- they settled on the 350 mark for “moderate”
which was the sweet spot for baking. Using these more specific numbers is really
a result of better oven design and better oven control. And the more you understand about what goes on inside your oven, the better results you'll get. And who doesn't want a better cookie? Hey everyone, thanks for watching. If you're interested in more food content, head on over our sister channel Eater. They've got this cool series where they test out different kitchen gadgets and they recently put up a video on pressure cookers.

Good morning, John! Today is the day after Thanksgiving here in America. Traditionally, the day when we buy all the things! Actually, more traditionally at my house, it's the day when we don't leave the house; because Black Friday.. terrifies me. For people who aren't American, the very ominous-sounding Black Friday is an accident of history. So, back in 1621, it was hard livin' here in America; and the first English settlers had a really bountiful crop. Apparently. This is somewhat mythological... And, it was on a Thursday; and they were thankful! That inspired a holiday; which is a nice kind of idea for a holiday, where you just talk about the things that you're thankful for. And eat a bunch of food! You also eat a bunch of food. Until the 1860's, different states celebrated this holiday on different days. Until Abraham Lincoln said: "This.. is the day! We're gonna have a national day."; and, the South was like: "We're not even part of you anymore. What are you talking about?!" But then, when we got back together again, that was good; and it became the national holiday. The fourth Thursday in November. Now, because it's a national holiday on the Thursday, you also sort of get that Friday as a de facto day off. 'Cause you don't want to go back to work for one day and then have the weekend; that's just dumb! In the '60's [1960's], because so many people were going on vacation on this day, or, to a lesser extent, going shopping; this became such a terrible traffic mess that police and taxi drivers started calling it "Black Friday". As stores, and also just general consumerist cultures, started pushing the idea of Christmas shopping further and further away from Christmas; the big block in the road, where you can't push it back any further, is Thanksgiving. 'Cause that's its own holiday. You can't start Christmas before Thanksgiving. And so, Black Friday became the official tipping point into the consumerist bonanza that is the holiday shopping season! Despite the fact that it has kind of this ominous-sounding name, it has been billed as the biggest and most important and best holiday shopping day of the year; which is actually not true. We are.. a nation of procrastinators; and thus, the biggest shopping day of the year is Christmas Eve. It seems a little bit upsetting that the day after we all get done telling the world why we should be satisfied with our lives, we are.. barraged with an advertising blitz showing us all of the things that we lack! At the same time, it is very important to the American economy. I mean, you can't really get angry at people for wanting to give each other things... And yes, DFTBA.com has its own Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals; and you can go to DFTBA.com and check those out now. It's also our 4th Anniversary of being a company, which is very exciting! And, to celebrate that fourth anniversary, all shipping within the United States this weekend, starting tomorrow, I think, is just $4.00! No matter what you buy!! But, I do think it's important that we don't just scrub the idea of satisfaction and thankfulness out of our brains as soon as we're done for Thanksgiving. And so, on this Black Friday, I want to continue being thankful. I'm thankful to my wonderful and supportive parents; to my beautiful, and intelligent, and hilarious wife. I'm thankful to my new Wii U. If you want to go to youtube.com/hankgames, you can see us playing the new Super Mario Brothers there soon. I'm thankful to all of my great friends here in Missoula and across the world. I'm thankful to finally have a robust and stable forum that can handle the weight of Nerdfighteria. There's a link in the description. I'm thankful to Youtube and Google for funding SciShow and Crash Course, and for supporting VlogBrothers, and all of our endeavors through the years. I'm thankful to Reddit , and QI, and Mental Floss magazine, for making sure that I keep learning interesting things. I'm thankful to Jonas Salk for giving away the patent to his polio vaccine to the world, so that it could be less expensive to manufacture; and Tim Berners-Lee for doing basically the same thing with the internet. I'm thankful to the Nerdcrafteria Minecraft server and Tumblr, and the Ning; and all the other places on the internet where Nerdfighters do Nerdfighter things. And, I'm thankful to all the wonderful, thoughtful, intelligent people who watch and support the things that I do on the internet; even when it's sappy, silly videos like this one. And I'm thankful, of course, for my brother who's always driving me to do new and interesting and difficult things; and who's raising a wonderful family, and who says wise and intelligent things on Tumblr. And John, I'll see you on Tuesday. *Music plays*

**Transcript**:
Of all the fruits farmed in the United
States, you can count on one hand, how many are native to this land - cranberries are one of them. They were both food and medicine - to
Native Americans - who recognize the cranberries' anti-inflammatory properties.
They even spread it on their arrow wounds. And today we know the humble cranberry
outranks almost every fruit and vegetable for disease fighting
antioxidants. Every year one-fifth of America's total harvest is consumed
around one day: Thanksgiving. Most of that, is cranberry sauce. Only five percent of the nation's crop
is sold as whole fresh cranberries. But everything else we eat: the dried
sweetened cranberries, the juice, the sauce - it all starts with this peculiar
little berry. And contrary to popular belief, cranberries don't grow under
water. So - how do they grow? We're in southern New Jersey - one of
America's top three cranberry states. This region is called the Pine Barrens,
and natural habitat for cranberries. Many of the same families have farmed the berries since the mid-1800s - like the Leigh brothers - this seventh generation
cranberry farm. Cranberries grow on low trailing vines and sunken beds called bogs. The plants are perennial, meaning they survive year after year. Here the oldest vines are over 65 years old. Cranberries love this sort of sandy soil, and they take a long time to grow - 16 months. You can see here that while the berries are ripening, the buds for next year's crop are already growing on the
vine. So farmers have to carefully nurture two seasons worth of cranberries
at one time. Water is one of the most precious resources for cranberry farmers.
This 2,000 acre farm uses only a hundred and thirty acres to grow cranberries. The
rest is a series of reservoirs and watersheds. The primary sources that is
the waiting river, which runs naturally along the farm, and we'll borrow the water
during the growing season, and put it back in when we're finished with it.
We're simply holding the keys for the following generations after harvest. So
what's all this water for, if the cranberries grow in dry land? Well, twice
a year the farmers flood the bogs. First in December for the duration of winter. This is when the plants go dormant, and their blanket of water insulates the
vines from harsh winter frost. In the spring, the bogs are drained, and the cranberries' pink flowers bloom. Nowadays, many farms like Lee brothers hire commercial bees to pollinate the fields. And by mid-June, the fruit begins to grow,
the berries start out green, turn white around August, and finally, red in the
fall. The funny thing about cranberries is, they don't really sweeten as they
ripen like strawberries or blueberries. They're a naturally tart fruit, whether
they're red or white, and the color is just skin deep. See, the
inside is white and it's crisp like an apple, and inside there are four air
chambers, which means that cranberries can - float - and that brings us to the
second time the bogs are flooded: for the October Harvest. A harvester drives through to knock the berries off the vines. Then, farmers wade into the bog, to corral
the floating berries to an elevator that sucks them up into a truck. Nearly all the cranberry farmers in New
Jersey belonged to the Ocean Spray Cooperative, which grows over 60% of the
world's cranberries. These berries will be frozen and processed into craisins
and cranberry juice. Remember, cranberries are tart, so a lot
of cranberry products have added sugar, to make them sweet. But around
Thanksgiving, you can find whole cranberries (fresh or frozen) in the
supermarket, and you can easily turn these beauties into a killer cranberry
sauce. You can even mold the sauce, and
refrigerate it for that fresh-from-a-can look, except this stuff is a whole lot
better for you - and it tastes a whole lot better too...

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage of America's total cranberry harvest consumed around Thanksgiving. While none of the generated MCQs ask the same question, Question 6 mentions the harvesting process, which is related to the context of the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest in terms of intent and content, I would suggest Question 8, which talks about cranberry products and their consumption, although it does not directly mention Thanksgiving or the percentage of harvest consumed.

But since none of the questions match the intent of the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index.

However, I can suggest creating a new generated MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ, such as:

Question: What percentage of America's total cranberry harvest is consumed around Thanksgiving?
Options: A. 10%, B. 15%, C. 20%, D. 25%

This new generated MCQ would be a direct match for the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage of the annual harvest that is eaten fresh. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 6 mentions the harvesting process, which is related to the topic.

However, a closer match can be found in the transcript, where it is mentioned that "Only five percent of the nation's crop is sold as whole fresh cranberries." This information is not directly used in any of the generated MCQs, but it is related to the content of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 6, but with a note that it's not a direct match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 6 (with a note that it's not a direct match)

A better approach would be to generate a new MCQ that directly asks about the percentage of the annual harvest that is eaten fresh, using the information from the transcript. For example:

Generated MCQ:
Question: What percentage of the nation's cranberry crop is sold as whole fresh cranberries?
Options: A. 2%, B. 5%, C. 12%, D. 15%
Correct Option: B

This generated MCQ would be a direct match to the ground truth MCQ.

They even spread it on their arrow wounds. And today we know the humble cranberry
outranks almost every fruit and vegetable for disease fighting
antioxidants. Every year one-fifth of America's total harvest is consumed
around one day: Thanksgiving. Most of that, is cranberry sauce. Only five percent of the nation's crop
is sold as whole fresh cranberries. But everything else we eat: the dried
sweetened cranberries, the juice, the sauce - it all starts with this peculiar
little berry. And contrary to popular belief, cranberries don't grow under
water. So - how do they grow? We're in southern New Jersey - one of
America's top three cranberry states. This region is called the Pine Barrens,
and natural habitat for cranberries. Many of the same families have farmed the berries since the mid-1800s - like the Leigh brothers - this seventh generation
cranberry farm. Cranberries grow on low trailing vines and sunken beds called bogs. The plants are perennial, meaning they survive year after year. Here the oldest vines are over 65 years old. Cranberries love this sort of sandy soil, and they take a long time to grow - 16 months. You can see here that while the berries are ripening, the buds for next year's crop are already growing on the
vine. So farmers have to carefully nurture two seasons worth of cranberries
at one time. Water is one of the most precious resources for cranberry farmers.
This 2,000 acre farm uses only a hundred and thirty acres to grow cranberries. The
rest is a series of reservoirs and watersheds. The primary sources that is
the waiting river, which runs naturally along the farm, and we'll borrow the water
during the growing season, and put it back in when we're finished with it.
We're simply holding the keys for the following generations after harvest. So
what's all this water for, if the cranberries grow in dry land? Well, twice
a year the farmers flood the bogs. First in December for the duration of winter. This is when the plants go dormant, and their blanket of water insulates the
vines from harsh winter frost. In the spring, the bogs are drained, and the cranberries' pink flowers bloom. Nowadays, many farms like Lee brothers hire commercial bees to pollinate the fields. And by mid-June, the fruit begins to grow,
the berries start out green, turn white around August, and finally, red in the
fall. The funny thing about cranberries is, they don't really sweeten as they
ripen like strawberries or blueberries. They're a naturally tart fruit, whether
they're red or white, and the color is just skin deep. See, the
inside is white and it's crisp like an apple, and inside there are four air
chambers, which means that cranberries can - float - and that brings us to the
second time the bogs are flooded: for the October Harvest. A harvester drives through to knock the berries off the vines. Then, farmers wade into the bog, to corral
the floating berries to an elevator that sucks them up into a truck. Nearly all the cranberry farmers in New
Jersey belonged to the Ocean Spray Cooperative, which grows over 60% of the
world's cranberries. These berries will be frozen and processed into craisins
and cranberry juice. Remember, cranberries are tart, so a lot
of cranberry products have added sugar, to make them sweet. But around
Thanksgiving, you can find whole cranberries (fresh or frozen) in the
supermarket, and you can easily turn these beauties into a killer cranberry
sauce. You can even mold the sauce, and
refrigerate it for that fresh-from-a-can look, except this stuff is a whole lot
better for you - and it tastes a whole lot better too...

**Transcript**:
Of all the fruits farmed in the United
States, you can count on one hand, how many are native to this land - cranberries are one of them. They were both food and medicine - to
Native Americans - who recognize the cranberries' anti-inflammatory properties.
They even spread it on their arrow wounds. And today we know the humble cranberry
outranks almost every fruit and vegetable for disease fighting
antioxidants. Every year one-fifth of America's total harvest is consumed
around one day: Thanksgiving. Most of that, is cranberry sauce. Only five percent of the nation's crop
is sold as whole fresh cranberries. But everything else we eat: the dried
sweetened cranberries, the juice, the sauce - it all starts with this peculiar
little berry. And contrary to popular belief, cranberries don't grow under
water. So - how do they grow? We're in southern New Jersey - one of
America's top three cranberry states. This region is called the Pine Barrens,
and natural habitat for cranberries. Many of the same families have farmed the berries since the mid-1800s - like the Leigh brothers - this seventh generation
cranberry farm. Cranberries grow on low trailing vines and sunken beds called bogs. The plants are perennial, meaning they survive year after year. Here the oldest vines are over 65 years old. Cranberries love this sort of sandy soil, and they take a long time to grow - 16 months. You can see here that while the berries are ripening, the buds for next year's crop are already growing on the
vine. So farmers have to carefully nurture two seasons worth of cranberries
at one time. Water is one of the most precious resources for cranberry farmers.
This 2,000 acre farm uses only a hundred and thirty acres to grow cranberries. The
rest is a series of reservoirs and watersheds. The primary sources that is
the waiting river, which runs naturally along the farm, and we'll borrow the water
during the growing season, and put it back in when we're finished with it.
We're simply holding the keys for the following generations after harvest. So
what's all this water for, if the cranberries grow in dry land? Well, twice
a year the farmers flood the bogs. First in December for the duration of winter. This is when the plants go dormant, and their blanket of water insulates the
vines from harsh winter frost. In the spring, the bogs are drained, and the cranberries' pink flowers bloom. Nowadays, many farms like Lee brothers hire commercial bees to pollinate the fields. And by mid-June, the fruit begins to grow,
the berries start out green, turn white around August, and finally, red in the
fall. The funny thing about cranberries is, they don't really sweeten as they
ripen like strawberries or blueberries. They're a naturally tart fruit, whether
they're red or white, and the color is just skin deep. See, the
inside is white and it's crisp like an apple, and inside there are four air
chambers, which means that cranberries can - float - and that brings us to the
second time the bogs are flooded: for the October Harvest. A harvester drives through to knock the berries off the vines. Then, farmers wade into the bog, to corral
the floating berries to an elevator that sucks them up into a truck. Nearly all the cranberry farmers in New
Jersey belonged to the Ocean Spray Cooperative, which grows over 60% of the
world's cranberries. These berries will be frozen and processed into craisins
and cranberry juice. Remember, cranberries are tart, so a lot
of cranberry products have added sugar, to make them sweet. But around

**Transcript**:
Of all the fruits farmed in the United
States, you can count on one hand, how many are native to this land - cranberries are one of them. They were both food and medicine - to
Native Americans - who recognize the cranberries' anti-inflammatory properties.
They even spread it on their arrow wounds. And today we know the humble cranberry
outranks almost every fruit and vegetable for disease fighting
antioxidants. Every year one-fifth of America's total harvest is consumed
around one day: Thanksgiving. Most of that, is cranberry sauce. Only five percent of the nation's crop
is sold as whole fresh cranberries. But everything else we eat: the dried
sweetened cranberries, the juice, the sauce - it all starts with this peculiar
little berry. And contrary to popular belief, cranberries don't grow under
water. So - how do they grow? We're in southern New Jersey - one of
America's top three cranberry states. This region is called the Pine Barrens,
and natural habitat for cranberries. Many of the same families have farmed the berries since the mid-1800s - like the Leigh brothers - this seventh generation
cranberry farm. Cranberries grow on low trailing vines and sunken beds called bogs. The plants are perennial, meaning they survive year after year. Here the oldest vines are over 65 years old. Cranberries love this sort of sandy soil, and they take a long time to grow - 16 months. You can see here that while the berries are ripening, the buds for next year's crop are already growing on the
vine. So farmers have to carefully nurture two seasons worth of cranberries
at one time. Water is one of the most precious resources for cranberry farmers.
This 2,000 acre farm uses only a hundred and thirty acres to grow cranberries. The
rest is a series of reservoirs and watersheds. The primary sources that is
the waiting river, which runs naturally along the farm, and we'll borrow the water
during the growing season, and put it back in when we're finished with it.
We're simply holding the keys for the following generations after harvest. So
what's all this water for, if the cranberries grow in dry land? Well, twice
a year the farmers flood the bogs. First in December for the duration of winter. This is when the plants go dormant, and their blanket of water insulates the
vines from harsh winter frost. In the spring, the bogs are drained, and the cranberries' pink flowers bloom. Nowadays, many farms like Lee brothers hire commercial bees to pollinate the fields. And by mid-June, the fruit begins to grow,
the berries start out green, turn white around August, and finally, red in the
fall. The funny thing about cranberries is, they don't really sweeten as they
ripen like strawberries or blueberries. They're a naturally tart fruit, whether
they're red or white, and the color is just skin deep. See, the
inside is white and it's crisp like an apple, and inside there are four air
chambers, which means that cranberries can - float - and that brings us to the
second time the bogs are flooded: for the October Harvest. A harvester drives through to knock the berries off the vines. Then, farmers wade into the bog, to corral
the floating berries to an elevator that sucks them up into a truck. Nearly all the cranberry farmers in New
Jersey belonged to the Ocean Spray Cooperative, which grows over 60% of the
world's cranberries. These berries will be frozen and processed into craisins
and cranberry juice. Remember, cranberries are tart, so a lot
of cranberry products have added sugar, to make them sweet. But around
Thanksgiving, you can find whole cranberries (fresh or frozen) in the
supermarket, and you can easily turn these beauties into a killer cranberry
sauce. You can even mold the sauce, and
refrigerate it for that fresh-from-a-can look, except this stuff is a whole lot
better for you - and it tastes a whole lot better too...

**Transcript**:
Some of our very favorite foods are closer
to this than this. That’s because coffee, bread, cheese, beer
– even chocolate! – are home to millions of microbes. In fact, these foods only acquire the tastes,
smells, and textures we love because of tiny bacteria and fungi. The vast majority of microbes – about 99%
– are actually quite harmless to humans. But the other 1% are nasty enough that our
ancestors – and the ancestors of various other mammals and birds – evolved a natural
repulsion to stuff that might harbor nasty germs. In general, we think rotten stuff looks and
smells disgusting, which, considering what's at stake, isn’t overly cautious. Fortunately, if friendly microbes get to our
food first, they can keep the bad guys at bay. Meat left out on the counter provides the
perfect conditions for pathogens to flourish: it’s warm, moist, and protein-rich, just
like our bodies. But with some micromanagement – adding lots
of salt, for instance – we can help harmless, salt-tolerant microbes like Lactobacillus
outcompete their dangerous but salt-sensitive relatives. A few unrefrigerated months later, we get
salami, rather than Salmonelli! Our ancestors stumbled on this kind of controlled
spoilage thousands of years ago – either by lucky accidents or out of serious desperation
– and we humans have been intentionally spoiling food ever since. Not only to keep our food safe to eat, but
also because the microbes we culture can transform it, almost magically, into awesome deliciousness. Yeast, for example, gorge on the sugary starch
in bread dough, then burp out carbon dioxide that helps give loaves their lift. In a more exotic transformation, bacteria
and fungi take turns munching on piles of cacao, mellowing out bitter polyphenols and
helping create the complex and delicious taste of chocolate. And deep in cheese caves, mold spores populate
small holes and cracks in soon-to-be blue cheese, while their relatives munch through
the rest of the blob, digesting big protein and fat molecules into a host of smaller aromatic
and flavor compounds, that give the final product its smoothness and rich, funky flavor. But to some, stinky cheese is about as appetizing
as licking someone’s toes. Which isn’t that far off, since the bacteria
that make some cheeses super-stinky are the same ones that cause foot odor. Yum? Even so, these flavors tend to grow on us:
not just literally but also figuratively. The more we’re exposed to particular microbial
funks – from our first taste of the flavor compounds in amniotic fluid forward – the
more we tend to like them. As a result, people around the world have
some very different ideas about how to microbe-ify foods – but every culinary culture involves
fermentation in one way or another. And if we didn’t let food spoil just a little
bit, we’d have no sauerkraut, soy sauce, pickles, or prosciutto. Not to mention kefir, kimchi, kombucha, koumiss,
katsuobushi - and plenty of other delicacies that don’t start with K. What’s more,
spoiled food may well have changed far more than our tastes – historical evidence suggests
that, when our ancestors gave up their wandering ways and settled down to grow grain, it was
likely for love of either bread or beer. Whatever the case, one thing is clear: without
the help of friendly fermenting microbes, we humans would  be terribly uncultured.

After re-evaluating the generated MCQs, I found that Question 3 is related to the environment where microbes can survive, but it does not directly answer the ground truth MCQ.

However, I noticed that Question 4 mentions an environment where microbes can outcompete pathogens, but it does not describe the environment itself.

Since I have to choose an index, I will choose the index of the generated MCQ that is most closely related to the ground truth MCQ, which is Question 4, but with the understanding that it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index: 4

**Transcript**:
[Emily}: Hey! So taxonomy is a totally complicated, really interesting field of science responsible for the naming and classification of things and we started to kind of get into this topic with our previous episode on "What is a Species", where we look into species definitions and concepts but I thought it would be really fun to do a hands-on experiment and there's nothing better than getting a couple of expert taxonomists in on the game.   [Olivier]: I'm Olivier Rieppel. I'm the Roe family curator of evolutionary biology here at the Field Museum in Chicago. [Janet]: I'm Janet Voight. I'm a MacArthur Associate Curator here at the Field Museum in the Intergrative Research Center. [Larry]: My name is Larry Heaney. I am the Negaunee Curator of Mammals at the Field Museum at the Field Museum of Natural History. [Margaret]: My name's Margaret Thayer. I'm a curator emeritus at the Field Museum I study insects, particularly beetles. [Emily]: And we wanted to get them to look at something in-depth that maybe they hadn't considered classifying before. Skittles! Peanut M&Ms! Peanut butter M&Ms! Nerds! Plain M&Ms! Starbursts! Reese's Pieces! Jellybeans! Chocolate-covered peanuts! Chewy Jolly Rancher thingies! Starburst jellybeans! And we had some black licorice, but I lost it. That's right--we're doing the taxonomy of candy. [Brain Scoop intro music] [Olivier]: If you want to classify things--and that can be anything, I mean, organisms you classify according to illusionary relationships With candy, or office furniture, or whatever you classify according to similarities. [Janet]: the art of taxonomy requires that you actually separate that new thing that you think you've found as much as you can from every other species that looks like it. [Larry]: I like chocolate-covered candy.
[Emily]: OK. [Larry]: And so we could group it together that way. [Emily]: So, essentially, all of these on this side, and we can move the Nerds over here. [Larry]: And that one too.
[Emily]: Yup.
[Larry]: Yup.
[Larry]: Can I have one of those? [Emily]: Yes, feel free. [Margaret]: I think investigating their contents would be an important thing to look at. It's not quite as hard as it looks. [Emily]: Oh wow! [Margaret]: That has some kind of jelly material in it. (chewing) I don't usually use this test for specimens, but...(both laugh) [Emily]: Do you eat the beetles that you study?
[Margaret]: No, not normally. [Margaret]: We occasionally sniff them, but that's all. 
[Emily]: Oh. [Olivier]: Here are the roundish things, the big ones, and then the smaller roundish things would be more closely related to that batch here than to any of the others. [Janet]: Right now I'm approaching these jars as collections made of what's likely the same species. The collections were made at one spot, at one time. [Emily]: You went to the river, put the jar in the water, and it was filled with Reese's Pieces. [Janet]: Yeah.
[Emily]: OK.
[Janet]: In La-La Land, I mean, but...
(both laugh) [Larry]: So we could group things together, put the chocolate ones together that way OR we could take the red ones and put those together.
[Emily]: Allll of the red ones. [Margaret]: That would be like taking a whole bunch of different red birds and putting them all together because they're red but one of them is a cardinal and one is some kind of duck, and you know...*muttering*..they're not related at all, so.... [Emily]: They're not even close.
[Margaret]: Yeah. [Emily]: So would you put those with the other bean shapes, here?
[Olivier]: So these are the bean shapes, here... [Olivier]: And then you have the bean shaped, you have the rounded, that go closer, that go over with the bean shaped... And you have the small rounded, that go closer with those... [Janet]: So just flipping through these, I'm seeing these Reese's Pieces: different colors, but the shape is amazingly uniform. These, with a strange letter "M", have some damage--I see their guts are actually chocolate. So my hypothesis is that each of these things, despite being a different color, actually has guts of chocolate. [Emily]: So you think that the red Skittles and the red Jolly Ranchers, and the red black-covered licorice, as gross as it is, can all be one thing. [Larry] (eating candy): Absolutely.
That's the thing about candy. You can put it together, you can group them any way you want.
[Emily]: Mm-hmm
[Larry]: Doesn't matter. [Olivier]: The way they are mixed up, you can't classify them in colors, because there is all colors in one. [Emily]: Right.
[Olivier]: So, not many characters to go with. [Emily]: I have insider knowledge: I have done extensive work on the taxonomy of Jelly Bellies. [Margaret]: (laughing)
[Emily]: And I can tell you that there are 36 different flavors in here. [Emily]: What would you make of something like that? [Margaret]: Well it could be that, uh, if we worked out the taxonomy of these things, we might decide that the Jelly Bellies were a genus unto themselves. And those 36, 37 flavors were different species of Jelly Bellies. [Emily]: Oh wow.
[Margaret]: Similarly, those other jelly bean things, that would be another way to interpret those as well. [Emily]: They're like the same family.
[Margaret]: *clears throat* Yeah. [Emily]: They're in the jelly bean family.
[Margaret]: The jelly bean family, right. [Emily]: I want to organize candy in a way where I can reach my hand in and shove them all in my face You can't do that with the red candy because then you've got like the peanut M&M and then the cinnamon Jelly Belly. [Larry]: Cinnamon and peanut butter actually would go together well.... [Larry]: You can try that.
[Emily]: Um, I'm okay. [Emily]: I'm alright.
*both start laughing* [Janet]: So you slap out your pen and your paper and your computer and you say, "Why are they different?" So you add all those up and then you go back and look in the literature For previously published descriptions of things that are kind of like this. 
[Emily]: Uh-huh [Janet]: In the same genus, let's say---or maybe in related genera, because sometimes a genus isn't as good as you think it is... [Emily]: nyeah...
[Janet]: But then you read those, and you look at them, and if you're kind of confused, then you try and get a hold of specimens, so that way...
[Emily]: And then it keeps kinda going. [Olivier]: The goal of classification, in terms of organisms, the goal of classification is to bring out their evolutionary relationships. [Larry]: What makes organisms so different is that our classifications of those is based on their relationships, on their ancestors. We don't put red bats and red foxes together. We COULD put red candy together! It makes perfect sense, why not? But we don't do it with red bats and red foxes because they DON'T share a common ancestor except way way way way WAY back. [Olivier]: Yeah, there's very many ways to classify things, and it's an interesting problem. Why there should be so many ways to classify things, and what these different classification things say about the world. [Emily]: And what does it say about us as people--
[Olivier]: as people, exactly. [Emily]: For choosing the ways, ways that we choose [Olivier]: Which means to say, is it us bringing order to the world? Or does the world come to us in an ordered way? [Olivier]: And probably is the first way around.
[Emily]: Oh wow. Now you're going into the philosophical rabbit hole.

[Margaret]: That would be like taking a whole bunch of different red birds and putting them all together because they're red but one of them is a cardinal and one is some kind of duck, and you know...*muttering*..they're not related at all, so.... [Emily]: They're not even close.
[Margaret]: Yeah. [Emily]: So would you put those with the other bean shapes, here?
[Olivier]: So these are the bean shapes, here... [Olivier]: And then you have the bean shaped, you have the rounded, that go closer, that go over with the bean shaped... And you have the small rounded, that go closer with those... [Janet]: So just flipping through these, I'm seeing these Reese's Pieces: different colors, but the shape is amazingly uniform. These, with a strange letter "M", have some damage--I see their guts are actually chocolate. So my hypothesis is that each of these things, despite being a different color, actually has guts of chocolate. [Emily]: So you think that the red Skittles and the red Jolly Ranchers, and the red black-covered licorice, as gross as it is, can all be one thing. [Larry] (eating candy): Absolutely.
That's the thing about candy. You can put it together, you can group them any way you want.
[Emily]: Mm-hmm
[Larry]: Doesn't matter. [Olivier]: The way they are mixed up, you can't classify them in colors, because there is all colors in one. [Emily]: Right.
[Olivier]: So, not many characters to go with. [Emily]: I have insider knowledge: I have done extensive work on the taxonomy of Jelly Bellies. [Margaret]: (laughing)
[Emily]: And I can tell you that there are 36 different flavors in here. [Emily]: What would you make of something like that? [Margaret]: Well it could be that, uh, if we worked out the taxonomy of these things, we might decide that the Jelly Bellies were a genus unto themselves. And those 36, 37 flavors were different species of Jelly Bellies. [Emily]: Oh wow.
[Margaret]: Similarly, those other jelly bean things, that would be another way to interpret those as well. [Emily]: They're like the same family.
[Margaret]: *clears throat* Yeah. [Emily]: They're in the jelly bean family.
[Margaret]: The jelly bean family, right. [Emily]: I want to organize candy in a way where I can reach my hand in and shove them all in my face You can't do that with the red candy because then you've got like the peanut M&M and then the cinnamon Jelly Belly. [Larry]: Cinnamon and peanut butter actually would go together well.... [Larry]: You can try that.
[Emily]: Um, I'm okay. [Emily]: I'm alright.
*both start laughing* [Janet]: So you slap out your pen and your paper and your computer and you say, "Why are they different?" So you add all those up and then you go back and look in the literature For previously published descriptions of things that are kind of like this. 
[Emily]: Uh-huh [Janet]: In the same genus, let's say---or maybe in related genera, because sometimes a genus isn't as good as you think it is... [Emily]: nyeah...
[Janet]: But then you read those, and you look at them, and if you're kind of confused, then you try and get a hold of specimens, so that way...
[Emily]: And then it keeps kinda going. [Olivier]: The goal of classification, in terms of organisms, the goal of classification is to bring out their evolutionary relationships. [Larry]: What makes organisms so different is that our classifications of those is based on their relationships, on their ancestors. We don't put red bats and red foxes together. We COULD put red candy together! It makes perfect sense, why not? But we don't do it with red bats and red foxes because they DON'T share a common ancestor except way way way way WAY back. [Olivier]: Yeah, there's very many ways to classify things, and it's an interesting problem. Why there should be so many ways to classify things, and what these different classification things say about the world. [Emily]: And what does it say about us as people--
[Olivier]: as people, exactly. [Emily]: For choosing the ways, ways that we choose [Olivier]: Which means to say, is it us bringing order to the world? Or does the world come to us in an ordered way? [Olivier]: And probably is the first way around.
[Emily]: Oh wow. Now you're going into the philosophical rabbit hole.

**Transcript**:
[Emily}: Hey! So taxonomy is a totally complicated, really interesting field of science responsible for the naming and classification of things and we started to kind of get into this topic with our previous episode on "What is a Species", where we look into species definitions and concepts but I thought it would be really fun to do a hands-on experiment and there's nothing better than getting a couple of expert taxonomists in on the game.   [Olivier]: I'm Olivier Rieppel. I'm the Roe family curator of evolutionary biology here at the Field Museum in Chicago. [Janet]: I'm Janet Voight. I'm a MacArthur Associate Curator here at the Field Museum in the Intergrative Research Center. [Larry]: My name is Larry Heaney. I am the Negaunee Curator of Mammals at the Field Museum at the Field Museum of Natural History. [Margaret]: My name's Margaret Thayer. I'm a curator emeritus at the Field Museum I study insects, particularly beetles. [Emily]: And we wanted to get them to look at something in-depth that maybe they hadn't considered classifying before. Skittles! Peanut M&Ms! Peanut butter M&Ms! Nerds! Plain M&Ms! Starbursts! Reese's Pieces! Jellybeans! Chocolate-covered peanuts! Chewy Jolly Rancher thingies! Starburst jellybeans! And we had some black licorice, but I lost it. That's right--we're doing the taxonomy of candy. [Brain Scoop intro music] [Olivier]: If you want to classify things--and that can be anything, I mean, organisms you classify according to illusionary relationships With candy, or office furniture, or whatever you classify according to similarities. [Janet]: the art of taxonomy requires that you actually separate that new thing that you think you've found as much as you can from every other species that looks like it. [Larry]: I like chocolate-covered candy.
[Emily]: OK. [Larry]: And so we could group it together that way. [Emily]: So, essentially, all of these on this side, and we can move the Nerds over here. [Larry]: And that one too.
[Emily]: Yup.
[Larry]: Yup.
[Larry]: Can I have one of those? [Emily]: Yes, feel free. [Margaret]: I think investigating their contents would be an important thing to look at. It's not quite as hard as it looks. [Emily]: Oh wow! [Margaret]: That has some kind of jelly material in it. (chewing) I don't usually use this test for specimens, but...(both laugh) [Emily]: Do you eat the beetles that you study?
[Margaret]: No, not normally. [Margaret]: We occasionally sniff them, but that's all. 
[Emily]: Oh. [Olivier]: Here are the roundish things, the big ones, and then the smaller roundish things would be more closely related to that batch here than to any of the others. [Janet]: Right now I'm approaching these jars as collections made of what's likely the same species. The collections were made at one spot, at one time. [Emily]: You went to the river, put the jar in the water, and it was filled with Reese's Pieces. [Janet]: Yeah.
[Emily]: OK.
[Janet]: In La-La Land, I mean, but...
(both laugh) [Larry]: So we could group things together, put the chocolate ones together that way OR we could take the red ones and put those together.
[Emily]: Allll of the red ones. [Margaret]: That would be like taking a whole bunch of different red birds and putting them all together because they're red but one of them is a cardinal and one is some kind of duck, and you know...*muttering*..they're not related at all, so.... [Emily]: They're not even close.
[Margaret]: Yeah. [Emily]: So would you put those with the other bean shapes, here?
[Olivier]: So these are the bean shapes, here... [Olivier]: And then you have the bean shaped, you have the rounded, that go closer, that go over with the bean shaped... And you have the small rounded, that go closer with those... [Janet]: So just flipping through these, I'm seeing these Reese's Pieces: different colors, but the shape is amazingly uniform. These, with a strange letter "M", have some damage--I see their guts are actually chocolate. So my hypothesis is that each of these things, despite being a different color, actually has guts of chocolate. [Emily]: So you think that the red Skittles and the red Jolly Ranchers, and the red black-covered licorice, as gross as it is, can all be one thing. [Larry] (eating candy): Absolutely.

**Transcript**:
Pumpkins are a mighty squash -
and they're actually the exact same species as a lot of other squash.
Acorn squash, yellow squash,
spaghetti squash, and even zucchini.
That means a zucchini and a pumpkin can breed and have little babies
zumpkins Or, maybe ... pumpkinis? The latin name for pumpkins is Cucurbita pepo,
which just means gourd melon, a truly uninspired bit of naming.
Like all fruit, pumpkins are both a trick and a treat – The seeds are hidden inside a delicious,
brightly covered package So animals to will eat them, 
and then spread them around. Pumpkin seeds (or pepitas) have evolved tough
shells that can survive the exciting journey through an animal's
digestive tract. In Russia, some believe that eating pumpkin
seeds can help get rid of parasitic worms. It's
not clear if that really works in humans but there is a real published study in which
pumpkin seeds helped de-worm ostriches. Pumpkins come from the Americas - they were
actually one of the first plants domesticated here 8-10 thousand years ago.
When the pilgrims arrived in 1620 they ate a lot of pumpkins.
They even wrote a poem about. That rhyme scheme was not great, but maybe that’s because the pilgrims were also making
a lot of beer with their pumpkins. Pumpkin beer was already a thing way back in the 17th century Sorry hipsters! People once thought they could get rid of freckles
by putting mashed-up pumpkin on there faces. And in all fairness that probably did distract
from the freckles. Explorers soon brought pumpkins back to europe.
It was only 1697 when a Frenchman incorporated a pumpkin into
the popular folktale we know as Cinderella. That was actually a very specific variety
of pumpkin - a red pumpkin – and there are lots of other colors. Yellow, white, even blue. And all pumpkins start out green – their
skin is full of green chlorophyll that photosynthesizes just like in a leaf. As the pumpkin ripens, the chlorophyll breaks down, and other pigments like orange carotene
become visible. You know how they gas green
tomatoes to turn them red? It's called ethylene  - and its given off
by a lot of ripening fruits. So if you have an unripe green pumpkin and
you want to change its color, put it in a bag with some old apples
and wait a few days. The Jack-O-Lantern has its roots in Europe
The story goes that a sinful man named Stingy Jack tricked the devil to get out of of hell but also wasn't allowed into heaven
so he was forced to wander the earth with only a single coal for a light. In the British Isles, people used turnips to carve their own Jack-O-Lanterns, but when they got to the Americas they must have realized: these will work waaaaay better.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not explicitly state that pumpkins and zucchinis are part of the same species.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that explicitly asks about the relationship between pumpkins and zucchinis. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the information provided in the transcript, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match. The transcript mentions that the Latin name for pumpkins is Cucurbita pepo, which is the same species as other squash, including zucchinis.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ would be 1, but please note that it is not a perfect match.

It would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that explicitly asks about the relationship between pumpkins and zucchinis, such as:

Have you ever heard someone say they're "blind as a bat"? Well that expression is a bit misguided. During the day, some kinds of bats can see almost as well as humans. But when the sun goes down, nocturnal bats rely on their ears more than their eyes to navigate. This special navigation process is called echolocation. In echolocation, bats use a combination of the voice, ears, and echoes to create a perceptual map that allows them to "see" in the dark. You might be wondering where an echo comes from. An echo is the reflection of sound reaching a listener. Sound is a vibration that ripples away from its source in waves. The rate at which this vibration occurs is called its frequency. Sound waves at high frequencies are high-pitched. Humans can hear sounds at frequencies between 20 and 20,000 waves per second and don't perceive pitches outside that range. Bats, on the other hand, can hear and produce sound at frequencies over 100,000 waves per second- way beyond the range of human hearing. Here, we've slowed down a bat's chirp, so you can hear it! This chrip is the first step in the process of bat echolocation, the primary sound that the bat will use to detect information about its surroundings. The bat listens as the chirp leaves its body and bounces off its surroundings. When the sound returns to the bat, the cartilage of the outer ear funnels the sound waves into the ear canal. The waves then reach the eardrum, which vibrates in response. These vibrations are transferred further into the ear to the basilar membrane, which runs the length of the cochlea. If you uncoil the cochlea and the basilar membrane, they would look like this. Each area of the membrane moves in response to a particular frequency. Then, the cochlea converts these vibrations into nerve impulses for the brain to interpret. The bad echolocate so fast that it can track down a dinner of insects moving around in complete darkness. Special muscles in its throat make it possible for the bat to chirp 160 to 190 times per second! Because it receives so much information at once, it has to differentiate relevant information from signal clutter. To do this, the bat emits chirps of varying frequency patterns, each of which echoes off objects differently depending on the object's size, shape and distance from the bat. Then, by analyzing resulting echo intensities, it creates a mental map of its surrounding physical space. When looking for prey, the bat first sends out low-frequency chirps over a wide range. Llarger objects will reflect more intense echoes, but it's often the smaller objects, like insects that the bat is targeting. Once a bat receives low-intensity echoes from small potential prey, it will remit a high frequency chirp directed toward it. When both high-and low-frequency echoes return to the bat, it is able to ignore the now-irrelevant, low-frequency ways that reflect from the trees or rocks that surround its meal. To gauge how far away a given object is, the bat analyzes the time delay between when it hears its chirp and perceives the resulting echo. Directional information comes from comparing information the bat receives in each ear. For example, let's imagine that a bat's chirp echoes back from an insect to this side of the bat. Since this ear is closer to the insect, it will receive the sound before the other ear. By interpreting the difference between when it receives the echo in each ear, the bat can guide itself towards the insect. Bat are only one type of animal that use echolocation. killer whales, dolphins, porpoises and some birds echolocate as well. Scientists who developed sonar and radar got their ideas from the study of echolocation in bats and whales. The U.S. Navy and other research groups are especially interested in echolocation because it could lead to even more technology! Maybe now you'll think twice the next time someone says "blind as a bat!"

Parasites have a nasty reputation - but is
really fair to fear these little guys? Well, yes - and if you don't think so, here's
why these terrifying creatures are worth avoiding at all costs! As if you need another reason to hate mosquitoes
- when they bite humans they can leave larvae of the parasitic Filarial Worm. These worms live and grow in our bodies, sometimes
taking years to mature into full adults, leaving only inconspicuous rashes and sores. Years later, they work together to block the
vessels of your lymphatic system, creating a build-up of fluid and leading to diseases
like elephantiasis. This is one of the leading causes of disability
in the world. Another worm worth hating is the pinworm. Pinworm eggs are often eaten because of contaminated
or dirty hands. The eggs hatch and mature in your gut, at
which point the adult female exits the anus to lay a new batch of eggs on the surrounding
skin. Your butthole becomes a nest! This causes intense itching, often leading
to re-contaminated hands or fingernails, which can end up in your mouth again, restarting
the cycle. Feel like scratching your bum? Do yourself a favour and wash those hands
and fingernails! On the other side of the body, live the lovely
pubic lice - sometimes called 'crabs'. Though it's not uncommon to find these buggers
in your eyebrows, beard or even eyelashes. The itching is from an allergic reaction to
their saliva, and it'll take treatment with medication or shaving it all off to get rid
of them. Of course, abstinence or no sex works well
as a preventative measure, along with not sharing your undies with other people. Some parasites are meant for marine animals,
but end up in humans out of the goodness of our...gut? The Anisakis Nematode infects humans after
eating raw or undercooked fish - like sushi - which contains the larvae. The worms penetrate our gut wall and cause
abdominal pain, nausea and even vomiting. But, nobody really wins this one, as the nematode
can't mature in a human gut and eventually dies. The Tongue Biter is another marine parasite. This tongue eating louse finds a suitable
fish and chews off it's tongue, only to cling on to the stub in it's place. Here they stay feeding on the fishes blood,
all the while mating and dispersing their progeny into the ocean. And finally, the wonderful cordyceps which
are fungi known for creating zombie ants. The fungus takes over the ants body and mind,
making it leave the colony and begin climbing upward to a more ideal temperature and humidity. The ant then bites onto a stem or leaf and
gets locked into position until it dies. At which point, the fungus bursts through
the ants head and spreads outward. Could such a parasite ever affect humans? For everyone's sake, we hope not! Our friends at James Cook University helped
us put this horrifying list of parasites together, with special help from parasitologist Dr Kate
Hutson. JCU is one of the world's leading institutions
focusing on the tropics with an opportunity to study in a diverse physical environment
unparalleled by any university in the world. I actually studied there for a semester abroad! If you want to learn more, be sure to head

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 6: If you were to contract the Filarial Worm, what would be a likely consequence? Options: A. You would experience intense itching, B. You would develop a rash, C. You would experience a build-up of fluid in your lymphatic system, D. You would experience abdominal pain Correct Option: C**

However, this question does not directly ask about the vector of the filarial worm. A more relevant question would be one that directly asks about the vector or the organism that spreads the disease.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the vector of the filarial worm. But if I had to choose one that is closest in terms of content, I would choose:

**Question 1: What is the primary concern when it comes to Filarial Worms? Options: A. They cause skin rashes, B. They block the vessels of the lymphatic system, C. They cause abdominal pain, D. They lead to the growth of tumors Correct Option: B**

This question is not directly asking about the vector, but it is asking about the primary concern of the Filarial Worms, which is related to the disease caused by the worm. However, I must note that this question is not a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is **Question 1**, but with the caveat that it's not a good match.

It's worth noting that the generated MCQs seem to be focused on the effects of the parasites, rather than the vectors that spread them. To create a good match for the ground truth MCQ, a new question that directly asks about the vector of the filarial worm would be needed.

as a preventative measure, along with not sharing your undies with other people. Some parasites are meant for marine animals,
but end up in humans out of the goodness of our...gut? The Anisakis Nematode infects humans after
eating raw or undercooked fish - like sushi - which contains the larvae. The worms penetrate our gut wall and cause
abdominal pain, nausea and even vomiting. But, nobody really wins this one, as the nematode
can't mature in a human gut and eventually dies. The Tongue Biter is another marine parasite. This tongue eating louse finds a suitable
fish and chews off it's tongue, only to cling on to the stub in it's place. Here they stay feeding on the fishes blood,
all the while mating and dispersing their progeny into the ocean. And finally, the wonderful cordyceps which
are fungi known for creating zombie ants. The fungus takes over the ants body and mind,
making it leave the colony and begin climbing upward to a more ideal temperature and humidity. The ant then bites onto a stem or leaf and
gets locked into position until it dies. At which point, the fungus bursts through
the ants head and spreads outward. Could such a parasite ever affect humans? For everyone's sake, we hope not! Our friends at James Cook University helped
us put this horrifying list of parasites together, with special help from parasitologist Dr Kate
Hutson. JCU is one of the world's leading institutions

**Transcript**:
Parasites have a nasty reputation - but is
really fair to fear these little guys? Well, yes - and if you don't think so, here's
why these terrifying creatures are worth avoiding at all costs! As if you need another reason to hate mosquitoes
- when they bite humans they can leave larvae of the parasitic Filarial Worm. These worms live and grow in our bodies, sometimes
taking years to mature into full adults, leaving only inconspicuous rashes and sores. Years later, they work together to block the
vessels of your lymphatic system, creating a build-up of fluid and leading to diseases
like elephantiasis. This is one of the leading causes of disability
in the world. Another worm worth hating is the pinworm. Pinworm eggs are often eaten because of contaminated
or dirty hands. The eggs hatch and mature in your gut, at
which point the adult female exits the anus to lay a new batch of eggs on the surrounding
skin. Your butthole becomes a nest! This causes intense itching, often leading
to re-contaminated hands or fingernails, which can end up in your mouth again, restarting
the cycle. Feel like scratching your bum? Do yourself a favour and wash those hands
and fingernails! On the other side of the body, live the lovely
pubic lice - sometimes called 'crabs'. Though it's not uncommon to find these buggers
in your eyebrows, beard or even eyelashes. The itching is from an allergic reaction to
their saliva, and it'll take treatment with medication or shaving it all off to get rid
of them. Of course, abstinence or no sex works well
as a preventative measure, along with not sharing your undies with other people. Some parasites are meant for marine animals,

 (GASPS)   So, what is empathy and why is it 
 VERY different than sympathy?   Empathy fuels connection.   Sympathy drives disconnection.   It's very interesting.   Theresa Wiseman is a nursing scholar   who studied very diverse professions 
 where empathy is relevant   and came up with 
 four qualities of empathy.   Perspective taking - ability to take 
 the perspective of another person,   or recognise their perspective 
 as their truth.   Staying out of judgment -   not easy when you enjoy it 
 as much as most of us do.   (AUDIENCE CHUCKLES)   Recognising emotion in other people, 
 then communicating that.   Empathy is feeling WITH people.   I always think of empathy 
 as this kind of sacred space.   When someone's in a deep hole 
 and they shout from the bottom...   ..And we look and we say, "Hey!" 
 And climb down...   Sympathy is, "Ooh!" 
 (LAUGHTER)   "It's bad, uh-huh?" 
 (LAUGHTER)   "Uh... No. You want a sandwich?"   Empathy is a choice 
 and it's a vulnerable choice.   In order to connect with you,   I have to connect with something 
 in myself that knows that feeling.   Rarely, if ever, does an empathic 
 response begin with, "At least..."   (LAUGHTER)   Yeah. And we do it all the time 
 because, you know what?   Someone shared something with us 
 that's incredibly painful   and we're trying 
 to "silver lining" it.   I don't think that's a verb, 
 but I'm using it as one.   We're trying to put a silver lining 
 around it.   So, "I had a miscarriage."   "At least you know 
 you can get pregnant."   "I think my marriage 
 is falling apart."   "At least you have a marriage."   (LAUGHTER)   "John's getting kicked out 
 of school."   "At least Sarah is an A-student."   One of the things we do sometimes   in the face of very difficult 
 conversations   is we try to make things better.   If I share something with you that's 
 very difficult, I'd rather you say,   "I don't even know what to say. 
 I'm just so glad you told me."   Because the truth is, rarely can 
 a response make something better.   What makes something better 
 is connection.

**Transcript**:
In well-meaning attempts to boost our confidence ahead of challenging moments, people often try to draw our attention to our strengths: our intelligence, our competence, our experience. But this can – curiously – have some awkward consequences. There’s a type of under-confidence that arises specifically when we grow too attached to our own dignity and become anxious around any situation that might seem to threaten it. We hold back from challenges in which there is any risk of ending up looking ridiculous which comprises, of course, almost all the most interesting situations. In a foreign city, we might grow reluctant to ask anyone to guide us to the nice bars, because they might think us an ignorant, pitiable, lost tourist. We might long to kiss someone but never let on out of a fear that they could dismiss us as a predatory loser. Or at work, we don’t apply for a promotion, in case the senior management deems us delusionally arrogant. In a concerted bid never to look foolish, we don’t venture very far from our cocoon, and thereby – from time to time at least – miss out on the best opportunities of our lives. At the heart of our under-confidence is a skewed picture of how dignified it is normal for a person to be. We imagine that it might be possible, after a certain age, to place ourselves beyond mockery. We trust that it's an option to lead a good life without regularly making a complete idiot of ourselves. One of the most charming books ever written in early modern Europe is called 'In Praise of Folly' by the Dutch scholar and philosopher, Erasmus. In its pages, Erasmus advances a hugely liberating argument. In a warm tone, he reminds us that everyone, however important and learned they might be, is a fool. No one is spared, not even the author. However well-schooled he himself was, Erasmus remained – he insists – as much of a nitwit as anyone else: his judgement is faulty, his passions get the better of him, he is prey to superstition and irrational fear, he is shy whenever he has to meet new people, he drops things at elegant dinners. This is deeply cheering, for it means that our own repeated idiocies don't have to exclude us from the best company. Looking like a prick, making blunders and doing bizarre things in the night doesn’t render us unfit for society; it just makes us a bit more like the greatest scholar of the northern European Renaissance. There’s a similarly uplifting message to be pulled from the work of Pieter Brueghel. His central work, 'The Dutch Proverbs,' presents a comically disenchanted view of human nature. Everyone, he suggests, is pretty much deranged: here’s a man throwing his money into the river; there’s a soldier squatting on the fire and burning his trousers; someone is intently bashing his head against a brick wall; someone else is biting a pillar. Importantly, the painting is not an attack on just a few unusually awful people-- it’s a picture of parts of all of us. Brueghel’s and Erasmus’s work proposes that the way to greater confidence isn’t to reassure ourselves of our own dignity-- it’s to grow at peace with the inevitable nature of our ridiculousness. We are idiots now, we have been idiots in the past, and we will be idiots again in the future... and that's OK. There aren’t any other available options for human beings to be. Once we learn to see ourselves as already, and by nature, foolish, it really doesn’t matter so much if we do one more thing that might make us look a bit stupid. The person we try to kiss could indeed think us ridiculous. The individual we asked directions from in a foreign city might regard us with contempt. But if these people did so, it wouldn’t be news to us-- they would only be confirming what we had already gracefully accepted in our hearts long ago: that we, like them – and every other person on the earth – are a nitwit. The risk of trying and failing would have its sting substantially removed. A fear of humiliation would no longer stalk us in the shadows of our minds. We would grow free to give things a go by accepting that failure was the acceptable norm. And every so often, amidst the endless rebuffs we’d have factored in from the outset, it would work: we’d get a kiss, we’d make a friend, we’d get a raise. The road to greater confidence begins with a ritual of telling oneself solemnly every morning before heading out for the day, that one is a muttonhead, a cretin, a dumbbell and an imbecile. One or two more acts of folly should, thereafter, not matter very much at all.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Back in Ancient Rome, the philosopher Cicero
described gratitude as the mother of all virtues. This concept of being thankful has been stressed
in religion and philosophy for a long time. Back in 1820 Scottish philosopher Thomas Brown
defined gratitude as “that delightful emotion of love to him who has conferred a kindness
on us.” But scientifically, gratitude doesn’t qualify
as a basic emotion like joy, sadness or anger. There’s no universal facial expression for
it. As an emotion, gratitude is a little hard to define. Today the Oxford Dictionary defines gratitude
as “the quality or condition of being thankful; the appreciation of an inclination to return
kindness.” And we’ve only really started to study gratitude scientifically in the past
30 years. In a 2015 study, participants were asked to
imagine how they would feel if a complete stranger saved their life. I mean, how would
you feel? The participants had to rate how grateful they were to strangers who provided
them with gifts of food and clothing – all while they had their brain scanned in an fMRI
machine. Researchers found their ratings of gratitude
positively correlated with activity in brain areas associated with fairness and value judgements.
It makes sense because gratitude is often thought of as a moral emotion. There are even benefits in just noting how
grateful you are. Another study asked people to write down three things that went well
that day and why for one week. At the end of the week people were slightly happier than
at the beginning, and over time, their happiness scores kept improving. After one month they
were 5% happier and after six months they were 9% happier. Just from one week of writing
a journal. A similar study with participants with heart
disease found that keeping a gratitude journal increased their heart health and quality of
sleep, perhaps because it reduces stress. “Counting your blessings” quite literally
makes people happier and healthier. And some people are even hardwired to be more
thankful. In a recent study of 77 couples, those with a particular genetic variation
that affects the secretion of oxytocin expressed more gratitude towards their partners. Oxytocin
is thought to play a big role in promoting close social bonds, so gratitude is part of
the glue that keeps these relationships together. So if you think it’s the thought that counts,
think again. Science shows there are some pretty amazing benefits to our mind, body
and relationships when we say those two small words – thank you.

It makes sense because gratitude is often thought of as a moral emotion. There are even benefits in just noting how
grateful you are. Another study asked people to write down three things that went well
that day and why for one week. At the end of the week people were slightly happier than
at the beginning, and over time, their happiness scores kept improving. After one month they
were 5% happier and after six months they were 9% happier. Just from one week of writing
a journal. A similar study with participants with heart
disease found that keeping a gratitude journal increased their heart health and quality of
sleep, perhaps because it reduces stress. “Counting your blessings” quite literally
makes people happier and healthier. And some people are even hardwired to be more
thankful. In a recent study of 77 couples, those with a particular genetic variation
that affects the secretion of oxytocin expressed more gratitude towards their partners. Oxytocin
is thought to play a big role in promoting close social bonds, so gratitude is part of
the glue that keeps these relationships together. So if you think it’s the thought that counts,
think again. Science shows there are some pretty amazing benefits to our mind, body
and relationships when we say those two small words – thank you.

**Transcript**:
Back in Ancient Rome, the philosopher Cicero
described gratitude as the mother of all virtues. This concept of being thankful has been stressed
in religion and philosophy for a long time. Back in 1820 Scottish philosopher Thomas Brown
defined gratitude as “that delightful emotion of love to him who has conferred a kindness
on us.” But scientifically, gratitude doesn’t qualify
as a basic emotion like joy, sadness or anger. There’s no universal facial expression for
it. As an emotion, gratitude is a little hard to define. Today the Oxford Dictionary defines gratitude
as “the quality or condition of being thankful; the appreciation of an inclination to return
kindness.” And we’ve only really started to study gratitude scientifically in the past
30 years. In a 2015 study, participants were asked to
imagine how they would feel if a complete stranger saved their life. I mean, how would
you feel? The participants had to rate how grateful they were to strangers who provided
them with gifts of food and clothing – all while they had their brain scanned in an fMRI
machine. Researchers found their ratings of gratitude
positively correlated with activity in brain areas associated with fairness and value judgements.
It makes sense because gratitude is often thought of as a moral emotion. There are even benefits in just noting how
grateful you are. Another study asked people to write down three things that went well

**Transcript**:
this video is sponsored by Skillshare curries burgers sushi pizzas tortillas as a species food is central not only to our survival but also to our cultures we love food but as much as we love food we also love to throw it away the UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that globally almost one third of food produced for consumption never gets eaten and in the u.s. that number is even higher forty percent of the u.s. is available food supply gets wasted every year as a report from the NRDC notes that's like buying five bags of groceries at the store and then just leaving two of them in the parking lot every time you shop so today we're going to look at food waste with three questions why is excessive food waste happening what are its environmental consequences and how can we fix it if all the food currently getting thrown in the landfill every year was instead diverted into meals for those in need we'd be able to feed as many as 1.8 billion people on top of that food waste has been estimated to be responsible for roughly 8 percent of global emissions if it was a country it would rank third under China in the United States for yearly greenhouse gas emissions it's large emissions footprint not only comes from all the energy needed to ship process and produce the food that ends up in the trash but also from the potent methane fumes that food emits as it decomposes in landfills so food waste is one of the many issues at the crossroads of climate action and social justice but food doesn't just sprout out of the ground and then magically end up in the trash there's a long chain of business and consumer interactions that at any point might turn perfectly edible food into waste simply put food transforms into trash in two general areas as it travels from farm to wait before the point-of-sale and after the point-of-sale if we look at this chart the majority of the food waste generated in the United States comes after the point-of-sale but let's look at the food loss before that on farms and in grocery stores in order to understand how this all starts before I transitioned to making YouTube videos full time I worked in a number of food-related positions where I saw firsthand how the drive for perfect abundant produce perpetuated an unnecessary trend of food waste as a farmhand at a number of different farms when I saw insect bites on arugula leaves or blemishes on peppers and tomatoes I knew they were destined to rot all that time effort and fuel wasted because the farm manager knew that better-looking produce will always sell over and perfect ones these cosmetically challenged products as they've come to be known can often end up left on the ground by harvesters or even make their way to landfills and into piles of food that decomposes and generate harmful emissions but the aesthetics of produce are just one part of the picture market prices for food can also affect weather crops make it through the harvest according to one recent study that analyzed on-farm food loss in California thirty three point seven percent of produce remains unharvested every year that's the equivalent of growing 300 acres of cantaloupe and leaving 100 acres of it to decay in the fields which according to an article from civil eats is exactly what happened to 6th generation farmer Canon Michel Michel couldn't justify paying workers to pick the cantaloupe because the cost of labour packing and shipping would have been more than the price he could get for the fruit and even if the food does make it off farms it still has to navigate the gauntlet of grocery store aisles one of the best ways to sell food is through the illusion of abundance people shop visually and to most that last Apple on the Shelf was left there because there was something wrong with it not because it just happened to be the last one in order to appear abundant grocery stores often over buy food to trick people into purchasing items as a result produce inevitably goes to waste as it sits out all day like glorified window dressing farmer Delaney's iock explains this dilemma and the documentary just eat it and there is an hour left in the market that one bunch of chard would sit there and no one would buy but if I had 30 bunches of chard all like bursting out I probably sell like 25 so what is that saving people are totally impulse shopping so at the grocery store and farmers markets vendors face an uphill battle against the old saying pile it high and watch it fly they need to produce an excess of food to sell their goods but that excess can at times lead to more waste after the point of sale the plague of food waste continues indeed household restaurant and food service waste accounts for 69 percent of the United States's annual food waste as a consumer and lover of food I've tried hard to minimize my waste but it can be easy to cook or by excess that ends up in the compost or trash for a family of four household food waste costs one thousand eight hundred dollars annually and with the average plate size expanding by 36 percent since 1960 and with refrigerators growing 30 percent in volume since 1972 it's tempting to buy more food just to fill up the space over buying and the inevitable cleaning out the refrigerator activity that comes with it can also be attributed to buy one get one promotions or purchasing in our appliances supermarkets and even our plates are all nudging us to buy or in addition to over buying in the United States there's also a severe lack of clarity when it comes to dealing with expiration dates and spoiled goods there are no federal laws regulating cell buy or expiration dates as a result labels can mean basically anything depending on where you buy your food in Missoula Montana for example milk sell by date is set at 12 days after pasteurization even though the standard is 21 to 24 days that's because in most cases these dates are set by the milk producer and not a regulatory service as one grocery vendor in Missoula laments the 12 day sell by date tells a consumer nothing it's just an arbitrary number somebody came up with with no scientific backing whatsoever this lack of clear information regarding when a product actually goes bad means that households throw out perfectly edible food well before it expires in short there are marketing labeling cultural and psychological forces all coming to play in order to make food waste a large problem in the United States ultimately there are many vectors by which food becomes waste whether in your own home or even before it makes it onto a grocery store shelf but there is hope there are very tangible solutions to these problems at all levels of the supply chain at the individual level solutions look like creating a plan to use all the food you buy or using sites like eat by date to truly understand whether your food has expired and then composting it instead of throwing it in the trash you can even get involved with groups like Food Not Bombs which has local chapters all over the world that recover food from local restaurants and stores and give it to those in need on the supply side solutions look like reducing food demand by eliminating buy-one-get-one promotions donating food that's not fit for sale or even using boxes and props to maintain the illusion of abundance without needed excess produce and on a policy level this means actions like standardizing expiration dates to accurately reflect the science behind foodborne illnesses food waste is a preventable problem an addressing food waste means tackling both climate change and hunger in the process we don't necessarily need fancy farming technologies to create more food for people who go hungry we just need to work together on every level to more equitably distribute the resources we already have and in doing so we not only mitigate climate change but also create stronger communities when I started making YouTube videos my

to buy more food just to fill up the space over buying and the inevitable cleaning out the refrigerator activity that comes with it can also be attributed to buy one get one promotions or purchasing in our appliances supermarkets and even our plates are all nudging us to buy or in addition to over buying in the United States there's also a severe lack of clarity when it comes to dealing with expiration dates and spoiled goods there are no federal laws regulating cell buy or expiration dates as a result labels can mean basically anything depending on where you buy your food in Missoula Montana for example milk sell by date is set at 12 days after pasteurization even though the standard is 21 to 24 days that's because in most cases these dates are set by the milk producer and not a regulatory service as one grocery vendor in Missoula laments the 12 day sell by date tells a consumer nothing it's just an arbitrary number somebody came up with with no scientific backing whatsoever this lack of clear information regarding when a product actually goes bad means that households throw out perfectly edible food well before it expires in short there are marketing labeling cultural and psychological forces all coming to play in order to make food waste a large problem in the United States ultimately there are many vectors by which food becomes waste whether in your own home or even before it makes it onto a grocery store shelf but there is hope there are very tangible solutions to these problems at all levels of the supply chain at the individual level solutions look like creating a plan to use all the food you buy or using sites like eat by date to truly understand whether your food has expired and then composting it instead of throwing it in the trash you can even get involved with groups like Food Not Bombs which has local chapters all over the world that recover food from local restaurants and stores and give it to those in need on the supply side solutions look like reducing food demand by eliminating buy-one-get-one promotions donating food that's not fit for sale or even using boxes and props to maintain the illusion of abundance without needed excess produce and on a policy level this means actions like standardizing expiration dates to accurately reflect the science behind foodborne illnesses food waste is a preventable problem an addressing food waste means tackling both climate change and hunger in the process we don't necessarily need fancy farming technologies to create more food for people who go hungry we just need to work together on

**Transcript**:
this video is sponsored by Skillshare curries burgers sushi pizzas tortillas as a species food is central not only to our survival but also to our cultures we love food but as much as we love food we also love to throw it away the UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that globally almost one third of food produced for consumption never gets eaten and in the u.s. that number is even higher forty percent of the u.s. is available food supply gets wasted every year as a report from the NRDC notes that's like buying five bags of groceries at the store and then just leaving two of them in the parking lot every time you shop so today we're going to look at food waste with three questions why is excessive food waste happening what are its environmental consequences and how can we fix it if all the food currently getting thrown in the landfill every year was instead diverted into meals for those in need we'd be able to feed as many as 1.8 billion people on top of that food waste has been estimated to be responsible for roughly 8 percent of global emissions if it was a country it would rank third under China in the United States for yearly greenhouse gas emissions it's large emissions footprint not only comes from all the energy needed to ship process and produce the food that ends up in the trash but also from the potent methane fumes that food emits as it decomposes in landfills so food waste is one of the many issues at the crossroads of climate action and social justice but food doesn't just sprout out of the ground and then magically end up in the trash there's a long chain of business and consumer interactions that at any point might turn perfectly edible food into waste simply put food transforms into trash in two general areas as it travels from farm to wait before the point-of-sale and after the point-of-sale if we look at this chart the majority of the food waste generated in the United States comes after the point-of-sale but let's look at the food loss before that on farms and in grocery stores in order to understand how this all starts before I transitioned to making YouTube videos full time I worked in a number of food-related positions where I saw firsthand how the drive for perfect abundant produce perpetuated an unnecessary trend of food waste as a farmhand at a number of different farms when I saw insect bites on arugula leaves or blemishes on peppers and tomatoes I knew they were destined to rot all that time effort and fuel wasted because the farm manager knew that better-looking produce will always sell over and perfect ones these cosmetically challenged products as they've come to be known can often end up left on the ground by harvesters or even make their way to landfills and into piles of food that decomposes and generate harmful emissions but the aesthetics of produce are just one part of the picture market prices for food can also affect weather crops make it through the harvest according to one recent study that analyzed on-farm food loss in California thirty three point seven percent of produce remains unharvested every year that's the equivalent of growing 300 acres of cantaloupe and leaving 100 acres of it to decay in the fields which according to an article from civil eats is exactly what happened to 6th generation farmer Canon Michel Michel couldn't justify paying workers to pick the cantaloupe because the cost of labour packing and shipping would have been more than the price he could get for the fruit and even if the food does make it off farms it still has to navigate the gauntlet of grocery store aisles one of the best ways to sell food is through the illusion of abundance people shop visually and to most that last Apple on the Shelf was left there because there was something wrong with it not because it just happened to be the last one in order to appear abundant grocery stores often over buy food to trick people into purchasing items as a result produce inevitably goes to waste as it sits out all day like glorified window dressing farmer Delaney's iock explains this dilemma and the documentary just eat it and there is an hour left in the market that one bunch of chard would sit there and no one would buy but if I had 30 bunches of chard all like bursting out I probably sell like 25 so what is that saving people are totally impulse shopping so at the grocery store and farmers markets vendors face an uphill battle against the old saying pile it high and watch it fly they need to produce an excess of food to sell their goods but that excess can at times lead to more waste after the point of sale the plague of food waste continues indeed household restaurant and food service waste accounts for 69 percent of the United States's

food-related positions where I saw firsthand how the drive for perfect abundant produce perpetuated an unnecessary trend of food waste as a farmhand at a number of different farms when I saw insect bites on arugula leaves or blemishes on peppers and tomatoes I knew they were destined to rot all that time effort and fuel wasted because the farm manager knew that better-looking produce will always sell over and perfect ones these cosmetically challenged products as they've come to be known can often end up left on the ground by harvesters or even make their way to landfills and into piles of food that decomposes and generate harmful emissions but the aesthetics of produce are just one part of the picture market prices for food can also affect weather crops make it through the harvest according to one recent study that analyzed on-farm food loss in California thirty three point seven percent of produce remains unharvested every year that's the equivalent of growing 300 acres of cantaloupe and leaving 100 acres of it to decay in the fields which according to an article from civil eats is exactly what happened to 6th generation farmer Canon Michel Michel couldn't justify paying workers to pick the cantaloupe because the cost of labour packing and shipping would have been more than the price he could get for the fruit and even if the food does make it off farms it still has to navigate the gauntlet of grocery store aisles one of the best ways to sell food is through the illusion of abundance people shop visually and to most that last Apple on the Shelf was left there because there was something wrong with it not because it just happened to be the last one in order to appear abundant grocery stores often over buy food to trick people into purchasing items as a result produce inevitably goes to waste as it sits out all day like glorified window dressing farmer Delaney's iock explains this dilemma and the documentary just eat it and there is an hour left in the market that one bunch of chard would sit there and no one would buy but if I had 30 bunches of chard all like bursting out I probably sell like 25 so what is that saving people are totally impulse shopping so at the grocery store and farmers markets vendors face an uphill battle against the old saying pile it high and watch it fly they need to produce an excess of food to sell their goods but that excess can at times lead to more waste after the point of sale the plague of food waste continues indeed household restaurant and food service waste accounts for 69 percent of the United States's annual food waste as a consumer and lover of food I've tried hard to minimize my waste but it can be easy to cook or by excess that ends up in the compost or trash for a family of four household food waste costs one thousand eight hundred dollars annually and with the average plate size expanding by 36 percent since 1960 and with refrigerators growing 30 percent in volume since 1972 it's tempting to buy more food just to fill up the space over buying and the inevitable cleaning out the refrigerator activity that comes with it can also be attributed to buy one get one promotions or purchasing in our appliances supermarkets and even our plates are all nudging us to buy or in addition to over buying in the United States there's also a severe lack of clarity when it comes to dealing with expiration dates and spoiled goods there are no federal laws regulating cell buy or expiration dates as a result labels can mean basically anything depending on where you buy your food in Missoula Montana for example milk sell by date is set at 12 days after pasteurization even though the standard is 21 to 24 days that's because in most cases these dates are set by the milk producer and not a regulatory service as one grocery vendor in Missoula laments the 12 day sell by date tells a consumer nothing it's just an arbitrary number somebody came up with with no scientific backing whatsoever this lack of clear information regarding when a product actually goes bad means that households throw out perfectly edible food well before it expires in short there are marketing labeling cultural and psychological forces all coming to play in order to make food waste a large problem in the United States ultimately there are many vectors by which food becomes waste whether in your own home or even before it makes it onto a grocery store shelf but there is hope there are very tangible solutions to these problems at all levels of the supply chain at the individual level solutions look like creating a plan to use all the food you buy or using sites like eat by date to truly understand whether your food has expired and then composting it instead of throwing it in the trash you can even get involved with groups like Food Not Bombs which has local chapters all over the world that recover food from local restaurants and stores and give it to those in need on the supply side solutions look like reducing food demand by eliminating buy-one-get-one promotions donating food that's not fit for sale or even using boxes and props to maintain the illusion of abundance without needed excess produce and on a policy level this means actions like standardizing expiration dates to accurately reflect the science behind foodborne illnesses food waste is a preventable problem an addressing food waste means tackling both climate change and hunger in the process we don't necessarily need fancy farming technologies to create more food for people who go hungry we just need to work together on every level to more equitably distribute the resources we already have and in doing so we not only mitigate climate change but also create stronger communities when I started making YouTube videos my

**Transcript**:
People have been keeping track of time, pretty much since people were people. At first we just needed to have an idea of what season it was, and maybe what season was coming up next, and around when. But after the invention of agriculture, it started being important to keep track of each day of the year. Once you start trying to count the days of the year though, it doesn't take long to notice a problem: You just can't make a consistent calendar with the same number of days every year, because there aren't a whole number of days in the year. That is why today's date exists! We have to add an extra day to the calendar every now and then and we do it on February 29th. The main issue is that the Earth's orbit and its rotation don't have anything to do with each other. When our planet spins once around on its axis we call that a day and when it completes a full orbit of the sun, we call that a solar year. Now it'd be nice if Earth always got back to the same place in its orbit after a set number of complete rotations, which would be an exact number of days... but it doesn't. Earth orbits the sun once every 365.2425 rotations, so if your calendar has a whole number of days, like 365 or 366 than you're counting either too few days or too many. And if you're counting wrong, then things like the solstices, the longest and shortest days of the year, which always happen at the same point in the Earth's orbit, will move around the calendar. That makes it a little tricky to plan for events that you want to happen on the same day every year, say a solstice celebration. And if that wasn't complicated enough, a lot of ancient cultures, like the Babylonians, Chinese, and Romans, used calendars based on the moon. But, the behavior of the moon, again, has nothing to do with our rotation or our orbit. The moon goes through a little more than 12 cycles, each a little more than 29 days, in the time that it takes for the Earth to go around the sun. And that means they had a similar problem: 12 lunar months a year is too few, but 13 lunar months in a year is too many. So most people using a lunar calendar would have 12 months most years but then, they'd add an extra month every couple of years to keep things, like harvest, around roughly the same solar date. Then there were the Romans, always trying to keep things interesting. Instead of having a system in place, for how often there should be an extra month, they left it up to their highest religious authority: the Pontifex Maximus. Which kinda worked for a while, at least until Julius Caesar came along. The Romans thought adding those extra months was super bad luck, so they didn't want to do it while they were at war, and Julius was at war all the time. So, the calendar got way off from where it should have been. Eventually, Caesar decided that the Romans should just use a brand new calendar, that relied on a set system of, when and where to add extra days. And that's how we got the Julian Calendar, which Western Europe and Christian churches used for a really long time. Most Julian years had 365 days, but like we said earlier, the year is about a quarter of a day longer than that, so every 4th year got an extra 366th day. Seems like a good fix, but things are not that simple. The four year system ends up slightly over-estimating the length of the year by about 10 minutes Something the designers of the Julian calendar knew about but they decided it wasn't worth complicating the calendar over. It's 10 minutes a year, what could go wrong? Well, 10 minutes a year, over a lot of years, can really add up. By the late 1500s, around 1600 years after Caesar the calendar was about 13 days off from where it should have been. That's when Pope Gregory XIII, the Pontifex Maximus of the Catholic Church at the time, decided that the Julian calendar needed an overhaul. So he put together the Gregorian calendar, the one that we still use today, which is really just the Julian Calendar with a couple of changes. The Gregorian calendar's new rules were: Every 4 years add an extra day, except, don't add it when the year is divisible by 100 except, actually, do add it if the year is divisible by 400. So 1700, 1800, and 1900, weren't leap years because they were all divisible by 100, but not by 400. The year 2000 was a leap year since 2000 is divisible by 400. And, of course, 2016 is a leap year as well. If we were still using the Julian calendar, 2016 would still be a leap year But the calendar would now be behind by 16 days So this video would have been uploaded on February 13th, 2016 not February 29th. so it wouldn't have made any sense. But the universe is complicated and does not care about our calendars. So the Gregorian calendar is still a little bit too long we will add a day about every 7,700 years, but don't hold your breath for a new calendar. The Gregorian calendar was only introduced when the Julian one was 13 days off from the true date. And that won't happen to the Gregorian calendar for another 100,000 years or so.

**Transcript**:
Whenever something looks interesting,  beautiful there's a natural impulse to want to capture and preserve it, which means in this day and age that we will likely to reach for our phones and take picture. Though this might seem like an ideal solution, there is a big problem associated with it. We're likely to be so busy taking the pictures we forget to look at the world whose beauty and interest prompted us to take a photograph in the first place. These problems seem to be very much of today a consequence of the tiny phones in our pockets. But, they would notice right in at beginning of the history of photography when the average camera was the size of a grandfather clock. The first person to notice them was the english art critic John Ruskin He was very impressed by cameras at first, but gradually he grew very suspicious of them believing they blinded us of our surroundings To try to correct this blindness Ruskin recommended that all of us take up drawing not with the view to becoming great artists but simply because through the act of trying to recreate on paper what we see in the world we studied it in a way we never do when we simply take a photograph Summing up what he attempted to do in four years of teaching and writing manuals on drawing Ruskin wrote: "Let two persons go out for a walk;" "the one a good sketcher, the other having no taste of the kind." "Let them go down a green lane." "There will be a great difference in the scene as perceived by the two individuals." "The one will see a lane and trees; he will perceive the trees to be green," "though he will think nothing about it;" "he will see that the sun shines, and that it has a cheerful effect," "and that's all." "But what will the sketcher see?" "His eye is accustomed to search into the cause of beauty," "and penetrate the minutest parts of loveliness." "He looks up, and observes how the showery and subdivided sunshine" "comes sprinkled down among the gleaming leaves overhead," "till the air is filled with an emerald light," "he would see here and there a bough is seen emerging from the veil of leaves," "he would see the jewel brightness of the emerald moss," "and the variegated and fantastic lichens, " "white and blue, purple and red, " "all mellowed and mingled into a single garment of beauty." "Then come the cavernous trunks, and the twisted roots" "that grasp with their snake-like coils at the steep bank, " "whose turfy slope is inlaid with flowers of a thousand dyes." "Is not this worth seeing?" "Yet if you are not a sketcher you will pass along the green lane," "and when you come home again, have nothing to say or to think about it," "but that you went down such and such a lane."

**Transcript**:
Tired? We all know the feeling; irritable, groggy and exceptionally lazy. Chances are you didn't sleep enough last night, or the past few nights. But what exactly is "enough sleep?" And more importantly, can you ever "catch up" on it? While the very function of sleep is still debated by scientists, we do know that it's necessary to function efficiently and productively. After all, we spend 24 years of our lifetime sleeping, it had better be important. Researchers have tested how much is required each night by assigning groups of people to four, five, and eight hours of sleep over extended periods of time. After 14 days, those with eight hours of sleep exhibited few attention lapses of cognitive issues; however, those with six or four hours of sleep showed a steady decline. In fact, after only two weeks, the six hour group showed a similar reaction time to a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%, which is considered legally drunk. The four hour sleepers suffered even more, occasionally falling asleep during their cognitive tests. In both groups, brain function decreased day by day, almost linearly with no sign of leveling off. Scientists have dubbed this cumulative effect as sleep debt. So can we recover from it? After a night or two of little sleep, studies show that the body and brain can fully recover with a few nights of good sleep. However, with long term sleep deprivation on the scale of weeks to months, the recovery of cognitive function is much slower, requiring many more nights of quality sleep. On the timescale of months to years, it is unknown whether brain function can be fully repaired, or if it causes permanent damage. Paradoxically, with chronic sleep deprivation, your sleepiness or how tired you feel does eventually level off, meaning that you become less and less aware of your objective impairment over time. So how long should you sleep? Most studies tend to show that seven to eight hours of sleep is the average ideal for humans. Apart from the cognitive issues, individuals who consistently sleep less than seven hours a night have an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, not to mention a 12% higher risk of death. On the flip side, studies have shown that while sleeping more than eight hours does not impair brain function, it also carries an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, and a 30% increased risk of mortality! So too much sleep may also be a bad thing. But variation most certainly exists, and our genetics play a large role. In fact, individuals genuinely unaffected by only six hours of sleep were found to have a mutation of a specific gene. When scientists genetically engineered mice to express this gene, they were able to stay awake for an extra 1.2 hours than normal mice. It turns out these short sleepers have more biologically intense sleep sessions than the average person. Ultimately, while it's important to know the ideal average of seven to eight hours exists, let your body and brain help you figure out its own needs. After all, no one shoe size fits all.

**Transcript**:
Tired? We all know the feeling; irritable, groggy and exceptionally lazy. Chances are you didn't sleep enough last night, or the past few nights. But what exactly is "enough sleep?" And more importantly, can you ever "catch up" on it? While the very function of sleep is still debated by scientists, we do know that it's necessary to function efficiently and productively. After all, we spend 24 years of our lifetime sleeping, it had better be important. Researchers have tested how much is required each night by assigning groups of people to four, five, and eight hours of sleep over extended periods of time. After 14 days, those with eight hours of sleep exhibited few attention lapses of cognitive issues; however, those with six or four hours of sleep showed a steady decline. In fact, after only two weeks, the six hour group showed a similar reaction time to a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%, which is considered legally drunk. The four hour sleepers suffered even more, occasionally falling asleep during their cognitive tests. In both groups, brain function decreased day by day, almost linearly with no sign of leveling off. Scientists have dubbed this cumulative effect as sleep debt. So can we recover from it? After a night or two of little sleep, studies show that the body and brain can fully recover with a few nights of good sleep. However, with long term sleep deprivation on the scale of weeks to months, the recovery of cognitive function is much slower, requiring many more nights of quality sleep.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
From twigs to electrical toothbrushes humans have been cleaning our teeth since the ancient Egyptians in 5000 BCE. But, what if you just straight-up stopped brushing your teeth at all for the rest of your life? Within minutes of stopping, the food debris and moist environment from your saliva creates an ideal environment for bacteria to survive. Streptococci is one of the most common bacteria found in our mouth and it's normally not harmful, until it metabolizes sugar or protein from food debris. But after a full day, these bacteria would have already produced significant amounts of plaque from sugars. Plaque is the slimy layer of biofilm that you can feel on your teeth when you "accidentally" forget to brush sometimes. And this plaque actually helps the bacteria adhere to your teeth, which allows them to produce even more plaque creating a cycle of bacteria and plaque build up. After a week, all this build-up will cause some pretty serious bad breath. Not to mention that the plaque begins to harden and form tartar that lead to your teeth appearing yellow. At this point, you're also causing significant damage to tooth enamel as the bacteria break down sugar to produce lactic acid. Enamel is the hard mineralized outer layer of the tooth. And once it breaks down, you can't make any more. After a month, your decaying teeth will form cavities. These holes in your teeth get deeper and deeper if left untreated, leading to gingivitis, an early form of gum disease. This is because the immune system attacks your gums and teeth in response to the bacteria build up. Your cavities will fill up with pus, which is a protein-rich fluid filled with dead white blood cells and your gums will be extremely sensitive at this point, turning red when you touch it and bleeding with any significant pressure. After an entire year of neglect, you now have Periodontitis. The inner layer of the gum and bone are broken down by enzymes and pull away from the teeth to form pockets, which only further allow collected food debris and bacteria to gather. This causes the immune system to go into overdrive and destroys your gums and ligaments, resulting in advanced Periodontitis where your teeth become loose and begin to fall out. Any longer, and the issues can spread beyond your mouth and into your blood, causing inflammation throughout your organs and increasing the likelihood of erectile disfunction, head and neck cancer, chronic heart disease, and even dementia development. Combine your lack of brushing with a poor diet high in processed foods, and especially sugar, which is much more common now than early Homo sapiens would have experienced, and you have a much more accelerated breeding ground for bacteria, putting your whole body's health at risk.

**Transcript**:
You ever notice this instruction that’s
in nearly every baking recipe? Preheating your oven to 350 degrees is sort
of a basic requirement for baking in America. Our ovens even do it automatically as we turn
them on, but have you ever stopped and asked yourself ... What’s so special about this number? I love to bake, but I’m certainly not a
pastry chef, so let’s meet someone with a bit more experience. This is Michael Laiskonis, the creative director
at the Institute of Culinary Education. He's a pastry chef. So temperature is really important in baking
not only to develop color and flavor, but also to control the moisture in our products. As the temperature rises and moisture is lost
at the surface, we get browning and also the creation of flavor compounds that didn't exist
in that product previously. This happens because of a chemical process
known as the maillard reaction, which occurs when proteins and sugars are
transformed by heat and moisture. When sugar molecules are exposed to the heat
in your oven they start to reduce – or break down – and interact with the proteins. That’s when you can see 
your pastry turning golden brown. But it’s not just about that physical transformation. You can taste the effects of the maillard
reaction too – that's what gives us the flavors
of the golden crust on a piece of bread or a nice sear on a steak or that mellow richness
of, say, caramelized onions. The trick behind that reaction is to find the perfect temperature that sets
it into action without over or under-doing it. These recipes might make you think that Maillard reaction occurs at 350 degrees, but actually ... So these Maillard reactions tend to occur at
a fairly low temperature – around 230 to 240 degrees Fahrenheit. You want to manipulate the rate at which
this reaction occurs both at the surface and internally to get the results you want. If we bake too cool, the entire cookie, for example, will dry out before
we get that surface drying that will lead to browning. If we bake things in too hot an oven, the opposite
occurs and we get burning. To get it just right we preheat the oven to 350 degrees
so the Maillard reaction has time to occur throughout the entire cookie. For most home cooks and to also account for
the fact that everyone's oven is slightly different, I think 350 is a great benchmark to work from. It’s a safe standard for most
people, but the number can also be altered to yield slightly different
results. Some pastry chefs might bake at 325 if they want a lighter colored cookie,
and some push it to 375 for a crispier outside. A lot of things that contemporary bakers tend
to forget is not too long ago, in history, we didn't have as much control over our ovens
or being a pastry chef meant being able to build a fire and maintain an oven temperature. Before the 1900’s, when ovens didn’t have
temperature regulators, recipe writers instructed bakers to “cook in a moderate” “hot”
or “slow” oven depending on the food. After the second world war, the temperature gauge was developed and it became widely popular across households. Modern ovens typically ranged from 200 to
550 degrees, so over time, recipe writers converted these temperature guidelines to actual numbers -- they settled on the 350 mark for “moderate”
which was the sweet spot for baking. Using these more specific numbers is really
a result of better oven design and better oven control. And the more you understand about what goes on inside your oven, the better results you'll get. And who doesn't want a better cookie?

**Transcript**:
Good morning, John! Today is the day after Thanksgiving here in America. Traditionally, the day when we buy all the things! Actually, more traditionally at my house, it's the day when we don't leave the house; because Black Friday.. terrifies me. For people who aren't American, the very ominous-sounding Black Friday is an accident of history. So, back in 1621, it was hard livin' here in America; and the first English settlers had a really bountiful crop. Apparently. This is somewhat mythological... And, it was on a Thursday; and they were thankful! That inspired a holiday; which is a nice kind of idea for a holiday, where you just talk about the things that you're thankful for. And eat a bunch of food! You also eat a bunch of food. Until the 1860's, different states celebrated this holiday on different days. Until Abraham Lincoln said: "This.. is the day! We're gonna have a national day."; and, the South was like: "We're not even part of you anymore. What are you talking about?!" But then, when we got back together again, that was good; and it became the national holiday. The fourth Thursday in November. Now, because it's a national holiday on the Thursday, you also sort of get that Friday as a de facto day off. 'Cause you don't want to go back to work for one day and then have the weekend; that's just dumb! In the '60's [1960's], because so many people were going on vacation on this day, or, to a lesser extent, going shopping; this became such a terrible traffic mess that police and taxi drivers started calling it "Black Friday". As stores, and also just general consumerist cultures, started pushing the idea of Christmas shopping further and further away from Christmas; the big block in the road, where you can't push it back any further, is Thanksgiving. 'Cause that's its own holiday. You can't start Christmas before Thanksgiving. And so, Black Friday became the official tipping point into the consumerist bonanza that is the holiday shopping season! Despite the fact that it has kind of this ominous-sounding name, it has been billed as the biggest and most important and best holiday shopping day of the year; which is actually not true. We are.. a nation of procrastinators; and thus, the biggest shopping day of the year is Christmas Eve. It seems a little bit upsetting that the day after we all get done telling the world why we should be satisfied with our lives, we are.. barraged with an advertising blitz showing us all of the things that we lack! At the same time, it is very important to the American economy. I mean, you can't really get angry at people for wanting to give each other things... And yes, DFTBA.com has its own Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals; and you can go to DFTBA.com and check those out now. It's also our 4th Anniversary of being a company, which is very exciting! And, to celebrate that fourth anniversary, all shipping within the United States this weekend, starting tomorrow, I think, is just $4.00! No matter what you buy!! But, I do think it's important that we don't just scrub the idea of satisfaction and thankfulness out of our brains as soon as we're done for Thanksgiving. And so, on this Black Friday, I want to continue being thankful. I'm thankful to my wonderful and supportive parents; to my beautiful, and intelligent, and hilarious wife. I'm thankful to my new Wii U. If you want to go to youtube.com/hankgames, you can see us playing the new Super Mario Brothers there soon. I'm thankful to all of my great friends here in Missoula and across the world. I'm thankful to finally have a robust and stable forum that can handle the weight of Nerdfighteria. There's a link in the description. I'm thankful to Youtube and Google for funding SciShow and Crash Course, and for supporting VlogBrothers, and all of our endeavors through the years. I'm thankful to Reddit , and QI, and Mental Floss magazine, for making sure that I keep learning interesting things. I'm thankful to Jonas Salk for giving away the patent to his polio vaccine to the world, so that it could be less expensive to manufacture; and Tim Berners-Lee for doing basically the same thing with the internet. I'm thankful to the Nerdcrafteria Minecraft server and Tumblr, and the Ning; and all the other places on the internet where Nerdfighters do Nerdfighter things. And, I'm thankful to all the wonderful, thoughtful, intelligent people who watch and support the things that I do on the internet; even when it's sappy, silly videos like this one. And I'm thankful, of course, for my brother who's always driving me to do new and interesting and difficult things; and who's raising a wonderful family, and who says wise and intelligent things on Tumblr. And John, I'll see you on Tuesday. *Music plays*

**Transcript**:
Of all the fruits farmed in the United
States, you can count on one hand, how many are native to this land - cranberries are one of them. They were both food and medicine - to
Native Americans - who recognize the cranberries' anti-inflammatory properties.
They even spread it on their arrow wounds. And today we know the humble cranberry
outranks almost every fruit and vegetable for disease fighting
antioxidants. Every year one-fifth of America's total harvest is consumed
around one day: Thanksgiving. Most of that, is cranberry sauce. Only five percent of the nation's crop
is sold as whole fresh cranberries. But everything else we eat: the dried
sweetened cranberries, the juice, the sauce - it all starts with this peculiar
little berry. And contrary to popular belief, cranberries don't grow under
water. So - how do they grow? We're in southern New Jersey - one of
America's top three cranberry states. This region is called the Pine Barrens,
and natural habitat for cranberries. Many of the same families have farmed the berries since the mid-1800s - like the Leigh brothers - this seventh generation
cranberry farm. Cranberries grow on low trailing vines and sunken beds called bogs. The plants are perennial, meaning they survive year after year. Here the oldest vines are over 65 years old. Cranberries love this sort of sandy soil, and they take a long time to grow - 16 months. You can see here that while the berries are ripening, the buds for next year's crop are already growing on the
vine. So farmers have to carefully nurture two seasons worth of cranberries
at one time. Water is one of the most precious resources for cranberry farmers.
This 2,000 acre farm uses only a hundred and thirty acres to grow cranberries. The
rest is a series of reservoirs and watersheds. The primary sources that is
the waiting river, which runs naturally along the farm, and we'll borrow the water
during the growing season, and put it back in when we're finished with it.
We're simply holding the keys for the following generations after harvest. So
what's all this water for, if the cranberries grow in dry land? Well, twice
a year the farmers flood the bogs. First in December for the duration of winter. This is when the plants go dormant, and their blanket of water insulates the
vines from harsh winter frost. In the spring, the bogs are drained, and the cranberries' pink flowers bloom. Nowadays, many farms like Lee brothers hire commercial bees to pollinate the fields. And by mid-June, the fruit begins to grow,
the berries start out green, turn white around August, and finally, red in the
fall. The funny thing about cranberries is, they don't really sweeten as they
ripen like strawberries or blueberries. They're a naturally tart fruit, whether
they're red or white, and the color is just skin deep. See, the
inside is white and it's crisp like an apple, and inside there are four air
chambers, which means that cranberries can - float - and that brings us to the
second time the bogs are flooded: for the October Harvest. A harvester drives through to knock the berries off the vines. Then, farmers wade into the bog, to corral
the floating berries to an elevator that sucks them up into a truck. Nearly all the cranberry farmers in New
Jersey belonged to the Ocean Spray Cooperative, which grows over 60% of the
world's cranberries. These berries will be frozen and processed into craisins
and cranberry juice. Remember, cranberries are tart, so a lot
of cranberry products have added sugar, to make them sweet. But around
Thanksgiving, you can find whole cranberries (fresh or frozen) in the
supermarket, and you can easily turn these beauties into a killer cranberry
sauce. You can even mold the sauce, and
refrigerate it for that fresh-from-a-can look, except this stuff is a whole lot
better for you - and it tastes a whole lot better too...

cranberry farm. Cranberries grow on low trailing vines and sunken beds called bogs. The plants are perennial, meaning they survive year after year. Here the oldest vines are over 65 years old. Cranberries love this sort of sandy soil, and they take a long time to grow - 16 months. You can see here that while the berries are ripening, the buds for next year's crop are already growing on the
vine. So farmers have to carefully nurture two seasons worth of cranberries
at one time. Water is one of the most precious resources for cranberry farmers.
This 2,000 acre farm uses only a hundred and thirty acres to grow cranberries. The
rest is a series of reservoirs and watersheds. The primary sources that is
the waiting river, which runs naturally along the farm, and we'll borrow the water
during the growing season, and put it back in when we're finished with it.
We're simply holding the keys for the following generations after harvest. So
what's all this water for, if the cranberries grow in dry land? Well, twice
a year the farmers flood the bogs. First in December for the duration of winter. This is when the plants go dormant, and their blanket of water insulates the
vines from harsh winter frost. In the spring, the bogs are drained, and the cranberries' pink flowers bloom. Nowadays, many farms like Lee brothers hire commercial bees to pollinate the fields. And by mid-June, the fruit begins to grow,
the berries start out green, turn white around August, and finally, red in the
fall. The funny thing about cranberries is, they don't really sweeten as they
ripen like strawberries or blueberries. They're a naturally tart fruit, whether
they're red or white, and the color is just skin deep. See, the
inside is white and it's crisp like an apple, and inside there are four air
chambers, which means that cranberries can - float - and that brings us to the
second time the bogs are flooded: for the October Harvest. A harvester drives through to knock the berries off the vines. Then, farmers wade into the bog, to corral
the floating berries to an elevator that sucks them up into a truck. Nearly all the cranberry farmers in New
Jersey belonged to the Ocean Spray Cooperative, which grows over 60% of the
world's cranberries. These berries will be frozen and processed into craisins
and cranberry juice. Remember, cranberries are tart, so a lot
of cranberry products have added sugar, to make them sweet. But around
Thanksgiving, you can find whole cranberries (fresh or frozen) in the
supermarket, and you can easily turn these beauties into a killer cranberry
sauce. You can even mold the sauce, and
refrigerate it for that fresh-from-a-can look, except this stuff is a whole lot
better for you - and it tastes a whole lot better too...

Native Americans - who recognize the cranberries' anti-inflammatory properties.
They even spread it on their arrow wounds. And today we know the humble cranberry
outranks almost every fruit and vegetable for disease fighting
antioxidants. Every year one-fifth of America's total harvest is consumed
around one day: Thanksgiving. Most of that, is cranberry sauce. Only five percent of the nation's crop
is sold as whole fresh cranberries. But everything else we eat: the dried

**Transcript**:
Of all the fruits farmed in the United
States, you can count on one hand, how many are native to this land - cranberries are one of them. They were both food and medicine - to
Native Americans - who recognize the cranberries' anti-inflammatory properties.
They even spread it on their arrow wounds. And today we know the humble cranberry
outranks almost every fruit and vegetable for disease fighting
antioxidants. Every year one-fifth of America's total harvest is consumed
around one day: Thanksgiving. Most of that, is cranberry sauce. Only five percent of the nation's crop
is sold as whole fresh cranberries. But everything else we eat: the dried
sweetened cranberries, the juice, the sauce - it all starts with this peculiar
little berry. And contrary to popular belief, cranberries don't grow under
water. So - how do they grow? We're in southern New Jersey - one of
America's top three cranberry states. This region is called the Pine Barrens,
and natural habitat for cranberries. Many of the same families have farmed the berries since the mid-1800s - like the Leigh brothers - this seventh generation
cranberry farm. Cranberries grow on low trailing vines and sunken beds called bogs. The plants are perennial, meaning they survive year after year. Here the oldest vines are over 65 years old. Cranberries love this sort of sandy soil, and they take a long time to grow - 16 months. You can see here that while the berries are ripening, the buds for next year's crop are already growing on the
vine. So farmers have to carefully nurture two seasons worth of cranberries
at one time. Water is one of the most precious resources for cranberry farmers.
This 2,000 acre farm uses only a hundred and thirty acres to grow cranberries. The
rest is a series of reservoirs and watersheds. The primary sources that is
the waiting river, which runs naturally along the farm, and we'll borrow the water
during the growing season, and put it back in when we're finished with it.
We're simply holding the keys for the following generations after harvest. So
what's all this water for, if the cranberries grow in dry land? Well, twice
a year the farmers flood the bogs. First in December for the duration of winter. This is when the plants go dormant, and their blanket of water insulates the
vines from harsh winter frost. In the spring, the bogs are drained, and the cranberries' pink flowers bloom. Nowadays, many farms like Lee brothers hire commercial bees to pollinate the fields. And by mid-June, the fruit begins to grow,
the berries start out green, turn white around August, and finally, red in the
fall. The funny thing about cranberries is, they don't really sweeten as they
ripen like strawberries or blueberries. They're a naturally tart fruit, whether
they're red or white, and the color is just skin deep. See, the
inside is white and it's crisp like an apple, and inside there are four air
chambers, which means that cranberries can - float - and that brings us to the
second time the bogs are flooded: for the October Harvest. A harvester drives through to knock the berries off the vines. Then, farmers wade into the bog, to corral
the floating berries to an elevator that sucks them up into a truck. Nearly all the cranberry farmers in New
Jersey belonged to the Ocean Spray Cooperative, which grows over 60% of the
world's cranberries. These berries will be frozen and processed into craisins
and cranberry juice. Remember, cranberries are tart, so a lot
of cranberry products have added sugar, to make them sweet. But around
Thanksgiving, you can find whole cranberries (fresh or frozen) in the
supermarket, and you can easily turn these beauties into a killer cranberry
sauce. You can even mold the sauce, and
refrigerate it for that fresh-from-a-can look, except this stuff is a whole lot
better for you - and it tastes a whole lot better too...

**Transcript**:
Some of our very favorite foods are closer
to this than this. That’s because coffee, bread, cheese, beer
– even chocolate! – are home to millions of microbes. In fact, these foods only acquire the tastes,
smells, and textures we love because of tiny bacteria and fungi. The vast majority of microbes – about 99%
– are actually quite harmless to humans. But the other 1% are nasty enough that our
ancestors – and the ancestors of various other mammals and birds – evolved a natural
repulsion to stuff that might harbor nasty germs. In general, we think rotten stuff looks and
smells disgusting, which, considering what's at stake, isn’t overly cautious. Fortunately, if friendly microbes get to our
food first, they can keep the bad guys at bay. Meat left out on the counter provides the
perfect conditions for pathogens to flourish: it’s warm, moist, and protein-rich, just
like our bodies. But with some micromanagement – adding lots
of salt, for instance – we can help harmless, salt-tolerant microbes like Lactobacillus
outcompete their dangerous but salt-sensitive relatives. A few unrefrigerated months later, we get
salami, rather than Salmonelli! Our ancestors stumbled on this kind of controlled
spoilage thousands of years ago – either by lucky accidents or out of serious desperation
– and we humans have been intentionally spoiling food ever since. Not only to keep our food safe to eat, but
also because the microbes we culture can transform it, almost magically, into awesome deliciousness. Yeast, for example, gorge on the sugary starch
in bread dough, then burp out carbon dioxide that helps give loaves their lift. In a more exotic transformation, bacteria
and fungi take turns munching on piles of cacao, mellowing out bitter polyphenols and
helping create the complex and delicious taste of chocolate. And deep in cheese caves, mold spores populate
small holes and cracks in soon-to-be blue cheese, while their relatives munch through
the rest of the blob, digesting big protein and fat molecules into a host of smaller aromatic
and flavor compounds, that give the final product its smoothness and rich, funky flavor. But to some, stinky cheese is about as appetizing
as licking someone’s toes. Which isn’t that far off, since the bacteria
that make some cheeses super-stinky are the same ones that cause foot odor. Yum? Even so, these flavors tend to grow on us:
not just literally but also figuratively. The more we’re exposed to particular microbial
funks – from our first taste of the flavor compounds in amniotic fluid forward – the
more we tend to like them. As a result, people around the world have
some very different ideas about how to microbe-ify foods – but every culinary culture involves
fermentation in one way or another. And if we didn’t let food spoil just a little
bit, we’d have no sauerkraut, soy sauce, pickles, or prosciutto. Not to mention kefir, kimchi, kombucha, koumiss,
katsuobushi - and plenty of other delicacies that don’t start with K. What’s more,
spoiled food may well have changed far more than our tastes – historical evidence suggests
that, when our ancestors gave up their wandering ways and settled down to grow grain, it was
likely for love of either bread or beer. Whatever the case, one thing is clear: without
the help of friendly fermenting microbes, we humans would  be terribly uncultured.

bit, we’d have no sauerkraut, soy sauce, pickles, or prosciutto. Not to mention kefir, kimchi, kombucha, koumiss,
katsuobushi - and plenty of other delicacies that don’t start with K. What’s more,
spoiled food may well have changed far more than our tastes – historical evidence suggests
that, when our ancestors gave up their wandering ways and settled down to grow grain, it was
likely for love of either bread or beer. Whatever the case, one thing is clear: without
the help of friendly fermenting microbes, we humans would  be terribly uncultured.

**Transcript**:
Some of our very favorite foods are closer
to this than this. That’s because coffee, bread, cheese, beer
– even chocolate! – are home to millions of microbes. In fact, these foods only acquire the tastes,
smells, and textures we love because of tiny bacteria and fungi. The vast majority of microbes – about 99%
– are actually quite harmless to humans. But the other 1% are nasty enough that our
ancestors – and the ancestors of various other mammals and birds – evolved a natural
repulsion to stuff that might harbor nasty germs. In general, we think rotten stuff looks and
smells disgusting, which, considering what's at stake, isn’t overly cautious. Fortunately, if friendly microbes get to our
food first, they can keep the bad guys at bay. Meat left out on the counter provides the
perfect conditions for pathogens to flourish: it’s warm, moist, and protein-rich, just
like our bodies. But with some micromanagement – adding lots
of salt, for instance – we can help harmless, salt-tolerant microbes like Lactobacillus
outcompete their dangerous but salt-sensitive relatives. A few unrefrigerated months later, we get
salami, rather than Salmonelli! Our ancestors stumbled on this kind of controlled
spoilage thousands of years ago – either by lucky accidents or out of serious desperation
– and we humans have been intentionally spoiling food ever since. Not only to keep our food safe to eat, but
also because the microbes we culture can transform it, almost magically, into awesome deliciousness. Yeast, for example, gorge on the sugary starch
in bread dough, then burp out carbon dioxide that helps give loaves their lift. In a more exotic transformation, bacteria
and fungi take turns munching on piles of cacao, mellowing out bitter polyphenols and
helping create the complex and delicious taste of chocolate. And deep in cheese caves, mold spores populate
small holes and cracks in soon-to-be blue cheese, while their relatives munch through
the rest of the blob, digesting big protein and fat molecules into a host of smaller aromatic
and flavor compounds, that give the final product its smoothness and rich, funky flavor. But to some, stinky cheese is about as appetizing
as licking someone’s toes. Which isn’t that far off, since the bacteria
that make some cheeses super-stinky are the same ones that cause foot odor. Yum? Even so, these flavors tend to grow on us:
not just literally but also figuratively. The more we’re exposed to particular microbial
funks – from our first taste of the flavor compounds in amniotic fluid forward – the
more we tend to like them. As a result, people around the world have
some very different ideas about how to microbe-ify foods – but every culinary culture involves
fermentation in one way or another. And if we didn’t let food spoil just a little
bit, we’d have no sauerkraut, soy sauce, pickles, or prosciutto. Not to mention kefir, kimchi, kombucha, koumiss,
katsuobushi - and plenty of other delicacies that don’t start with K. What’s more,
spoiled food may well have changed far more than our tastes – historical evidence suggests

the help of friendly fermenting microbes, we humans would  be terribly uncultured.

**Transcript**:
[Emily}: Hey! So taxonomy is a totally complicated, really interesting field of science responsible for the naming and classification of things and we started to kind of get into this topic with our previous episode on "What is a Species", where we look into species definitions and concepts but I thought it would be really fun to do a hands-on experiment and there's nothing better than getting a couple of expert taxonomists in on the game.   [Olivier]: I'm Olivier Rieppel. I'm the Roe family curator of evolutionary biology here at the Field Museum in Chicago. [Janet]: I'm Janet Voight. I'm a MacArthur Associate Curator here at the Field Museum in the Intergrative Research Center. [Larry]: My name is Larry Heaney. I am the Negaunee Curator of Mammals at the Field Museum at the Field Museum of Natural History. [Margaret]: My name's Margaret Thayer. I'm a curator emeritus at the Field Museum I study insects, particularly beetles. [Emily]: And we wanted to get them to look at something in-depth that maybe they hadn't considered classifying before. Skittles! Peanut M&Ms! Peanut butter M&Ms! Nerds! Plain M&Ms! Starbursts! Reese's Pieces! Jellybeans! Chocolate-covered peanuts! Chewy Jolly Rancher thingies! Starburst jellybeans! And we had some black licorice, but I lost it. That's right--we're doing the taxonomy of candy. [Brain Scoop intro music] [Olivier]: If you want to classify things--and that can be anything, I mean, organisms you classify according to illusionary relationships With candy, or office furniture, or whatever you classify according to similarities. [Janet]: the art of taxonomy requires that you actually separate that new thing that you think you've found as much as you can from every other species that looks like it. [Larry]: I like chocolate-covered candy.
[Emily]: OK. [Larry]: And so we could group it together that way. [Emily]: So, essentially, all of these on this side, and we can move the Nerds over here. [Larry]: And that one too.
[Emily]: Yup.
[Larry]: Yup.
[Larry]: Can I have one of those? [Emily]: Yes, feel free. [Margaret]: I think investigating their contents would be an important thing to look at. It's not quite as hard as it looks. [Emily]: Oh wow! [Margaret]: That has some kind of jelly material in it. (chewing) I don't usually use this test for specimens, but...(both laugh) [Emily]: Do you eat the beetles that you study?
[Margaret]: No, not normally. [Margaret]: We occasionally sniff them, but that's all. 
[Emily]: Oh. [Olivier]: Here are the roundish things, the big ones, and then the smaller roundish things would be more closely related to that batch here than to any of the others. [Janet]: Right now I'm approaching these jars as collections made of what's likely the same species. The collections were made at one spot, at one time. [Emily]: You went to the river, put the jar in the water, and it was filled with Reese's Pieces. [Janet]: Yeah.
[Emily]: OK.
[Janet]: In La-La Land, I mean, but...
(both laugh) [Larry]: So we could group things together, put the chocolate ones together that way OR we could take the red ones and put those together.
[Emily]: Allll of the red ones. [Margaret]: That would be like taking a whole bunch of different red birds and putting them all together because they're red but one of them is a cardinal and one is some kind of duck, and you know...*muttering*..they're not related at all, so.... [Emily]: They're not even close.
[Margaret]: Yeah. [Emily]: So would you put those with the other bean shapes, here?
[Olivier]: So these are the bean shapes, here... [Olivier]: And then you have the bean shaped, you have the rounded, that go closer, that go over with the bean shaped... And you have the small rounded, that go closer with those... [Janet]: So just flipping through these, I'm seeing these Reese's Pieces: different colors, but the shape is amazingly uniform. These, with a strange letter "M", have some damage--I see their guts are actually chocolate. So my hypothesis is that each of these things, despite being a different color, actually has guts of chocolate. [Emily]: So you think that the red Skittles and the red Jolly Ranchers, and the red black-covered licorice, as gross as it is, can all be one thing. [Larry] (eating candy): Absolutely.
That's the thing about candy. You can put it together, you can group them any way you want.
[Emily]: Mm-hmm
[Larry]: Doesn't matter. [Olivier]: The way they are mixed up, you can't classify them in colors, because there is all colors in one. [Emily]: Right.
[Olivier]: So, not many characters to go with. [Emily]: I have insider knowledge: I have done extensive work on the taxonomy of Jelly Bellies. [Margaret]: (laughing)
[Emily]: And I can tell you that there are 36 different flavors in here. [Emily]: What would you make of something like that? [Margaret]: Well it could be that, uh, if we worked out the taxonomy of these things, we might decide that the Jelly Bellies were a genus unto themselves. And those 36, 37 flavors were different species of Jelly Bellies. [Emily]: Oh wow.
[Margaret]: Similarly, those other jelly bean things, that would be another way to interpret those as well. [Emily]: They're like the same family.
[Margaret]: *clears throat* Yeah. [Emily]: They're in the jelly bean family.
[Margaret]: The jelly bean family, right. [Emily]: I want to organize candy in a way where I can reach my hand in and shove them all in my face You can't do that with the red candy because then you've got like the peanut M&M and then the cinnamon Jelly Belly. [Larry]: Cinnamon and peanut butter actually would go together well.... [Larry]: You can try that.
[Emily]: Um, I'm okay. [Emily]: I'm alright.
*both start laughing* [Janet]: So you slap out your pen and your paper and your computer and you say, "Why are they different?" So you add all those up and then you go back and look in the literature For previously published descriptions of things that are kind of like this. 
[Emily]: Uh-huh [Janet]: In the same genus, let's say---or maybe in related genera, because sometimes a genus isn't as good as you think it is... [Emily]: nyeah...
[Janet]: But then you read those, and you look at them, and if you're kind of confused, then you try and get a hold of specimens, so that way...
[Emily]: And then it keeps kinda going. [Olivier]: The goal of classification, in terms of organisms, the goal of classification is to bring out their evolutionary relationships. [Larry]: What makes organisms so different is that our classifications of those is based on their relationships, on their ancestors. We don't put red bats and red foxes together. We COULD put red candy together! It makes perfect sense, why not? But we don't do it with red bats and red foxes because they DON'T share a common ancestor except way way way way WAY back. [Olivier]: Yeah, there's very many ways to classify things, and it's an interesting problem. Why there should be so many ways to classify things, and what these different classification things say about the world. [Emily]: And what does it say about us as people--
[Olivier]: as people, exactly. [Emily]: For choosing the ways, ways that we choose [Olivier]: Which means to say, is it us bringing order to the world? Or does the world come to us in an ordered way? [Olivier]: And probably is the first way around.
[Emily]: Oh wow. Now you're going into the philosophical rabbit hole.

**Transcript**:
[Emily}: Hey! So taxonomy is a totally complicated, really interesting field of science responsible for the naming and classification of things and we started to kind of get into this topic with our previous episode on "What is a Species", where we look into species definitions and concepts but I thought it would be really fun to do a hands-on experiment and there's nothing better than getting a couple of expert taxonomists in on the game.   [Olivier]: I'm Olivier Rieppel. I'm the Roe family curator of evolutionary biology here at the Field Museum in Chicago. [Janet]: I'm Janet Voight. I'm a MacArthur Associate Curator here at the Field Museum in the Intergrative Research Center. [Larry]: My name is Larry Heaney. I am the Negaunee Curator of Mammals at the Field Museum at the Field Museum of Natural History. [Margaret]: My name's Margaret Thayer. I'm a curator emeritus at the Field Museum I study insects, particularly beetles. [Emily]: And we wanted to get them to look at something in-depth that maybe they hadn't considered classifying before. Skittles! Peanut M&Ms! Peanut butter M&Ms! Nerds! Plain M&Ms! Starbursts! Reese's Pieces! Jellybeans! Chocolate-covered peanuts! Chewy Jolly Rancher thingies! Starburst jellybeans! And we had some black licorice, but I lost it. That's right--we're doing the taxonomy of candy. [Brain Scoop intro music] [Olivier]: If you want to classify things--and that can be anything, I mean, organisms you classify according to illusionary relationships With candy, or office furniture, or whatever you classify according to similarities. [Janet]: the art of taxonomy requires that you actually separate that new thing that you think you've found as much as you can from every other species that looks like it. [Larry]: I like chocolate-covered candy.
[Emily]: OK. [Larry]: And so we could group it together that way. [Emily]: So, essentially, all of these on this side, and we can move the Nerds over here. [Larry]: And that one too.
[Emily]: Yup.
[Larry]: Yup.
[Larry]: Can I have one of those? [Emily]: Yes, feel free. [Margaret]: I think investigating their contents would be an important thing to look at. It's not quite as hard as it looks. [Emily]: Oh wow! [Margaret]: That has some kind of jelly material in it. (chewing) I don't usually use this test for specimens, but...(both laugh) [Emily]: Do you eat the beetles that you study?
[Margaret]: No, not normally. [Margaret]: We occasionally sniff them, but that's all. 
[Emily]: Oh. [Olivier]: Here are the roundish things, the big ones, and then the smaller roundish things would be more closely related to that batch here than to any of the others. [Janet]: Right now I'm approaching these jars as collections made of what's likely the same species. The collections were made at one spot, at one time. [Emily]: You went to the river, put the jar in the water, and it was filled with Reese's Pieces. [Janet]: Yeah.
[Emily]: OK.
[Janet]: In La-La Land, I mean, but...
(both laugh) [Larry]: So we could group things together, put the chocolate ones together that way OR we could take the red ones and put those together.
[Emily]: Allll of the red ones. [Margaret]: That would be like taking a whole bunch of different red birds and putting them all together because they're red but one of them is a cardinal and one is some kind of duck, and you know...*muttering*..they're not related at all, so.... [Emily]: They're not even close.
[Margaret]: Yeah. [Emily]: So would you put those with the other bean shapes, here?
[Olivier]: So these are the bean shapes, here... [Olivier]: And then you have the bean shaped, you have the rounded, that go closer, that go over with the bean shaped... And you have the small rounded, that go closer with those... [Janet]: So just flipping through these, I'm seeing these Reese's Pieces: different colors, but the shape is amazingly uniform. These, with a strange letter "M", have some damage--I see their guts are actually chocolate. So my hypothesis is that each of these things, despite being a different color, actually has guts of chocolate. [Emily]: So you think that the red Skittles and the red Jolly Ranchers, and the red black-covered licorice, as gross as it is, can all be one thing. [Larry] (eating candy): Absolutely.
That's the thing about candy. You can put it together, you can group them any way you want.
[Emily]: Mm-hmm
[Larry]: Doesn't matter. [Olivier]: The way they are mixed up, you can't classify them in colors, because there is all colors in one. [Emily]: Right.
[Olivier]: So, not many characters to go with. [Emily]: I have insider knowledge: I have done extensive work on the taxonomy of Jelly Bellies. [Margaret]: (laughing)
[Emily]: And I can tell you that there are 36 different flavors in here. [Emily]: What would you make of something like that? [Margaret]: Well it could be that, uh, if we worked out the taxonomy of these things, we might decide that the Jelly Bellies were a genus unto themselves. And those 36, 37 flavors were different species of Jelly Bellies. [Emily]: Oh wow.
[Margaret]: Similarly, those other jelly bean things, that would be another way to interpret those as well. [Emily]: They're like the same family.
[Margaret]: *clears throat* Yeah. [Emily]: They're in the jelly bean family.
[Margaret]: The jelly bean family, right. [Emily]: I want to organize candy in a way where I can reach my hand in and shove them all in my face You can't do that with the red candy because then you've got like the peanut M&M and then the cinnamon Jelly Belly. [Larry]: Cinnamon and peanut butter actually would go together well.... [Larry]: You can try that.
[Emily]: Um, I'm okay. [Emily]: I'm alright.
*both start laughing* [Janet]: So you slap out your pen and your paper and your computer and you say, "Why are they different?" So you add all those up and then you go back and look in the literature For previously published descriptions of things that are kind of like this. 
[Emily]: Uh-huh [Janet]: In the same genus, let's say---or maybe in related genera, because sometimes a genus isn't as good as you think it is... [Emily]: nyeah...
[Janet]: But then you read those, and you look at them, and if you're kind of confused, then you try and get a hold of specimens, so that way...
[Emily]: And then it keeps kinda going. [Olivier]: The goal of classification, in terms of organisms, the goal of classification is to bring out their evolutionary relationships. [Larry]: What makes organisms so different is that our classifications of those is based on their relationships, on their ancestors. We don't put red bats and red foxes together. We COULD put red candy together! It makes perfect sense, why not? But we don't do it with red bats and red foxes because they DON'T share a common ancestor except way way way way WAY back. [Olivier]: Yeah, there's very many ways to classify things, and it's an interesting problem. Why there should be so many ways to classify things, and what these different classification things say about the world. [Emily]: And what does it say about us as people--
[Olivier]: as people, exactly. [Emily]: For choosing the ways, ways that we choose [Olivier]: Which means to say, is it us bringing order to the world? Or does the world come to us in an ordered way? [Olivier]: And probably is the first way around.
[Emily]: Oh wow. Now you're going into the philosophical rabbit hole.

**Transcript**:
Pumpkins are a mighty squash -
and they're actually the exact same species as a lot of other squash.
Acorn squash, yellow squash,
spaghetti squash, and even zucchini.
That means a zucchini and a pumpkin can breed and have little babies
zumpkins Or, maybe ... pumpkinis? The latin name for pumpkins is Cucurbita pepo,
which just means gourd melon, a truly uninspired bit of naming.
Like all fruit, pumpkins are both a trick and a treat – The seeds are hidden inside a delicious,
brightly covered package So animals to will eat them, 
and then spread them around. Pumpkin seeds (or pepitas) have evolved tough
shells that can survive the exciting journey through an animal's
digestive tract. In Russia, some believe that eating pumpkin
seeds can help get rid of parasitic worms. It's
not clear if that really works in humans but there is a real published study in which
pumpkin seeds helped de-worm ostriches. Pumpkins come from the Americas - they were
actually one of the first plants domesticated here 8-10 thousand years ago.
When the pilgrims arrived in 1620 they ate a lot of pumpkins.
They even wrote a poem about. That rhyme scheme was not great, but maybe that’s because the pilgrims were also making
a lot of beer with their pumpkins. Pumpkin beer was already a thing way back in the 17th century Sorry hipsters! People once thought they could get rid of freckles
by putting mashed-up pumpkin on there faces. And in all fairness that probably did distract
from the freckles. Explorers soon brought pumpkins back to europe.
It was only 1697 when a Frenchman incorporated a pumpkin into
the popular folktale we know as Cinderella. That was actually a very specific variety
of pumpkin - a red pumpkin – and there are lots of other colors. Yellow, white, even blue. And all pumpkins start out green – their
skin is full of green chlorophyll that photosynthesizes just like in a leaf. As the pumpkin ripens, the chlorophyll breaks down, and other pigments like orange carotene
become visible. You know how they gas green
tomatoes to turn them red? It's called ethylene  - and its given off
by a lot of ripening fruits. So if you have an unripe green pumpkin and
you want to change its color, put it in a bag with some old apples
and wait a few days. The Jack-O-Lantern has its roots in Europe
The story goes that a sinful man named Stingy Jack tricked the devil to get out of of hell but also wasn't allowed into heaven
so he was forced to wander the earth with only a single coal for a light. In the British Isles, people used turnips to carve their own Jack-O-Lanterns, but when they got to the Americas they must have realized: these will work waaaaay better.

from the freckles. Explorers soon brought pumpkins back to europe.
It was only 1697 when a Frenchman incorporated a pumpkin into
the popular folktale we know as Cinderella. That was actually a very specific variety
of pumpkin - a red pumpkin – and there are lots of other colors. Yellow, white, even blue. And all pumpkins start out green – their
skin is full of green chlorophyll that photosynthesizes just like in a leaf. As the pumpkin ripens, the chlorophyll breaks down, and other pigments like orange carotene
become visible. You know how they gas green
tomatoes to turn them red? It's called ethylene  - and its given off
by a lot of ripening fruits. So if you have an unripe green pumpkin and
you want to change its color, put it in a bag with some old apples
and wait a few days. The Jack-O-Lantern has its roots in Europe
The story goes that a sinful man named Stingy Jack tricked the devil to get out of of hell but also wasn't allowed into heaven
so he was forced to wander the earth with only a single coal for a light. In the British Isles, people used turnips to carve their own Jack-O-Lanterns, but when they got to the Americas they must have realized: these will work waaaaay better.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever heard someone say they're "blind as a bat"? Well that expression is a bit misguided. During the day, some kinds of bats can see almost as well as humans. But when the sun goes down, nocturnal bats rely on their ears more than their eyes to navigate. This special navigation process is called echolocation. In echolocation, bats use a combination of the voice, ears, and echoes to create a perceptual map that allows them to "see" in the dark. You might be wondering where an echo comes from. An echo is the reflection of sound reaching a listener. Sound is a vibration that ripples away from its source in waves. The rate at which this vibration occurs is called its frequency. Sound waves at high frequencies are high-pitched. Humans can hear sounds at frequencies between 20 and 20,000 waves per second and don't perceive pitches outside that range. Bats, on the other hand, can hear and produce sound at frequencies over 100,000 waves per second- way beyond the range of human hearing. Here, we've slowed down a bat's chirp, so you can hear it! This chrip is the first step in the process of bat echolocation, the primary sound that the bat will use to detect information about its surroundings. The bat listens as the chirp leaves its body and bounces off its surroundings. When the sound returns to the bat, the cartilage of the outer ear funnels the sound waves into the ear canal. The waves then reach the eardrum, which vibrates in response. These vibrations are transferred further into the ear to the basilar membrane, which runs the length of the cochlea. If you uncoil the cochlea and the basilar membrane, they would look like this. Each area of the membrane moves in response to a particular frequency. Then, the cochlea converts these vibrations into nerve impulses for the brain to interpret. The bad echolocate so fast that it can track down a dinner of insects moving around in complete darkness. Special muscles in its throat make it possible for the bat to chirp 160 to 190 times per second! Because it receives so much information at once, it has to differentiate relevant information from signal clutter. To do this, the bat emits chirps of varying frequency patterns, each of which echoes off objects differently depending on the object's size, shape and distance from the bat. Then, by analyzing resulting echo intensities, it creates a mental map of its surrounding physical space. When looking for prey, the bat first sends out low-frequency chirps over a wide range. Llarger objects will reflect more intense echoes, but it's often the smaller objects, like insects that the bat is targeting. Once a bat receives low-intensity echoes from small potential prey, it will remit a high frequency chirp directed toward it. When both high-and low-frequency echoes return to the bat, it is able to ignore the now-irrelevant, low-frequency ways that reflect from the trees or rocks that surround its meal. To gauge how far away a given object is, the bat analyzes the time delay between when it hears its chirp and perceives the resulting echo. Directional information comes from comparing information the bat receives in each ear. For example, let's imagine that a bat's chirp echoes back from an insect to this side of the bat. Since this ear is closer to the insect, it will receive the sound before the other ear. By interpreting the difference between when it receives the echo in each ear, the bat can guide itself towards the insect. Bat are only one type of animal that use echolocation. killer whales, dolphins, porpoises and some birds echolocate as well. Scientists who developed sonar and radar got their ideas from the study of echolocation in bats and whales. The U.S. Navy and other research groups are especially interested in echolocation because it could lead to even more technology! Maybe now you'll think twice the next time someone says "blind as a bat!"

Parasites have a nasty reputation - but is
really fair to fear these little guys? Well, yes - and if you don't think so, here's
why these terrifying creatures are worth avoiding at all costs! As if you need another reason to hate mosquitoes
- when they bite humans they can leave larvae of the parasitic Filarial Worm. These worms live and grow in our bodies, sometimes
taking years to mature into full adults, leaving only inconspicuous rashes and sores. Years later, they work together to block the
vessels of your lymphatic system, creating a build-up of fluid and leading to diseases
like elephantiasis. This is one of the leading causes of disability
in the world. Another worm worth hating is the pinworm. Pinworm eggs are often eaten because of contaminated
or dirty hands. The eggs hatch and mature in your gut, at
which point the adult female exits the anus to lay a new batch of eggs on the surrounding
skin. Your butthole becomes a nest! This causes intense itching, often leading
to re-contaminated hands or fingernails, which can end up in your mouth again, restarting
the cycle. Feel like scratching your bum? Do yourself a favour and wash those hands
and fingernails! On the other side of the body, live the lovely
pubic lice - sometimes called 'crabs'. Though it's not uncommon to find these buggers
in your eyebrows, beard or even eyelashes. The itching is from an allergic reaction to
their saliva, and it'll take treatment with medication or shaving it all off to get rid
of them. Of course, abstinence or no sex works well
as a preventative measure, along with not sharing your undies with other people. Some parasites are meant for marine animals,
but end up in humans out of the goodness of our...gut? The Anisakis Nematode infects humans after
eating raw or undercooked fish - like sushi - which contains the larvae. The worms penetrate our gut wall and cause
abdominal pain, nausea and even vomiting. But, nobody really wins this one, as the nematode
can't mature in a human gut and eventually dies. The Tongue Biter is another marine parasite. This tongue eating louse finds a suitable
fish and chews off it's tongue, only to cling on to the stub in it's place. Here they stay feeding on the fishes blood,
all the while mating and dispersing their progeny into the ocean. And finally, the wonderful cordyceps which
are fungi known for creating zombie ants. The fungus takes over the ants body and mind,
making it leave the colony and begin climbing upward to a more ideal temperature and humidity. The ant then bites onto a stem or leaf and
gets locked into position until it dies. At which point, the fungus bursts through
the ants head and spreads outward. Could such a parasite ever affect humans? For everyone's sake, we hope not! Our friends at James Cook University helped
us put this horrifying list of parasites together, with special help from parasitologist Dr Kate
Hutson. JCU is one of the world's leading institutions
focusing on the tropics with an opportunity to study in a diverse physical environment
unparalleled by any university in the world. I actually studied there for a semester abroad! If you want to learn more, be sure to head

why these terrifying creatures are worth avoiding at all costs! As if you need another reason to hate mosquitoes
- when they bite humans they can leave larvae of the parasitic Filarial Worm. These worms live and grow in our bodies, sometimes
taking years to mature into full adults, leaving only inconspicuous rashes and sores. Years later, they work together to block the
vessels of your lymphatic system, creating a build-up of fluid and leading to diseases
like elephantiasis. This is one of the leading causes of disability
in the world. Another worm worth hating is the pinworm. Pinworm eggs are often eaten because of contaminated
or dirty hands. The eggs hatch and mature in your gut, at
which point the adult female exits the anus to lay a new batch of eggs on the surrounding
skin. Your butthole becomes a nest! This causes intense itching, often leading
to re-contaminated hands or fingernails, which can end up in your mouth again, restarting
the cycle. Feel like scratching your bum? Do yourself a favour and wash those hands
and fingernails! On the other side of the body, live the lovely
pubic lice - sometimes called 'crabs'. Though it's not uncommon to find these buggers
in your eyebrows, beard or even eyelashes. The itching is from an allergic reaction to
their saliva, and it'll take treatment with medication or shaving it all off to get rid
of them. Of course, abstinence or no sex works well
as a preventative measure, along with not sharing your undies with other people. Some parasites are meant for marine animals,
but end up in humans out of the goodness of our...gut? The Anisakis Nematode infects humans after
eating raw or undercooked fish - like sushi - which contains the larvae. The worms penetrate our gut wall and cause
abdominal pain, nausea and even vomiting. But, nobody really wins this one, as the nematode
can't mature in a human gut and eventually dies. The Tongue Biter is another marine parasite. This tongue eating louse finds a suitable
fish and chews off it's tongue, only to cling on to the stub in it's place. Here they stay feeding on the fishes blood,
all the while mating and dispersing their progeny into the ocean. And finally, the wonderful cordyceps which
are fungi known for creating zombie ants. The fungus takes over the ants body and mind,
making it leave the colony and begin climbing upward to a more ideal temperature and humidity. The ant then bites onto a stem or leaf and
gets locked into position until it dies. At which point, the fungus bursts through
the ants head and spreads outward. Could such a parasite ever affect humans? For everyone's sake, we hope not! Our friends at James Cook University helped
us put this horrifying list of parasites together, with special help from parasitologist Dr Kate
Hutson. JCU is one of the world's leading institutions
focusing on the tropics with an opportunity to study in a diverse physical environment
unparalleled by any university in the world. I actually studied there for a semester abroad! If you want to learn more, be sure to head
