**Transcript**:
In the city of Alexandria in 415 CE, the bishop and the governor 
were in a fight. It started with a disagreement over the 
behavior of a militia of monks, and ended with an accusation 
of witchcraft leveled against one of the most 
powerful figures in the city. Hypatia of Alexandria was a prominent 
mathematician, philosopher, and advisor to the city’s leaders. In the centuries since she lived, the details of her life have been 
the subject of much dispute and have taken on an almost 
mythical status. But while none of Hypatia’s 
own writings survive, her contemporaries’ and students’ 
accounts of her work and life paint a picture of the qualities that 
made her renowned as a scholar, beloved as a teacher, and ultimately 
led to her downfall. Hypatia was born around 
355 in Alexandria, then part of the Egyptian province 
of the Eastern Roman Empire, and an intellectual center. Her father Theon was an accomplished 
Greek mathematician and astronomer; her mother is unknown. Hypatia was likely an only child, and 
Theon educated her himself. By adulthood, she had surpassed her 
father in both mathematics and philosophy, becoming the city’s foremost scholar 
and taking over his position at the head of the Platonic school, 
similar to a modern university. She refined scientific instruments, 
wrote math textbooks, and developed a more efficient 
method of long division. But perhaps her most significant 
contributions to intellectual life in Alexandria came through her teaching. The philosophy Hypatia taught drew 
from the legacy of Plato and Aristotle, as well as the mystical philosopher 
Plotinus and the mathematician Pythagoras. The convergence of these influences merged
to form a school called Neoplatonism. For the Neoplatonists, mathematics 
had a spiritual aspect, divided among the four branches of 
arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music. These subjects were not studied merely 
for the sake of curiosity or practical utility, but because they 
authenticated the belief that numbers were the sacred 
language of the universe. In the repeated patterns of algebraic 
formulas and geometric shapes, the orbits of the planets, and the 
harmonious intervals of musical tones, the Neoplatonists saw a rational 
cosmic force at work. Students delved into this ordered 
mathematical world to achieve higher unity with this force, 
known as “the One.” While Hypatia was considered pagan— a term for traditional Roman 
belief before Christianity— she worshipped no particular 
deity or deities, and her ideas could be applied alongside 
multiple religious viewpoints. Jewish and Christian as well 
as pagan students travelled from the farthest reaches of 
the empire to study with her. The nonpartisan environment 
Hypatia fostered, where all students could feel comfortable, was especially remarkable given the 
religious and political turmoil that was fracturing the city of 
Alexandria at the time. Christianity had recently become 
the Empire’s state religion. The local archbishop Cyril had steadily 
gained political power, commanding zealous militias of Christian 
monks to destroy pagan temples and harass the Jewish population. In doing so, he encroached on the secular
authority of the Roman governor Orestes, himself a moderate Christian, leading to
a bitter public feud between the two men. Because she was seen as a wise 
and impartial figure, governor Orestes consulted Hypatia, who advised him to act with 
fairness and restraint. But when a group of Cyril’s 
monks incited a riot, badly injuring Orestes in the process, 
he had their leader tortured to death. Cyril and his followers blamed Hypatia, accusing her of witchcraft to 
turn Orestes against Christianity. In March 415, as Hypatia was 
traveling through the city, the bishop’s militia of monks 
dragged her from her carriage and brutally murdered and dismembered her. Hypatia’s death was a turning point 
in the politics of Alexandria. In the wake of her murder, other philosophers in the Greek 
and Roman tradition fled, and the city’s role as a center of 
learning declined. In a very real way, the spirit of inquisition, openness, 
and fairness she fostered died with her.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I would say that Question 10 is the closest match.

Although Question 10 does not directly ask about Hypatia giving advice to officials, it does describe her teaching style as "wise and impartial," which is similar to the description in the ground truth MCQ. Additionally, the transcript mentions that Governor Orestes consulted Hypatia, who advised him to act with fairness and restraint, which is related to the content of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 10 is the most similar generated MCQ, with an index of 10. However, please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about Hypatia giving advice to officials.

powerful figures in the city. Hypatia of Alexandria was a prominent 
mathematician, philosopher, and advisor to the city’s leaders. In the centuries since she lived, the details of her life have been 
the subject of much dispute and have taken on an almost 
mythical status. But while none of Hypatia’s 
own writings survive, her contemporaries’ and students’ 
accounts of her work and life paint a picture of the qualities that 
made her renowned as a scholar, beloved as a teacher, and ultimately 
led to her downfall. Hypatia was born around 
355 in Alexandria, then part of the Egyptian province 
of the Eastern Roman Empire, and an intellectual center. Her father Theon was an accomplished 
Greek mathematician and astronomer; her mother is unknown. Hypatia was likely an only child, and 
Theon educated her himself. By adulthood, she had surpassed her 
father in both mathematics and philosophy, becoming the city’s foremost scholar 
and taking over his position at the head of the Platonic school, 
similar to a modern university. She refined scientific instruments, 
wrote math textbooks, and developed a more efficient 
method of long division. But perhaps her most significant 
contributions to intellectual life in Alexandria came through her teaching. The philosophy Hypatia taught drew 
from the legacy of Plato and Aristotle, as well as the mystical philosopher 
Plotinus and the mathematician Pythagoras. The convergence of these influences merged
to form a school called Neoplatonism. For the Neoplatonists, mathematics 
had a spiritual aspect, divided among the four branches of 
arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music. These subjects were not studied merely 
for the sake of curiosity or practical utility, but because they 
authenticated the belief that numbers were the sacred 
language of the universe. In the repeated patterns of algebraic 
formulas and geometric shapes, the orbits of the planets, and the 
harmonious intervals of musical tones, the Neoplatonists saw a rational 
cosmic force at work. Students delved into this ordered 
mathematical world to achieve higher unity with this force, 
known as “the One.” While Hypatia was considered pagan— a term for traditional Roman 
belief before Christianity— she worshipped no particular 
deity or deities, and her ideas could be applied alongside 
multiple religious viewpoints. Jewish and Christian as well 
as pagan students travelled from the farthest reaches of 
the empire to study with her. The nonpartisan environment 
Hypatia fostered, where all students could feel comfortable, was especially remarkable given the 
religious and political turmoil that was fracturing the city of 
Alexandria at the time. Christianity had recently become 
the Empire’s state religion. The local archbishop Cyril had steadily 
gained political power, commanding zealous militias of Christian 
monks to destroy pagan temples and harass the Jewish population. In doing so, he encroached on the secular
authority of the Roman governor Orestes, himself a moderate Christian, leading to
a bitter public feud between the two men. Because she was seen as a wise 
and impartial figure, governor Orestes consulted Hypatia, who advised him to act with 
fairness and restraint. But when a group of Cyril’s 
monks incited a riot, badly injuring Orestes in the process, 
he had their leader tortured to death. Cyril and his followers blamed Hypatia, accusing her of witchcraft to 
turn Orestes against Christianity. In March 415, as Hypatia was 
traveling through the city, the bishop’s militia of monks 
dragged her from her carriage and brutally murdered and dismembered her. Hypatia’s death was a turning point 
in the politics of Alexandria. In the wake of her murder, other philosophers in the Greek 
and Roman tradition fled, and the city’s role as a center of 
learning declined. In a very real way, the spirit of inquisition, openness, 
and fairness she fostered died with her.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has some relation to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the term "pagan" and its meaning. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about this term, Question 9 does ask about the philosophical school that Hypatia drew from in her teachings, which is Neoplatonism. According to the transcript, Hypatia was considered a pagan, and her ideas could be applied alongside multiple religious viewpoints.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses Hypatia's religious views or the context in which the term "pagan" is used. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs meet this criteria.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 9, but with the caveat that it's not a direct match.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In the spring of 1944, Tokyo residents
experienced numerous aerial attacks from Allied bombers. Air raid sirens warned citizens 
to get indoors and preceded strategic blackouts
across the city. But 28-year old Hisako Koyama 
saw these blackouts as opportunities. Dragging a futon over her head 
for protection, Koyama would gaze at the night sky, tracking all sorts 
of astronomical phenomena. However, her latest endeavor required 
the light of day. By angling her telescope towards the sun, Koyama could project the star's
light onto a sheet of paper, allowing her to sketch 
the sun’s shifting surface. She spent weeks recreating this set up,
tracking every change she saw. But while Koyama didn't know it, these drawings were the start 
of one of the most important records of solar activity in human history. To understand exactly what Koyama
saw on the sun’s surface, we first need to understand 
what’s happening inside the star. Every second, 
trillions of hydrogen atoms fuse into helium atoms
in a process called nuclear fusion. This ongoing explosion maintains 
the sun’s internal temperature of roughly 15 million degrees Celsius, which is more than enough energy 
to transform gas into churning pools of plasma. Plasma consists of charged particles 
that produce powerful magnetic fields. But unlike the stable charged particles 
that maintain magnetic activity on Earth, this plasma is constantly in flux, alternately disrupting and amplifying
the sun's magnetic field. This ongoing movement can produce temporary concentrations 
of magnetic activity which inhibit the movement of molecules 
and in turn reduce heat in that area. And since regions with less heat 
generate less light, places with the strongest magnetic fields
appear as dark spots scattered across the sun’s surface. These so-called sunspots 
are always moving, both as a result of plasma 
swirling within the sphere, and the sun’s rotation. And because they’re often 
clustered together, accurately counting sunspots and tracking 
their movement can be a challenge, depending greatly on the perception 
and judgment of the viewer. This is precisely where Koyama’s 
contributions would be so valuable. Despite having no
formal training in astronomy, her observations and sketches
were remarkably accurate. After sending her work 
to the Oriental Astronomical Association, she received a letter of commendation for
her dedicated and detailed observations. With their support, she began to visit 
the Tokyo Museum of Science, where she could use a far superior
telescope to continue her work. Koyama soon joined the museum's staff
as a professional observer, and over the next 40 years, 
she worked on a daily basis, producing over 10,000 drawings
of the sun’s surface. Researchers already knew magnetic currents
in the sun followed an 11 year cycle that moved sunspots in a butterfly shaped 
path over the star’s surface. But using Koyama’s record, they could precisely follow 
specific sunspots and clusters through that journey. This kind of detail offered a real-time
indication of the sun’s magnetic activity, allowing scientists to track 
all kinds of solar phenomena, including volatile solar flares. These flares typically emanate
from the vicinity of sunspots, and can travel all the way 
to Earth’s atmosphere. Here, they can create geomagnetic storms capable of disrupting long range 
communication and causing blackouts. Solar flares also pose a major risk 
to satellites and manned space stations, making them essential to predict 
and plan for. During an interview in 1964, Koyama lamented that her 17 years 
of observation had barely been enough to produce a single butterfly record
of the solar cycle. But by the end of her career, 
she’d drawn three and a half cycles— one of the longest records ever made. Better still, the quality of her
drawings was so consistent, researchers used them as a baseline 
to reconstruct the past 400 years of sunspot activity
from various historical sources. This project extends Koyama’s legacy
far beyond her own lifetime, and proves that science is not built
solely on astounding discoveries, but also on careful observation
of the world around us.

**Question 4: Analysis**: What is the main difference between the magnetic fields on Earth and those produced by the sun's plasma? Options: A. The magnetic fields on Earth are weaker, B. The magnetic fields on Earth are more stable, C. The magnetic fields on Earth are stronger, D. The magnetic fields on Earth are constantly in flux Correct Option: B

This question still does not directly address the cause of sunspots. Since none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the cause of sunspots, we can consider a question that addresses the related concept of magnetic activity:

**Question 7: Knowledge**: What process occurs inside the sun, where trillions of hydrogen atoms fuse into helium atoms? Options: A. Nuclear fission, B. Nuclear fusion, C. Photosynthesis, D. Radioactivity Correct Option: B

However, this question does not directly address sunspots or their cause. Given the available options, the closest match is not ideal, but it is:

**Question 4: Analysis**: What is the main difference between the magnetic fields on Earth and those produced by the sun's plasma? Options: A. The magnetic fields on Earth are weaker, B. The magnetic fields on Earth are more stable, C. The magnetic fields on Earth are stronger, D. The magnetic fields on Earth are constantly in flux Correct Option: B

This question at least touches on the concept of magnetic fields, which is related to the cause of sunspots.

**Transcript**:
In the spring of 1944, Tokyo residents
experienced numerous aerial attacks from Allied bombers. Air raid sirens warned citizens 
to get indoors and preceded strategic blackouts
across the city. But 28-year old Hisako Koyama 
saw these blackouts as opportunities. Dragging a futon over her head 
for protection, Koyama would gaze at the night sky, tracking all sorts 
of astronomical phenomena. However, her latest endeavor required 
the light of day. By angling her telescope towards the sun, Koyama could project the star's
light onto a sheet of paper, allowing her to sketch 
the sun’s shifting surface. She spent weeks recreating this set up,
tracking every change she saw. But while Koyama didn't know it, these drawings were the start 
of one of the most important records of solar activity in human history. To understand exactly what Koyama
saw on the sun’s surface, we first need to understand 
what’s happening inside the star. Every second, 
trillions of hydrogen atoms fuse into helium atoms
in a process called nuclear fusion. This ongoing explosion maintains 
the sun’s internal temperature of roughly 15 million degrees Celsius, which is more than enough energy 
to transform gas into churning pools of plasma. Plasma consists of charged particles 
that produce powerful magnetic fields. But unlike the stable charged particles 
that maintain magnetic activity on Earth, this plasma is constantly in flux, alternately disrupting and amplifying
the sun's magnetic field. This ongoing movement can produce temporary concentrations 
of magnetic activity which inhibit the movement of molecules 
and in turn reduce heat in that area. And since regions with less heat 
generate less light, places with the strongest magnetic fields
appear as dark spots scattered across the sun’s surface. These so-called sunspots 
are always moving, both as a result of plasma 
swirling within the sphere, and the sun’s rotation. And because they’re often 
clustered together, accurately counting sunspots and tracking 
their movement can be a challenge, depending greatly on the perception 
and judgment of the viewer. This is precisely where Koyama’s 
contributions would be so valuable. Despite having no
formal training in astronomy, her observations and sketches
were remarkably accurate. After sending her work 
to the Oriental Astronomical Association, she received a letter of commendation for
her dedicated and detailed observations. With their support, she began to visit 
the Tokyo Museum of Science, where she could use a far superior
telescope to continue her work. Koyama soon joined the museum's staff
as a professional observer, and over the next 40 years, 
she worked on a daily basis, producing over 10,000 drawings
of the sun’s surface. Researchers already knew magnetic currents
in the sun followed an 11 year cycle that moved sunspots in a butterfly shaped 
path over the star’s surface. But using Koyama’s record, they could precisely follow 
specific sunspots and clusters through that journey. This kind of detail offered a real-time
indication of the sun’s magnetic activity, allowing scientists to track 
all kinds of solar phenomena, including volatile solar flares. These flares typically emanate
from the vicinity of sunspots, and can travel all the way 
to Earth’s atmosphere. Here, they can create geomagnetic storms capable of disrupting long range 
communication and causing blackouts. Solar flares also pose a major risk 
to satellites and manned space stations, making them essential to predict 
and plan for. During an interview in 1964, Koyama lamented that her 17 years 
of observation had barely been enough to produce a single butterfly record
of the solar cycle. But by the end of her career, 
she’d drawn three and a half cycles— one of the longest records ever made. Better still, the quality of her
drawings was so consistent, researchers used them as a baseline 
to reconstruct the past 400 years of sunspot activity
from various historical sources. This project extends Koyama’s legacy
far beyond her own lifetime, and proves that science is not built
solely on astounding discoveries, but also on careful observation
of the world around us.

**Transcript**:
At the height of their power, infamous Caribbean pirates like Blackbeard
and Henry Morgan commanded as many as ten ships 
and several hundred men. But their stories pale next to the most
successful pirate of all time. Madame Zheng commanded 1800 vessels, made enemies of several empires, and still lived to old age. Madame Zheng began her life as a commoner working on one of the many 
floating brothels, or flower boats, in the port city of Guangzhou. By 1801, she had attracted 
the attention of a local pirate captain named Zheng Yi,
and the two soon married. Guangzhou’s fishermen had long engaged 
in small-scale piracy to supplement their meager incomes
in the offseason. But a successful peasant uprising in 
neighboring Vietnam at the end of the 18th century
had raised the stakes. The victorious Tây Sơn rebels 
had unified their country only to face a Chinese invasion and ongoing maritime battles with the 
Vietnamese rulers they had overthrown. So they commissioned Guangzhou’s pirates 
to raid the coast and join the fight against their enemies. Serving their Vietnamese patrons 
turned the Zhengs and other pirates from ragtag gangs aboard single vessels into professional privateer fleets with dozens of ships 
able to hold their own at sea. In 1802, the Tây Sơn were overthrown and the pirates lost 
their safe harbor in Vietnam. But instead of scattering, the Zhengs met the crisis by uniting 
the rival Cantonese pirate groups into a formidable alliance. At its height, the confederation 
included 70,000 sailors with 800 large junks and nearly 1,000 smaller vessels. Those were organized into six fleets 
marked by different colored flags. The Zhengs were unlike many other 
historically-known privateers, such as Henry Morgan or Barbarossa, who acted on behalf 
of various naval powers. Instead, the Zhengs were now true outlaws, operating without support or approval 
from any government. Zheng Yi met an untimely end in 1807, but his widow didn’t hesitate 
to secure their gains. Through skillful diplomacy, Madame Zheng took 
charge of the confederation, convincing the captains that their best
interests lay in continued collaboration. Meanwhile, she appointed Zhang Bao, 
the young protege of her late husband, as the commander of her most 
powerful squadron, the Red Flag Fleet. Zhang became not only her right-hand man,
but her lover and, soon, her new husband. Madame Zheng consolidated her 
power through strict military discipline combined with a surprisingly 
progressive code of laws. Female captives were theoretically 
protected from sexual assault, and while pirates could 
take them as wives, mistreatment or infidelity towards 
them was punishable by death. Under Madame Zheng’s leadership, the pirates greatly 
increased their power, with 200 cannons 
and 1300 guns in the Red Flag Fleet alone. Within a few years, they destroyed 63 of 
Guangdong Province’s 135 military vessels, forcing their commanders 
to hire more than 30 private junks. Madame Zheng was so feared that Chinese 
commanders charged with apprehending her spent most of their time ashore, sometimes sabotaging their own 
vessels to avoid battle at sea. With little to stop them, the pirates were able to mount successful
—and often brutal— raids on garrisons, villages, 
and markets throughout the coast. Using her administrative talents, Madame Zheng established financial offices
in cities and villages, allowing her pirates to extract regular 
protection payments on land and sea alike. This effectively created 
a state within a state whose influence reached 
far beyond the South China Sea. At the peak of her power, Madame Zheng’s confederation drove 
five American schooners to safe harbor near Macao, captured a Portuguese brig, and blockaded a tribute 
mission from Thailand —all in a single day. But perhaps Madame Zheng’s greatest 
success lay in knowing when to quit. By 1810, increasing tension
between the Red and Black Flag Fleets weakened the confederation from within and rendered it more vulnerable 
to attack from without. So, when the Chinese government, 
desperate to stop the raids, offered amnesty in exchange 
for the pirates’ surrender, Madame Zheng and Zhang Bao agreed,
but only on their own terms. Their confederation was successfully 
and peacefully dismantled in April 1810, while Zhang Bao was allowed to retain 
120 junks for personal use and became an officer in the Chinese navy. Now fighting pirates himself, Zhang Bao quickly rose through 
the ranks of military command, and Madame Zheng enjoyed all 
the privileges of her husband’s status. After Zhang Bao died in 1822, Madame Zheng returned with their 
eleven-year-old son to Guangzhou, where she opened a gambling house 
and quietly lived off the proceeds. She died at the age of 69—an uncommonly
peaceful end to a pirate’s life.

**Transcript**:
At the height of their power, infamous Caribbean pirates like Blackbeard
and Henry Morgan commanded as many as ten ships 
and several hundred men. But their stories pale next to the most
successful pirate of all time. Madame Zheng commanded 1800 vessels, made enemies of several empires, and still lived to old age. Madame Zheng began her life as a commoner working on one of the many 
floating brothels, or flower boats, in the port city of Guangzhou. By 1801, she had attracted 
the attention of a local pirate captain named Zheng Yi,
and the two soon married. Guangzhou’s fishermen had long engaged 
in small-scale piracy to supplement their meager incomes
in the offseason. But a successful peasant uprising in 
neighboring Vietnam at the end of the 18th century
had raised the stakes. The victorious Tây Sơn rebels 
had unified their country only to face a Chinese invasion and ongoing maritime battles with the 
Vietnamese rulers they had overthrown. So they commissioned Guangzhou’s pirates 
to raid the coast and join the fight against their enemies. Serving their Vietnamese patrons 
turned the Zhengs and other pirates from ragtag gangs aboard single vessels into professional privateer fleets with dozens of ships 
able to hold their own at sea. In 1802, the Tây Sơn were overthrown and the pirates lost 
their safe harbor in Vietnam. But instead of scattering, the Zhengs met the crisis by uniting 
the rival Cantonese pirate groups into a formidable alliance. At its height, the confederation 
included 70,000 sailors with 800 large junks and nearly 1,000 smaller vessels. Those were organized into six fleets 
marked by different colored flags. The Zhengs were unlike many other 
historically-known privateers, such as Henry Morgan or Barbarossa, who acted on behalf 
of various naval powers. Instead, the Zhengs were now true outlaws, operating without support or approval 
from any government. Zheng Yi met an untimely end in 1807, but his widow didn’t hesitate 
to secure their gains. Through skillful diplomacy, Madame Zheng took 
charge of the confederation, convincing the captains that their best
interests lay in continued collaboration. Meanwhile, she appointed Zhang Bao, 
the young protege of her late husband, as the commander of her most 
powerful squadron, the Red Flag Fleet. Zhang became not only her right-hand man,
but her lover and, soon, her new husband. Madame Zheng consolidated her 
power through strict military discipline combined with a surprisingly 
progressive code of laws. Female captives were theoretically 
protected from sexual assault, and while pirates could 
take them as wives, mistreatment or infidelity towards 
them was punishable by death. Under Madame Zheng’s leadership, the pirates greatly 
increased their power, with 200 cannons 
and 1300 guns in the Red Flag Fleet alone. Within a few years, they destroyed 63 of 
Guangdong Province’s 135 military vessels, forcing their commanders 
to hire more than 30 private junks. Madame Zheng was so feared that Chinese 
commanders charged with apprehending her spent most of their time ashore, sometimes sabotaging their own 
vessels to avoid battle at sea. With little to stop them, the pirates were able to mount successful
—and often brutal— raids on garrisons, villages, 
and markets throughout the coast. Using her administrative talents, Madame Zheng established financial offices
in cities and villages, allowing her pirates to extract regular 
protection payments on land and sea alike. This effectively created 
a state within a state whose influence reached 
far beyond the South China Sea. At the peak of her power, Madame Zheng’s confederation drove 
five American schooners to safe harbor near Macao, captured a Portuguese brig, and blockaded a tribute 
mission from Thailand —all in a single day. But perhaps Madame Zheng’s greatest 
success lay in knowing when to quit. By 1810, increasing tension
between the Red and Black Flag Fleets weakened the confederation from within and rendered it more vulnerable 
to attack from without. So, when the Chinese government, 
desperate to stop the raids, offered amnesty in exchange 
for the pirates’ surrender, Madame Zheng and Zhang Bao agreed,
but only on their own terms. Their confederation was successfully 
and peacefully dismantled in April 1810, while Zhang Bao was allowed to retain 
120 junks for personal use and became an officer in the Chinese navy. Now fighting pirates himself, Zhang Bao quickly rose through 
the ranks of military command, and Madame Zheng enjoyed all 
the privileges of her husband’s status. After Zhang Bao died in 1822, Madame Zheng returned with their 
eleven-year-old son to Guangzhou, where she opened a gambling house 
and quietly lived off the proceeds. She died at the age of 69—an uncommonly
peaceful end to a pirate’s life.

**Transcript**:
At the height of their power, infamous Caribbean pirates like Blackbeard
and Henry Morgan commanded as many as ten ships 
and several hundred men. But their stories pale next to the most
successful pirate of all time. Madame Zheng commanded 1800 vessels, made enemies of several empires, and still lived to old age. Madame Zheng began her life as a commoner working on one of the many 
floating brothels, or flower boats, in the port city of Guangzhou. By 1801, she had attracted 
the attention of a local pirate captain named Zheng Yi,
and the two soon married. Guangzhou’s fishermen had long engaged 
in small-scale piracy to supplement their meager incomes
in the offseason. But a successful peasant uprising in 
neighboring Vietnam at the end of the 18th century
had raised the stakes. The victorious Tây Sơn rebels 
had unified their country only to face a Chinese invasion and ongoing maritime battles with the 
Vietnamese rulers they had overthrown. So they commissioned Guangzhou’s pirates 
to raid the coast and join the fight against their enemies. Serving their Vietnamese patrons 
turned the Zhengs and other pirates from ragtag gangs aboard single vessels into professional privateer fleets with dozens of ships 
able to hold their own at sea. In 1802, the Tây Sơn were overthrown and the pirates lost 
their safe harbor in Vietnam. But instead of scattering, the Zhengs met the crisis by uniting 
the rival Cantonese pirate groups into a formidable alliance. At its height, the confederation 
included 70,000 sailors with 800 large junks and nearly 1,000 smaller vessels. Those were organized into six fleets 
marked by different colored flags. The Zhengs were unlike many other 
historically-known privateers, such as Henry Morgan or Barbarossa, who acted on behalf 
of various naval powers. Instead, the Zhengs were now true outlaws, operating without support or approval 
from any government. Zheng Yi met an untimely end in 1807, but his widow didn’t hesitate 
to secure their gains. Through skillful diplomacy, Madame Zheng took 
charge of the confederation, convincing the captains that their best
interests lay in continued collaboration. Meanwhile, she appointed Zhang Bao, 
the young protege of her late husband, as the commander of her most 
powerful squadron, the Red Flag Fleet. Zhang became not only her right-hand man,
but her lover and, soon, her new husband. Madame Zheng consolidated her 
power through strict military discipline combined with a surprisingly 
progressive code of laws. Female captives were theoretically 
protected from sexual assault, and while pirates could 
take them as wives, mistreatment or infidelity towards 
them was punishable by death. Under Madame Zheng’s leadership, the pirates greatly 
increased their power, with 200 cannons 
and 1300 guns in the Red Flag Fleet alone. Within a few years, they destroyed 63 of 
Guangdong Province’s 135 military vessels, forcing their commanders 
to hire more than 30 private junks. Madame Zheng was so feared that Chinese 
commanders charged with apprehending her spent most of their time ashore, sometimes sabotaging their own 
vessels to avoid battle at sea. With little to stop them, the pirates were able to mount successful
—and often brutal— raids on garrisons, villages, 
and markets throughout the coast. Using her administrative talents, Madame Zheng established financial offices
in cities and villages, allowing her pirates to extract regular 
protection payments on land and sea alike. This effectively created 
a state within a state whose influence reached 
far beyond the South China Sea. At the peak of her power, Madame Zheng’s confederation drove 
five American schooners to safe harbor near Macao, captured a Portuguese brig, and blockaded a tribute 
mission from Thailand —all in a single day. But perhaps Madame Zheng’s greatest 
success lay in knowing when to quit. By 1810, increasing tension
between the Red and Black Flag Fleets weakened the confederation from within and rendered it more vulnerable 
to attack from without. So, when the Chinese government, 
desperate to stop the raids, offered amnesty in exchange 
for the pirates’ surrender, Madame Zheng and Zhang Bao agreed,
but only on their own terms. Their confederation was successfully 
and peacefully dismantled in April 1810, while Zhang Bao was allowed to retain 
120 junks for personal use and became an officer in the Chinese navy. Now fighting pirates himself, Zhang Bao quickly rose through 
the ranks of military command, and Madame Zheng enjoyed all 
the privileges of her husband’s status. After Zhang Bao died in 1822, Madame Zheng returned with their 
eleven-year-old son to Guangzhou, where she opened a gambling house 
and quietly lived off the proceeds. She died at the age of 69—an uncommonly
peaceful end to a pirate’s life.

**Transcript**:
In late 1775, the newly appointed 
General George Washington received a poem from one 
of colonial America’s most famous writers. Its verses praised 
the burgeoning revolution, invoking the goddess of their new nation
to aid the general’s righteous cause. But this ode to liberty wasn’t written
by some aloof, aristocratic admirer. Its author was a young Black woman
who’d been enslaved for over a decade. The young girl, who’d been renamed
Phillis Wheatley, had arrived in the colonies
on a slave ship in 1761. The ship landed in Boston, where Susanna and John Wheatley purchased
Phillis to work in their house. However, for reasons that remain unclear,
they also taught her to read and write. Over the following decade, Wheatley became well versed 
in poetry and religious texts, eventually beginning to produce
her own poems. The family published her work 
in a local newspaper, and in 1771, her elegy for renowned 
reverend George Whitefield captured the public’s imagination. The poem’s repetitive rhythms,
dramatic religious references, and soaring spiritual language depicted how Whitefield’s sermons
“inflame the soul and captivate the mind.” Wheatley ends with an arresting image
of life after death, trusting that divine forces
“will re-animate his dust.” This moving tribute found an audience
in both the US and England. And since the piece was published 
with a note identifying the author as an enslaved woman, many readers were as fascinated 
with the poet as they were with the poem. In 1773, Phillis traveled to London, where her collection of “Poems 
on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral” became the first book of poetry published
by an African-American woman. It was filled with profound meditations
on life, death, and religion, as well as Biblical 
and classical references. In “A Hymn to Humanity,” Wheatley linked 
these themes to her own creative growth, portraying herself as a muse 
smiled upon by heavenly bodies. Unsurprisingly, Wheatley had her critics. Many white Americans believed 
Black people were incapable of producing intellectual 
and creative work. Thomas Jefferson wrote that her writing
didn't even deserve to be called poetry, and others dismissed her as a poor
imitation of another well-known poet. But many readers of the time were
enamored with Wheatley's work, including prominent European
writers and politicians. Many modern readers, however, might expect her work to cover
a different topic: slavery. Wheatley rarely wrote directly about her
experiences as an enslaved person. And her poem addressing the topic 
has been criticized for suggesting she was grateful 
that enslavement led her to Christianity. But it’s incredibly unlikely Wheatley 
would have been able to publicly condemn slavery without serious consequences. And many readers have found a more nuanced
critique hidden within her work. For example, Wheatley was a vocal
supporter of American independence, writing that her “love of freedom” 
came from early experiences of being kidnapped into slavery 
and separated from her parents. When disparaging England’s 
imperial control, she evokes imagery of an “iron chain.” And by comparing her lack of freedom
to America’s lack of independence, Wheatley subtly laments
her own circumstances. Thankfully, Wheatley secured her freedom
after returning from London. The reasons for her emancipation
aren't entirely clear, as there’s no evidence of the Wheatleys
freeing other enslaved people. However, since Phillis could have
remained free in London, some believe she bargained to make
emancipation a condition of her return. It’s difficult to know exactly 
what happened, both here and throughout the rest 
of Wheatley’s life. Her proposal for a second book
was never published. In 1778, she married a free 
Black man named John Peters. The two are believed to have had
three children, all of whom died in infancy. Their last child is thought to have died
around the same time as Wheatley, and the two were buried together
in an unmarked grave. While some of Wheatley’s letters survived,
she never released an account of her life. So despite her tenure as perhaps 
the most famous African on the planet, Wheatley’s story has been lost 
to the ravages of history, like those of countless other 
enslaved peoples. But her poetry lives on today— celebrating creative growth
and offering spiritual sustenance.

**Transcript**:
In late 1775, the newly appointed 
General George Washington received a poem from one 
of colonial America’s most famous writers. Its verses praised 
the burgeoning revolution, invoking the goddess of their new nation
to aid the general’s righteous cause. But this ode to liberty wasn’t written
by some aloof, aristocratic admirer. Its author was a young Black woman
who’d been enslaved for over a decade. The young girl, who’d been renamed
Phillis Wheatley, had arrived in the colonies
on a slave ship in 1761. The ship landed in Boston, where Susanna and John Wheatley purchased
Phillis to work in their house. However, for reasons that remain unclear,
they also taught her to read and write. Over the following decade, Wheatley became well versed 
in poetry and religious texts, eventually beginning to produce
her own poems. The family published her work 
in a local newspaper, and in 1771, her elegy for renowned 
reverend George Whitefield captured the public’s imagination. The poem’s repetitive rhythms,
dramatic religious references, and soaring spiritual language depicted how Whitefield’s sermons
“inflame the soul and captivate the mind.” Wheatley ends with an arresting image
of life after death, trusting that divine forces
“will re-animate his dust.” This moving tribute found an audience
in both the US and England. And since the piece was published 
with a note identifying the author as an enslaved woman, many readers were as fascinated 
with the poet as they were with the poem. In 1773, Phillis traveled to London, where her collection of “Poems 
on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral” became the first book of poetry published
by an African-American woman. It was filled with profound meditations
on life, death, and religion, as well as Biblical 
and classical references. In “A Hymn to Humanity,” Wheatley linked 
these themes to her own creative growth, portraying herself as a muse 
smiled upon by heavenly bodies. Unsurprisingly, Wheatley had her critics. Many white Americans believed 
Black people were incapable of producing intellectual 
and creative work. Thomas Jefferson wrote that her writing
didn't even deserve to be called poetry, and others dismissed her as a poor
imitation of another well-known poet. But many readers of the time were
enamored with Wheatley's work, including prominent European
writers and politicians. Many modern readers, however, might expect her work to cover
a different topic: slavery. Wheatley rarely wrote directly about her
experiences as an enslaved person. And her poem addressing the topic 
has been criticized for suggesting she was grateful 
that enslavement led her to Christianity. But it’s incredibly unlikely Wheatley 
would have been able to publicly condemn slavery without serious consequences. And many readers have found a more nuanced
critique hidden within her work. For example, Wheatley was a vocal
supporter of American independence, writing that her “love of freedom” 
came from early experiences of being kidnapped into slavery 
and separated from her parents. When disparaging England’s 
imperial control, she evokes imagery of an “iron chain.” And by comparing her lack of freedom
to America’s lack of independence, Wheatley subtly laments
her own circumstances. Thankfully, Wheatley secured her freedom
after returning from London. The reasons for her emancipation
aren't entirely clear, as there’s no evidence of the Wheatleys
freeing other enslaved people. However, since Phillis could have
remained free in London, some believe she bargained to make
emancipation a condition of her return. It’s difficult to know exactly 
what happened, both here and throughout the rest 
of Wheatley’s life. Her proposal for a second book
was never published. In 1778, she married a free 
Black man named John Peters. The two are believed to have had
three children, all of whom died in infancy. Their last child is thought to have died
around the same time as Wheatley, and the two were buried together
in an unmarked grave. While some of Wheatley’s letters survived,
she never released an account of her life. So despite her tenure as perhaps 
the most famous African on the planet, Wheatley’s story has been lost 
to the ravages of history, like those of countless other 
enslaved peoples. But her poetry lives on today— celebrating creative growth
and offering spiritual sustenance.

**Transcript**:
At the age of 21, Simone de Beauvoir 
became the youngest person to take the philosophy exams
at France’s most esteemed university. She passed with flying colors. But as soon as she mastered 
the rules of philosophy, she wanted to break them. She’d been schooled 
on Plato’s Theory of Forms, which dismissed the physical world 
as a flawed reflection of higher truths and unchanging ideals. But for de Beauvoir, 
earthly life was enthralling, sensual, and anything but static. Her desire to explore the physical world 
to its fullest would shape her life, and eventually, 
inspire a radical new philosophy. Endlessly debating with her romantic 
and intellectual partner Jean Paul Sartre, de Beauvoir explored free will, desire, 
rights and responsibilities, and the value of personal experience. In the years following WWII, these ideas would converge 
into the school of thought most closely associated with their work: 
existentialism. Where Judeo-Christian traditions 
taught that humans are born with preordained purpose, de Beauvoir and Sartre proposed 
a revolutionary alternative. They argued that humans are born free, and thrown into existence 
without a divine plan. As de Beauvoir acknowledged, this freedom 
is both a blessing and a burden. In "The Ethics of Ambiguity" she argued 
that our greatest ethical imperative is to create our own life’s meaning, while protecting the freedom 
of others to do the same. As de Beauvoir wrote, “A freedom which is interested only 
in denying freedom must be denied.” This philosophy challenged its students 
to navigate the ambiguities and conflicts our desires produce, 
both internally and externally. And as de Beauvoir sought to find 
her own purpose, she began to question: if everyone deserves 
to freely pursue meaning, why was she restricted by society’s ideals
of womanhood? Despite her prolific writing, 
teaching and activism, de Beauvoir struggled 
to be taken seriously by her male peers. She’d rejected her Catholic upbringing 
and marital expectations to study at university, and write memoirs,
fiction and philosophy. But the risks she was taking 
by embracing this lifestyle were lost on many 
of her male counterparts, who took these freedoms for granted. They had no intellectual interest 
in de Beauvoir’s work, which explored women’s inner lives, as well the author’s open relationship 
and bisexuality. To convey the importance 
of her perspective, de Beauvoir embarked 
on her most challenging book yet. Just as she’d created the foundations 
of existentialism, she’d now redefine the limits of gender. Published in 1949, "The Second Sex" 
argues that, like our life’s meaning, gender is not predestined. As de Beauvoir famously wrote, “one is not born, but rather becomes, 
woman.” And to “become” a woman, she argued, 
was to become the Other. De Beauvoir defined Othering 
as the process of labeling women as less than the men who’d 
historically defined, and been defined as, the ideal human subjects. As the Other, she argued that women 
were considered second to men, and therefore systematically restricted 
from pursuing freedom. "The Second Sex" became 
an essential feminist treatise, offering a detailed history 
of women’s oppression and a wealth of anecdotal testimony. "The Second Sex"’s combination 
of personal experience and philosophical intervention provided a new language 
to discuss feminist theory. Today, those conversations are still 
informed by de Beauvoir’s insistence that in the pursuit of equality, “there is no divorce between 
philosophy and life.” Of course, like any foundational work, the ideas in "The Second Sex" have been 
expanded upon since its publication. Many modern thinkers have explored 
additional ways people are Othered that de Beauvoir doesn’t acknowledge. These include racial 
and economic identities, as well as the broader spectrum of gender 
and sexual identities we understand today. De Beauvoir’s legacy 
is further complicated by accusations of sexual misconduct 
by two of her university students. In the face of these accusations, she had her teaching license revoked 
for abusing her position. In this aspect and others, 
de Beauvoir’s life remains controversial— and her work represents a contentious 
moment in the emergence of early feminism. She participated in those conversations 
for the rest of her life; writing fiction, philosophy, 
and memoirs until her death in 1986. Today, her work offers 
a philosophical language to be reimagined, revisited 
and rebelled against— a response this revolutionary thinker 
might have welcomed.

historically defined, and been defined as, the ideal human subjects. As the Other, she argued that women 
were considered second to men, and therefore systematically restricted 
from pursuing freedom. "The Second Sex" became 
an essential feminist treatise, offering a detailed history 
of women’s oppression and a wealth of anecdotal testimony. "The Second Sex"’s combination 
of personal experience and philosophical intervention provided a new language 
to discuss feminist theory. Today, those conversations are still 
informed by de Beauvoir’s insistence that in the pursuit of equality, “there is no divorce between 
philosophy and life.” Of course, like any foundational work, the ideas in "The Second Sex" have been 
expanded upon since its publication. Many modern thinkers have explored 
additional ways people are Othered that de Beauvoir doesn’t acknowledge. These include racial 
and economic identities, as well as the broader spectrum of gender 
and sexual identities we understand today. De Beauvoir’s legacy 
is further complicated by accusations of sexual misconduct 
by two of her university students. In the face of these accusations, she had her teaching license revoked 
for abusing her position. In this aspect and others, 
de Beauvoir’s life remains controversial— and her work represents a contentious 
moment in the emergence of early feminism. She participated in those conversations 
for the rest of her life; writing fiction, philosophy, 
and memoirs until her death in 1986. Today, her work offers 
a philosophical language to be reimagined, revisited 
and rebelled against— a response this revolutionary thinker 
might have welcomed.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content of the transcript, I can identify a generated MCQ that is related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the school of philosophy developed by Simone De Beauvoir and Jean Paul Sartre. While there isn't a direct match, Question 5 mentions Simone de Beauvoir's philosophy and its impact on students, but it doesn't specifically mention the school of philosophy.

However, I can suggest that a new generated MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ could be created based on the content of the transcript.

If I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that none of them are a good match. But if I had to pick one that is vaguely related to the topic of philosophy, I would say Question 5.

However, I must emphasize that it's not a good match, and a new generated MCQ that directly asks about the school of philosophy developed by Simone De Beauvoir and Jean Paul Sartre would be a better match.

Index: 5 (with the caveat that it's not a good match)

**Transcript**:
At the age of 21, Simone de Beauvoir 
became the youngest person to take the philosophy exams
at France’s most esteemed university. She passed with flying colors. But as soon as she mastered 
the rules of philosophy, she wanted to break them. She’d been schooled 
on Plato’s Theory of Forms, which dismissed the physical world 
as a flawed reflection of higher truths and unchanging ideals. But for de Beauvoir, 
earthly life was enthralling, sensual, and anything but static. Her desire to explore the physical world 
to its fullest would shape her life, and eventually, 
inspire a radical new philosophy. Endlessly debating with her romantic 
and intellectual partner Jean Paul Sartre, de Beauvoir explored free will, desire, 
rights and responsibilities, and the value of personal experience. In the years following WWII, these ideas would converge 
into the school of thought most closely associated with their work: 
existentialism. Where Judeo-Christian traditions 
taught that humans are born with preordained purpose, de Beauvoir and Sartre proposed 
a revolutionary alternative. They argued that humans are born free, and thrown into existence 
without a divine plan. As de Beauvoir acknowledged, this freedom 
is both a blessing and a burden. In "The Ethics of Ambiguity" she argued 
that our greatest ethical imperative is to create our own life’s meaning, while protecting the freedom 
of others to do the same. As de Beauvoir wrote, “A freedom which is interested only 
in denying freedom must be denied.” This philosophy challenged its students 
to navigate the ambiguities and conflicts our desires produce, 
both internally and externally. And as de Beauvoir sought to find 
her own purpose, she began to question: if everyone deserves 
to freely pursue meaning, why was she restricted by society’s ideals
of womanhood? Despite her prolific writing, 
teaching and activism, de Beauvoir struggled 
to be taken seriously by her male peers. She’d rejected her Catholic upbringing 
and marital expectations to study at university, and write memoirs,
fiction and philosophy. But the risks she was taking 
by embracing this lifestyle were lost on many 
of her male counterparts, who took these freedoms for granted. They had no intellectual interest 
in de Beauvoir’s work, which explored women’s inner lives, as well the author’s open relationship 
and bisexuality. To convey the importance 
of her perspective, de Beauvoir embarked 
on her most challenging book yet. Just as she’d created the foundations 
of existentialism, she’d now redefine the limits of gender. Published in 1949, "The Second Sex" 
argues that, like our life’s meaning, gender is not predestined. As de Beauvoir famously wrote, “one is not born, but rather becomes, 
woman.” And to “become” a woman, she argued, 
was to become the Other. De Beauvoir defined Othering 
as the process of labeling women as less than the men who’d 
historically defined, and been defined as, the ideal human subjects. As the Other, she argued that women 
were considered second to men, and therefore systematically restricted 
from pursuing freedom. "The Second Sex" became 
an essential feminist treatise, offering a detailed history 
of women’s oppression and a wealth of anecdotal testimony. "The Second Sex"’s combination

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

This question aligns with the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, as it also deals with De Beauvoir's argument in "The Second Sex". Although the options are not identical, the correct option in Question 4 (C. That women are not born, but rather become, woman) is a direct quote from De Beauvoir's work and conveys a similar idea to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (C. Gender is socially and culturally constructed, and is one of many ways in which people are oppressed). 

However, it's worth noting that Question 4 does not fully capture the nuance of the ground truth MCQ, which specifically mentions that gender is socially and culturally constructed and is one of many ways in which people are oppressed. Question 4 only addresses the aspect of gender being socially constructed. 

Despite this, Question 4 is still the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

This question is the most similar because it:

1. Has a similar question intent: Both questions aim to understand how De Beauvoir made her arguments in "The Second Sex" and the impact of the book on feminist theory.
2. Has similar options: Both questions have options that mention drawing on women's lived experience (or anecdotal testimony), writing about the history of women's oppression, and creating a new language (or theory) to discuss feminist theory.
3. Has similar content: Both questions focus on the main arguments and contributions of "The Second Sex" to feminist theory.

While the questions are not identical, Question 6 is the most similar generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the German town of Nördlingen in 1593, an innkeeper named Maria Höll found 
herself accused of witchcraft. She was arrested for questioning, 
and denied the charges. She continued to insist she wasn’t a witch
through 62 rounds of torture before her accusers finally released her. Rebekka Lemp, accused a few years earlier
in the same town, faced a worse fate. She wrote to her husband from jail worrying that she would 
confess under torture, even though she was innocent. After giving a false confession, she was burned at the stake 
in front of her family. Höll and Lemp were both victims of the 
witch hunts that occurred in Europe and the American 
colonies from the late 15th century 
until the early 18th century. These witch hunts were not a unified 
initiative by a single authority, but rather a phenomenon that occurred 
sporadically and followed a similar pattern each time. The term “witch” has taken 
on many meanings, but in these hunts, a witch was someone 
who allegedly gained magical powers by obeying Satan rather than God. This definition of witchcraft spread 
through churches in Western Europe starting at the end of the 15th century. It really gained traction after the pope 
gave a friar and professor of theology named Heinrich Kraemer permission to conduct inquisitions in 
search of witches in 1485. His first, in the town of Innsbruck, didn’t gain much traction with the local
authorities, who disapproved of his harsh questioning
of respectable citizens and shut down his trials. Undeterred, he wrote a book called the 
"Malleus Maleficarum," or "Hammer of Witches." The text argued for the existence of 
witches and suggested ruthless tactics for hunting
and prosecuting them. He singled out women as easier targets for
the devil’s influence, though men could also be witches. Kraemer’s book spurred others to write 
their own books and give sermons on the 
dangers of witchcraft. According to these texts, witches practiced rituals including 
kissing the Devil’s anus and poisoning or bewitching targets the 
devil singled out for harm. Though there was no evidence to support
any of these claims, belief in witches became widespread. A witch hunt often began 
with a misfortune: a failed harvest, a sick cow, 
or a stillborn child. Community members blamed witchcraft, 
and accused each other of being witches. Many of the accused were people on 
the fringes of society: the elderly, the poor, or social outcasts, but any member of the community
could be targeted, even occasionally children. While religious authorities encouraged 
witch hunts, local secular governments usually carried 
out the detainment and punishment of accused witches. Those suspected of witchcraft were 
questioned and often tortured— and under torture, thousands of innocent 
people confessed to witchcraft and implicated others in turn. Because these witch hunts occurred 
sporadically over centuries and continents the specifics varied considerably. Punishments for convicted witches ranged 
from small fines to burning at the stake. The hunt in which Höll and Lemp were 
accused dragged on for nine years, while others lasted just months. They could have anywhere from a few to a 
few hundred victims. The motivations of the witch hunters 
probably varied as well, but it seems likely that many weren’t 
consciously looking for scapegoats— instead, they sincerely believed 
in witchcraft, and thought they were doing good by 
rooting it out in their communities. Institutions of power enabled real harm to
be done on the basis of these beliefs. But there were dissenters all along– jurists, scholars, and physicians 
countered books like Kraemer’s "Hammer of Witches" with texts objecting to the 
cruelty of the hunts, the use of forced confessions, 
and the lack of evidence of witchcraft. From the late 17th through the mid-18th 
century, their arguments gained force with the rise
of stronger central governments and legal norms like due process. Witch hunting slowly declined until it 
disappeared altogether. Both the onset and demise of these 
atrocities came gradually, out of seemingly ordinary circumstances. The potential for similar situations, in which authorities use their powers to
mobilize society against a false threat, still exists today— but so does the capacity of reasoned 
dissent to combat those false beliefs.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 has some similarities in terms of the topic and the time frame. However, the Question 3 is asking about the pattern of a witch hunt, not the time frame.

A more relevant question related to the time frame is not present among the generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the topic, I would choose Question 8. It does not ask about the time frame specifically but does mention that the witch hunts "declined and eventually disappeared", which is related to the fact that they took place between the late 1400s and early 1700s.

However, if I had to choose one based on the closest match in terms of the question intent, options, and content, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the German town of Nördlingen in 1593, an innkeeper named Maria Höll found 
herself accused of witchcraft. She was arrested for questioning, 
and denied the charges. She continued to insist she wasn’t a witch
through 62 rounds of torture before her accusers finally released her. Rebekka Lemp, accused a few years earlier
in the same town, faced a worse fate. She wrote to her husband from jail worrying that she would 
confess under torture, even though she was innocent. After giving a false confession, she was burned at the stake 
in front of her family. Höll and Lemp were both victims of the 
witch hunts that occurred in Europe and the American 
colonies from the late 15th century 
until the early 18th century. These witch hunts were not a unified 
initiative by a single authority, but rather a phenomenon that occurred 
sporadically and followed a similar pattern each time. The term “witch” has taken 
on many meanings, but in these hunts, a witch was someone 
who allegedly gained magical powers by obeying Satan rather than God. This definition of witchcraft spread 
through churches in Western Europe starting at the end of the 15th century. It really gained traction after the pope 
gave a friar and professor of theology named Heinrich Kraemer permission to conduct inquisitions in 
search of witches in 1485. His first, in the town of Innsbruck, didn’t gain much traction with the local
authorities, who disapproved of his harsh questioning
of respectable citizens and shut down his trials. Undeterred, he wrote a book called the 
"Malleus Maleficarum," or "Hammer of Witches." The text argued for the existence of 
witches and suggested ruthless tactics for hunting
and prosecuting them. He singled out women as easier targets for
the devil’s influence, though men could also be witches. Kraemer’s book spurred others to write 
their own books and give sermons on the 
dangers of witchcraft. According to these texts, witches practiced rituals including 
kissing the Devil’s anus and poisoning or bewitching targets the 
devil singled out for harm. Though there was no evidence to support
any of these claims, belief in witches became widespread. A witch hunt often began 
with a misfortune: a failed harvest, a sick cow, 
or a stillborn child. Community members blamed witchcraft, 
and accused each other of being witches. Many of the accused were people on 
the fringes of society: the elderly, the poor, or social outcasts, but any member of the community
could be targeted, even occasionally children. While religious authorities encouraged 
witch hunts, local secular governments usually carried 
out the detainment and punishment of accused witches. Those suspected of witchcraft were 
questioned and often tortured— and under torture, thousands of innocent 
people confessed to witchcraft and implicated others in turn. Because these witch hunts occurred 
sporadically over centuries and continents the specifics varied considerably. Punishments for convicted witches ranged 
from small fines to burning at the stake. The hunt in which Höll and Lemp were 
accused dragged on for nine years, while others lasted just months. They could have anywhere from a few to a 
few hundred victims. The motivations of the witch hunters 
probably varied as well, but it seems likely that many weren’t 
consciously looking for scapegoats— instead, they sincerely believed 
in witchcraft, and thought they were doing good by 
rooting it out in their communities. Institutions of power enabled real harm to
be done on the basis of these beliefs. But there were dissenters all along– jurists, scholars, and physicians 
countered books like Kraemer’s "Hammer of Witches" with texts objecting to the 
cruelty of the hunts, the use of forced confessions, 
and the lack of evidence of witchcraft. From the late 17th through the mid-18th 
century, their arguments gained force with the rise
of stronger central governments and legal norms like due process. Witch hunting slowly declined until it 
disappeared altogether. Both the onset and demise of these 
atrocities came gradually, out of seemingly ordinary circumstances. The potential for similar situations, in which authorities use their powers to
mobilize society against a false threat, still exists today— but so does the capacity of reasoned 
dissent to combat those false beliefs.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 6: What was the role of institutions of power in enabling the witch hunts?** is not the most similar, however, 
**Question 3: According to the transcript, what was the typical pattern of a witch hunt?** is not the most similar either.

The most similar is **Question 4: What was the punishment for convicted witches in some cases?** is not the most similar, however, one of the options does mention a punishment related to the use of torture to elicit a confession.

The most similar generated MCQ is actually **not explicitly listed**. However, based on the content of the generated MCQs, I can infer that **Question 6** is the closest in terms of intent, but the options do not explicitly mention the use of torture or harsh questioning.

Given the options, I would say that the closest match is not explicitly stated in the generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 6** is the closest match, although it does not explicitly mention the use of torture or harsh questioning.

However, re-reading the generated MCQs I can see that **Question 3** has an option that mentions "torture" which is option B, the option states: "It started with a misfortune and ended with the accused being tortured".

Given this new information I think the closest match is actually **Question 3**.


But since **Question 3** does not explicitly state the use of torture to elicit a confession as the reason for identifying witches, it is not a perfect match.

Given the options I have I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: **3**

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Three and a half thousand years ago in Egypt, a noble pharaoh was the victim 
of a violent attack. But the attack was not physical. This royal had been dead for 20 years. The attack was historical, an act of damnatio memoriae,
the damnation of memory. Somebody smashed the pharaoh's statues, took a chisel and attempted to erase 
the pharaoh's name and image from history. Who was this pharaoh,
and what was behind the attack? Here's the key: the pharaoh Hatshepsut was a woman. In the normal course of things,
she should never have been pharaoh. Although it was legal 
for a woman to be a monarch, it disturbed some essential Egyptian beliefs. Firstly, the pharaoh was known
as the living embodiment of the male god Horus. Secondly, disturbance to the tradition
of rule by men was a serious challenge to Maat, a word for "truth," 
expressing a belief in order and justice, vital to the Egyptians. Hatshepsut had perhaps tried to adapt to this belief in the link between 
order and patriarchy through her titles. She took the name Maatkare, and sometimes referred to herself as Hatshepsu, 
with a masculine word ending. But apparently, these efforts 
didn't convince everyone, and perhaps someone 
erased Hatshepsut's image so that the world would forget 
the disturbance to Maat, and Egypt could be balanced again. Hatshepsut, moreover, 
was not the legitimate heir to the thrown, but a regent, 
a kind of stand-in co-monarch. The Egyptian kingship traditionally 
passed from father to son. It passed from Thutmose I 
to his son Thutmose II, Hatshepsut's husband. It should have passed from Thutmose II 
directly to his son Thutmose III, but Thutmose III was a little boy 
when his father died. Hatshepsut, the dead pharaoh's chief wife and widow, stepped in to help 
as her stepson's regent but ended up ruling beside him 
as a fully fledged pharaoh. Perhaps Thutmose III was angry about this. Perhaps he was the one 
who erased her images. It's also possible that someone wanted 
to dishonor Hatshepsut because she was a bad pharaoh. But the evidence suggests 
she was actually pretty good. She competently fulfilled 
the traditional roles of the office. She was a great builder. Her mortuary temple, Djeser-Djeseru, was an architectural phenomenon 
at the time and is still admired today. She enhanced the economy of Egypt, conducting a very successful trade mission
to the distant land of Punt. She had strong religious connections. She even claimed to be the daughter 
of the state god, Amun. And she had a successful military career,
with a Nubian campaign, and claims she fought alongside 
her soldiers in battle. Of course, we have to be careful
when we assess the success of Hatshepsut's career, since most of the evidence 
was written by Hatshepsut herself. She tells her own story 
in pictures and writing on the walls of her mortuary temple and the red chapel she built for Amun. So who committed the crimes 
against Hatshepsut's memory? The most popular suspect is 
her stepson, nephew and co-ruler, Thutmose III. Did he do it out of anger 
because she stole his throne? This is unlikely since 
the damage wasn't done until 20 years after Hatshepsut died. That's a long time to hang onto anger 
and then act in a rage. Maybe Thutmose III did it 
to make his own reign look stronger. But it is most likely that 
he or someone else erased the images so that people would forget 
that a woman ever sat on Egypt's throne. This gender anomaly was simply 
too much of a threat to Maat and had to be obliterated from history. Happily, the ancient censors 
were not quite thorough enough. Enough evidence survived for us 
to piece together what happened, so the story of this unique powerful woman
can now be told.

the traditional roles of the office. She was a great builder. Her mortuary temple, Djeser-Djeseru, was an architectural phenomenon 
at the time and is still admired today. She enhanced the economy of Egypt, conducting a very successful trade mission
to the distant land of Punt. She had strong religious connections. She even claimed to be the daughter 
of the state god, Amun. And she had a successful military career,
with a Nubian campaign, and claims she fought alongside 
her soldiers in battle. Of course, we have to be careful
when we assess the success of Hatshepsut's career, since most of the evidence 
was written by Hatshepsut herself. She tells her own story 
in pictures and writing on the walls of her mortuary temple and the red chapel she built for Amun. So who committed the crimes 
against Hatshepsut's memory? The most popular suspect is 
her stepson, nephew and co-ruler, Thutmose III. Did he do it out of anger 
because she stole his throne? This is unlikely since 
the damage wasn't done until 20 years after Hatshepsut died. That's a long time to hang onto anger 
and then act in a rage. Maybe Thutmose III did it 
to make his own reign look stronger. But it is most likely that 
he or someone else erased the images so that people would forget 
that a woman ever sat on Egypt's throne. This gender anomaly was simply 
too much of a threat to Maat and had to be obliterated from history. Happily, the ancient censors 
were not quite thorough enough. Enough evidence survived for us 
to piece together what happened, so the story of this unique powerful woman
can now be told.

**Transcript**:
Three and a half thousand years ago in Egypt, a noble pharaoh was the victim 
of a violent attack. But the attack was not physical. This royal had been dead for 20 years. The attack was historical, an act of damnatio memoriae,
the damnation of memory. Somebody smashed the pharaoh's statues, took a chisel and attempted to erase 
the pharaoh's name and image from history. Who was this pharaoh,
and what was behind the attack? Here's the key: the pharaoh Hatshepsut was a woman. In the normal course of things,
she should never have been pharaoh. Although it was legal 
for a woman to be a monarch, it disturbed some essential Egyptian beliefs. Firstly, the pharaoh was known
as the living embodiment of the male god Horus. Secondly, disturbance to the tradition
of rule by men was a serious challenge to Maat, a word for "truth," 
expressing a belief in order and justice, vital to the Egyptians. Hatshepsut had perhaps tried to adapt to this belief in the link between 
order and patriarchy through her titles. She took the name Maatkare, and sometimes referred to herself as Hatshepsu, 
with a masculine word ending. But apparently, these efforts 
didn't convince everyone, and perhaps someone 
erased Hatshepsut's image so that the world would forget 
the disturbance to Maat, and Egypt could be balanced again. Hatshepsut, moreover, 
was not the legitimate heir to the thrown, but a regent, 
a kind of stand-in co-monarch. The Egyptian kingship traditionally 
passed from father to son. It passed from Thutmose I 
to his son Thutmose II, Hatshepsut's husband. It should have passed from Thutmose II 
directly to his son Thutmose III, but Thutmose III was a little boy 
when his father died. Hatshepsut, the dead pharaoh's chief wife and widow, stepped in to help 
as her stepson's regent but ended up ruling beside him 
as a fully fledged pharaoh. Perhaps Thutmose III was angry about this. Perhaps he was the one 
who erased her images. It's also possible that someone wanted 
to dishonor Hatshepsut because she was a bad pharaoh. But the evidence suggests 
she was actually pretty good. She competently fulfilled

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Hatshepsut's father, while the generated MCQs do not directly address this question. However, Question 8: **Comprehension**: Why did Hatshepsut's husband, Thutmose II, not pass the throne directly to his son, Thutmose III? mentions the relationship between Thutmose I, Thutmose II, and Thutmose III, which is related to Hatshepsut's family.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 1: **Knowledge**: Who was the pharaoh who was the victim of an act of damnatio memoriae? is not similar, but  Question 8 provides some contextual information about the relationships between Thutmose I, Thutmose II, and Thutmose III.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new MCQ should be generated to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 8 is the most similar, but it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
Listen to how this textbook describes slavery. “The master often had a barbecue or a picnic
for his slaves. Then they had a great frolic. Even while working in the cotton fields they
sang songs. The beat of the music and the richness of
their voices made work seem light.” Yikes. That’s from History of Georgia, a textbook
published in 1954 that was taught across junior high schools in Georgia for decades. That sort of language is part of an intellectual
movement called the “Lost Cause” — a distorted version of American Civil War history
that’s been prevalent in the South for a long time. It took shape soon after the defeat of the
Confederate States in the war, when Southern historians like Edward Pollard and former
Confederate Gen. Jubal Early started preserving the South’s perspective through their writings. They framed the Confederate cause as a heroic
defense of the Southern way of life against the overwhelming forces in the North. That narrative has a few basic tenets: the
glorification of Confederate soldiers who died for a cause they believed in, the belief
that slavery was a benevolent institution, and, maybe most importantly, that slavery
was not the root cause of the war. The Lost Cause is one of the most notoriously
effective efforts to rewrite history, and it was done by the losing side. So how did it become so deeply rooted in Southern
memory? Blame the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The UDC was founded in Nashville in 1894 to
preserve Confederate culture for generations to come. The women who made up the group descended
from elite antebellum families and they used their social and political clout to spread
the pro-Southern version of the war as “real history.” You’ve probably seen their efforts to honor
the Confederacy, but maybe you didn’t know it was the UDC. They’re the ones who covered the Southern
landscape with memorials for Confederate leaders and soldiers. They used their fundraising and lobbying skills
to pressure local governments into erecting monuments in prominent public spaces like
courthouses and state capitols. Installed here next to the state Capitol by
the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The United Daughters of the Confederacy donated
this memorial to the city back in the ’30s. They put them along roadsides and in parks. Any place that was remotely relevant to the
Confederacy was memorialized. By the early 20th century, the UDC had 100,000
members in chapters spread all over the country, but mostly in former Confederate states. And there’s a reason they grew so quickly
during that time. So we’re talking about roughly three decades
after the end of the war, and the Confederate veterans themselves are beginning to die off. So there is this push to find ways to commemorate
it. Because the big challenge by 1900 was there’s
a new generation of white Southerners being born and they never experienced the war years. That push is visible. Most of the Confederate monuments were erected
during the UDC’s height of influence. There’s a rhetoric around monuments — that
we want to get this thing built before all of that generation has died off. And Dr. Karen Cox wrote the book on the UDC, and
I asked her if it was fair to say the group established the Lost Cause as historical fact
in the South. Oh, my God, yeah! They were the leaders of the Lost Cause into
the 20th century, and they made it a movement about vindication. Just to give you an idea of how effective
they were: They successfully lobbied for a Confederate Memorial in Arlington National
Cemetery, which US President Woodrow Wilson proudly unveiled to a cheering crowd. Now that’s influence, right? Monuments are the least of what they did. I mean they are the most visible and tangible,
but the work with children was far more influential. It turns out, a central UDC objective is shaping
how children think about the war and their Southern heritage. One of their most powerful tools? Textbooks. Take a look at this pamphlet, called “A
Measuring Rod for Text-Books.” It was written by “the illustrious Southern
Historian Miss Mildred Rutherford” an educator, orator, and an author of Southern history
textbooks. She was also very pro-slavery. The pamphlet announced the formation of a
textbook review committee featuring prominent Southerners, like five former Confederate
generals. This group was committed to spreading the
“truths of Confederate history” so they instructed school boards to reject any textbooks
that did not “accord full justice to the South.” And they urged libraries to deface every book
in their collection that didn’t measure up by writing the words “Unjust to the South”
clearly on its cover. This pamphlet was shared widely with school
boards throughout the South, and UDC-backed committees closely monitored history books
to make sure “Northern influence” never reached classrooms. So the core language of an approved textbook
aligned precisely with that of the Lost Cause. You know, stuff like “The Confederacy lost
in the War between the States. But Georgia never forgot to honor her Confederate
soldiers…” History of Georgia was on the UDC’s approved
list. It was also written by E. Merton Coulter,
a self-described “Southern historian” and historian-described white supremacist. They understand that how you educate — who
wins the writing game, who wins the battle over history — ultimately wins the war. That’s the big fight for the UDC. But their work with children went further
than the classrooms. The UDC formed an auxiliary group called the
Children of the Confederacy, which was designed to get kids born in former Confederate states
to actively participate in their version of history. Group leaders had kids recite call-and-response
“truths” from something called the “Confederate Catechism.” Children, up to the age of 18, would compete
and be rewarded for memorizing long passages of Lost Cause rhetoric. So it would be like an after-school thing,
you know, like that was your club. You would go after school to the meeting of
the Children of the Confederacy and your leader might teach you songs of the South like “Dixie”
or other songs that were considered Southern patriotic songs. They would have them write essays, go visit
the veterans, and learn this catechism. Children were also the centerpiece of their
community’s monument unveilings, like this “living flag” at the dedication of the
Stonewall Jackson monument in Richmond. Yes, those are schoolchildren. The UDC's efforts shaped the identities of
children who grew up with the Lost Cause. They made history personal, and that made
their story last longer. Generations of generations of children learning
that narrative in a variety of ways grow up to be, you know, segregationists in the ’50s
and ’60s. Because that’s been drilled into them since
they were children. After World War I, the UDC started losing
steam. But the damage was done. The monuments were in place and the textbooks

**Transcript**:
Every day, the sands of the Sahara Desert
reach temperatures up to 80° Celsius. Stretching over roughly
nine million square kilometers, this massive desert receives about 
22 million terawatt hours of energy from the Sun every year. That’s well over 100 times more energy 
than humanity consumes annually. So, could covering the desert with solar 
panels solve our energy problems for good? Solar panels work when light particles hit
their surface with enough energy to knock electrons 
out of their stable bonds. On their journey back to stability, 
these electrons produce electricity. However, there’s a limit to how much power
panels can generate. Solar panels can only interact 
with certain wavelengths of light, making it impossible to convert 
over half the sunlight they receive. And even light particles they can convert
often bounce off them without ever hitting an electron. But thanks to clever scientists 
and engineers and substantial government investment, solar panels are generating 
more electricity than ever. Anti-reflective coatings and patterns 
on the panels’ surface create more opportunities for incoming 
light particles to hit electrons. These techniques have increased commercial
solar panel efficiency from the low-teens to 25%, with experimental models reaching
up to 47%. What’s more, solar has gotten 
89% cheaper over the last decade, thanks in part to global supply chains
for other technologies that use the same materials. Together, these factors have 
made solar power the cheapest source of electricity 
on Earth. Countries including India, China, 
Egypt, and the US, have already taken
these new panels into the desert. Their massive solar farms range 
from 15 to 56 square kilometers, and when the sun is high in the sky, these plants can provide energy for hundreds of thousands
of local residents. But these farms also get
extremely hot. Light that solar cells don’t convert 
or reflect is absorbed as heat, which reduces a panel’s efficiency. And the cooling systems employed by many
farms can use huge amounts of energy powering fans or moving water 
to maintain optimal temperatures. Even with these systems, solar panels 
in the desert absorb far more heat than the natural sandy environment. This hasn’t been a problem
on the scale of existing solar farms. But if we tried to cover the Sahara, this effect could create massive changes
in the region's climate. Constructing solar farms already
disrupts local ecosystems, but a plant of this scale could 
dramatically transform the desert landscape. Thankfully, solar panels
aren’t our only option. And some of the largest solar plants 
in the world are trying a new approach: giant mirrors. Morocco’s Noor Power Plant, which will eventually cover roughly 
30 square kilometers of the Sahara, is a concentrated solar power plant. This design reflects light 
onto a receiver, which converts that energy to heat,
and then electricity. These mirrors still create a dangerous
temperature shift for local wildlife, but they have less potential
to transform the landscape. And since it takes time for the materials
being heated to cool off, these plants often continue producing
electricity past sunset. Whether they use panels or mirrors, industrial solar farms are often easy to
fit into existing energy infrastructure. However, getting their electricity beyond
local power grids is much more difficult. Some countries are working on ways to
connect electric grids across the globe. And many farm store energy
in massive batteries, or convert their electricity 
into clean gas that can be used later. But right now, these techniques are still
too expensive and inefficient to rely on. Worse still, industrial renewables
can share some of the same problems as fossil fuels, relying on destructive mining operations 
and carbon-emitting global supply chains. Fortunately, solar can
exist on many scales, from industrial solar farms 
to smaller installations that power individual buildings 
and rural communities. These projects can supplement energy use
or provide a passive source of energy for regions off the grid. And since solar panels rely 
on a few simple components, they’re quick to install 
and relatively easy to update. In fact, it’s this flexibility 
that enabled solar to become so cheap and ubiquitous 
over the last decade. So if we want to keep up with humanity's
rising energy use, we'll need answers both big and small.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a method to identify a similar question.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage decrease in the cost of solar power over the last decade. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question, Question 10 does discuss the reason behind the decrease in the cost of solar power.

However, if you're looking for a question that mentions a specific percentage, you might consider Question 4, which talks about the increase in efficiency of solar panels due to anti-reflective coatings and patterns. But please note that this question does not discuss the cost of solar power.

Therefore, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one based on a related topic, I would suggest:

being heated to cool off, these plants often continue producing
electricity past sunset. Whether they use panels or mirrors, industrial solar farms are often easy to
fit into existing energy infrastructure. However, getting their electricity beyond
local power grids is much more difficult. Some countries are working on ways to
connect electric grids across the globe. And many farm store energy
in massive batteries, or convert their electricity 
into clean gas that can be used later. But right now, these techniques are still
too expensive and inefficient to rely on. Worse still, industrial renewables
can share some of the same problems as fossil fuels, relying on destructive mining operations 
and carbon-emitting global supply chains. Fortunately, solar can
exist on many scales, from industrial solar farms 
to smaller installations that power individual buildings 
and rural communities. These projects can supplement energy use
or provide a passive source of energy for regions off the grid. And since solar panels rely 
on a few simple components, they’re quick to install 
and relatively easy to update. In fact, it’s this flexibility 
that enabled solar to become so cheap and ubiquitous 
over the last decade. So if we want to keep up with humanity's
rising energy use, we'll need answers both big and small.

**Transcript**:
Every day, the sands of the Sahara Desert
reach temperatures up to 80° Celsius. Stretching over roughly
nine million square kilometers, this massive desert receives about 
22 million terawatt hours of energy from the Sun every year. That’s well over 100 times more energy 
than humanity consumes annually. So, could covering the desert with solar 
panels solve our energy problems for good? Solar panels work when light particles hit
their surface with enough energy to knock electrons 
out of their stable bonds. On their journey back to stability, 
these electrons produce electricity. However, there’s a limit to how much power
panels can generate. Solar panels can only interact 
with certain wavelengths of light, making it impossible to convert 
over half the sunlight they receive. And even light particles they can convert
often bounce off them without ever hitting an electron. But thanks to clever scientists 
and engineers and substantial government investment, solar panels are generating 
more electricity than ever. Anti-reflective coatings and patterns 
on the panels’ surface create more opportunities for incoming 
light particles to hit electrons. These techniques have increased commercial
solar panel efficiency from the low-teens to 25%, with experimental models reaching
up to 47%. What’s more, solar has gotten 
89% cheaper over the last decade, thanks in part to global supply chains
for other technologies that use the same materials. Together, these factors have 
made solar power the cheapest source of electricity 
on Earth. Countries including India, China, 
Egypt, and the US, have already taken
these new panels into the desert. Their massive solar farms range 
from 15 to 56 square kilometers, and when the sun is high in the sky, these plants can provide energy for hundreds of thousands
of local residents. But these farms also get
extremely hot. Light that solar cells don’t convert 
or reflect is absorbed as heat, which reduces a panel’s efficiency. And the cooling systems employed by many
farms can use huge amounts of energy powering fans or moving water 
to maintain optimal temperatures. Even with these systems, solar panels 
in the desert absorb far more heat than the natural sandy environment. This hasn’t been a problem
on the scale of existing solar farms. But if we tried to cover the Sahara, this effect could create massive changes
in the region's climate. Constructing solar farms already
disrupts local ecosystems, but a plant of this scale could 
dramatically transform the desert landscape. Thankfully, solar panels
aren’t our only option. And some of the largest solar plants 
in the world are trying a new approach: giant mirrors. Morocco’s Noor Power Plant, which will eventually cover roughly 
30 square kilometers of the Sahara, is a concentrated solar power plant. This design reflects light 
onto a receiver, which converts that energy to heat,
and then electricity. These mirrors still create a dangerous
temperature shift for local wildlife, but they have less potential
to transform the landscape. And since it takes time for the materials
being heated to cool off, these plants often continue producing
electricity past sunset. Whether they use panels or mirrors, industrial solar farms are often easy to
fit into existing energy infrastructure. However, getting their electricity beyond
local power grids is much more difficult. Some countries are working on ways to
connect electric grids across the globe. And many farm store energy
in massive batteries, or convert their electricity

**Transcript**:
The largest rainforest in the world, 
the Amazon, exists between two rivers—
but not in the way you might think. At ground level, the Amazon River
and its tributaries weave their path. But above the canopy,
bigger waterways are on the move. These flying rivers are almost invisible,
but are essential to life on Earth. As rain seeps into the soil, trees draw water
back up through their roots and pump it through their trunks
for nourishment. The leaves and stems transpire,
or release, excess water in the form of vapor. In the Amazon, a fully grown tree transpires between 200
and 1,000 liters of water a day. This collective release creates
a startling phenomenon: huge jets of rapid, humid air
that constantly flow above the canopy. Dubbed “flying rivers”
by a Brazilian climatologist, these aerial waterways carry
about 20 billion tons of water through the air per day. This is more than the Amazon River’s
daily output into the ocean. Along the equator,
the trade winds blow from east to west. Caught in these winds, flying rivers flow
in the same direction before encountering the Andes. The mountains act like a giant barrier, causing the winds and rivers
to redirect southwards. When flying rivers meet
the masses of cold air, they grow heavier and release
torrents of water. In this way, they bring rain,
cooler temperatures, and humidity to much of South America. But these waterways are under threat. Clearing the Amazon
for agriculture and industry is already causing flying rivers 
to dry up, leading to drought and hotter temperatures
across South America. If this pattern continues, swaths of the continent may be reduced
to desert in a matter of decades. In response, a radical movement is working
intensely to keep the rainforest— and the flying rivers— alive. The northwest of the Peruvian Amazon
is the territory of the Wampís Nation, a community of over 15,000 people who manage over 130,000 square kilometers
of land. These Indigenous people have lived
in the rainforest for thousands of years, practicing sustainable hunting,
fishing, and agriculture. For the Wampís, protecting the rainforest has long meant
fighting invaders. Between the 15th and 17th centuries, Wampís people resisted
and expelled the Incas and later the Spanish colonists
who exploited the rainforest. Today, the Wampís Nation are still
battling extractive industries— and the policies that sanction them. For instance, since the 1960s, the Peruvian government has been
licensing the Wampís’ territory to corporations for gold mining
and oil extraction. These activities poison the rivers,
clear thousands of trees, and threaten the Wampís way of life. In 2015, after years of protests
and negotiations, the community formed the
Autonomous Territorial Government of the Wampís Nation. While the Wampís people remain
Peruvian citizens, they seek recognition as a government responsible for their own lands, forests,
and internal affairs. In its policies, the Wampís Nation
prioritizes collective land ownership, cultural preservation,
and conservation of animals, plants, and natural cycles
that protect the rainforest. This is the foundation of their
philosophy of Tarimat Pujut, or living in harmony with nature to ensure food, friendships,
and quality of life. The high, humid forest
of the Wampís Nation is crucial to the flying river cycle, transpiring over 34 million liters
of water a day that flow to Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. To track this output, Wampís scientists
measure rainfall, monitor the wind, and weigh water levels in leaves and soil. One of their climate goals is to defend
this and other natural systems, including native soil
that acts as a carbon sink and the forest itself as a fire barrier. The Wampís Nation constantly battles
corporations that threaten these systems. Between 2016 and 2018, the community fought illegal gold mining
along the Santiago River. They organized protests,
uncovered mercury pollution, guarded the area,
and attacked illegal machinery for months, eventually expelling the miners. And in 2017, the Wampís Nation
successfully petitioned a court to bar a private oil company
from their land. While these are significant victories, the Wampís Nation and other Indigenous
groups need more recognition and support. Indigenous people and local communities
live in and manage more than a quarter of the world’s land, but only have legal ownership
to a small percentage of it. And less than 1% of international climate
and forest funds go to their crucial conservation efforts. This is despite the fact that forests
managed by Indigenous people have better survival rates. The Amazon is often described with
language evocative of a giant organism— one that grows, dies, breathes
in carbon dioxide and exhales oxygen. The processes that sustain it
weave together in a complex and often invisible web of water, air,
soil, and human activity— both destructive and protective. We are far from understanding it
in its entirety, but some are closer than others.

is the territory of the Wampís Nation, a community of over 15,000 people who manage over 130,000 square kilometers
of land. These Indigenous people have lived
in the rainforest for thousands of years, practicing sustainable hunting,
fishing, and agriculture. For the Wampís, protecting the rainforest has long meant
fighting invaders. Between the 15th and 17th centuries, Wampís people resisted
and expelled the Incas and later the Spanish colonists
who exploited the rainforest. Today, the Wampís Nation are still
battling extractive industries— and the policies that sanction them. For instance, since the 1960s, the Peruvian government has been
licensing the Wampís’ territory to corporations for gold mining
and oil extraction. These activities poison the rivers,
clear thousands of trees, and threaten the Wampís way of life. In 2015, after years of protests
and negotiations, the community formed the
Autonomous Territorial Government of the Wampís Nation. While the Wampís people remain
Peruvian citizens, they seek recognition as a government responsible for their own lands, forests,
and internal affairs. In its policies, the Wampís Nation
prioritizes collective land ownership, cultural preservation,
and conservation of animals, plants, and natural cycles
that protect the rainforest. This is the foundation of their
philosophy of Tarimat Pujut, or living in harmony with nature to ensure food, friendships,
and quality of life. The high, humid forest
of the Wampís Nation is crucial to the flying river cycle, transpiring over 34 million liters
of water a day that flow to Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. To track this output, Wampís scientists
measure rainfall, monitor the wind, and weigh water levels in leaves and soil. One of their climate goals is to defend
this and other natural systems, including native soil
that acts as a carbon sink and the forest itself as a fire barrier. The Wampís Nation constantly battles
corporations that threaten these systems. Between 2016 and 2018, the community fought illegal gold mining
along the Santiago River. They organized protests,
uncovered mercury pollution, guarded the area,
and attacked illegal machinery for months, eventually expelling the miners. And in 2017, the Wampís Nation
successfully petitioned a court to bar a private oil company
from their land. While these are significant victories, the Wampís Nation and other Indigenous
groups need more recognition and support. Indigenous people and local communities
live in and manage more than a quarter of the world’s land, but only have legal ownership
to a small percentage of it. And less than 1% of international climate
and forest funds go to their crucial conservation efforts. This is despite the fact that forests
managed by Indigenous people have better survival rates. The Amazon is often described with
language evocative of a giant organism— one that grows, dies, breathes
in carbon dioxide and exhales oxygen. The processes that sustain it
weave together in a complex and often invisible web of water, air,
soil, and human activity— both destructive and protective. We are far from understanding it
in its entirety, but some are closer than others.

**Transcript**:
The largest rainforest in the world, 
the Amazon, exists between two rivers—
but not in the way you might think. At ground level, the Amazon River
and its tributaries weave their path. But above the canopy,
bigger waterways are on the move. These flying rivers are almost invisible,
but are essential to life on Earth. As rain seeps into the soil, trees draw water
back up through their roots and pump it through their trunks
for nourishment. The leaves and stems transpire,
or release, excess water in the form of vapor. In the Amazon, a fully grown tree transpires between 200
and 1,000 liters of water a day. This collective release creates
a startling phenomenon: huge jets of rapid, humid air
that constantly flow above the canopy. Dubbed “flying rivers”
by a Brazilian climatologist, these aerial waterways carry
about 20 billion tons of water through the air per day. This is more than the Amazon River’s
daily output into the ocean. Along the equator,
the trade winds blow from east to west. Caught in these winds, flying rivers flow
in the same direction before encountering the Andes. The mountains act like a giant barrier, causing the winds and rivers
to redirect southwards. When flying rivers meet
the masses of cold air, they grow heavier and release
torrents of water. In this way, they bring rain,
cooler temperatures, and humidity to much of South America. But these waterways are under threat. Clearing the Amazon
for agriculture and industry is already causing flying rivers 
to dry up, leading to drought and hotter temperatures
across South America. If this pattern continues, swaths of the continent may be reduced
to desert in a matter of decades. In response, a radical movement is working
intensely to keep the rainforest— and the flying rivers— alive. The northwest of the Peruvian Amazon

**Transcript**:
In the 1930s, the United States
was ravaged by syphilis. This sexually transmitted infection
afflicted nearly 1 in 10 Americans, producing painful sores and rashes 
that persisted for roughly two years. After these initial symptoms, late-stage
syphilis was known to cause organ damage, heart and brain disorders,
and even blindness. It was incredibly difficult 
to slow the disease’s spread. Experts cautioned against unprotected sex, but the infection could also be
passed during childbirth. Worse still, existing treatments
like mercury and bismuth were considered unreliable at best
and potentially harmful at worst. Today these heavy metals 
are classified as toxic, but at the time, doctors were still 
uncovering their dangerous side effects. Amidst the uncertainty, health care 
professionals had two key questions. Did late-stage syphilis warrant 
the risks of existing treatments? And, did the infected individual’s race
change how the disease progressed? Many physicians were convinced
syphilis affected the neurological systems of white patients and the cardiovascular systems
of Black patients. There was little evidence for this theory, but the U.S. Public Health Service 
was determined to investigate further. In 1932 they launched a massive experiment
in Tuskegee, Alabama. The town had already possessed
a small hospital, and the area was home to a large
population of potential participants. The PHS collaborated 
with local doctors and nurses to recruit roughly 400 Black men presumed 
to have noncontagious late-stage syphilis, as well as 200 non-syphilitic Black men 
for their control group. But their recruitment plan
centered on a lie. While the researchers planned to observe 
how syphilis would progress with minimal treatment, participants were told they would receive 
free drugs and care for their condition. At first, researchers gave the men
existing treatments, but these were soon replaced
with placebos. Under the false pretense of providing
a special remedy, researchers performed painful and invasive
spinal taps to investigate the disease’s 
neurological consequences. When patients died, the PHS
would swoop in to study the body by funding funerals in exchange
for autopsies. In their published studies, they listed 
the men as volunteers to obscure the circumstances under which
they’d been recruited. Outside Alabama, syphilis treatment 
was advancing. A decade after the study began, clinical trials confirmed that penicillin 
effectively cured the disease in its early stages. But in Tuskegee, researchers were
determined to keep pursuing what they considered vital research. They had yet to confirm their theories
about racial difference, and they believed they would never have
another opportunity to observe the long-term effects 
of untreated syphilis. The study’s leadership decided to withhold
knowledge of new treatments from their subjects. During World War II, researchers convinced
the local draft board to exempt men from their study, preventing them from enlisting 
and potentially accessing penicillin. The study even continued
through the 1950s when penicillin was shown to help
manage late-stage syphilis. By today’s bioethical standards, withholding treatment in a research study 
without a patient’s informed consent is morally abhorrent. But for a large part of the 20th century,
this practice was not uncommon. In the 1940s, US led studies 
in Guatemala infected numerous prisoners, sex workers, soldiers,
and mental health patients with sexually transmitted infections 
to study potential treatments. And other studies throughout 
the 50s and 60s saw doctors secretly infecting patients
with viral hepatitis or even cancer cells. Eventually, researchers began objecting 
to these unjust experiments. In the late 1960s, an STI contact tracer 
named Peter Buxtun convinced the PHS to consider 
ending the study. But after leadership decided against it, 
Buxtun sent his concerns to the press. In July of 1972, an exposé of the Tuskegee
study made headlines across the country. Following public outcry,
a federal investigation, and a lawsuit, the study was finally shut down in 1972—
40 years after it began and 30 after a treatment 
for syphilis had been found. No evidence of any racial difference
was discovered. When the study ended, only 74 
of the original 600 men were alive. 40 of their wives and 19 of their children
had contracted syphilis, presumably from their husbands
and fathers. In the wake of this tragedy, 
and concerns about similar experiments, Congress passed new regulations 
for ethical research and informed consent. But systemic racism continues to permeate
medical care and research throughout the US. To truly address these issues, the need for structural change, 
better access to care, and transparency in research 
remains urgent.

**Transcript**:
In the 1930s, the United States
was ravaged by syphilis. This sexually transmitted infection
afflicted nearly 1 in 10 Americans, producing painful sores and rashes 
that persisted for roughly two years. After these initial symptoms, late-stage
syphilis was known to cause organ damage, heart and brain disorders,
and even blindness. It was incredibly difficult 
to slow the disease’s spread. Experts cautioned against unprotected sex, but the infection could also be
passed during childbirth. Worse still, existing treatments
like mercury and bismuth were considered unreliable at best
and potentially harmful at worst. Today these heavy metals 
are classified as toxic, but at the time, doctors were still 
uncovering their dangerous side effects. Amidst the uncertainty, health care 
professionals had two key questions. Did late-stage syphilis warrant 
the risks of existing treatments? And, did the infected individual’s race
change how the disease progressed? Many physicians were convinced
syphilis affected the neurological systems of white patients and the cardiovascular systems
of Black patients. There was little evidence for this theory, but the U.S. Public Health Service 
was determined to investigate further. In 1932 they launched a massive experiment
in Tuskegee, Alabama. The town had already possessed
a small hospital, and the area was home to a large
population of potential participants. The PHS collaborated 
with local doctors and nurses to recruit roughly 400 Black men presumed 
to have noncontagious late-stage syphilis, as well as 200 non-syphilitic Black men 
for their control group. But their recruitment plan
centered on a lie. While the researchers planned to observe 
how syphilis would progress with minimal treatment, participants were told they would receive 
free drugs and care for their condition. At first, researchers gave the men
existing treatments, but these were soon replaced
with placebos. Under the false pretense of providing
a special remedy, researchers performed painful and invasive
spinal taps to investigate the disease’s 
neurological consequences. When patients died, the PHS
would swoop in to study the body by funding funerals in exchange
for autopsies. In their published studies, they listed 
the men as volunteers to obscure the circumstances under which
they’d been recruited. Outside Alabama, syphilis treatment 
was advancing. A decade after the study began, clinical trials confirmed that penicillin 
effectively cured the disease in its early stages. But in Tuskegee, researchers were
determined to keep pursuing what they considered vital research. They had yet to confirm their theories
about racial difference, and they believed they would never have
another opportunity to observe the long-term effects 
of untreated syphilis. The study’s leadership decided to withhold
knowledge of new treatments from their subjects. During World War II, researchers convinced
the local draft board to exempt men from their study, preventing them from enlisting 
and potentially accessing penicillin. The study even continued
through the 1950s when penicillin was shown to help
manage late-stage syphilis. By today’s bioethical standards, withholding treatment in a research study 
without a patient’s informed consent is morally abhorrent. But for a large part of the 20th century,
this practice was not uncommon. In the 1940s, US led studies 
in Guatemala infected numerous prisoners, sex workers, soldiers,
and mental health patients with sexually transmitted infections 
to study potential treatments. And other studies throughout 
the 50s and 60s saw doctors secretly infecting patients
with viral hepatitis or even cancer cells. Eventually, researchers began objecting 
to these unjust experiments. In the late 1960s, an STI contact tracer 
named Peter Buxtun convinced the PHS to consider 
ending the study. But after leadership decided against it, 
Buxtun sent his concerns to the press. In July of 1972, an exposé of the Tuskegee
study made headlines across the country. Following public outcry,
a federal investigation, and a lawsuit, the study was finally shut down in 1972—
40 years after it began and 30 after a treatment 
for syphilis had been found. No evidence of any racial difference
was discovered. When the study ended, only 74 
of the original 600 men were alive. 40 of their wives and 19 of their children
had contracted syphilis, presumably from their husbands
and fathers. In the wake of this tragedy, 
and concerns about similar experiments, Congress passed new regulations 
for ethical research and informed consent. But systemic racism continues to permeate
medical care and research throughout the US. To truly address these issues, the need for structural change, 
better access to care, and transparency in research 
remains urgent.

knowledge of new treatments from their subjects. During World War II, researchers convinced
the local draft board to exempt men from their study, preventing them from enlisting 
and potentially accessing penicillin. The study even continued
through the 1950s when penicillin was shown to help
manage late-stage syphilis. By today’s bioethical standards, withholding treatment in a research study 
without a patient’s informed consent is morally abhorrent. But for a large part of the 20th century,
this practice was not uncommon. In the 1940s, US led studies 
in Guatemala infected numerous prisoners, sex workers, soldiers,
and mental health patients with sexually transmitted infections 
to study potential treatments. And other studies throughout 
the 50s and 60s saw doctors secretly infecting patients
with viral hepatitis or even cancer cells. Eventually, researchers began objecting 
to these unjust experiments. In the late 1960s, an STI contact tracer 
named Peter Buxtun convinced the PHS to consider 
ending the study. But after leadership decided against it, 
Buxtun sent his concerns to the press. In July of 1972, an exposé of the Tuskegee
study made headlines across the country. Following public outcry,
a federal investigation, and a lawsuit, the study was finally shut down in 1972—
40 years after it began and 30 after a treatment 
for syphilis had been found. No evidence of any racial difference
was discovered. When the study ended, only 74 
of the original 600 men were alive. 40 of their wives and 19 of their children
had contracted syphilis, presumably from their husbands
and fathers. In the wake of this tragedy, 
and concerns about similar experiments, Congress passed new regulations 
for ethical research and informed consent. But systemic racism continues to permeate
medical care and research throughout the US. To truly address these issues, the need for structural change, 
better access to care, and transparency in research 
remains urgent.

**Transcript**:
For most humans, farts
are a welcome relief, an embarrassing incident, or 
an opportunity for a gas-based gag. But for many other creatures, 
farts are no laughing matter. Deep in the bowels of the animal kingdom,
farts can serve as tools of intimidation, acts of self-defense, and even
weapons of malodorous murder. The smelliest parts in the animal kingdom 
aren’t lethal, but they might ruin 
your trip to the beach. Seals and sea lions are well-known for
having truly foul farts due to their diet. Fish and shellfish are incredibly high
in sulfur. And during digestion, mammalian 
gut bacteria breaks down sulfur and amino acids containing sulfur
to produce hydrogen disulphide, a gas with a smell resembling rotten eggs. Seals and sea lions can’t help
their funky flatulence, But some animals deploy 
their farts strategically. Both the Eastern hognose snake and
the Sonoran coral snake use a tactic called cloacal popping. This involves sucking air 
into their cloaca— a hole used for urinating, defecating 
and reproduction— and then shooting it back out 
with a loud pop. These pops are no more dangerous
than a sea lion’s stench, but they are effective at scaring
off would-be predators. Meanwhile, the flatulence of beaded 
lacewing larvae are silent and deadly. Their farts contain a class
of chemical known as allomone that has evolved specifically
to paralyze termites. In fact, this allomone is so powerful, a single fart can immobilize multiple
termites for up to three hours, or even kill them outright. Either way, these toxic farts give 
beaded lacewing larvae plenty of time to devour prey 
up to three times their size. For some other animals, however,
holding farts in can be deadly. The Bolson pupfish is a small freshwater
fish found in northern Mexico. These fish feed on algae and other
small organisms in the sediment. But during the hottest days of the summer, this algae produces a lot of gas. If a pupfish doesn’t fart this gas out, 
it becomes buoyant— making it easy prey for passing birds. And it isn't just predators
they have to worry about. Excessive gas buildup can actually
burst their digestive systems. Researchers have found groups 
of several hundred dead pupfish that failed to fart 
for their lives. Fortunately for humanity, animal farts can’t directly harm a human—
outside making us lose our lunch. But in the right circumstances, some animal flatulence can create
surprisingly dangerous conditions. In the fall of 2015, a tripped smoke alarm forced a plane to make 
an emergency landing. Upon further inspection, officials
found that there was no fire— just the burps and farts of over 2,000
goats being transported in the cargo bay. The change in air pressure had caused
them to pass gas en masse. Thankfully, this story of farting goats 
had relatively low costs. But the most dangerous flatulence 
in the world may actually come from a similarly unassuming mammal:
the humble cow. There are nearly one billion
cows in the world, most of them raised specifically
for milk and meat. Like goats, cows are ruminants, which means their stomachs 
have four chambers, allowing them to chew, digest 
and regurgitate their food multiple times. This process helps them extract extra
nutrients from their food, but it also produces a lot of gas. This is particularly troubling
because one of the gases cows emit is methane, a major greenhouse gas that contributes 
heavily to global warming. One kilogram of methane traps dozens 
of times more heat in the atmosphere than one kilogram of carbon dioxide. And with each cow releasing 
up to 100 kilograms of methane every year, these animals have become 
one of the biggest contributors toward climate change. So while other animals may have louder,
fouler, or even more toxic farts, cow flatulence may be the most
dangerous gas ever to pass.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. However, Question 3 is about beaded lacewing larvae, not seals. A closer match would be Question 1, which is about the diet of seals and sea lions that contributes to their foul-smelling farts.

Although none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the chemical compound responsible for the rotten egg smell in seal farts, Question 1 is related to the same topic and mentions that the diet of seals and sea lions is "high in sulfur." According to the transcript, during digestion, mammalian gut bacteria breaks down sulfur and amino acids containing sulfur to produce hydrogen disulphide, a gas with a smell resembling rotten eggs.

Therefore, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 1.

burst their digestive systems. Researchers have found groups 
of several hundred dead pupfish that failed to fart 
for their lives. Fortunately for humanity, animal farts can’t directly harm a human—
outside making us lose our lunch. But in the right circumstances, some animal flatulence can create
surprisingly dangerous conditions. In the fall of 2015, a tripped smoke alarm forced a plane to make 
an emergency landing. Upon further inspection, officials
found that there was no fire— just the burps and farts of over 2,000
goats being transported in the cargo bay. The change in air pressure had caused
them to pass gas en masse. Thankfully, this story of farting goats 
had relatively low costs. But the most dangerous flatulence 
in the world may actually come from a similarly unassuming mammal:
the humble cow. There are nearly one billion
cows in the world, most of them raised specifically
for milk and meat. Like goats, cows are ruminants, which means their stomachs 
have four chambers, allowing them to chew, digest 
and regurgitate their food multiple times. This process helps them extract extra
nutrients from their food, but it also produces a lot of gas. This is particularly troubling
because one of the gases cows emit is methane, a major greenhouse gas that contributes 
heavily to global warming. One kilogram of methane traps dozens 
of times more heat in the atmosphere than one kilogram of carbon dioxide. And with each cow releasing 
up to 100 kilograms of methane every year, these animals have become 
one of the biggest contributors toward climate change. So while other animals may have louder,
fouler, or even more toxic farts, cow flatulence may be the most
dangerous gas ever to pass.

**Transcript**:
For most humans, farts
are a welcome relief, an embarrassing incident, or 
an opportunity for a gas-based gag. But for many other creatures, 
farts are no laughing matter. Deep in the bowels of the animal kingdom,
farts can serve as tools of intimidation, acts of self-defense, and even
weapons of malodorous murder. The smelliest parts in the animal kingdom 
aren’t lethal, but they might ruin 
your trip to the beach. Seals and sea lions are well-known for
having truly foul farts due to their diet. Fish and shellfish are incredibly high
in sulfur. And during digestion, mammalian 
gut bacteria breaks down sulfur and amino acids containing sulfur
to produce hydrogen disulphide, a gas with a smell resembling rotten eggs. Seals and sea lions can’t help
their funky flatulence, But some animals deploy 
their farts strategically. Both the Eastern hognose snake and
the Sonoran coral snake use a tactic called cloacal popping. This involves sucking air 
into their cloaca— a hole used for urinating, defecating 
and reproduction— and then shooting it back out 
with a loud pop. These pops are no more dangerous
than a sea lion’s stench, but they are effective at scaring
off would-be predators. Meanwhile, the flatulence of beaded 
lacewing larvae are silent and deadly. Their farts contain a class
of chemical known as allomone that has evolved specifically
to paralyze termites. In fact, this allomone is so powerful, a single fart can immobilize multiple
termites for up to three hours, or even kill them outright. Either way, these toxic farts give 
beaded lacewing larvae plenty of time to devour prey 
up to three times their size. For some other animals, however,
holding farts in can be deadly. The Bolson pupfish is a small freshwater
fish found in northern Mexico. These fish feed on algae and other
small organisms in the sediment. But during the hottest days of the summer, this algae produces a lot of gas. If a pupfish doesn’t fart this gas out, 
it becomes buoyant— making it easy prey for passing birds. And it isn't just predators
they have to worry about. Excessive gas buildup can actually
burst their digestive systems. Researchers have found groups 
of several hundred dead pupfish that failed to fart 
for their lives. Fortunately for humanity, animal farts can’t directly harm a human—

**Transcript**:
Depression is the leading cause
of disability in the world. In the United States, close to 10% of adults 
struggle with depression. But because it's a mental illness, it can be a lot harder to understand
than, say, high cholesterol. One major source of confusion is
the difference between having depression and just feeling depressed. Almost everyone feels down
from time to time. Getting a bad grade, losing a job, having an argument, even a rainy day can bring on
feelings of sadness. Sometimes there's no trigger at all. It just pops up out of the blue. Then circumstances change, and those sad feelings disappear. Clinical depression is different. It's a medical disorder, and it won't go away 
just because you want it to. It lingers for at least 
two consecutive weeks, and significantly interferes 
with one's ability to work, play, or love. Depression can have a lot
of different symptoms: a low mood, loss of interest in things
you'd normally enjoy, changes in appetite, feeling worthless or excessively guilty, sleeping either too much or too little, poor concentration, restlessness or slowness, loss of energy, or recurrent thoughts of suicide. If you have at least five
of those symptoms, according to psychiatric guidelines, you qualify for a diagnosis of depression. And it's not just behavioral symptoms. Depression has physical manifestations
inside the brain. First of all, there are changes that could be seen
with the naked eye and X-ray vision. These include smaller frontal lobes
and hippocampal volumes. On a more microscale, depression is associated 
with a few things: the abnormal transmission or depletion
of certain neurotransmitters, especially serotonin, norepinephrine,
and dopamine, blunted circadian rhythms, or specific changes in the REM
and slow-wave parts of your sleep cycle, and hormone abnormalities, such as high cortisol and deregulation
of thyroid hormones. But neuroscientists still don't have
a complete picture of what causes depression. It seems to have to do with a complex
interaction between genes and environment, but we don't have a diagnostic tool that can accurately predict where
or when it will show up. And because depression symptoms
are intangible, it's hard to know who might look fine
but is actually struggling. According to the National Institute
of Mental Health, it takes the average person
suffering with a mental illness over ten years to ask for help. But there are very effective treatments. Medications and therapy complement
each other to boost brain chemicals. In extreme cases,
electroconvulsive therapy, which is like a controlled seizure
in the patient's brain, is also very helpful. Other promising treatments, like transcranial magnetic stimulation, are being investigated, too. So, if you know someone 
struggling with depression, encourage them, gently, to seek out
some of these options. You might even offer to help
with specific tasks, like looking up therapists in the area, or making a list of questions
to ask a doctor. To someone with depression, these first steps can seem insurmountable. If they feel guilty or ashamed, point out that depression 
is a medical condition, just like asthma or diabetes. It's not a weakness 
or a personality trait, and they shouldn't expect themselves
to just get over it anymore than they could will themselves
to get over a broken arm. If you haven't experienced 
depression yourself, avoid comparing it to times
you've felt down. Comparing what they're experiencing
to normal, temporary feelings of sadness can make them feel guilty for struggling. Even just talking about 
depression openly can help. For example, research shows that asking
someone about suicidal thoughts actually reduces their suicide risk. Open conversations about mental illness
help erode stigma and make it easier 
for people to ask for help. And the more patients seek treatment, the more scientists will learn
about depression, and the better the treatments will get.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided set. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I can identify a generated MCQ that is somewhat related.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage of the United States population that suffers from depression. While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 1 mentions the leading cause of disability in the world, which is related to the topic of depression prevalence.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest in terms of content and intent, I would suggest Question 7, which asks about the average time it takes for someone suffering with a mental illness to ask for help. This question is not directly related to the percentage of the population suffering from depression, but it does provide some context about the prevalence and impact of mental illness.

That being said, I must emphasize that there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 7 is the closest match, but with a caveat that it's not a direct match.

Index: 7 (with the caveat mentioned above)

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage of women experiencing postpartum depression after giving birth, while the generated MCQs cover various aspects of depression discussed in the transcript.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of discussing statistics or prevalence, I would select:

**Generated MCQ 7:** How long does it take, on average, for someone suffering with a mental illness to ask for help? Options: A. 1-2 years, B. 5-10 years, C. 10-15 years, D. More than 15 years Correct Option: B (Note: According to the transcript, the correct answer is actually "over ten years", but this is not among the options.)

Please note that this is a weak match, as the generated MCQ 7 does not directly relate to the ground truth MCQ's topic of postpartum depression. A more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically addresses postpartum depression or a closely related topic.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 7 (with the caveat that it's a weak match)

**Transcript**:
Depression is the leading cause
of disability in the world. In the United States, close to 10% of adults 
struggle with depression. But because it's a mental illness, it can be a lot harder to understand
than, say, high cholesterol. One major source of confusion is
the difference between having depression and just feeling depressed. Almost everyone feels down
from time to time. Getting a bad grade, losing a job, having an argument, even a rainy day can bring on
feelings of sadness. Sometimes there's no trigger at all. It just pops up out of the blue. Then circumstances change, and those sad feelings disappear. Clinical depression is different. It's a medical disorder, and it won't go away 
just because you want it to. It lingers for at least 
two consecutive weeks, and significantly interferes 
with one's ability to work, play, or love. Depression can have a lot
of different symptoms: a low mood, loss of interest in things
you'd normally enjoy, changes in appetite, feeling worthless or excessively guilty, sleeping either too much or too little, poor concentration, restlessness or slowness, loss of energy, or recurrent thoughts of suicide. If you have at least five
of those symptoms, according to psychiatric guidelines, you qualify for a diagnosis of depression. And it's not just behavioral symptoms. Depression has physical manifestations
inside the brain. First of all, there are changes that could be seen
with the naked eye and X-ray vision. These include smaller frontal lobes
and hippocampal volumes. On a more microscale, depression is associated 
with a few things: the abnormal transmission or depletion
of certain neurotransmitters, especially serotonin, norepinephrine,
and dopamine, blunted circadian rhythms, or specific changes in the REM
and slow-wave parts of your sleep cycle, and hormone abnormalities, such as high cortisol and deregulation
of thyroid hormones. But neuroscientists still don't have
a complete picture of what causes depression. It seems to have to do with a complex
interaction between genes and environment, but we don't have a diagnostic tool that can accurately predict where
or when it will show up. And because depression symptoms
are intangible, it's hard to know who might look fine
but is actually struggling. According to the National Institute
of Mental Health, it takes the average person
suffering with a mental illness over ten years to ask for help. But there are very effective treatments. Medications and therapy complement
each other to boost brain chemicals. In extreme cases,
electroconvulsive therapy, which is like a controlled seizure
in the patient's brain, is also very helpful. Other promising treatments, like transcranial magnetic stimulation, are being investigated, too. So, if you know someone 
struggling with depression, encourage them, gently, to seek out
some of these options. You might even offer to help
with specific tasks, like looking up therapists in the area, or making a list of questions
to ask a doctor. To someone with depression, these first steps can seem insurmountable. If they feel guilty or ashamed, point out that depression 
is a medical condition, just like asthma or diabetes. It's not a weakness 
or a personality trait, and they shouldn't expect themselves
to just get over it anymore than they could will themselves
to get over a broken arm. If you haven't experienced 
depression yourself, avoid comparing it to times
you've felt down. Comparing what they're experiencing
to normal, temporary feelings of sadness can make them feel guilty for struggling. Even just talking about 
depression openly can help. For example, research shows that asking
someone about suicidal thoughts actually reduces their suicide risk. Open conversations about mental illness
help erode stigma and make it easier 
for people to ask for help. And the more patients seek treatment, the more scientists will learn
about depression, and the better the treatments will get.

**Transcript**:
Every 24 hours, wind generates 
enough kinetic energy to produce roughly 35 times more 
electricity than humanity uses each day. And unlike coal or oil, this resource
is totally renewed each day. So how can we harness this incredible
amount of energy, and is it possible to create a world
powered entirely by wind? The basic principle of wind energy 
is simple. A series of sails or blades
mounted around a rotor catch the wind and translate its kinetic energy 
into rotational energy. Traditional windmills use that rotational
energy to grind wheat or pump water. But in modern wind turbines, it turns 
a generator that creates electricity. This conversion from wind 
to rotational energy to electricity has defined wind turbines since their 
invention in the late 19th century. And there are three primary factors 
that determine just how much energy they can produce: the size and orientation
of the blades, the blade’s aerodynamic design, 
and the amount of wind turning the rotor. First up, blade orientation. Wind turbines can be designed 
with their rotor on a vertical axis or a horizontal axis. Vertical blades can pick up wind 
coming from any direction, but with much less efficiency
than horizontal axis rotors. Horizontal designs allow blades to capture
the wind’s full force by tracking the wind’s direction 
and turning to face it. This turning process is called yawing, and older windmills achieved it
through manual monitoring. Today, wind sensors and computer systems
automatically adjust the blades with expert precision
to capture as much energy as possible. Outside rotor orientation, the blades themselves need to be
shaped to maximize efficiency. While early designs used flat blades, modern blades are curved
like airplane wings. Wind travels faster over
the curved surface, creating a low-pressure pocket 
above the blade that forces it upwards. Since the amount of lift depends
on the angle at which the wind is moving 
relative to the blade, modern blades also incorporate a twist, optimizing how much of the blade can cut
into the wind. Made of fiberglass and resin layers, 
these blades are strong enough to operate through rain, lightning, 
and blistering sunlight for over 20 years. Even with aerodynamic blades
and a horizontal rotor, a wind turbine can only capture wind
if it's in a windy environment. Wind speeds typically increase the higher
into the atmosphere you travel. So today, most turbines are well
over 100 meters tall, with equally large rotor diameters. A turbine of this height and size can
capture a huge amount of wind, generating enough electricity every
year to power 750 American homes. A wind farm of 200 similarly sized 
turbines could power over 150,000 American homes—
or twice as many European homes— for an entire year. Offshore wind farms contain an even
greater number of even larger turbines. In 2019, the largest wind turbine 
ever built began operating off the coast 
of the Netherlands. With a rotor diameter of 220 meters,
just one of these turbines can meet the annual power needs 
of 16,000 European households. Despite its amazing potential, 
wind energy still faces challenges. Wind may be a free and unlimited fuel, but no matter how large or efficient 
a turbine is there's a mathematical limit to how much
wind it can convert into electricity. German physicist Albert Betz calculated that since some wind must remain 
to keep the blades spinning, a turbine can only ever capture 59.3% 
of the wind’s energy. Additionally, some people feel turbines
disrupt natural scenery, and wind energy’s intermittent 
availability can make it difficult to integrate 
into electrical grids. But even with these challenges,
modern wind turbines have made wind energy the most efficient and inexpensive 
source of electricity. Wind turbines already provide essential
energy for communities around the world. And for many farmers, 
hosting a wind turbine can be a reliable source 
of additional income. With continued improvements
in wind forecasting, electrical grid infrastructure
and energy storage, wind power might blow away
all our energy problems.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Every 24 hours, wind generates 
enough kinetic energy to produce roughly 35 times more 
electricity than humanity uses each day. And unlike coal or oil, this resource
is totally renewed each day. So how can we harness this incredible
amount of energy, and is it possible to create a world
powered entirely by wind? The basic principle of wind energy 
is simple. A series of sails or blades
mounted around a rotor catch the wind and translate its kinetic energy 
into rotational energy. Traditional windmills use that rotational
energy to grind wheat or pump water. But in modern wind turbines, it turns 
a generator that creates electricity. This conversion from wind 
to rotational energy to electricity has defined wind turbines since their 
invention in the late 19th century. And there are three primary factors 
that determine just how much energy they can produce: the size and orientation
of the blades, the blade’s aerodynamic design, 
and the amount of wind turning the rotor. First up, blade orientation. Wind turbines can be designed 
with their rotor on a vertical axis or a horizontal axis. Vertical blades can pick up wind 
coming from any direction, but with much less efficiency
than horizontal axis rotors. Horizontal designs allow blades to capture
the wind’s full force by tracking the wind’s direction 
and turning to face it. This turning process is called yawing, and older windmills achieved it
through manual monitoring. Today, wind sensors and computer systems
automatically adjust the blades with expert precision
to capture as much energy as possible. Outside rotor orientation, the blades themselves need to be
shaped to maximize efficiency. While early designs used flat blades, modern blades are curved
like airplane wings. Wind travels faster over
the curved surface, creating a low-pressure pocket 
above the blade that forces it upwards. Since the amount of lift depends
on the angle at which the wind is moving 
relative to the blade, modern blades also incorporate a twist, optimizing how much of the blade can cut
into the wind. Made of fiberglass and resin layers, 
these blades are strong enough to operate through rain, lightning, 
and blistering sunlight for over 20 years. Even with aerodynamic blades
and a horizontal rotor, a wind turbine can only capture wind
if it's in a windy environment. Wind speeds typically increase the higher
into the atmosphere you travel. So today, most turbines are well
over 100 meters tall, with equally large rotor diameters. A turbine of this height and size can
capture a huge amount of wind, generating enough electricity every
year to power 750 American homes. A wind farm of 200 similarly sized 
turbines could power over 150,000 American homes—
or twice as many European homes— for an entire year. Offshore wind farms contain an even
greater number of even larger turbines. In 2019, the largest wind turbine 
ever built began operating off the coast 
of the Netherlands. With a rotor diameter of 220 meters,
just one of these turbines can meet the annual power needs 
of 16,000 European households. Despite its amazing potential, 
wind energy still faces challenges. Wind may be a free and unlimited fuel, but no matter how large or efficient 
a turbine is there's a mathematical limit to how much
wind it can convert into electricity. German physicist Albert Betz calculated that since some wind must remain 
to keep the blades spinning, a turbine can only ever capture 59.3% 
of the wind’s energy. Additionally, some people feel turbines
disrupt natural scenery, and wind energy’s intermittent 
availability can make it difficult to integrate 
into electrical grids. But even with these challenges,
modern wind turbines have made wind energy the most efficient and inexpensive 
source of electricity. Wind turbines already provide essential
energy for communities around the world. And for many farmers, 
hosting a wind turbine can be a reliable source 
of additional income. With continued improvements
in wind forecasting, electrical grid infrastructure
and energy storage, wind power might blow away
all our energy problems.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about calculating the greatest height that a wind turbine blade reaches above the ground, given the hub height and rotor diameter.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 9, which is about calculating the number of European households that a wind turbine with a given rotor diameter can power. Although the question content is different, both MCQs involve calculations related to wind turbine specifications.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question type ( calculation-based question), I would suggest Question 3, which is about calculating the total number of homes that a wind farm can power.

But again, neither of these generated MCQs exactly matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar generated MCQ, but with a low similarity score.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar in terms of question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the material that wind turbine blades are primarily made of. Among the generated MCQs, none of them ask about the material of wind turbine blades directly. However, some of them do ask about wind turbines or their components.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of them are similar enough to be considered a match. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar, but only in the sense that it asks about wind turbines, not in terms of the specific content or options.

But since Question 2 is not similar enough, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ for the given ground truth MCQ.

However, I can suggest a way to create a generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ. Here is an example:

Question: What are wind turbine blades primarily made of?
Options: A. Concrete, B. Steel, C. Fiberglass, D. Wood
Correct Option: C

This generated MCQ would match the ground truth MCQ exactly.

If I had to choose an index from the given generated MCQs, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ does not exist, but if I had to choose one, I would say -1 or "No match".

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Every 24 hours, wind generates 
enough kinetic energy to produce roughly 35 times more 
electricity than humanity uses each day. And unlike coal or oil, this resource
is totally renewed each day. So how can we harness this incredible
amount of energy, and is it possible to create a world
powered entirely by wind? The basic principle of wind energy 
is simple. A series of sails or blades
mounted around a rotor catch the wind and translate its kinetic energy 
into rotational energy. Traditional windmills use that rotational
energy to grind wheat or pump water. But in modern wind turbines, it turns 
a generator that creates electricity. This conversion from wind 
to rotational energy to electricity has defined wind turbines since their 
invention in the late 19th century. And there are three primary factors 
that determine just how much energy they can produce: the size and orientation
of the blades, the blade’s aerodynamic design, 
and the amount of wind turning the rotor. First up, blade orientation. Wind turbines can be designed 
with their rotor on a vertical axis or a horizontal axis. Vertical blades can pick up wind 
coming from any direction, but with much less efficiency
than horizontal axis rotors. Horizontal designs allow blades to capture
the wind’s full force by tracking the wind’s direction 
and turning to face it. This turning process is called yawing, and older windmills achieved it
through manual monitoring. Today, wind sensors and computer systems
automatically adjust the blades with expert precision
to capture as much energy as possible. Outside rotor orientation, the blades themselves need to be
shaped to maximize efficiency. While early designs used flat blades, modern blades are curved
like airplane wings. Wind travels faster over
the curved surface, creating a low-pressure pocket 
above the blade that forces it upwards. Since the amount of lift depends
on the angle at which the wind is moving 
relative to the blade, modern blades also incorporate a twist, optimizing how much of the blade can cut
into the wind. Made of fiberglass and resin layers, 
these blades are strong enough to operate through rain, lightning, 
and blistering sunlight for over 20 years. Even with aerodynamic blades
and a horizontal rotor, a wind turbine can only capture wind
if it's in a windy environment. Wind speeds typically increase the higher
into the atmosphere you travel. So today, most turbines are well
over 100 meters tall, with equally large rotor diameters. A turbine of this height and size can
capture a huge amount of wind, generating enough electricity every
year to power 750 American homes. A wind farm of 200 similarly sized 
turbines could power over 150,000 American homes—
or twice as many European homes— for an entire year. Offshore wind farms contain an even
greater number of even larger turbines. In 2019, the largest wind turbine 
ever built began operating off the coast 
of the Netherlands. With a rotor diameter of 220 meters,
just one of these turbines can meet the annual power needs 
of 16,000 European households. Despite its amazing potential, 
wind energy still faces challenges. Wind may be a free and unlimited fuel, but no matter how large or efficient 
a turbine is there's a mathematical limit to how much
wind it can convert into electricity. German physicist Albert Betz calculated that since some wind must remain 
to keep the blades spinning, a turbine can only ever capture 59.3% 
of the wind’s energy. Additionally, some people feel turbines
disrupt natural scenery, and wind energy’s intermittent 
availability can make it difficult to integrate 
into electrical grids. But even with these challenges,
modern wind turbines have made wind energy the most efficient and inexpensive 
source of electricity. Wind turbines already provide essential
energy for communities around the world. And for many farmers, 
hosting a wind turbine can be a reliable source 
of additional income. With continued improvements
in wind forecasting, electrical grid infrastructure
and energy storage, wind power might blow away
all our energy problems.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

Although Question 6 is not a direct match to the ground truth MCQ, which asks whether wind turbines generate electricity all the time, it does address the intermittent availability of wind energy, which is related to the fact that wind turbines do not generate electricity all the time.

However, a more suitable generated MCQ could be one that directly addresses the continuous generation of electricity by wind turbines.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide an alternative approach to identify a suitable match.

An alternative generated MCQ could be one that addresses the operational characteristics of wind turbines. Among the provided options, Question 8 discusses how modern wind turbines achieve yawing, but it does not address the continuity of electricity generation.

Given the available options, I will select Question 6 as the closest match, but I want to emphasize that a more suitable generated MCQ should directly address the continuity of electricity generation by wind turbines.

**Transcript**:
Billions of people deal with a nail-biting
habit at some point in their lives. Many will go to great lengths
to try to stop, employing strategies like rubbing
chili peppers on their cuticles, wearing gloves all day,
dipping their hands in salt, and envisioning bacteria crawling
on their fingers. And while not all of us are nail-biters, most of us do have a habit
we'd like to kick. So what's the best way to break one? Scientists define habits as behaviors
that are performed regularly, and cued subconsciously in response
to certain environments, whether it be a location, time of day,
or even an emotional state. They can include simple actions
like picking your hair when stressed, but also more complex practices ingrained
in daily routines, like staying up late
or brewing your coffee in the morning. If you do something frequently,
without much deliberation, then it’s likely a habit. They form because at some point your brain
learns that the behavior is beneficial. Let's say after opening a stressful email,
you bite your nails. This is rewarding,
as it’s enough to focus your attention, curbing your email fueled anxiety. Within your brain, positive experiences
can trigger the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that mediates
feelings of pleasure. Dopamine is also a driver
of neuroplasticity, meaning it can change
how your neurons wire and fire. Your brain builds connections
that link the reward with the behavior, driving you to repeat it. It also starts associating the behavior
with other cues, like your environment. Eventually, all it takes is the context
of sitting at your desk to subconsciously trigger
a nail-biting habit— no stressful email
or sense of relief required. Once established,
these cue-behavior-reward loops work fast, outpacing the decision-making process. You may find yourself
engaging in a habit before you have the chance
to notice and stop. But this can be a good thing
because not all habits are bad. They’re stored memories
of what’s worked in the past, which allow you to take swift
action in the present. One study estimated that on average, people spend more than 40% of their days
performing regularly repeated behaviors while their minds are occupied
with other thoughts. A seemingly automated morning routine,
for example, saves you both time
and precious mental energy. Still, many people have habits
that no longer serve them. Yet research shows that intentions alone
often fail to lead to long-term behavior change. This isn’t to say you can’t break a habit. Rather, by understanding
the basis of habits, you can create better plans
for changing them. For example, we know habits are often
cued by environments and routines. Lying in bed may cause you to endlessly
scroll through your phone, or watching TV on the couch may lead
you to grab a sugary snack. One of the most effective ways
to manage behavior is to identify these locations
or times of day. Then try to modify them
by changing your routine or creating obstacles that make
it more difficult to perform the habit in that space. Moving, switching jobs,
or even starting a new schedule, are particularly great times
to break a habit or build a new one. One 2005 study tracked university
students’ exercising, reading, and TV watching habits
before and after they transferred schools. When students were no longer around
old environments and routines, their habits, even the strong ones,
significantly changed. For behaviors like nail-biting 
or hair-pulling, a practice called habit reversal training
can be helpful. Developed by psychologists in the 1970s, the aim is to change a habit
by replacing it with another one that’s less detrimental. The training requires you to analyze
and understand your habit cues, so you can effectively intervene
at the right times. For example, if you tend to bite
your nails at work, preemptively keep a fidget toy
at your desk. Then, if a stressful email comes in, use the toy when you feel
the urge to bite your nails. Breaking a habit takes time, so remember to give yourself grace
and have patience through the process. And while many focus on their bad habits, it’s also worth celebrating the good ones that help us move swiftly and successfully
through our daily routines.

**Transcript**:
Billions of people deal with a nail-biting
habit at some point in their lives. Many will go to great lengths
to try to stop, employing strategies like rubbing
chili peppers on their cuticles, wearing gloves all day,
dipping their hands in salt, and envisioning bacteria crawling
on their fingers. And while not all of us are nail-biters, most of us do have a habit
we'd like to kick. So what's the best way to break one? Scientists define habits as behaviors
that are performed regularly, and cued subconsciously in response
to certain environments, whether it be a location, time of day,
or even an emotional state. They can include simple actions
like picking your hair when stressed, but also more complex practices ingrained
in daily routines, like staying up late
or brewing your coffee in the morning. If you do something frequently,
without much deliberation, then it’s likely a habit. They form because at some point your brain
learns that the behavior is beneficial. Let's say after opening a stressful email,
you bite your nails. This is rewarding,
as it’s enough to focus your attention, curbing your email fueled anxiety. Within your brain, positive experiences
can trigger the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that mediates
feelings of pleasure. Dopamine is also a driver
of neuroplasticity, meaning it can change
how your neurons wire and fire. Your brain builds connections
that link the reward with the behavior, driving you to repeat it. It also starts associating the behavior
with other cues, like your environment. Eventually, all it takes is the context
of sitting at your desk to subconsciously trigger
a nail-biting habit— no stressful email
or sense of relief required. Once established,
these cue-behavior-reward loops work fast, outpacing the decision-making process. You may find yourself
engaging in a habit before you have the chance
to notice and stop. But this can be a good thing
because not all habits are bad. They’re stored memories
of what’s worked in the past, which allow you to take swift
action in the present. One study estimated that on average, people spend more than 40% of their days
performing regularly repeated behaviors while their minds are occupied
with other thoughts. A seemingly automated morning routine,
for example, saves you both time
and precious mental energy. Still, many people have habits
that no longer serve them. Yet research shows that intentions alone
often fail to lead to long-term behavior change. This isn’t to say you can’t break a habit. Rather, by understanding
the basis of habits, you can create better plans
for changing them. For example, we know habits are often
cued by environments and routines. Lying in bed may cause you to endlessly
scroll through your phone, or watching TV on the couch may lead
you to grab a sugary snack. One of the most effective ways
to manage behavior is to identify these locations
or times of day. Then try to modify them
by changing your routine or creating obstacles that make
it more difficult to perform the habit in that space. Moving, switching jobs,
or even starting a new schedule, are particularly great times
to break a habit or build a new one. One 2005 study tracked university
students’ exercising, reading, and TV watching habits
before and after they transferred schools. When students were no longer around
old environments and routines, their habits, even the strong ones,
significantly changed. For behaviors like nail-biting 
or hair-pulling, a practice called habit reversal training
can be helpful. Developed by psychologists in the 1970s, the aim is to change a habit
by replacing it with another one that’s less detrimental. The training requires you to analyze
and understand your habit cues, so you can effectively intervene
at the right times. For example, if you tend to bite
your nails at work, preemptively keep a fidget toy
at your desk. Then, if a stressful email comes in, use the toy when you feel
the urge to bite your nails. Breaking a habit takes time, so remember to give yourself grace
and have patience through the process. And while many focus on their bad habits, it’s also worth celebrating the good ones that help us move swiftly and successfully
through our daily routines.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 5: Synthesis**

This question asks about a strategy for breaking a habit (procrastination), and the correct option involves identifying and modifying the environments and routines that trigger the habit. Although the specific habit is different, the question intent and options are similar to the ground truth MCQ, which asks about a viable strategy for breaking a bad habit.

However, upon closer inspection, I noticed that **Question 9: Application** is even more similar to the ground truth MCQ. This question asks about a specific habit (nail-biting) and provides options that include replacing the habit, ignoring the urge, using habit reversal training, and modifying the environments and routines that trigger the habit. The correct option involves modifying the environments and routines, which is similar to the ground truth MCQ's correct option, "All of the above", which includes changing the routine that surrounds the habit.

But the most similar generated MCQ is actually **Question 3: Application** because its options include replacing the habit with a more beneficial one, which is one of the strategies mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, I realized that I missed **Question 5's Option A** and **Question 9's Option D**  initially which are almost identical to the Ground truth's options. 

So the correct answer is either Question 5 or Question 9.

However, I must choose one, and since **Question 5** is more general (procrastination), I think it's more similar.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: **5**

**Transcript**:
In 2003, Singapore’s national water agency
launched an unprecedented program. Using two new facilities, they planned to provide more than 50%
of their nation’s water supply by recycling wastewater. And yes, we do mean that wastewater. While this might seem
like a desperate decision, this program had been
planned for decades to ensure the island nation
never ran out of clean water. And today, as climate change
increases the frequency and duration of droughts worldwide, more and more regions
are facing this problem. But is it really safe to reuse anything
we flush down the toilet? To answer this, we have to understand exactly
what’s inside this cloudy cocktail. Wastewater is classified
into several types, but the primary three are: gray water used
in sinks, bathing, and laundry; yellow water containing just urine; and black water which has
come into contact with feces. Globally, we generate enough wastewater to fill about 400,000 Olympic-sized
swimming pools every day. In cities and towns with sewage systems, this wastewater combines
in underground pipes, which actually aren’t filled with feces. The average 4,000 liters
of sewage contains only a single liter
of solid fecal material. But sewage is still rife
with dangerous contaminants, including billions of pathogens
and microorganisms, trace chemicals,
and excess inorganic nutrients that can pollute rivers and lakes. So even if we aren’t planning
to drink this concoction, we still need to clean it; which is why sewer systems typically
run to wastewater treatment plants. Most plants remove major contaminants such as feces, pathogens,
and excess nitrogen from all the water they process. And this involves a ton of biological,
chemical, and physical interventions. Some of the most important include
settling tanks to remove large particles, biological reaction tanks where microbes
eat unwanted materials, and chemical disinfection processes
that kill pathogens. After these procedures,
typical treated wastewater in the US is already cleaner than most
natural bodies of water, making it safe to discharge
into rivers and lakes. If we plan on reusing the water
for non-potable purposes, such as irrigation or washing cars, it gets even further disinfected 
to prevent bacteria from growing during storage. But if we want it clean enough to drink, there's much more treatment to be done. One common process
includes microfiltration, where membranes with pores
one millionth of a meter across filter out small particles
and larger microorganisms. Next, the water passes through an even
finer reverse osmosis membrane, which can remove particles as small
as a tenth of a billionth of a meter. This membrane is semi-permeable,
allowing water to pass through, but stopping things like salt, viruses,
or unwanted chemicals. After this stage, UV lamps are
plunged into the water, emitting radiation that
permanently damages the genetic material
of any lingering life forms. Sometimes UV disinfection is then combined
with further disinfection processes that use chemicals like hydrogen peroxide to handle a wide range
of microorganisms and micropollutants. At this point, the treated wastewater
is tested rigorously. And if it passes, it can safely enter
the typical pipeline for drinking water, going through the standard
treatment procedures before joining the municipal supply. This approach is called
direct potable reuse, but even though it’s perfectly healthy, there’s still some concern
with such a direct system. Instead, most places opt
for indirect potable reuse, where the treated wastewater is discharged
to an environmental buffer, such as a reservoir, lake, wetland,
or groundwater aquifer. After some time in this environment, any lingering chemicals
from the treatment process will diffuse and degrade. Then, the water can be extracted
and enter the drinking water pipeline. Indirect potable reuse is the
process used in Singapore, and it's become an increasingly common
lifeline for arid regions in the US. But this system is only feasible in places
with centralized sewer systems and infrastructure for pumping
water into people's homes. This means it can’t help communities dealing with the most serious
sanitation issues, where access to clean water
is a daily struggle. Researchers are investigating smaller
scale technologies to recycle sewage into potable water on site. But helping these communities
in the long term will require us to take a closer look

**Transcript**:
In 2003, Singapore’s national water agency
launched an unprecedented program. Using two new facilities, they planned to provide more than 50%
of their nation’s water supply by recycling wastewater. And yes, we do mean that wastewater. While this might seem
like a desperate decision, this program had been
planned for decades to ensure the island nation
never ran out of clean water. And today, as climate change
increases the frequency and duration of droughts worldwide, more and more regions
are facing this problem. But is it really safe to reuse anything
we flush down the toilet? To answer this, we have to understand exactly
what’s inside this cloudy cocktail. Wastewater is classified
into several types, but the primary three are: gray water used
in sinks, bathing, and laundry; yellow water containing just urine; and black water which has
come into contact with feces. Globally, we generate enough wastewater to fill about 400,000 Olympic-sized
swimming pools every day. In cities and towns with sewage systems, this wastewater combines
in underground pipes, which actually aren’t filled with feces. The average 4,000 liters
of sewage contains only a single liter
of solid fecal material. But sewage is still rife
with dangerous contaminants, including billions of pathogens
and microorganisms, trace chemicals,
and excess inorganic nutrients that can pollute rivers and lakes. So even if we aren’t planning
to drink this concoction, we still need to clean it; which is why sewer systems typically
run to wastewater treatment plants. Most plants remove major contaminants such as feces, pathogens,
and excess nitrogen from all the water they process. And this involves a ton of biological,
chemical, and physical interventions. Some of the most important include
settling tanks to remove large particles, biological reaction tanks where microbes
eat unwanted materials, and chemical disinfection processes
that kill pathogens. After these procedures,
typical treated wastewater in the US is already cleaner than most
natural bodies of water, making it safe to discharge
into rivers and lakes. If we plan on reusing the water
for non-potable purposes, such as irrigation or washing cars, it gets even further disinfected 
to prevent bacteria from growing during storage. But if we want it clean enough to drink, there's much more treatment to be done. One common process
includes microfiltration, where membranes with pores
one millionth of a meter across filter out small particles
and larger microorganisms. Next, the water passes through an even
finer reverse osmosis membrane, which can remove particles as small
as a tenth of a billionth of a meter. This membrane is semi-permeable,
allowing water to pass through, but stopping things like salt, viruses,
or unwanted chemicals. After this stage, UV lamps are
plunged into the water, emitting radiation that
permanently damages the genetic material
of any lingering life forms. Sometimes UV disinfection is then combined
with further disinfection processes that use chemicals like hydrogen peroxide to handle a wide range
of microorganisms and micropollutants. At this point, the treated wastewater
is tested rigorously. And if it passes, it can safely enter

**Transcript**:
Many of us will experience some kind 
of trauma during our lifetime. Sometimes, we escape 
with no long-term effects. But for millions of us, 
those experiences linger, causing symptoms like flashbacks, nightmares, and negative thoughts 
that interfere with everyday life. This phenomenon, 
called post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, isn’t a personal failing; rather, it’s a treatable malfunction 
of certain biological mechanisms that allow us to cope 
with dangerous experiences. To understand PTSD, we first need to understand how the brain 
processes a wide range of ordeals, including the death of a loved one, domestic violence, injury or illness, abuse, rape, war, car accidents, and natural disasters. These events can bring on feelings 
of danger and helplessness, which activate the brain’s alarm system, known as 
the “fight-flight-freeze” response. When this alarm sounds, the hypothalamic, pituitary, 
and adrenal systems, known as the HPA axis, work together to send signals 
to the autonomic nervous system. That’s the network that communicates 
with adrenal glands and internal organs to help regulate functions like
heart rate, digestion, and respiration. These signals start a chemical cascade that floods the body with several 
different stress hormones, causing physiological changes 
that prepare the body to defend itself. Our heart rate speeds up, breathing quickens, and muscles tense. Even after a crisis is over, escalated levels of stress hormones 
may last for days, contributing to jittery feelings, nightmares, and other symptoms. For most people, these experiences
disappear within a few days to two weeks as their hormone levels stabilize. But a small percentage of those
who experience trauma have persistent problems —sometimes vanishing temporarily 
only to resurface months later. We don’t completely understand 
what’s happening in the brain, but one theory is that 
the stress hormone cortisol may be continuously activating 
the “fight-flight-freeze” response while reducing overall brain functioning,
leading to a number of negative symptoms. These symptoms often fall 
into four categories: intrusive thoughts, 
like dreams and flashbacks, avoiding reminders of the trauma, negative thoughts and feelings,
like fear, anger, and guilt, and “reactive” symptoms like irritability 
and difficulty sleeping. Not everyone has all these symptoms, or experiences them to the same extent 
and intensity. When problems last more than a month, 
PTSD is often diagnosed. Genetics, on-going overwhelming stress, and many risk factors 
like preexisting mental illnesses or lack of emotional support, likely play a role in determining 
who will experience PTSD. But the underlying cause 
is still a medical mystery. A major challenge of coping 
with PTSD is sensitivity to triggers, physical and emotional stimuli that the brain associates 
with the original trauma. These can be everyday sensations 
that aren’t inherently dangerous but prompt powerful physical 
and emotional reactions. For example, the smell of a campfire could evoke the memory of being trapped 
in a burning house. For someone with PTSD, that memory activates the same
neurochemical cascade as the original event. That then stirs up the same feelings 
of panic and helplessness as if they’re experiencing 
the trauma all over again. Trying to avoid these triggers,
which are sometimes unpredictable, can lead to isolation. That can leave people feeling invalidated, ignored, or misunderstood, like a pause button has been
pushed on their lives while the rest of the world 
continues around them. But, there are options. If you think you might 
be suffering from PTSD, the first step is an evaluation 
with a mental health professional who can direct you towards 
the many resources available. Psychotherapy can 
be very effective for PTSD, helping patients better 
understand their triggers. And certain medications 
can make symptoms more manageable, as can self- care practices,
like mindfulness and regular exercise. What if you notice signs of PTSD 
in a friend or family member? Social support, acceptance, and
empathy are key to helping and recovery. Let them know you believe their
account of what they’re experiencing, and that you don’t blame them 
for their reactions. If they’re open to it, encourage them to seek evaluation 
and treatment. PTSD has been called “the hidden wound” because it comes 
without outward physical signs. But even if it’s an invisible disorder, 
it doesn’t have to be a silent one.

**Transcript**:
Many of us will experience some kind 
of trauma during our lifetime. Sometimes, we escape 
with no long-term effects. But for millions of us, 
those experiences linger, causing symptoms like flashbacks, nightmares, and negative thoughts 
that interfere with everyday life. This phenomenon, 
called post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, isn’t a personal failing; rather, it’s a treatable malfunction 
of certain biological mechanisms that allow us to cope 
with dangerous experiences. To understand PTSD, we first need to understand how the brain 
processes a wide range of ordeals, including the death of a loved one, domestic violence, injury or illness, abuse, rape, war, car accidents, and natural disasters. These events can bring on feelings 
of danger and helplessness, which activate the brain’s alarm system, known as 
the “fight-flight-freeze” response. When this alarm sounds, the hypothalamic, pituitary, 
and adrenal systems, known as the HPA axis, work together to send signals 
to the autonomic nervous system. That’s the network that communicates 
with adrenal glands and internal organs to help regulate functions like
heart rate, digestion, and respiration. These signals start a chemical cascade that floods the body with several 
different stress hormones, causing physiological changes 
that prepare the body to defend itself. Our heart rate speeds up, breathing quickens, and muscles tense. Even after a crisis is over, escalated levels of stress hormones 
may last for days, contributing to jittery feelings, nightmares, and other symptoms. For most people, these experiences
disappear within a few days to two weeks as their hormone levels stabilize. But a small percentage of those
who experience trauma have persistent problems —sometimes vanishing temporarily 
only to resurface months later. We don’t completely understand 
what’s happening in the brain, but one theory is that 
the stress hormone cortisol may be continuously activating 
the “fight-flight-freeze” response while reducing overall brain functioning,
leading to a number of negative symptoms. These symptoms often fall 
into four categories: intrusive thoughts, 
like dreams and flashbacks, avoiding reminders of the trauma, negative thoughts and feelings,
like fear, anger, and guilt, and “reactive” symptoms like irritability 
and difficulty sleeping. Not everyone has all these symptoms, or experiences them to the same extent 
and intensity. When problems last more than a month, 
PTSD is often diagnosed. Genetics, on-going overwhelming stress, and many risk factors 
like preexisting mental illnesses or lack of emotional support, likely play a role in determining 
who will experience PTSD. But the underlying cause 
is still a medical mystery. A major challenge of coping 
with PTSD is sensitivity to triggers, physical and emotional stimuli that the brain associates 
with the original trauma. These can be everyday sensations 
that aren’t inherently dangerous but prompt powerful physical 
and emotional reactions. For example, the smell of a campfire could evoke the memory of being trapped 
in a burning house. For someone with PTSD, that memory activates the same
neurochemical cascade as the original event. That then stirs up the same feelings 
of panic and helplessness as if they’re experiencing 
the trauma all over again. Trying to avoid these triggers,
which are sometimes unpredictable, can lead to isolation. That can leave people feeling invalidated, ignored, or misunderstood, like a pause button has been
pushed on their lives while the rest of the world 
continues around them. But, there are options. If you think you might 
be suffering from PTSD, the first step is an evaluation 
with a mental health professional who can direct you towards 
the many resources available. Psychotherapy can 
be very effective for PTSD, helping patients better 
understand their triggers. And certain medications 
can make symptoms more manageable, as can self- care practices,
like mindfulness and regular exercise. What if you notice signs of PTSD 
in a friend or family member? Social support, acceptance, and
empathy are key to helping and recovery. Let them know you believe their
account of what they’re experiencing, and that you don’t blame them 
for their reactions. If they’re open to it, encourage them to seek evaluation 
and treatment. PTSD has been called “the hidden wound” because it comes 
without outward physical signs. But even if it’s an invisible disorder, 
it doesn’t have to be a silent one.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although the wording of the question is different, the intent and content of Question 4 align with the ground truth MCQ. Both questions relate to the concept of triggers in PTSD, and the correct options (C and D, respectively) describe the physical and emotional stimuli that can trigger symptoms.

However, it's worth noting that the generated MCQs do not have an exact match for the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ specifically asks about the definition of triggers, whereas Question 4 asks about a symptom of PTSD that can be triggered by everyday sensations.

If a new generated MCQ were to be created to exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it would be something like:

Question: What are triggers known as in the context of PTSD?
Options: A. Neurochemical cascades, B. Cortisol stress hormonal release, C. Physical and emotional stimuli, D. Flight-fight-freeze response

This new question would be a more direct match for the ground truth MCQ. However, among the existing generated MCQs, Question 4 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
In the city of Alexandria in 415 CE, the bishop and the governor 
were in a fight. It started with a disagreement over the 
behavior of a militia of monks, and ended with an accusation 
of witchcraft leveled against one of the most 
powerful figures in the city. Hypatia of Alexandria was a prominent 
mathematician, philosopher, and advisor to the city’s leaders. In the centuries since she lived, the details of her life have been 
the subject of much dispute and have taken on an almost 
mythical status. But while none of Hypatia’s 
own writings survive, her contemporaries’ and students’ 
accounts of her work and life paint a picture of the qualities that 
made her renowned as a scholar, beloved as a teacher, and ultimately 
led to her downfall. Hypatia was born around 
355 in Alexandria, then part of the Egyptian province 
of the Eastern Roman Empire, and an intellectual center. Her father Theon was an accomplished 
Greek mathematician and astronomer; her mother is unknown. Hypatia was likely an only child, and 
Theon educated her himself. By adulthood, she had surpassed her 
father in both mathematics and philosophy, becoming the city’s foremost scholar 
and taking over his position at the head of the Platonic school, 
similar to a modern university. She refined scientific instruments, 
wrote math textbooks, and developed a more efficient 
method of long division. But perhaps her most significant 
contributions to intellectual life in Alexandria came through her teaching. The philosophy Hypatia taught drew 
from the legacy of Plato and Aristotle, as well as the mystical philosopher 
Plotinus and the mathematician Pythagoras. The convergence of these influences merged
to form a school called Neoplatonism. For the Neoplatonists, mathematics 
had a spiritual aspect, divided among the four branches of 
arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music. These subjects were not studied merely 
for the sake of curiosity or practical utility, but because they 
authenticated the belief that numbers were the sacred 
language of the universe. In the repeated patterns of algebraic 
formulas and geometric shapes, the orbits of the planets, and the 
harmonious intervals of musical tones, the Neoplatonists saw a rational 
cosmic force at work. Students delved into this ordered 
mathematical world to achieve higher unity with this force, 
known as “the One.” While Hypatia was considered pagan— a term for traditional Roman 
belief before Christianity— she worshipped no particular 
deity or deities, and her ideas could be applied alongside 
multiple religious viewpoints. Jewish and Christian as well 
as pagan students travelled from the farthest reaches of 
the empire to study with her. The nonpartisan environment 
Hypatia fostered, where all students could feel comfortable, was especially remarkable given the 
religious and political turmoil that was fracturing the city of 
Alexandria at the time. Christianity had recently become 
the Empire’s state religion. The local archbishop Cyril had steadily 
gained political power, commanding zealous militias of Christian 
monks to destroy pagan temples and harass the Jewish population. In doing so, he encroached on the secular
authority of the Roman governor Orestes, himself a moderate Christian, leading to
a bitter public feud between the two men. Because she was seen as a wise 
and impartial figure, governor Orestes consulted Hypatia, who advised him to act with 
fairness and restraint. But when a group of Cyril’s 
monks incited a riot, badly injuring Orestes in the process, 
he had their leader tortured to death. Cyril and his followers blamed Hypatia, accusing her of witchcraft to 
turn Orestes against Christianity. In March 415, as Hypatia was 
traveling through the city, the bishop’s militia of monks 
dragged her from her carriage and brutally murdered and dismembered her. Hypatia’s death was a turning point 
in the politics of Alexandria. In the wake of her murder, other philosophers in the Greek 
and Roman tradition fled, and the city’s role as a center of 
learning declined. In a very real way, the spirit of inquisition, openness, 
and fairness she fostered died with her.

**Transcript**:
In the city of Alexandria in 415 CE, the bishop and the governor 
were in a fight. It started with a disagreement over the 
behavior of a militia of monks, and ended with an accusation 
of witchcraft leveled against one of the most 
powerful figures in the city. Hypatia of Alexandria was a prominent 
mathematician, philosopher, and advisor to the city’s leaders. In the centuries since she lived, the details of her life have been 
the subject of much dispute and have taken on an almost 
mythical status. But while none of Hypatia’s 
own writings survive, her contemporaries’ and students’ 
accounts of her work and life paint a picture of the qualities that 
made her renowned as a scholar, beloved as a teacher, and ultimately 
led to her downfall. Hypatia was born around 
355 in Alexandria, then part of the Egyptian province 
of the Eastern Roman Empire, and an intellectual center. Her father Theon was an accomplished 
Greek mathematician and astronomer; her mother is unknown. Hypatia was likely an only child, and 
Theon educated her himself. By adulthood, she had surpassed her 
father in both mathematics and philosophy, becoming the city’s foremost scholar 
and taking over his position at the head of the Platonic school, 
similar to a modern university. She refined scientific instruments, 
wrote math textbooks, and developed a more efficient 
method of long division. But perhaps her most significant 
contributions to intellectual life in Alexandria came through her teaching. The philosophy Hypatia taught drew 
from the legacy of Plato and Aristotle, as well as the mystical philosopher 
Plotinus and the mathematician Pythagoras. The convergence of these influences merged
to form a school called Neoplatonism. For the Neoplatonists, mathematics 
had a spiritual aspect, divided among the four branches of 
arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music. These subjects were not studied merely 
for the sake of curiosity or practical utility, but because they 
authenticated the belief that numbers were the sacred 
language of the universe. In the repeated patterns of algebraic 
formulas and geometric shapes, the orbits of the planets, and the 
harmonious intervals of musical tones, the Neoplatonists saw a rational 
cosmic force at work. Students delved into this ordered 
mathematical world to achieve higher unity with this force, 
known as “the One.” While Hypatia was considered pagan— a term for traditional Roman 
belief before Christianity— she worshipped no particular 
deity or deities, and her ideas could be applied alongside 
multiple religious viewpoints. Jewish and Christian as well 
as pagan students travelled from the farthest reaches of 
the empire to study with her. The nonpartisan environment 
Hypatia fostered, where all students could feel comfortable, was especially remarkable given the 
religious and political turmoil that was fracturing the city of 
Alexandria at the time. Christianity had recently become 
the Empire’s state religion. The local archbishop Cyril had steadily 
gained political power, commanding zealous militias of Christian 
monks to destroy pagan temples and harass the Jewish population. In doing so, he encroached on the secular
authority of the Roman governor Orestes, himself a moderate Christian, leading to
a bitter public feud between the two men. Because she was seen as a wise 
and impartial figure, governor Orestes consulted Hypatia, who advised him to act with 
fairness and restraint. But when a group of Cyril’s 
monks incited a riot, badly injuring Orestes in the process, 
he had their leader tortured to death. Cyril and his followers blamed Hypatia, accusing her of witchcraft to 
turn Orestes against Christianity. In March 415, as Hypatia was 
traveling through the city, the bishop’s militia of monks 
dragged her from her carriage and brutally murdered and dismembered her. Hypatia’s death was a turning point 
in the politics of Alexandria. In the wake of her murder, other philosophers in the Greek 
and Roman tradition fled, and the city’s role as a center of 
learning declined. In a very real way, the spirit of inquisition, openness, 
and fairness she fostered died with her.

**Transcript**:
In the spring of 1944, Tokyo residents
experienced numerous aerial attacks from Allied bombers. Air raid sirens warned citizens 
to get indoors and preceded strategic blackouts
across the city. But 28-year old Hisako Koyama 
saw these blackouts as opportunities. Dragging a futon over her head 
for protection, Koyama would gaze at the night sky, tracking all sorts 
of astronomical phenomena. However, her latest endeavor required 
the light of day. By angling her telescope towards the sun, Koyama could project the star's
light onto a sheet of paper, allowing her to sketch 
the sun’s shifting surface. She spent weeks recreating this set up,
tracking every change she saw. But while Koyama didn't know it, these drawings were the start 
of one of the most important records of solar activity in human history. To understand exactly what Koyama
saw on the sun’s surface, we first need to understand 
what’s happening inside the star. Every second, 
trillions of hydrogen atoms fuse into helium atoms
in a process called nuclear fusion. This ongoing explosion maintains 
the sun’s internal temperature of roughly 15 million degrees Celsius, which is more than enough energy 
to transform gas into churning pools of plasma. Plasma consists of charged particles 
that produce powerful magnetic fields. But unlike the stable charged particles 
that maintain magnetic activity on Earth, this plasma is constantly in flux, alternately disrupting and amplifying
the sun's magnetic field. This ongoing movement can produce temporary concentrations 
of magnetic activity which inhibit the movement of molecules 
and in turn reduce heat in that area. And since regions with less heat 
generate less light, places with the strongest magnetic fields
appear as dark spots scattered across the sun’s surface. These so-called sunspots 
are always moving, both as a result of plasma 
swirling within the sphere, and the sun’s rotation. And because they’re often 
clustered together, accurately counting sunspots and tracking 
their movement can be a challenge, depending greatly on the perception 
and judgment of the viewer. This is precisely where Koyama’s 
contributions would be so valuable. Despite having no
formal training in astronomy, her observations and sketches
were remarkably accurate. After sending her work 
to the Oriental Astronomical Association, she received a letter of commendation for
her dedicated and detailed observations. With their support, she began to visit 
the Tokyo Museum of Science, where she could use a far superior
telescope to continue her work. Koyama soon joined the museum's staff
as a professional observer, and over the next 40 years, 
she worked on a daily basis, producing over 10,000 drawings
of the sun’s surface. Researchers already knew magnetic currents
in the sun followed an 11 year cycle that moved sunspots in a butterfly shaped 
path over the star’s surface. But using Koyama’s record, they could precisely follow 
specific sunspots and clusters through that journey. This kind of detail offered a real-time
indication of the sun’s magnetic activity, allowing scientists to track 
all kinds of solar phenomena, including volatile solar flares. These flares typically emanate
from the vicinity of sunspots, and can travel all the way 
to Earth’s atmosphere. Here, they can create geomagnetic storms capable of disrupting long range 
communication and causing blackouts. Solar flares also pose a major risk 
to satellites and manned space stations, making them essential to predict 
and plan for. During an interview in 1964, Koyama lamented that her 17 years 
of observation had barely been enough to produce a single butterfly record
of the solar cycle. But by the end of her career, 
she’d drawn three and a half cycles— one of the longest records ever made. Better still, the quality of her
drawings was so consistent, researchers used them as a baseline 
to reconstruct the past 400 years of sunspot activity
from various historical sources. This project extends Koyama’s legacy
far beyond her own lifetime, and proves that science is not built
solely on astounding discoveries, but also on careful observation
of the world around us.

swirling within the sphere, and the sun’s rotation. And because they’re often 
clustered together, accurately counting sunspots and tracking 
their movement can be a challenge, depending greatly on the perception 
and judgment of the viewer. This is precisely where Koyama’s 
contributions would be so valuable. Despite having no
formal training in astronomy, her observations and sketches
were remarkably accurate. After sending her work 
to the Oriental Astronomical Association, she received a letter of commendation for
her dedicated and detailed observations. With their support, she began to visit 
the Tokyo Museum of Science, where she could use a far superior
telescope to continue her work. Koyama soon joined the museum's staff
as a professional observer, and over the next 40 years, 
she worked on a daily basis, producing over 10,000 drawings
of the sun’s surface. Researchers already knew magnetic currents
in the sun followed an 11 year cycle that moved sunspots in a butterfly shaped 
path over the star’s surface. But using Koyama’s record, they could precisely follow 
specific sunspots and clusters through that journey. This kind of detail offered a real-time
indication of the sun’s magnetic activity, allowing scientists to track 
all kinds of solar phenomena, including volatile solar flares. These flares typically emanate
from the vicinity of sunspots, and can travel all the way 
to Earth’s atmosphere. Here, they can create geomagnetic storms capable of disrupting long range 
communication and causing blackouts. Solar flares also pose a major risk 
to satellites and manned space stations, making them essential to predict 
and plan for. During an interview in 1964, Koyama lamented that her 17 years 
of observation had barely been enough to produce a single butterfly record
of the solar cycle. But by the end of her career, 
she’d drawn three and a half cycles— one of the longest records ever made. Better still, the quality of her
drawings was so consistent, researchers used them as a baseline 
to reconstruct the past 400 years of sunspot activity
from various historical sources. This project extends Koyama’s legacy
far beyond her own lifetime, and proves that science is not built
solely on astounding discoveries, but also on careful observation
of the world around us.

**Transcript**:
In the spring of 1944, Tokyo residents
experienced numerous aerial attacks from Allied bombers. Air raid sirens warned citizens 
to get indoors and preceded strategic blackouts
across the city. But 28-year old Hisako Koyama 
saw these blackouts as opportunities. Dragging a futon over her head 
for protection, Koyama would gaze at the night sky, tracking all sorts 
of astronomical phenomena. However, her latest endeavor required 
the light of day. By angling her telescope towards the sun, Koyama could project the star's
light onto a sheet of paper, allowing her to sketch 
the sun’s shifting surface. She spent weeks recreating this set up,
tracking every change she saw. But while Koyama didn't know it, these drawings were the start 
of one of the most important records of solar activity in human history. To understand exactly what Koyama
saw on the sun’s surface, we first need to understand 
what’s happening inside the star. Every second, 
trillions of hydrogen atoms fuse into helium atoms
in a process called nuclear fusion. This ongoing explosion maintains 
the sun’s internal temperature of roughly 15 million degrees Celsius, which is more than enough energy 
to transform gas into churning pools of plasma. Plasma consists of charged particles 
that produce powerful magnetic fields. But unlike the stable charged particles 
that maintain magnetic activity on Earth, this plasma is constantly in flux, alternately disrupting and amplifying
the sun's magnetic field. This ongoing movement can produce temporary concentrations 
of magnetic activity which inhibit the movement of molecules 
and in turn reduce heat in that area. And since regions with less heat 
generate less light, places with the strongest magnetic fields
appear as dark spots scattered across the sun’s surface. These so-called sunspots 
are always moving, both as a result of plasma 
swirling within the sphere, and the sun’s rotation. And because they’re often

**Transcript**:
At the height of their power, infamous Caribbean pirates like Blackbeard
and Henry Morgan commanded as many as ten ships 
and several hundred men. But their stories pale next to the most
successful pirate of all time. Madame Zheng commanded 1800 vessels, made enemies of several empires, and still lived to old age. Madame Zheng began her life as a commoner working on one of the many 
floating brothels, or flower boats, in the port city of Guangzhou. By 1801, she had attracted 
the attention of a local pirate captain named Zheng Yi,
and the two soon married. Guangzhou’s fishermen had long engaged 
in small-scale piracy to supplement their meager incomes
in the offseason. But a successful peasant uprising in 
neighboring Vietnam at the end of the 18th century
had raised the stakes. The victorious Tây Sơn rebels 
had unified their country only to face a Chinese invasion and ongoing maritime battles with the 
Vietnamese rulers they had overthrown. So they commissioned Guangzhou’s pirates 
to raid the coast and join the fight against their enemies. Serving their Vietnamese patrons 
turned the Zhengs and other pirates from ragtag gangs aboard single vessels into professional privateer fleets with dozens of ships 
able to hold their own at sea. In 1802, the Tây Sơn were overthrown and the pirates lost 
their safe harbor in Vietnam. But instead of scattering, the Zhengs met the crisis by uniting 
the rival Cantonese pirate groups into a formidable alliance. At its height, the confederation 
included 70,000 sailors with 800 large junks and nearly 1,000 smaller vessels. Those were organized into six fleets 
marked by different colored flags. The Zhengs were unlike many other 
historically-known privateers, such as Henry Morgan or Barbarossa, who acted on behalf 
of various naval powers. Instead, the Zhengs were now true outlaws, operating without support or approval 
from any government. Zheng Yi met an untimely end in 1807, but his widow didn’t hesitate 
to secure their gains. Through skillful diplomacy, Madame Zheng took 
charge of the confederation, convincing the captains that their best
interests lay in continued collaboration. Meanwhile, she appointed Zhang Bao, 
the young protege of her late husband, as the commander of her most 
powerful squadron, the Red Flag Fleet. Zhang became not only her right-hand man,
but her lover and, soon, her new husband. Madame Zheng consolidated her 
power through strict military discipline combined with a surprisingly 
progressive code of laws. Female captives were theoretically 
protected from sexual assault, and while pirates could 
take them as wives, mistreatment or infidelity towards 
them was punishable by death. Under Madame Zheng’s leadership, the pirates greatly 
increased their power, with 200 cannons 
and 1300 guns in the Red Flag Fleet alone. Within a few years, they destroyed 63 of 
Guangdong Province’s 135 military vessels, forcing their commanders 
to hire more than 30 private junks. Madame Zheng was so feared that Chinese 
commanders charged with apprehending her spent most of their time ashore, sometimes sabotaging their own 
vessels to avoid battle at sea. With little to stop them, the pirates were able to mount successful
—and often brutal— raids on garrisons, villages, 
and markets throughout the coast. Using her administrative talents, Madame Zheng established financial offices
in cities and villages, allowing her pirates to extract regular 
protection payments on land and sea alike. This effectively created 
a state within a state whose influence reached 
far beyond the South China Sea. At the peak of her power, Madame Zheng’s confederation drove 
five American schooners to safe harbor near Macao, captured a Portuguese brig, and blockaded a tribute 
mission from Thailand —all in a single day. But perhaps Madame Zheng’s greatest 
success lay in knowing when to quit. By 1810, increasing tension
between the Red and Black Flag Fleets weakened the confederation from within and rendered it more vulnerable 
to attack from without. So, when the Chinese government, 
desperate to stop the raids, offered amnesty in exchange 
for the pirates’ surrender, Madame Zheng and Zhang Bao agreed,
but only on their own terms. Their confederation was successfully 
and peacefully dismantled in April 1810, while Zhang Bao was allowed to retain 
120 junks for personal use and became an officer in the Chinese navy. Now fighting pirates himself, Zhang Bao quickly rose through 
the ranks of military command, and Madame Zheng enjoyed all 
the privileges of her husband’s status. After Zhang Bao died in 1822, Madame Zheng returned with their 
eleven-year-old son to Guangzhou, where she opened a gambling house 
and quietly lived off the proceeds. She died at the age of 69—an uncommonly
peaceful end to a pirate’s life.

**Transcript**:
At the height of their power, infamous Caribbean pirates like Blackbeard
and Henry Morgan commanded as many as ten ships 
and several hundred men. But their stories pale next to the most
successful pirate of all time. Madame Zheng commanded 1800 vessels, made enemies of several empires, and still lived to old age. Madame Zheng began her life as a commoner working on one of the many 
floating brothels, or flower boats, in the port city of Guangzhou. By 1801, she had attracted 
the attention of a local pirate captain named Zheng Yi,
and the two soon married. Guangzhou’s fishermen had long engaged 
in small-scale piracy to supplement their meager incomes
in the offseason. But a successful peasant uprising in 
neighboring Vietnam at the end of the 18th century
had raised the stakes. The victorious Tây Sơn rebels 
had unified their country only to face a Chinese invasion and ongoing maritime battles with the 
Vietnamese rulers they had overthrown. So they commissioned Guangzhou’s pirates 
to raid the coast and join the fight against their enemies. Serving their Vietnamese patrons 
turned the Zhengs and other pirates from ragtag gangs aboard single vessels into professional privateer fleets with dozens of ships 
able to hold their own at sea. In 1802, the Tây Sơn were overthrown and the pirates lost 
their safe harbor in Vietnam. But instead of scattering, the Zhengs met the crisis by uniting 
the rival Cantonese pirate groups into a formidable alliance. At its height, the confederation 
included 70,000 sailors with 800 large junks and nearly 1,000 smaller vessels. Those were organized into six fleets 
marked by different colored flags. The Zhengs were unlike many other 
historically-known privateers, such as Henry Morgan or Barbarossa, who acted on behalf 
of various naval powers. Instead, the Zhengs were now true outlaws, operating without support or approval 
from any government. Zheng Yi met an untimely end in 1807, but his widow didn’t hesitate 
to secure their gains. Through skillful diplomacy, Madame Zheng took 
charge of the confederation, convincing the captains that their best
interests lay in continued collaboration. Meanwhile, she appointed Zhang Bao, 
the young protege of her late husband, as the commander of her most 
powerful squadron, the Red Flag Fleet. Zhang became not only her right-hand man,
but her lover and, soon, her new husband. Madame Zheng consolidated her 
power through strict military discipline combined with a surprisingly 
progressive code of laws. Female captives were theoretically 
protected from sexual assault, and while pirates could 
take them as wives, mistreatment or infidelity towards 
them was punishable by death. Under Madame Zheng’s leadership, the pirates greatly 
increased their power, with 200 cannons 
and 1300 guns in the Red Flag Fleet alone. Within a few years, they destroyed 63 of 
Guangdong Province’s 135 military vessels, forcing their commanders 
to hire more than 30 private junks. Madame Zheng was so feared that Chinese 
commanders charged with apprehending her spent most of their time ashore, sometimes sabotaging their own 
vessels to avoid battle at sea. With little to stop them, the pirates were able to mount successful
—and often brutal— raids on garrisons, villages, 
and markets throughout the coast. Using her administrative talents, Madame Zheng established financial offices
in cities and villages, allowing her pirates to extract regular 
protection payments on land and sea alike. This effectively created 
a state within a state whose influence reached 
far beyond the South China Sea. At the peak of her power, Madame Zheng’s confederation drove 
five American schooners to safe harbor near Macao, captured a Portuguese brig, and blockaded a tribute 
mission from Thailand —all in a single day. But perhaps Madame Zheng’s greatest 
success lay in knowing when to quit. By 1810, increasing tension
between the Red and Black Flag Fleets weakened the confederation from within and rendered it more vulnerable 
to attack from without. So, when the Chinese government, 
desperate to stop the raids, offered amnesty in exchange 
for the pirates’ surrender, Madame Zheng and Zhang Bao agreed,
but only on their own terms. Their confederation was successfully 
and peacefully dismantled in April 1810, while Zhang Bao was allowed to retain 
120 junks for personal use and became an officer in the Chinese navy. Now fighting pirates himself, Zhang Bao quickly rose through 
the ranks of military command, and Madame Zheng enjoyed all 
the privileges of her husband’s status. After Zhang Bao died in 1822, Madame Zheng returned with their 
eleven-year-old son to Guangzhou, where she opened a gambling house 
and quietly lived off the proceeds. She died at the age of 69—an uncommonly

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In late 1775, the newly appointed 
General George Washington received a poem from one 
of colonial America’s most famous writers. Its verses praised 
the burgeoning revolution, invoking the goddess of their new nation
to aid the general’s righteous cause. But this ode to liberty wasn’t written
by some aloof, aristocratic admirer. Its author was a young Black woman
who’d been enslaved for over a decade. The young girl, who’d been renamed
Phillis Wheatley, had arrived in the colonies
on a slave ship in 1761. The ship landed in Boston, where Susanna and John Wheatley purchased
Phillis to work in their house. However, for reasons that remain unclear,
they also taught her to read and write. Over the following decade, Wheatley became well versed 
in poetry and religious texts, eventually beginning to produce
her own poems. The family published her work 
in a local newspaper, and in 1771, her elegy for renowned 
reverend George Whitefield captured the public’s imagination. The poem’s repetitive rhythms,
dramatic religious references, and soaring spiritual language depicted how Whitefield’s sermons
“inflame the soul and captivate the mind.” Wheatley ends with an arresting image
of life after death, trusting that divine forces
“will re-animate his dust.” This moving tribute found an audience
in both the US and England. And since the piece was published 
with a note identifying the author as an enslaved woman, many readers were as fascinated 
with the poet as they were with the poem. In 1773, Phillis traveled to London, where her collection of “Poems 
on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral” became the first book of poetry published
by an African-American woman. It was filled with profound meditations
on life, death, and religion, as well as Biblical 
and classical references. In “A Hymn to Humanity,” Wheatley linked 
these themes to her own creative growth, portraying herself as a muse 
smiled upon by heavenly bodies. Unsurprisingly, Wheatley had her critics. Many white Americans believed 
Black people were incapable of producing intellectual 
and creative work. Thomas Jefferson wrote that her writing
didn't even deserve to be called poetry, and others dismissed her as a poor
imitation of another well-known poet. But many readers of the time were
enamored with Wheatley's work, including prominent European
writers and politicians. Many modern readers, however, might expect her work to cover
a different topic: slavery. Wheatley rarely wrote directly about her
experiences as an enslaved person. And her poem addressing the topic 
has been criticized for suggesting she was grateful 
that enslavement led her to Christianity. But it’s incredibly unlikely Wheatley 
would have been able to publicly condemn slavery without serious consequences. And many readers have found a more nuanced
critique hidden within her work. For example, Wheatley was a vocal
supporter of American independence, writing that her “love of freedom” 
came from early experiences of being kidnapped into slavery 
and separated from her parents. When disparaging England’s 
imperial control, she evokes imagery of an “iron chain.” And by comparing her lack of freedom
to America’s lack of independence, Wheatley subtly laments
her own circumstances. Thankfully, Wheatley secured her freedom
after returning from London. The reasons for her emancipation
aren't entirely clear, as there’s no evidence of the Wheatleys
freeing other enslaved people. However, since Phillis could have
remained free in London, some believe she bargained to make
emancipation a condition of her return. It’s difficult to know exactly 
what happened, both here and throughout the rest 
of Wheatley’s life. Her proposal for a second book
was never published. In 1778, she married a free 
Black man named John Peters. The two are believed to have had
three children, all of whom died in infancy. Their last child is thought to have died
around the same time as Wheatley, and the two were buried together
in an unmarked grave. While some of Wheatley’s letters survived,
she never released an account of her life. So despite her tenure as perhaps 
the most famous African on the planet, Wheatley’s story has been lost 
to the ravages of history, like those of countless other 
enslaved peoples. But her poetry lives on today— celebrating creative growth
and offering spiritual sustenance.

However, I must point out that the generated MCQ does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the year Phillis Wheatley arrived in Boston, while the generated MCQ asks about the identity of the young Black woman who wrote a poem praising the burgeoning revolution.

To provide a more accurate evaluation, I will assume that the generated MCQ is not a direct match for the ground truth MCQ. Instead, I will evaluate the generated MCQ as a separate question.

- Clarity and Readability Score: 0.9000 (the generated MCQ is clear and readable, but not directly related to the ground truth MCQ)
- Total Score: 0.1700

Please note that the total score is low due to the lack of relevance between the generated MCQ and the ground truth MCQ. If you would like me to generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, I can try to do so.

**Transcript**:
At the age of 21, Simone de Beauvoir 
became the youngest person to take the philosophy exams
at France’s most esteemed university. She passed with flying colors. But as soon as she mastered 
the rules of philosophy, she wanted to break them. She’d been schooled 
on Plato’s Theory of Forms, which dismissed the physical world 
as a flawed reflection of higher truths and unchanging ideals. But for de Beauvoir, 
earthly life was enthralling, sensual, and anything but static. Her desire to explore the physical world 
to its fullest would shape her life, and eventually, 
inspire a radical new philosophy. Endlessly debating with her romantic 
and intellectual partner Jean Paul Sartre, de Beauvoir explored free will, desire, 
rights and responsibilities, and the value of personal experience. In the years following WWII, these ideas would converge 
into the school of thought most closely associated with their work: 
existentialism. Where Judeo-Christian traditions 
taught that humans are born with preordained purpose, de Beauvoir and Sartre proposed 
a revolutionary alternative. They argued that humans are born free, and thrown into existence 
without a divine plan. As de Beauvoir acknowledged, this freedom 
is both a blessing and a burden. In "The Ethics of Ambiguity" she argued 
that our greatest ethical imperative is to create our own life’s meaning, while protecting the freedom 
of others to do the same. As de Beauvoir wrote, “A freedom which is interested only 
in denying freedom must be denied.” This philosophy challenged its students 
to navigate the ambiguities and conflicts our desires produce, 
both internally and externally. And as de Beauvoir sought to find 
her own purpose, she began to question: if everyone deserves 
to freely pursue meaning, why was she restricted by society’s ideals
of womanhood? Despite her prolific writing, 
teaching and activism, de Beauvoir struggled 
to be taken seriously by her male peers. She’d rejected her Catholic upbringing 
and marital expectations to study at university, and write memoirs,
fiction and philosophy. But the risks she was taking 
by embracing this lifestyle were lost on many 
of her male counterparts, who took these freedoms for granted. They had no intellectual interest 
in de Beauvoir’s work, which explored women’s inner lives, as well the author’s open relationship 
and bisexuality. To convey the importance 
of her perspective, de Beauvoir embarked 
on her most challenging book yet. Just as she’d created the foundations 
of existentialism, she’d now redefine the limits of gender. Published in 1949, "The Second Sex" 
argues that, like our life’s meaning, gender is not predestined. As de Beauvoir famously wrote, “one is not born, but rather becomes, 
woman.” And to “become” a woman, she argued, 
was to become the Other. De Beauvoir defined Othering 
as the process of labeling women as less than the men who’d 
historically defined, and been defined as, the ideal human subjects. As the Other, she argued that women 
were considered second to men, and therefore systematically restricted 
from pursuing freedom. "The Second Sex" became 
an essential feminist treatise, offering a detailed history 
of women’s oppression and a wealth of anecdotal testimony. "The Second Sex"’s combination 
of personal experience and philosophical intervention provided a new language 
to discuss feminist theory. Today, those conversations are still 
informed by de Beauvoir’s insistence that in the pursuit of equality, “there is no divorce between 
philosophy and life.” Of course, like any foundational work, the ideas in "The Second Sex" have been 
expanded upon since its publication. Many modern thinkers have explored 
additional ways people are Othered that de Beauvoir doesn’t acknowledge. These include racial 
and economic identities, as well as the broader spectrum of gender 
and sexual identities we understand today. De Beauvoir’s legacy 
is further complicated by accusations of sexual misconduct 
by two of her university students. In the face of these accusations, she had her teaching license revoked 
for abusing her position. In this aspect and others, 
de Beauvoir’s life remains controversial— and her work represents a contentious 
moment in the emergence of early feminism. She participated in those conversations 
for the rest of her life; writing fiction, philosophy, 
and memoirs until her death in 1986. Today, her work offers 
a philosophical language to be reimagined, revisited 
and rebelled against— a response this revolutionary thinker 
might have welcomed.

**Transcript**:
At the age of 21, Simone de Beauvoir 
became the youngest person to take the philosophy exams
at France’s most esteemed university. She passed with flying colors. But as soon as she mastered 
the rules of philosophy, she wanted to break them. She’d been schooled 
on Plato’s Theory of Forms, which dismissed the physical world 
as a flawed reflection of higher truths and unchanging ideals. But for de Beauvoir, 
earthly life was enthralling, sensual, and anything but static. Her desire to explore the physical world 
to its fullest would shape her life, and eventually, 
inspire a radical new philosophy. Endlessly debating with her romantic 
and intellectual partner Jean Paul Sartre, de Beauvoir explored free will, desire, 
rights and responsibilities, and the value of personal experience. In the years following WWII, these ideas would converge 
into the school of thought most closely associated with their work: 
existentialism. Where Judeo-Christian traditions 
taught that humans are born with preordained purpose, de Beauvoir and Sartre proposed 
a revolutionary alternative. They argued that humans are born free, and thrown into existence 
without a divine plan. As de Beauvoir acknowledged, this freedom 
is both a blessing and a burden. In "The Ethics of Ambiguity" she argued 
that our greatest ethical imperative is to create our own life’s meaning, while protecting the freedom 
of others to do the same. As de Beauvoir wrote, “A freedom which is interested only 
in denying freedom must be denied.” This philosophy challenged its students 
to navigate the ambiguities and conflicts our desires produce, 
both internally and externally. And as de Beauvoir sought to find 
her own purpose, she began to question: if everyone deserves 
to freely pursue meaning, why was she restricted by society’s ideals
of womanhood? Despite her prolific writing, 
teaching and activism, de Beauvoir struggled 
to be taken seriously by her male peers. She’d rejected her Catholic upbringing 
and marital expectations to study at university, and write memoirs,
fiction and philosophy. But the risks she was taking 
by embracing this lifestyle were lost on many 
of her male counterparts, who took these freedoms for granted. They had no intellectual interest 
in de Beauvoir’s work, which explored women’s inner lives, as well the author’s open relationship 
and bisexuality. To convey the importance 
of her perspective, de Beauvoir embarked 
on her most challenging book yet. Just as she’d created the foundations 
of existentialism, she’d now redefine the limits of gender. Published in 1949, "The Second Sex" 
argues that, like our life’s meaning, gender is not predestined. As de Beauvoir famously wrote, “one is not born, but rather becomes, 
woman.” And to “become” a woman, she argued, 
was to become the Other. De Beauvoir defined Othering 
as the process of labeling women as less than the men who’d 
historically defined, and been defined as, the ideal human subjects. As the Other, she argued that women 
were considered second to men, and therefore systematically restricted 
from pursuing freedom. "The Second Sex" became 
an essential feminist treatise, offering a detailed history 
of women’s oppression and a wealth of anecdotal testimony. "The Second Sex"’s combination 
of personal experience and philosophical intervention provided a new language 
to discuss feminist theory. Today, those conversations are still 
informed by de Beauvoir’s insistence that in the pursuit of equality, “there is no divorce between 
philosophy and life.” Of course, like any foundational work, the ideas in "The Second Sex" have been 
expanded upon since its publication. Many modern thinkers have explored 
additional ways people are Othered that de Beauvoir doesn’t acknowledge. These include racial 
and economic identities, as well as the broader spectrum of gender 
and sexual identities we understand today. De Beauvoir’s legacy 
is further complicated by accusations of sexual misconduct 
by two of her university students. In the face of these accusations, she had her teaching license revoked 
for abusing her position. In this aspect and others, 
de Beauvoir’s life remains controversial— and her work represents a contentious 
moment in the emergence of early feminism. She participated in those conversations 
for the rest of her life; writing fiction, philosophy, 
and memoirs until her death in 1986. Today, her work offers 
a philosophical language to be reimagined, revisited 
and rebelled against— a response this revolutionary thinker 
might have welcomed.

**Transcript**:
In the German town of Nördlingen in 1593, an innkeeper named Maria Höll found 
herself accused of witchcraft. She was arrested for questioning, 
and denied the charges. She continued to insist she wasn’t a witch
through 62 rounds of torture before her accusers finally released her. Rebekka Lemp, accused a few years earlier
in the same town, faced a worse fate. She wrote to her husband from jail worrying that she would 
confess under torture, even though she was innocent. After giving a false confession, she was burned at the stake 
in front of her family. Höll and Lemp were both victims of the 
witch hunts that occurred in Europe and the American 
colonies from the late 15th century 
until the early 18th century. These witch hunts were not a unified 
initiative by a single authority, but rather a phenomenon that occurred 
sporadically and followed a similar pattern each time. The term “witch” has taken 
on many meanings, but in these hunts, a witch was someone 
who allegedly gained magical powers by obeying Satan rather than God. This definition of witchcraft spread 
through churches in Western Europe starting at the end of the 15th century. It really gained traction after the pope 
gave a friar and professor of theology named Heinrich Kraemer permission to conduct inquisitions in 
search of witches in 1485. His first, in the town of Innsbruck, didn’t gain much traction with the local
authorities, who disapproved of his harsh questioning
of respectable citizens and shut down his trials. Undeterred, he wrote a book called the 
"Malleus Maleficarum," or "Hammer of Witches." The text argued for the existence of 
witches and suggested ruthless tactics for hunting
and prosecuting them. He singled out women as easier targets for
the devil’s influence, though men could also be witches. Kraemer’s book spurred others to write 
their own books and give sermons on the 
dangers of witchcraft. According to these texts, witches practiced rituals including 
kissing the Devil’s anus and poisoning or bewitching targets the 
devil singled out for harm. Though there was no evidence to support
any of these claims, belief in witches became widespread. A witch hunt often began 
with a misfortune: a failed harvest, a sick cow, 
or a stillborn child. Community members blamed witchcraft, 
and accused each other of being witches. Many of the accused were people on 
the fringes of society: the elderly, the poor, or social outcasts, but any member of the community
could be targeted, even occasionally children. While religious authorities encouraged 
witch hunts, local secular governments usually carried 
out the detainment and punishment of accused witches. Those suspected of witchcraft were 
questioned and often tortured— and under torture, thousands of innocent 
people confessed to witchcraft and implicated others in turn. Because these witch hunts occurred 
sporadically over centuries and continents the specifics varied considerably. Punishments for convicted witches ranged 
from small fines to burning at the stake. The hunt in which Höll and Lemp were 
accused dragged on for nine years, while others lasted just months. They could have anywhere from a few to a 
few hundred victims. The motivations of the witch hunters 
probably varied as well, but it seems likely that many weren’t 
consciously looking for scapegoats— instead, they sincerely believed 
in witchcraft, and thought they were doing good by 
rooting it out in their communities. Institutions of power enabled real harm to
be done on the basis of these beliefs. But there were dissenters all along– jurists, scholars, and physicians 
countered books like Kraemer’s "Hammer of Witches" with texts objecting to the 
cruelty of the hunts, the use of forced confessions, 
and the lack of evidence of witchcraft. From the late 17th through the mid-18th 
century, their arguments gained force with the rise
of stronger central governments and legal norms like due process. Witch hunting slowly declined until it 
disappeared altogether. Both the onset and demise of these 
atrocities came gradually, out of seemingly ordinary circumstances. The potential for similar situations, in which authorities use their powers to
mobilize society against a false threat, still exists today— but so does the capacity of reasoned 
dissent to combat those false beliefs.

**Transcript**:
In the German town of Nördlingen in 1593, an innkeeper named Maria Höll found 
herself accused of witchcraft. She was arrested for questioning, 
and denied the charges. She continued to insist she wasn’t a witch
through 62 rounds of torture before her accusers finally released her. Rebekka Lemp, accused a few years earlier
in the same town, faced a worse fate. She wrote to her husband from jail worrying that she would 
confess under torture, even though she was innocent. After giving a false confession, she was burned at the stake 
in front of her family. Höll and Lemp were both victims of the 
witch hunts that occurred in Europe and the American 
colonies from the late 15th century 
until the early 18th century. These witch hunts were not a unified 
initiative by a single authority, but rather a phenomenon that occurred 
sporadically and followed a similar pattern each time. The term “witch” has taken 
on many meanings, but in these hunts, a witch was someone 
who allegedly gained magical powers by obeying Satan rather than God. This definition of witchcraft spread 
through churches in Western Europe starting at the end of the 15th century. It really gained traction after the pope 
gave a friar and professor of theology named Heinrich Kraemer permission to conduct inquisitions in 
search of witches in 1485. His first, in the town of Innsbruck, didn’t gain much traction with the local
authorities, who disapproved of his harsh questioning
of respectable citizens and shut down his trials. Undeterred, he wrote a book called the 
"Malleus Maleficarum," or "Hammer of Witches." The text argued for the existence of 
witches and suggested ruthless tactics for hunting
and prosecuting them. He singled out women as easier targets for
the devil’s influence, though men could also be witches. Kraemer’s book spurred others to write 
their own books and give sermons on the 
dangers of witchcraft. According to these texts, witches practiced rituals including 
kissing the Devil’s anus and poisoning or bewitching targets the 
devil singled out for harm. Though there was no evidence to support
any of these claims, belief in witches became widespread. A witch hunt often began 
with a misfortune: a failed harvest, a sick cow, 
or a stillborn child. Community members blamed witchcraft, 
and accused each other of being witches. Many of the accused were people on 
the fringes of society: the elderly, the poor, or social outcasts, but any member of the community
could be targeted, even occasionally children. While religious authorities encouraged 
witch hunts, local secular governments usually carried 
out the detainment and punishment of accused witches. Those suspected of witchcraft were 
questioned and often tortured— and under torture, thousands of innocent 
people confessed to witchcraft and implicated others in turn. Because these witch hunts occurred 
sporadically over centuries and continents the specifics varied considerably. Punishments for convicted witches ranged 
from small fines to burning at the stake. The hunt in which Höll and Lemp were 
accused dragged on for nine years, while others lasted just months. They could have anywhere from a few to a 
few hundred victims. The motivations of the witch hunters 
probably varied as well, but it seems likely that many weren’t 
consciously looking for scapegoats— instead, they sincerely believed 
in witchcraft, and thought they were doing good by 
rooting it out in their communities. Institutions of power enabled real harm to
be done on the basis of these beliefs. But there were dissenters all along– jurists, scholars, and physicians 
countered books like Kraemer’s "Hammer of Witches" with texts objecting to the 
cruelty of the hunts, the use of forced confessions, 
and the lack of evidence of witchcraft. From the late 17th through the mid-18th 
century, their arguments gained force with the rise
of stronger central governments and legal norms like due process. Witch hunting slowly declined until it 
disappeared altogether. Both the onset and demise of these 
atrocities came gradually, out of seemingly ordinary circumstances. The potential for similar situations, in which authorities use their powers to
mobilize society against a false threat, still exists today— but so does the capacity of reasoned 
dissent to combat those false beliefs.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Three and a half thousand years ago in Egypt, a noble pharaoh was the victim 
of a violent attack. But the attack was not physical. This royal had been dead for 20 years. The attack was historical, an act of damnatio memoriae,
the damnation of memory. Somebody smashed the pharaoh's statues, took a chisel and attempted to erase 
the pharaoh's name and image from history. Who was this pharaoh,
and what was behind the attack? Here's the key: the pharaoh Hatshepsut was a woman. In the normal course of things,
she should never have been pharaoh. Although it was legal 
for a woman to be a monarch, it disturbed some essential Egyptian beliefs. Firstly, the pharaoh was known
as the living embodiment of the male god Horus. Secondly, disturbance to the tradition
of rule by men was a serious challenge to Maat, a word for "truth," 
expressing a belief in order and justice, vital to the Egyptians. Hatshepsut had perhaps tried to adapt to this belief in the link between 
order and patriarchy through her titles. She took the name Maatkare, and sometimes referred to herself as Hatshepsu, 
with a masculine word ending. But apparently, these efforts 
didn't convince everyone, and perhaps someone 
erased Hatshepsut's image so that the world would forget 
the disturbance to Maat, and Egypt could be balanced again. Hatshepsut, moreover, 
was not the legitimate heir to the thrown, but a regent, 
a kind of stand-in co-monarch. The Egyptian kingship traditionally 
passed from father to son. It passed from Thutmose I 
to his son Thutmose II, Hatshepsut's husband. It should have passed from Thutmose II 
directly to his son Thutmose III, but Thutmose III was a little boy 
when his father died. Hatshepsut, the dead pharaoh's chief wife and widow, stepped in to help 
as her stepson's regent but ended up ruling beside him 
as a fully fledged pharaoh. Perhaps Thutmose III was angry about this. Perhaps he was the one 
who erased her images. It's also possible that someone wanted 
to dishonor Hatshepsut because she was a bad pharaoh. But the evidence suggests 
she was actually pretty good. She competently fulfilled 
the traditional roles of the office. She was a great builder. Her mortuary temple, Djeser-Djeseru, was an architectural phenomenon 
at the time and is still admired today. She enhanced the economy of Egypt, conducting a very successful trade mission
to the distant land of Punt. She had strong religious connections. She even claimed to be the daughter 
of the state god, Amun. And she had a successful military career,
with a Nubian campaign, and claims she fought alongside 
her soldiers in battle. Of course, we have to be careful
when we assess the success of Hatshepsut's career, since most of the evidence 
was written by Hatshepsut herself. She tells her own story 
in pictures and writing on the walls of her mortuary temple and the red chapel she built for Amun. So who committed the crimes 
against Hatshepsut's memory? The most popular suspect is 
her stepson, nephew and co-ruler, Thutmose III. Did he do it out of anger 
because she stole his throne? This is unlikely since 
the damage wasn't done until 20 years after Hatshepsut died. That's a long time to hang onto anger 
and then act in a rage. Maybe Thutmose III did it 
to make his own reign look stronger. But it is most likely that 
he or someone else erased the images so that people would forget 
that a woman ever sat on Egypt's throne. This gender anomaly was simply 
too much of a threat to Maat and had to be obliterated from history. Happily, the ancient censors 
were not quite thorough enough. Enough evidence survived for us 
to piece together what happened, so the story of this unique powerful woman
can now be told.

erased Hatshepsut's image so that the world would forget 
the disturbance to Maat, and Egypt could be balanced again. Hatshepsut, moreover, 
was not the legitimate heir to the thrown, but a regent, 
a kind of stand-in co-monarch. The Egyptian kingship traditionally 
passed from father to son. It passed from Thutmose I 
to his son Thutmose II, Hatshepsut's husband. It should have passed from Thutmose II 
directly to his son Thutmose III, but Thutmose III was a little boy 
when his father died. Hatshepsut, the dead pharaoh's chief wife and widow, stepped in to help 
as her stepson's regent but ended up ruling beside him 
as a fully fledged pharaoh. Perhaps Thutmose III was angry about this. Perhaps he was the one 
who erased her images. It's also possible that someone wanted 
to dishonor Hatshepsut because she was a bad pharaoh. But the evidence suggests 
she was actually pretty good. She competently fulfilled 
the traditional roles of the office. She was a great builder. Her mortuary temple, Djeser-Djeseru, was an architectural phenomenon 
at the time and is still admired today. She enhanced the economy of Egypt, conducting a very successful trade mission
to the distant land of Punt. She had strong religious connections. She even claimed to be the daughter 
of the state god, Amun. And she had a successful military career,
with a Nubian campaign, and claims she fought alongside 
her soldiers in battle. Of course, we have to be careful
when we assess the success of Hatshepsut's career, since most of the evidence 
was written by Hatshepsut herself. She tells her own story 
in pictures and writing on the walls of her mortuary temple and the red chapel she built for Amun. So who committed the crimes 
against Hatshepsut's memory? The most popular suspect is 
her stepson, nephew and co-ruler, Thutmose III. Did he do it out of anger 
because she stole his throne? This is unlikely since 
the damage wasn't done until 20 years after Hatshepsut died. That's a long time to hang onto anger 
and then act in a rage. Maybe Thutmose III did it 
to make his own reign look stronger. But it is most likely that 
he or someone else erased the images so that people would forget 
that a woman ever sat on Egypt's throne. This gender anomaly was simply 
too much of a threat to Maat and had to be obliterated from history. Happily, the ancient censors 
were not quite thorough enough. Enough evidence survived for us 
to piece together what happened, so the story of this unique powerful woman
can now be told.

**Transcript**:
Three and a half thousand years ago in Egypt, a noble pharaoh was the victim 
of a violent attack. But the attack was not physical. This royal had been dead for 20 years. The attack was historical, an act of damnatio memoriae,
the damnation of memory. Somebody smashed the pharaoh's statues, took a chisel and attempted to erase 
the pharaoh's name and image from history. Who was this pharaoh,
and what was behind the attack? Here's the key: the pharaoh Hatshepsut was a woman. In the normal course of things,
she should never have been pharaoh. Although it was legal 
for a woman to be a monarch, it disturbed some essential Egyptian beliefs. Firstly, the pharaoh was known
as the living embodiment of the male god Horus. Secondly, disturbance to the tradition
of rule by men was a serious challenge to Maat, a word for "truth," 
expressing a belief in order and justice, vital to the Egyptians. Hatshepsut had perhaps tried to adapt to this belief in the link between 
order and patriarchy through her titles. She took the name Maatkare, and sometimes referred to herself as Hatshepsu, 
with a masculine word ending. But apparently, these efforts 
didn't convince everyone, and perhaps someone 
erased Hatshepsut's image so that the world would forget

**Transcript**:
Listen to how this textbook describes slavery. “The master often had a barbecue or a picnic
for his slaves. Then they had a great frolic. Even while working in the cotton fields they
sang songs. The beat of the music and the richness of
their voices made work seem light.” Yikes. That’s from History of Georgia, a textbook
published in 1954 that was taught across junior high schools in Georgia for decades. That sort of language is part of an intellectual
movement called the “Lost Cause” — a distorted version of American Civil War history
that’s been prevalent in the South for a long time. It took shape soon after the defeat of the
Confederate States in the war, when Southern historians like Edward Pollard and former
Confederate Gen. Jubal Early started preserving the South’s perspective through their writings. They framed the Confederate cause as a heroic
defense of the Southern way of life against the overwhelming forces in the North. That narrative has a few basic tenets: the
glorification of Confederate soldiers who died for a cause they believed in, the belief
that slavery was a benevolent institution, and, maybe most importantly, that slavery
was not the root cause of the war. The Lost Cause is one of the most notoriously
effective efforts to rewrite history, and it was done by the losing side. So how did it become so deeply rooted in Southern
memory? Blame the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The UDC was founded in Nashville in 1894 to
preserve Confederate culture for generations to come. The women who made up the group descended
from elite antebellum families and they used their social and political clout to spread
the pro-Southern version of the war as “real history.” You’ve probably seen their efforts to honor
the Confederacy, but maybe you didn’t know it was the UDC. They’re the ones who covered the Southern
landscape with memorials for Confederate leaders and soldiers. They used their fundraising and lobbying skills
to pressure local governments into erecting monuments in prominent public spaces like
courthouses and state capitols. Installed here next to the state Capitol by
the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The United Daughters of the Confederacy donated
this memorial to the city back in the ’30s. They put them along roadsides and in parks. Any place that was remotely relevant to the
Confederacy was memorialized. By the early 20th century, the UDC had 100,000
members in chapters spread all over the country, but mostly in former Confederate states. And there’s a reason they grew so quickly
during that time. So we’re talking about roughly three decades
after the end of the war, and the Confederate veterans themselves are beginning to die off. So there is this push to find ways to commemorate
it. Because the big challenge by 1900 was there’s
a new generation of white Southerners being born and they never experienced the war years. That push is visible. Most of the Confederate monuments were erected
during the UDC’s height of influence. There’s a rhetoric around monuments — that
we want to get this thing built before all of that generation has died off. And Dr. Karen Cox wrote the book on the UDC, and
I asked her if it was fair to say the group established the Lost Cause as historical fact
in the South. Oh, my God, yeah! They were the leaders of the Lost Cause into
the 20th century, and they made it a movement about vindication. Just to give you an idea of how effective
they were: They successfully lobbied for a Confederate Memorial in Arlington National
Cemetery, which US President Woodrow Wilson proudly unveiled to a cheering crowd. Now that’s influence, right? Monuments are the least of what they did. I mean they are the most visible and tangible,
but the work with children was far more influential. It turns out, a central UDC objective is shaping
how children think about the war and their Southern heritage. One of their most powerful tools? Textbooks. Take a look at this pamphlet, called “A
Measuring Rod for Text-Books.” It was written by “the illustrious Southern
Historian Miss Mildred Rutherford” an educator, orator, and an author of Southern history
textbooks. She was also very pro-slavery. The pamphlet announced the formation of a
textbook review committee featuring prominent Southerners, like five former Confederate
generals. This group was committed to spreading the
“truths of Confederate history” so they instructed school boards to reject any textbooks
that did not “accord full justice to the South.” And they urged libraries to deface every book
in their collection that didn’t measure up by writing the words “Unjust to the South”
clearly on its cover. This pamphlet was shared widely with school
boards throughout the South, and UDC-backed committees closely monitored history books
to make sure “Northern influence” never reached classrooms. So the core language of an approved textbook
aligned precisely with that of the Lost Cause. You know, stuff like “The Confederacy lost
in the War between the States. But Georgia never forgot to honor her Confederate
soldiers…” History of Georgia was on the UDC’s approved
list. It was also written by E. Merton Coulter,
a self-described “Southern historian” and historian-described white supremacist. They understand that how you educate — who
wins the writing game, who wins the battle over history — ultimately wins the war. That’s the big fight for the UDC. But their work with children went further
than the classrooms. The UDC formed an auxiliary group called the
Children of the Confederacy, which was designed to get kids born in former Confederate states
to actively participate in their version of history. Group leaders had kids recite call-and-response
“truths” from something called the “Confederate Catechism.” Children, up to the age of 18, would compete
and be rewarded for memorizing long passages of Lost Cause rhetoric. So it would be like an after-school thing,
you know, like that was your club. You would go after school to the meeting of
the Children of the Confederacy and your leader might teach you songs of the South like “Dixie”
or other songs that were considered Southern patriotic songs. They would have them write essays, go visit
the veterans, and learn this catechism. Children were also the centerpiece of their
community’s monument unveilings, like this “living flag” at the dedication of the
Stonewall Jackson monument in Richmond. Yes, those are schoolchildren. The UDC's efforts shaped the identities of
children who grew up with the Lost Cause. They made history personal, and that made
their story last longer. Generations of generations of children learning
that narrative in a variety of ways grow up to be, you know, segregationists in the ’50s
and ’60s. Because that’s been drilled into them since
they were children. After World War I, the UDC started losing
steam. But the damage was done. The monuments were in place and the textbooks
they wrote remained in Southern classrooms until the late ’70s. And the women’s group did it all without
the right to vote or participate in politics. You can still get glimmers of this Lost Cause
memory of the war And I think the UDC, to a great extent was
— that was their goal. So the next time someone says the Confederate
monuments are about just know that that’s exactly what the United
Daughters of the Confederacy wants you to think.

**Transcript**:
Every day, the sands of the Sahara Desert
reach temperatures up to 80° Celsius. Stretching over roughly
nine million square kilometers, this massive desert receives about 
22 million terawatt hours of energy from the Sun every year. That’s well over 100 times more energy 
than humanity consumes annually. So, could covering the desert with solar 
panels solve our energy problems for good? Solar panels work when light particles hit
their surface with enough energy to knock electrons 
out of their stable bonds. On their journey back to stability, 
these electrons produce electricity. However, there’s a limit to how much power
panels can generate. Solar panels can only interact 
with certain wavelengths of light, making it impossible to convert 
over half the sunlight they receive. And even light particles they can convert
often bounce off them without ever hitting an electron. But thanks to clever scientists 
and engineers and substantial government investment, solar panels are generating 
more electricity than ever. Anti-reflective coatings and patterns 
on the panels’ surface create more opportunities for incoming 
light particles to hit electrons. These techniques have increased commercial
solar panel efficiency from the low-teens to 25%, with experimental models reaching
up to 47%. What’s more, solar has gotten 
89% cheaper over the last decade, thanks in part to global supply chains
for other technologies that use the same materials. Together, these factors have 
made solar power the cheapest source of electricity 
on Earth. Countries including India, China, 
Egypt, and the US, have already taken
these new panels into the desert. Their massive solar farms range 
from 15 to 56 square kilometers, and when the sun is high in the sky, these plants can provide energy for hundreds of thousands
of local residents. But these farms also get
extremely hot. Light that solar cells don’t convert 
or reflect is absorbed as heat, which reduces a panel’s efficiency. And the cooling systems employed by many
farms can use huge amounts of energy powering fans or moving water 
to maintain optimal temperatures. Even with these systems, solar panels 
in the desert absorb far more heat than the natural sandy environment. This hasn’t been a problem
on the scale of existing solar farms. But if we tried to cover the Sahara, this effect could create massive changes
in the region's climate. Constructing solar farms already
disrupts local ecosystems, but a plant of this scale could 
dramatically transform the desert landscape. Thankfully, solar panels
aren’t our only option. And some of the largest solar plants 
in the world are trying a new approach: giant mirrors. Morocco’s Noor Power Plant, which will eventually cover roughly 
30 square kilometers of the Sahara, is a concentrated solar power plant. This design reflects light 
onto a receiver, which converts that energy to heat,
and then electricity. These mirrors still create a dangerous
temperature shift for local wildlife, but they have less potential
to transform the landscape. And since it takes time for the materials
being heated to cool off, these plants often continue producing
electricity past sunset. Whether they use panels or mirrors, industrial solar farms are often easy to
fit into existing energy infrastructure. However, getting their electricity beyond
local power grids is much more difficult. Some countries are working on ways to
connect electric grids across the globe. And many farm store energy
in massive batteries, or convert their electricity 
into clean gas that can be used later. But right now, these techniques are still
too expensive and inefficient to rely on. Worse still, industrial renewables
can share some of the same problems as fossil fuels, relying on destructive mining operations 
and carbon-emitting global supply chains. Fortunately, solar can
exist on many scales, from industrial solar farms 
to smaller installations that power individual buildings 
and rural communities. These projects can supplement energy use
or provide a passive source of energy for regions off the grid. And since solar panels rely 
on a few simple components, they’re quick to install 
and relatively easy to update. In fact, it’s this flexibility 
that enabled solar to become so cheap and ubiquitous 
over the last decade. So if we want to keep up with humanity's
rising energy use, we'll need answers both big and small.

**Transcript**:
Every day, the sands of the Sahara Desert
reach temperatures up to 80° Celsius. Stretching over roughly
nine million square kilometers, this massive desert receives about 
22 million terawatt hours of energy from the Sun every year. That’s well over 100 times more energy 
than humanity consumes annually. So, could covering the desert with solar 
panels solve our energy problems for good? Solar panels work when light particles hit
their surface with enough energy to knock electrons 
out of their stable bonds. On their journey back to stability, 
these electrons produce electricity. However, there’s a limit to how much power
panels can generate. Solar panels can only interact 
with certain wavelengths of light, making it impossible to convert 
over half the sunlight they receive. And even light particles they can convert
often bounce off them without ever hitting an electron. But thanks to clever scientists 
and engineers and substantial government investment, solar panels are generating 
more electricity than ever. Anti-reflective coatings and patterns 
on the panels’ surface create more opportunities for incoming 
light particles to hit electrons. These techniques have increased commercial
solar panel efficiency from the low-teens to 25%, with experimental models reaching
up to 47%. What’s more, solar has gotten 
89% cheaper over the last decade, thanks in part to global supply chains
for other technologies that use the same materials. Together, these factors have 
made solar power the cheapest source of electricity 
on Earth. Countries including India, China, 
Egypt, and the US, have already taken
these new panels into the desert. Their massive solar farms range 
from 15 to 56 square kilometers, and when the sun is high in the sky, these plants can provide energy for hundreds of thousands
of local residents. But these farms also get

and relatively easy to update. In fact, it’s this flexibility 
that enabled solar to become so cheap and ubiquitous 
over the last decade. So if we want to keep up with humanity's
rising energy use, we'll need answers both big and small.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
The largest rainforest in the world, 
the Amazon, exists between two rivers—
but not in the way you might think. At ground level, the Amazon River
and its tributaries weave their path. But above the canopy,
bigger waterways are on the move. These flying rivers are almost invisible,
but are essential to life on Earth. As rain seeps into the soil, trees draw water
back up through their roots and pump it through their trunks
for nourishment. The leaves and stems transpire,
or release, excess water in the form of vapor. In the Amazon, a fully grown tree transpires between 200
and 1,000 liters of water a day. This collective release creates
a startling phenomenon: huge jets of rapid, humid air
that constantly flow above the canopy. Dubbed “flying rivers”
by a Brazilian climatologist, these aerial waterways carry
about 20 billion tons of water through the air per day. This is more than the Amazon River’s
daily output into the ocean. Along the equator,
the trade winds blow from east to west. Caught in these winds, flying rivers flow
in the same direction before encountering the Andes. The mountains act like a giant barrier, causing the winds and rivers
to redirect southwards. When flying rivers meet
the masses of cold air, they grow heavier and release
torrents of water. In this way, they bring rain,
cooler temperatures, and humidity to much of South America. But these waterways are under threat. Clearing the Amazon
for agriculture and industry is already causing flying rivers 
to dry up, leading to drought and hotter temperatures
across South America. If this pattern continues, swaths of the continent may be reduced
to desert in a matter of decades. In response, a radical movement is working
intensely to keep the rainforest— and the flying rivers— alive. The northwest of the Peruvian Amazon
is the territory of the Wampís Nation, a community of over 15,000 people who manage over 130,000 square kilometers
of land. These Indigenous people have lived
in the rainforest for thousands of years, practicing sustainable hunting,
fishing, and agriculture. For the Wampís, protecting the rainforest has long meant
fighting invaders. Between the 15th and 17th centuries, Wampís people resisted
and expelled the Incas and later the Spanish colonists
who exploited the rainforest. Today, the Wampís Nation are still
battling extractive industries— and the policies that sanction them. For instance, since the 1960s, the Peruvian government has been
licensing the Wampís’ territory to corporations for gold mining
and oil extraction. These activities poison the rivers,
clear thousands of trees, and threaten the Wampís way of life. In 2015, after years of protests
and negotiations, the community formed the
Autonomous Territorial Government of the Wampís Nation. While the Wampís people remain
Peruvian citizens, they seek recognition as a government responsible for their own lands, forests,
and internal affairs. In its policies, the Wampís Nation
prioritizes collective land ownership, cultural preservation,
and conservation of animals, plants, and natural cycles
that protect the rainforest. This is the foundation of their
philosophy of Tarimat Pujut, or living in harmony with nature to ensure food, friendships,
and quality of life. The high, humid forest
of the Wampís Nation is crucial to the flying river cycle, transpiring over 34 million liters
of water a day that flow to Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. To track this output, Wampís scientists
measure rainfall, monitor the wind, and weigh water levels in leaves and soil. One of their climate goals is to defend
this and other natural systems, including native soil
that acts as a carbon sink and the forest itself as a fire barrier. The Wampís Nation constantly battles
corporations that threaten these systems. Between 2016 and 2018, the community fought illegal gold mining
along the Santiago River. They organized protests,
uncovered mercury pollution, guarded the area,
and attacked illegal machinery for months, eventually expelling the miners. And in 2017, the Wampís Nation
successfully petitioned a court to bar a private oil company
from their land. While these are significant victories, the Wampís Nation and other Indigenous
groups need more recognition and support. Indigenous people and local communities
live in and manage more than a quarter of the world’s land, but only have legal ownership
to a small percentage of it. And less than 1% of international climate
and forest funds go to their crucial conservation efforts. This is despite the fact that forests
managed by Indigenous people have better survival rates. The Amazon is often described with
language evocative of a giant organism— one that grows, dies, breathes
in carbon dioxide and exhales oxygen. The processes that sustain it
weave together in a complex and often invisible web of water, air,
soil, and human activity— both destructive and protective. We are far from understanding it
in its entirety, but some are closer than others.

**Transcript**:
The largest rainforest in the world, 
the Amazon, exists between two rivers—
but not in the way you might think. At ground level, the Amazon River
and its tributaries weave their path. But above the canopy,
bigger waterways are on the move. These flying rivers are almost invisible,
but are essential to life on Earth. As rain seeps into the soil, trees draw water
back up through their roots and pump it through their trunks
for nourishment. The leaves and stems transpire,
or release, excess water in the form of vapor. In the Amazon, a fully grown tree transpires between 200
and 1,000 liters of water a day. This collective release creates
a startling phenomenon: huge jets of rapid, humid air
that constantly flow above the canopy. Dubbed “flying rivers”
by a Brazilian climatologist, these aerial waterways carry
about 20 billion tons of water through the air per day. This is more than the Amazon River’s
daily output into the ocean. Along the equator,
the trade winds blow from east to west. Caught in these winds, flying rivers flow
in the same direction before encountering the Andes. The mountains act like a giant barrier, causing the winds and rivers
to redirect southwards. When flying rivers meet
the masses of cold air, they grow heavier and release
torrents of water. In this way, they bring rain,
cooler temperatures, and humidity to much of South America. But these waterways are under threat. Clearing the Amazon
for agriculture and industry is already causing flying rivers 
to dry up, leading to drought and hotter temperatures
across South America. If this pattern continues, swaths of the continent may be reduced
to desert in a matter of decades. In response, a radical movement is working
intensely to keep the rainforest— and the flying rivers— alive. The northwest of the Peruvian Amazon
is the territory of the Wampís Nation, a community of over 15,000 people who manage over 130,000 square kilometers
of land. These Indigenous people have lived
in the rainforest for thousands of years, practicing sustainable hunting,
fishing, and agriculture. For the Wampís, protecting the rainforest has long meant
fighting invaders. Between the 15th and 17th centuries, Wampís people resisted
and expelled the Incas and later the Spanish colonists
who exploited the rainforest. Today, the Wampís Nation are still
battling extractive industries— and the policies that sanction them. For instance, since the 1960s, the Peruvian government has been
licensing the Wampís’ territory to corporations for gold mining
and oil extraction. These activities poison the rivers,
clear thousands of trees, and threaten the Wampís way of life. In 2015, after years of protests
and negotiations, the community formed the
Autonomous Territorial Government of the Wampís Nation. While the Wampís people remain
Peruvian citizens, they seek recognition as a government responsible for their own lands, forests,
and internal affairs. In its policies, the Wampís Nation
prioritizes collective land ownership, cultural preservation,
and conservation of animals, plants, and natural cycles
that protect the rainforest. This is the foundation of their
philosophy of Tarimat Pujut, or living in harmony with nature to ensure food, friendships,
and quality of life. The high, humid forest
of the Wampís Nation is crucial to the flying river cycle, transpiring over 34 million liters
of water a day that flow to Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. To track this output, Wampís scientists
measure rainfall, monitor the wind, and weigh water levels in leaves and soil. One of their climate goals is to defend
this and other natural systems, including native soil
that acts as a carbon sink and the forest itself as a fire barrier. The Wampís Nation constantly battles
corporations that threaten these systems. Between 2016 and 2018, the community fought illegal gold mining
along the Santiago River. They organized protests,
uncovered mercury pollution, guarded the area,
and attacked illegal machinery for months, eventually expelling the miners. And in 2017, the Wampís Nation
successfully petitioned a court to bar a private oil company
from their land. While these are significant victories, the Wampís Nation and other Indigenous
groups need more recognition and support. Indigenous people and local communities
live in and manage more than a quarter of the world’s land, but only have legal ownership
to a small percentage of it. And less than 1% of international climate
and forest funds go to their crucial conservation efforts. This is despite the fact that forests
managed by Indigenous people have better survival rates. The Amazon is often described with
language evocative of a giant organism— one that grows, dies, breathes
in carbon dioxide and exhales oxygen. The processes that sustain it
weave together in a complex and often invisible web of water, air,
soil, and human activity— both destructive and protective. We are far from understanding it
in its entirety, but some are closer than others.

**Transcript**:
In the 1930s, the United States
was ravaged by syphilis. This sexually transmitted infection
afflicted nearly 1 in 10 Americans, producing painful sores and rashes 
that persisted for roughly two years. After these initial symptoms, late-stage
syphilis was known to cause organ damage, heart and brain disorders,
and even blindness. It was incredibly difficult 
to slow the disease’s spread. Experts cautioned against unprotected sex, but the infection could also be
passed during childbirth. Worse still, existing treatments
like mercury and bismuth were considered unreliable at best
and potentially harmful at worst. Today these heavy metals 
are classified as toxic, but at the time, doctors were still 
uncovering their dangerous side effects. Amidst the uncertainty, health care 
professionals had two key questions. Did late-stage syphilis warrant 
the risks of existing treatments? And, did the infected individual’s race
change how the disease progressed? Many physicians were convinced
syphilis affected the neurological systems of white patients and the cardiovascular systems
of Black patients. There was little evidence for this theory, but the U.S. Public Health Service 
was determined to investigate further. In 1932 they launched a massive experiment
in Tuskegee, Alabama. The town had already possessed
a small hospital, and the area was home to a large
population of potential participants. The PHS collaborated 
with local doctors and nurses to recruit roughly 400 Black men presumed 
to have noncontagious late-stage syphilis, as well as 200 non-syphilitic Black men 
for their control group. But their recruitment plan
centered on a lie. While the researchers planned to observe 
how syphilis would progress with minimal treatment, participants were told they would receive 
free drugs and care for their condition. At first, researchers gave the men
existing treatments, but these were soon replaced
with placebos. Under the false pretense of providing
a special remedy, researchers performed painful and invasive
spinal taps to investigate the disease’s 
neurological consequences. When patients died, the PHS
would swoop in to study the body by funding funerals in exchange
for autopsies. In their published studies, they listed 
the men as volunteers to obscure the circumstances under which
they’d been recruited. Outside Alabama, syphilis treatment 
was advancing. A decade after the study began, clinical trials confirmed that penicillin 
effectively cured the disease in its early stages. But in Tuskegee, researchers were
determined to keep pursuing what they considered vital research. They had yet to confirm their theories
about racial difference, and they believed they would never have
another opportunity to observe the long-term effects 
of untreated syphilis. The study’s leadership decided to withhold
knowledge of new treatments from their subjects. During World War II, researchers convinced
the local draft board to exempt men from their study, preventing them from enlisting 
and potentially accessing penicillin. The study even continued
through the 1950s when penicillin was shown to help
manage late-stage syphilis. By today’s bioethical standards, withholding treatment in a research study 
without a patient’s informed consent is morally abhorrent. But for a large part of the 20th century,
this practice was not uncommon. In the 1940s, US led studies 
in Guatemala infected numerous prisoners, sex workers, soldiers,
and mental health patients with sexually transmitted infections 
to study potential treatments. And other studies throughout 
the 50s and 60s saw doctors secretly infecting patients
with viral hepatitis or even cancer cells. Eventually, researchers began objecting 
to these unjust experiments. In the late 1960s, an STI contact tracer 
named Peter Buxtun convinced the PHS to consider 
ending the study. But after leadership decided against it, 
Buxtun sent his concerns to the press. In July of 1972, an exposé of the Tuskegee
study made headlines across the country. Following public outcry,
a federal investigation, and a lawsuit, the study was finally shut down in 1972—
40 years after it began and 30 after a treatment 
for syphilis had been found. No evidence of any racial difference
was discovered. When the study ended, only 74 
of the original 600 men were alive. 40 of their wives and 19 of their children
had contracted syphilis, presumably from their husbands
and fathers. In the wake of this tragedy, 
and concerns about similar experiments, Congress passed new regulations 
for ethical research and informed consent. But systemic racism continues to permeate
medical care and research throughout the US. To truly address these issues, the need for structural change, 
better access to care, and transparency in research 
remains urgent.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the 1930s, the United States
was ravaged by syphilis. This sexually transmitted infection
afflicted nearly 1 in 10 Americans, producing painful sores and rashes 
that persisted for roughly two years. After these initial symptoms, late-stage
syphilis was known to cause organ damage, heart and brain disorders,
and even blindness. It was incredibly difficult 
to slow the disease’s spread. Experts cautioned against unprotected sex, but the infection could also be
passed during childbirth. Worse still, existing treatments
like mercury and bismuth were considered unreliable at best
and potentially harmful at worst. Today these heavy metals 
are classified as toxic, but at the time, doctors were still 
uncovering their dangerous side effects. Amidst the uncertainty, health care 
professionals had two key questions. Did late-stage syphilis warrant 
the risks of existing treatments? And, did the infected individual’s race
change how the disease progressed? Many physicians were convinced
syphilis affected the neurological systems of white patients and the cardiovascular systems
of Black patients. There was little evidence for this theory, but the U.S. Public Health Service 
was determined to investigate further. In 1932 they launched a massive experiment
in Tuskegee, Alabama. The town had already possessed
a small hospital, and the area was home to a large
population of potential participants. The PHS collaborated 
with local doctors and nurses to recruit roughly 400 Black men presumed 
to have noncontagious late-stage syphilis, as well as 200 non-syphilitic Black men 
for their control group. But their recruitment plan
centered on a lie. While the researchers planned to observe 
how syphilis would progress with minimal treatment, participants were told they would receive 
free drugs and care for their condition. At first, researchers gave the men
existing treatments, but these were soon replaced
with placebos. Under the false pretense of providing
a special remedy, researchers performed painful and invasive
spinal taps to investigate the disease’s 
neurological consequences. When patients died, the PHS
would swoop in to study the body by funding funerals in exchange
for autopsies. In their published studies, they listed 
the men as volunteers to obscure the circumstances under which
they’d been recruited. Outside Alabama, syphilis treatment 
was advancing. A decade after the study began, clinical trials confirmed that penicillin 
effectively cured the disease in its early stages. But in Tuskegee, researchers were
determined to keep pursuing what they considered vital research. They had yet to confirm their theories
about racial difference, and they believed they would never have
another opportunity to observe the long-term effects 
of untreated syphilis. The study’s leadership decided to withhold
knowledge of new treatments from their subjects. During World War II, researchers convinced
the local draft board to exempt men from their study, preventing them from enlisting 
and potentially accessing penicillin. The study even continued
through the 1950s when penicillin was shown to help
manage late-stage syphilis. By today’s bioethical standards, withholding treatment in a research study 
without a patient’s informed consent is morally abhorrent. But for a large part of the 20th century,
this practice was not uncommon. In the 1940s, US led studies 
in Guatemala infected numerous prisoners, sex workers, soldiers,
and mental health patients with sexually transmitted infections 
to study potential treatments. And other studies throughout 
the 50s and 60s saw doctors secretly infecting patients
with viral hepatitis or even cancer cells. Eventually, researchers began objecting 
to these unjust experiments. In the late 1960s, an STI contact tracer 
named Peter Buxtun convinced the PHS to consider 
ending the study. But after leadership decided against it, 
Buxtun sent his concerns to the press. In July of 1972, an exposé of the Tuskegee
study made headlines across the country. Following public outcry,
a federal investigation, and a lawsuit, the study was finally shut down in 1972—
40 years after it began and 30 after a treatment 
for syphilis had been found. No evidence of any racial difference
was discovered. When the study ended, only 74 
of the original 600 men were alive. 40 of their wives and 19 of their children
had contracted syphilis, presumably from their husbands
and fathers. In the wake of this tragedy, 
and concerns about similar experiments, Congress passed new regulations 
for ethical research and informed consent. But systemic racism continues to permeate
medical care and research throughout the US. To truly address these issues, the need for structural change, 
better access to care, and transparency in research 
remains urgent.

**Transcript**:
For most humans, farts
are a welcome relief, an embarrassing incident, or 
an opportunity for a gas-based gag. But for many other creatures, 
farts are no laughing matter. Deep in the bowels of the animal kingdom,
farts can serve as tools of intimidation, acts of self-defense, and even
weapons of malodorous murder. The smelliest parts in the animal kingdom 
aren’t lethal, but they might ruin 
your trip to the beach. Seals and sea lions are well-known for
having truly foul farts due to their diet. Fish and shellfish are incredibly high
in sulfur. And during digestion, mammalian 
gut bacteria breaks down sulfur and amino acids containing sulfur
to produce hydrogen disulphide, a gas with a smell resembling rotten eggs. Seals and sea lions can’t help
their funky flatulence, But some animals deploy 
their farts strategically. Both the Eastern hognose snake and
the Sonoran coral snake use a tactic called cloacal popping. This involves sucking air 
into their cloaca— a hole used for urinating, defecating 
and reproduction— and then shooting it back out 
with a loud pop. These pops are no more dangerous
than a sea lion’s stench, but they are effective at scaring
off would-be predators. Meanwhile, the flatulence of beaded 
lacewing larvae are silent and deadly. Their farts contain a class
of chemical known as allomone that has evolved specifically
to paralyze termites. In fact, this allomone is so powerful, a single fart can immobilize multiple
termites for up to three hours, or even kill them outright. Either way, these toxic farts give 
beaded lacewing larvae plenty of time to devour prey 
up to three times their size. For some other animals, however,
holding farts in can be deadly. The Bolson pupfish is a small freshwater
fish found in northern Mexico. These fish feed on algae and other
small organisms in the sediment. But during the hottest days of the summer, this algae produces a lot of gas. If a pupfish doesn’t fart this gas out, 
it becomes buoyant— making it easy prey for passing birds. And it isn't just predators
they have to worry about. Excessive gas buildup can actually
burst their digestive systems. Researchers have found groups 
of several hundred dead pupfish that failed to fart 
for their lives. Fortunately for humanity, animal farts can’t directly harm a human—
outside making us lose our lunch. But in the right circumstances, some animal flatulence can create
surprisingly dangerous conditions. In the fall of 2015, a tripped smoke alarm forced a plane to make 
an emergency landing. Upon further inspection, officials
found that there was no fire— just the burps and farts of over 2,000
goats being transported in the cargo bay. The change in air pressure had caused
them to pass gas en masse. Thankfully, this story of farting goats 
had relatively low costs. But the most dangerous flatulence 
in the world may actually come from a similarly unassuming mammal:
the humble cow. There are nearly one billion
cows in the world, most of them raised specifically
for milk and meat. Like goats, cows are ruminants, which means their stomachs 
have four chambers, allowing them to chew, digest 
and regurgitate their food multiple times. This process helps them extract extra
nutrients from their food, but it also produces a lot of gas. This is particularly troubling
because one of the gases cows emit is methane, a major greenhouse gas that contributes 
heavily to global warming. One kilogram of methane traps dozens 
of times more heat in the atmosphere than one kilogram of carbon dioxide. And with each cow releasing 
up to 100 kilograms of methane every year, these animals have become 
one of the biggest contributors toward climate change. So while other animals may have louder,
fouler, or even more toxic farts, cow flatulence may be the most
dangerous gas ever to pass.

**Transcript**:
For most humans, farts
are a welcome relief, an embarrassing incident, or 
an opportunity for a gas-based gag. But for many other creatures, 
farts are no laughing matter. Deep in the bowels of the animal kingdom,
farts can serve as tools of intimidation, acts of self-defense, and even
weapons of malodorous murder. The smelliest parts in the animal kingdom 
aren’t lethal, but they might ruin 
your trip to the beach. Seals and sea lions are well-known for
having truly foul farts due to their diet. Fish and shellfish are incredibly high
in sulfur. And during digestion, mammalian 
gut bacteria breaks down sulfur and amino acids containing sulfur
to produce hydrogen disulphide, a gas with a smell resembling rotten eggs. Seals and sea lions can’t help
their funky flatulence, But some animals deploy 
their farts strategically. Both the Eastern hognose snake and
the Sonoran coral snake use a tactic called cloacal popping. This involves sucking air 
into their cloaca— a hole used for urinating, defecating 
and reproduction— and then shooting it back out 
with a loud pop. These pops are no more dangerous
than a sea lion’s stench, but they are effective at scaring
off would-be predators. Meanwhile, the flatulence of beaded 
lacewing larvae are silent and deadly. Their farts contain a class
of chemical known as allomone that has evolved specifically
to paralyze termites. In fact, this allomone is so powerful, a single fart can immobilize multiple
termites for up to three hours, or even kill them outright. Either way, these toxic farts give 
beaded lacewing larvae plenty of time to devour prey 
up to three times their size. For some other animals, however,
holding farts in can be deadly. The Bolson pupfish is a small freshwater
fish found in northern Mexico. These fish feed on algae and other
small organisms in the sediment. But during the hottest days of the summer, this algae produces a lot of gas. If a pupfish doesn’t fart this gas out, 
it becomes buoyant— making it easy prey for passing birds. And it isn't just predators
they have to worry about. Excessive gas buildup can actually
burst their digestive systems. Researchers have found groups 
of several hundred dead pupfish that failed to fart 
for their lives. Fortunately for humanity, animal farts can’t directly harm a human—
outside making us lose our lunch. But in the right circumstances, some animal flatulence can create
surprisingly dangerous conditions. In the fall of 2015, a tripped smoke alarm forced a plane to make 
an emergency landing. Upon further inspection, officials
found that there was no fire— just the burps and farts of over 2,000
goats being transported in the cargo bay. The change in air pressure had caused
them to pass gas en masse. Thankfully, this story of farting goats 
had relatively low costs. But the most dangerous flatulence 
in the world may actually come from a similarly unassuming mammal:
the humble cow. There are nearly one billion
cows in the world, most of them raised specifically
for milk and meat. Like goats, cows are ruminants, which means their stomachs 
have four chambers, allowing them to chew, digest 
and regurgitate their food multiple times. This process helps them extract extra
nutrients from their food, but it also produces a lot of gas. This is particularly troubling
because one of the gases cows emit is methane, a major greenhouse gas that contributes 
heavily to global warming. One kilogram of methane traps dozens 
of times more heat in the atmosphere than one kilogram of carbon dioxide. And with each cow releasing 
up to 100 kilograms of methane every year, these animals have become 
one of the biggest contributors toward climate change. So while other animals may have louder,
fouler, or even more toxic farts, cow flatulence may be the most
dangerous gas ever to pass.

**Transcript**:
Depression is the leading cause
of disability in the world. In the United States, close to 10% of adults 
struggle with depression. But because it's a mental illness, it can be a lot harder to understand
than, say, high cholesterol. One major source of confusion is
the difference between having depression and just feeling depressed. Almost everyone feels down
from time to time. Getting a bad grade, losing a job, having an argument, even a rainy day can bring on
feelings of sadness. Sometimes there's no trigger at all. It just pops up out of the blue. Then circumstances change, and those sad feelings disappear. Clinical depression is different. It's a medical disorder, and it won't go away 
just because you want it to. It lingers for at least 
two consecutive weeks, and significantly interferes 
with one's ability to work, play, or love. Depression can have a lot
of different symptoms: a low mood, loss of interest in things
you'd normally enjoy, changes in appetite, feeling worthless or excessively guilty, sleeping either too much or too little, poor concentration, restlessness or slowness, loss of energy, or recurrent thoughts of suicide. If you have at least five
of those symptoms, according to psychiatric guidelines, you qualify for a diagnosis of depression. And it's not just behavioral symptoms. Depression has physical manifestations
inside the brain. First of all, there are changes that could be seen
with the naked eye and X-ray vision. These include smaller frontal lobes
and hippocampal volumes. On a more microscale, depression is associated 
with a few things: the abnormal transmission or depletion
of certain neurotransmitters, especially serotonin, norepinephrine,
and dopamine, blunted circadian rhythms, or specific changes in the REM
and slow-wave parts of your sleep cycle, and hormone abnormalities, such as high cortisol and deregulation
of thyroid hormones. But neuroscientists still don't have
a complete picture of what causes depression. It seems to have to do with a complex
interaction between genes and environment, but we don't have a diagnostic tool that can accurately predict where
or when it will show up. And because depression symptoms
are intangible, it's hard to know who might look fine
but is actually struggling. According to the National Institute
of Mental Health, it takes the average person
suffering with a mental illness over ten years to ask for help. But there are very effective treatments. Medications and therapy complement
each other to boost brain chemicals. In extreme cases,
electroconvulsive therapy, which is like a controlled seizure
in the patient's brain, is also very helpful. Other promising treatments, like transcranial magnetic stimulation, are being investigated, too. So, if you know someone 
struggling with depression, encourage them, gently, to seek out
some of these options. You might even offer to help
with specific tasks, like looking up therapists in the area, or making a list of questions
to ask a doctor. To someone with depression, these first steps can seem insurmountable. If they feel guilty or ashamed, point out that depression 
is a medical condition, just like asthma or diabetes. It's not a weakness 
or a personality trait, and they shouldn't expect themselves
to just get over it anymore than they could will themselves
to get over a broken arm. If you haven't experienced 
depression yourself, avoid comparing it to times
you've felt down. Comparing what they're experiencing
to normal, temporary feelings of sadness can make them feel guilty for struggling. Even just talking about 
depression openly can help. For example, research shows that asking
someone about suicidal thoughts actually reduces their suicide risk. Open conversations about mental illness
help erode stigma and make it easier 
for people to ask for help. And the more patients seek treatment, the more scientists will learn
about depression, and the better the treatments will get.

Depression is the leading cause
of disability in the world. In the United States, close to 10% of adults 
struggle with depression. But because it's a mental illness, it can be a lot harder to understand
than, say, high cholesterol. One major source of confusion is
the difference between having depression and just feeling depressed. Almost everyone feels down
from time to time. Getting a bad grade, losing a job, having an argument, even a rainy day can bring on
feelings of sadness. Sometimes there's no trigger at all. It just pops up out of the blue. Then circumstances change, and those sad feelings disappear. Clinical depression is different. It's a medical disorder, and it won't go away 
just because you want it to. It lingers for at least 
two consecutive weeks, and significantly interferes 
with one's ability to work, play, or love. Depression can have a lot
of different symptoms: a low mood, loss of interest in things
you'd normally enjoy, changes in appetite, feeling worthless or excessively guilty, sleeping either too much or too little, poor concentration, restlessness or slowness, loss of energy, or recurrent thoughts of suicide. If you have at least five
of those symptoms, according to psychiatric guidelines, you qualify for a diagnosis of depression. And it's not just behavioral symptoms. Depression has physical manifestations
inside the brain. First of all, there are changes that could be seen
with the naked eye and X-ray vision. These include smaller frontal lobes
and hippocampal volumes. On a more microscale, depression is associated 
with a few things: the abnormal transmission or depletion
of certain neurotransmitters, especially serotonin, norepinephrine,
and dopamine, blunted circadian rhythms, or specific changes in the REM
and slow-wave parts of your sleep cycle, and hormone abnormalities, such as high cortisol and deregulation
of thyroid hormones. But neuroscientists still don't have
a complete picture of what causes depression. It seems to have to do with a complex
interaction between genes and environment, but we don't have a diagnostic tool that can accurately predict where
or when it will show up. And because depression symptoms
are intangible, it's hard to know who might look fine
but is actually struggling. According to the National Institute
of Mental Health, it takes the average person
suffering with a mental illness over ten years to ask for help. But there are very effective treatments. Medications and therapy complement
each other to boost brain chemicals. In extreme cases,
electroconvulsive therapy, which is like a controlled seizure
in the patient's brain, is also very helpful. Other promising treatments, like transcranial magnetic stimulation, are being investigated, too. So, if you know someone 
struggling with depression, encourage them, gently, to seek out
some of these options. You might even offer to help
with specific tasks, like looking up therapists in the area, or making a list of questions
to ask a doctor. To someone with depression, these first steps can seem insurmountable. If they feel guilty or ashamed, point out that depression 
is a medical condition, just like asthma or diabetes. It's not a weakness 
or a personality trait, and they shouldn't expect themselves
to just get over it anymore than they could will themselves
to get over a broken arm. If you haven't experienced 
depression yourself, avoid comparing it to times
you've felt down. Comparing what they're experiencing
to normal, temporary feelings of sadness can make them feel guilty for struggling. Even just talking about 
depression openly can help. For example, research shows that asking
someone about suicidal thoughts actually reduces their suicide risk. Open conversations about mental illness
help erode stigma and make it easier 
for people to ask for help. And the more patients seek treatment, the more scientists will learn
about depression, and the better the treatments will get.

**Transcript**:
Every 24 hours, wind generates 
enough kinetic energy to produce roughly 35 times more 
electricity than humanity uses each day. And unlike coal or oil, this resource
is totally renewed each day. So how can we harness this incredible
amount of energy, and is it possible to create a world
powered entirely by wind? The basic principle of wind energy 
is simple. A series of sails or blades
mounted around a rotor catch the wind and translate its kinetic energy 
into rotational energy. Traditional windmills use that rotational
energy to grind wheat or pump water. But in modern wind turbines, it turns 
a generator that creates electricity. This conversion from wind 
to rotational energy to electricity has defined wind turbines since their 
invention in the late 19th century. And there are three primary factors 
that determine just how much energy they can produce: the size and orientation
of the blades, the blade’s aerodynamic design, 
and the amount of wind turning the rotor. First up, blade orientation. Wind turbines can be designed 
with their rotor on a vertical axis or a horizontal axis. Vertical blades can pick up wind 
coming from any direction, but with much less efficiency
than horizontal axis rotors. Horizontal designs allow blades to capture
the wind’s full force by tracking the wind’s direction 
and turning to face it. This turning process is called yawing, and older windmills achieved it
through manual monitoring. Today, wind sensors and computer systems
automatically adjust the blades with expert precision
to capture as much energy as possible. Outside rotor orientation, the blades themselves need to be
shaped to maximize efficiency. While early designs used flat blades, modern blades are curved
like airplane wings. Wind travels faster over
the curved surface, creating a low-pressure pocket 
above the blade that forces it upwards. Since the amount of lift depends
on the angle at which the wind is moving 
relative to the blade, modern blades also incorporate a twist, optimizing how much of the blade can cut
into the wind. Made of fiberglass and resin layers, 
these blades are strong enough to operate through rain, lightning, 
and blistering sunlight for over 20 years. Even with aerodynamic blades
and a horizontal rotor, a wind turbine can only capture wind
if it's in a windy environment. Wind speeds typically increase the higher
into the atmosphere you travel. So today, most turbines are well
over 100 meters tall, with equally large rotor diameters. A turbine of this height and size can
capture a huge amount of wind, generating enough electricity every
year to power 750 American homes. A wind farm of 200 similarly sized 
turbines could power over 150,000 American homes—
or twice as many European homes— for an entire year. Offshore wind farms contain an even
greater number of even larger turbines. In 2019, the largest wind turbine 
ever built began operating off the coast 
of the Netherlands. With a rotor diameter of 220 meters,
just one of these turbines can meet the annual power needs 
of 16,000 European households. Despite its amazing potential, 
wind energy still faces challenges. Wind may be a free and unlimited fuel, but no matter how large or efficient 
a turbine is there's a mathematical limit to how much
wind it can convert into electricity. German physicist Albert Betz calculated that since some wind must remain 
to keep the blades spinning, a turbine can only ever capture 59.3% 
of the wind’s energy. Additionally, some people feel turbines
disrupt natural scenery, and wind energy’s intermittent 
availability can make it difficult to integrate 
into electrical grids. But even with these challenges,
modern wind turbines have made wind energy the most efficient and inexpensive 
source of electricity. Wind turbines already provide essential
energy for communities around the world. And for many farmers, 
hosting a wind turbine can be a reliable source 
of additional income. With continued improvements
in wind forecasting, electrical grid infrastructure
and energy storage, wind power might blow away
all our energy problems.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Every 24 hours, wind generates 
enough kinetic energy to produce roughly 35 times more 
electricity than humanity uses each day. And unlike coal or oil, this resource
is totally renewed each day. So how can we harness this incredible
amount of energy, and is it possible to create a world
powered entirely by wind? The basic principle of wind energy 
is simple. A series of sails or blades
mounted around a rotor catch the wind and translate its kinetic energy 
into rotational energy. Traditional windmills use that rotational
energy to grind wheat or pump water. But in modern wind turbines, it turns 
a generator that creates electricity. This conversion from wind 
to rotational energy to electricity has defined wind turbines since their 
invention in the late 19th century. And there are three primary factors 
that determine just how much energy they can produce: the size and orientation
of the blades, the blade’s aerodynamic design, 
and the amount of wind turning the rotor. First up, blade orientation. Wind turbines can be designed 
with their rotor on a vertical axis or a horizontal axis. Vertical blades can pick up wind 
coming from any direction, but with much less efficiency
than horizontal axis rotors. Horizontal designs allow blades to capture
the wind’s full force by tracking the wind’s direction 
and turning to face it. This turning process is called yawing, and older windmills achieved it
through manual monitoring. Today, wind sensors and computer systems
automatically adjust the blades with expert precision
to capture as much energy as possible. Outside rotor orientation, the blades themselves need to be
shaped to maximize efficiency. While early designs used flat blades, modern blades are curved
like airplane wings. Wind travels faster over
the curved surface, creating a low-pressure pocket 
above the blade that forces it upwards. Since the amount of lift depends
on the angle at which the wind is moving 
relative to the blade, modern blades also incorporate a twist, optimizing how much of the blade can cut
into the wind. Made of fiberglass and resin layers, 
these blades are strong enough to operate through rain, lightning, 
and blistering sunlight for over 20 years. Even with aerodynamic blades
and a horizontal rotor, a wind turbine can only capture wind
if it's in a windy environment. Wind speeds typically increase the higher
into the atmosphere you travel. So today, most turbines are well
over 100 meters tall, with equally large rotor diameters. A turbine of this height and size can
capture a huge amount of wind, generating enough electricity every
year to power 750 American homes. A wind farm of 200 similarly sized 
turbines could power over 150,000 American homes—
or twice as many European homes— for an entire year. Offshore wind farms contain an even
greater number of even larger turbines. In 2019, the largest wind turbine 
ever built began operating off the coast 
of the Netherlands. With a rotor diameter of 220 meters,
just one of these turbines can meet the annual power needs 
of 16,000 European households. Despite its amazing potential, 
wind energy still faces challenges. Wind may be a free and unlimited fuel, but no matter how large or efficient 
a turbine is there's a mathematical limit to how much
wind it can convert into electricity. German physicist Albert Betz calculated that since some wind must remain 
to keep the blades spinning, a turbine can only ever capture 59.3% 
of the wind’s energy. Additionally, some people feel turbines
disrupt natural scenery, and wind energy’s intermittent 
availability can make it difficult to integrate 
into electrical grids. But even with these challenges,
modern wind turbines have made wind energy the most efficient and inexpensive 
source of electricity. Wind turbines already provide essential
energy for communities around the world. And for many farmers, 
hosting a wind turbine can be a reliable source 
of additional income. With continued improvements
in wind forecasting, electrical grid infrastructure
and energy storage, wind power might blow away
all our energy problems.

**Transcript**:
Every 24 hours, wind generates 
enough kinetic energy to produce roughly 35 times more 
electricity than humanity uses each day. And unlike coal or oil, this resource
is totally renewed each day. So how can we harness this incredible
amount of energy, and is it possible to create a world
powered entirely by wind? The basic principle of wind energy 
is simple. A series of sails or blades
mounted around a rotor catch the wind and translate its kinetic energy 
into rotational energy. Traditional windmills use that rotational
energy to grind wheat or pump water. But in modern wind turbines, it turns 
a generator that creates electricity. This conversion from wind 
to rotational energy to electricity has defined wind turbines since their 
invention in the late 19th century. And there are three primary factors 
that determine just how much energy they can produce: the size and orientation
of the blades, the blade’s aerodynamic design, 
and the amount of wind turning the rotor. First up, blade orientation. Wind turbines can be designed 
with their rotor on a vertical axis or a horizontal axis. Vertical blades can pick up wind 
coming from any direction, but with much less efficiency
than horizontal axis rotors. Horizontal designs allow blades to capture
the wind’s full force by tracking the wind’s direction 
and turning to face it. This turning process is called yawing, and older windmills achieved it
through manual monitoring. Today, wind sensors and computer systems
automatically adjust the blades with expert precision
to capture as much energy as possible. Outside rotor orientation, the blades themselves need to be
shaped to maximize efficiency. While early designs used flat blades, modern blades are curved
like airplane wings. Wind travels faster over
the curved surface, creating a low-pressure pocket 
above the blade that forces it upwards. Since the amount of lift depends
on the angle at which the wind is moving 
relative to the blade, modern blades also incorporate a twist, optimizing how much of the blade can cut
into the wind. Made of fiberglass and resin layers, 
these blades are strong enough to operate through rain, lightning, 
and blistering sunlight for over 20 years. Even with aerodynamic blades
and a horizontal rotor, a wind turbine can only capture wind
if it's in a windy environment. Wind speeds typically increase the higher
into the atmosphere you travel. So today, most turbines are well
over 100 meters tall, with equally large rotor diameters. A turbine of this height and size can
capture a huge amount of wind, generating enough electricity every
year to power 750 American homes. A wind farm of 200 similarly sized 
turbines could power over 150,000 American homes—
or twice as many European homes— for an entire year. Offshore wind farms contain an even
greater number of even larger turbines. In 2019, the largest wind turbine 
ever built began operating off the coast 
of the Netherlands. With a rotor diameter of 220 meters,
just one of these turbines can meet the annual power needs 
of 16,000 European households. Despite its amazing potential, 
wind energy still faces challenges. Wind may be a free and unlimited fuel, but no matter how large or efficient 
a turbine is there's a mathematical limit to how much
wind it can convert into electricity. German physicist Albert Betz calculated that since some wind must remain 
to keep the blades spinning, a turbine can only ever capture 59.3% 
of the wind’s energy. Additionally, some people feel turbines
disrupt natural scenery, and wind energy’s intermittent 
availability can make it difficult to integrate 
into electrical grids. But even with these challenges,
modern wind turbines have made wind energy the most efficient and inexpensive 
source of electricity. Wind turbines already provide essential
energy for communities around the world. And for many farmers, 
hosting a wind turbine can be a reliable source 
of additional income. With continued improvements
in wind forecasting, electrical grid infrastructure
and energy storage, wind power might blow away
all our energy problems.

**Transcript**:
Billions of people deal with a nail-biting
habit at some point in their lives. Many will go to great lengths
to try to stop, employing strategies like rubbing
chili peppers on their cuticles, wearing gloves all day,
dipping their hands in salt, and envisioning bacteria crawling
on their fingers. And while not all of us are nail-biters, most of us do have a habit
we'd like to kick. So what's the best way to break one? Scientists define habits as behaviors
that are performed regularly, and cued subconsciously in response
to certain environments, whether it be a location, time of day,
or even an emotional state. They can include simple actions
like picking your hair when stressed, but also more complex practices ingrained
in daily routines, like staying up late
or brewing your coffee in the morning. If you do something frequently,
without much deliberation, then it’s likely a habit. They form because at some point your brain
learns that the behavior is beneficial. Let's say after opening a stressful email,
you bite your nails. This is rewarding,
as it’s enough to focus your attention, curbing your email fueled anxiety. Within your brain, positive experiences
can trigger the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that mediates
feelings of pleasure. Dopamine is also a driver
of neuroplasticity, meaning it can change
how your neurons wire and fire. Your brain builds connections
that link the reward with the behavior, driving you to repeat it. It also starts associating the behavior
with other cues, like your environment. Eventually, all it takes is the context
of sitting at your desk to subconsciously trigger
a nail-biting habit— no stressful email
or sense of relief required. Once established,
these cue-behavior-reward loops work fast, outpacing the decision-making process. You may find yourself
engaging in a habit before you have the chance
to notice and stop. But this can be a good thing
because not all habits are bad. They’re stored memories
of what’s worked in the past, which allow you to take swift
action in the present. One study estimated that on average, people spend more than 40% of their days
performing regularly repeated behaviors while their minds are occupied
with other thoughts. A seemingly automated morning routine,
for example, saves you both time
and precious mental energy. Still, many people have habits
that no longer serve them. Yet research shows that intentions alone
often fail to lead to long-term behavior change. This isn’t to say you can’t break a habit. Rather, by understanding
the basis of habits, you can create better plans
for changing them. For example, we know habits are often
cued by environments and routines. Lying in bed may cause you to endlessly
scroll through your phone, or watching TV on the couch may lead
you to grab a sugary snack. One of the most effective ways
to manage behavior is to identify these locations
or times of day. Then try to modify them
by changing your routine or creating obstacles that make
it more difficult to perform the habit in that space. Moving, switching jobs,
or even starting a new schedule, are particularly great times
to break a habit or build a new one. One 2005 study tracked university
students’ exercising, reading, and TV watching habits
before and after they transferred schools. When students were no longer around
old environments and routines, their habits, even the strong ones,
significantly changed. For behaviors like nail-biting 
or hair-pulling, a practice called habit reversal training
can be helpful. Developed by psychologists in the 1970s, the aim is to change a habit
by replacing it with another one that’s less detrimental. The training requires you to analyze
and understand your habit cues, so you can effectively intervene
at the right times. For example, if you tend to bite
your nails at work, preemptively keep a fidget toy
at your desk. Then, if a stressful email comes in, use the toy when you feel
the urge to bite your nails. Breaking a habit takes time, so remember to give yourself grace
and have patience through the process. And while many focus on their bad habits, it’s also worth celebrating the good ones that help us move swiftly and successfully
through our daily routines.

**Transcript**:
Billions of people deal with a nail-biting
habit at some point in their lives. Many will go to great lengths
to try to stop, employing strategies like rubbing
chili peppers on their cuticles, wearing gloves all day,
dipping their hands in salt, and envisioning bacteria crawling
on their fingers. And while not all of us are nail-biters, most of us do have a habit
we'd like to kick. So what's the best way to break one? Scientists define habits as behaviors
that are performed regularly, and cued subconsciously in response
to certain environments, whether it be a location, time of day,
or even an emotional state. They can include simple actions
like picking your hair when stressed, but also more complex practices ingrained
in daily routines, like staying up late
or brewing your coffee in the morning. If you do something frequently,
without much deliberation, then it’s likely a habit. They form because at some point your brain
learns that the behavior is beneficial. Let's say after opening a stressful email,
you bite your nails. This is rewarding,
as it’s enough to focus your attention, curbing your email fueled anxiety. Within your brain, positive experiences
can trigger the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that mediates
feelings of pleasure. Dopamine is also a driver
of neuroplasticity, meaning it can change
how your neurons wire and fire. Your brain builds connections
that link the reward with the behavior, driving you to repeat it. It also starts associating the behavior
with other cues, like your environment. Eventually, all it takes is the context
of sitting at your desk to subconsciously trigger
a nail-biting habit— no stressful email
or sense of relief required. Once established,
these cue-behavior-reward loops work fast, outpacing the decision-making process. You may find yourself
engaging in a habit before you have the chance
to notice and stop. But this can be a good thing
because not all habits are bad. They’re stored memories
of what’s worked in the past, which allow you to take swift
action in the present. One study estimated that on average, people spend more than 40% of their days
performing regularly repeated behaviors while their minds are occupied
with other thoughts. A seemingly automated morning routine,
for example, saves you both time
and precious mental energy. Still, many people have habits
that no longer serve them. Yet research shows that intentions alone
often fail to lead to long-term behavior change. This isn’t to say you can’t break a habit. Rather, by understanding
the basis of habits, you can create better plans
for changing them. For example, we know habits are often
cued by environments and routines. Lying in bed may cause you to endlessly
scroll through your phone, or watching TV on the couch may lead
you to grab a sugary snack. One of the most effective ways
to manage behavior is to identify these locations
or times of day. Then try to modify them
by changing your routine or creating obstacles that make
it more difficult to perform the habit in that space. Moving, switching jobs,
or even starting a new schedule, are particularly great times
to break a habit or build a new one. One 2005 study tracked university
students’ exercising, reading, and TV watching habits
before and after they transferred schools. When students were no longer around
old environments and routines, their habits, even the strong ones,
significantly changed. For behaviors like nail-biting 
or hair-pulling, a practice called habit reversal training
can be helpful. Developed by psychologists in the 1970s, the aim is to change a habit
by replacing it with another one that’s less detrimental. The training requires you to analyze
and understand your habit cues, so you can effectively intervene
at the right times. For example, if you tend to bite
your nails at work, preemptively keep a fidget toy
at your desk. Then, if a stressful email comes in, use the toy when you feel
the urge to bite your nails. Breaking a habit takes time, so remember to give yourself grace
and have patience through the process. And while many focus on their bad habits, it’s also worth celebrating the good ones that help us move swiftly and successfully
through our daily routines.

**Transcript**:
In 2003, Singapore’s national water agency
launched an unprecedented program. Using two new facilities, they planned to provide more than 50%
of their nation’s water supply by recycling wastewater. And yes, we do mean that wastewater. While this might seem
like a desperate decision, this program had been
planned for decades to ensure the island nation
never ran out of clean water. And today, as climate change
increases the frequency and duration of droughts worldwide, more and more regions
are facing this problem. But is it really safe to reuse anything
we flush down the toilet? To answer this, we have to understand exactly
what’s inside this cloudy cocktail. Wastewater is classified
into several types, but the primary three are: gray water used
in sinks, bathing, and laundry; yellow water containing just urine; and black water which has
come into contact with feces. Globally, we generate enough wastewater to fill about 400,000 Olympic-sized
swimming pools every day. In cities and towns with sewage systems, this wastewater combines
in underground pipes, which actually aren’t filled with feces. The average 4,000 liters
of sewage contains only a single liter
of solid fecal material. But sewage is still rife
with dangerous contaminants, including billions of pathogens
and microorganisms, trace chemicals,
and excess inorganic nutrients that can pollute rivers and lakes. So even if we aren’t planning
to drink this concoction, we still need to clean it; which is why sewer systems typically
run to wastewater treatment plants. Most plants remove major contaminants such as feces, pathogens,
and excess nitrogen from all the water they process. And this involves a ton of biological,
chemical, and physical interventions. Some of the most important include
settling tanks to remove large particles, biological reaction tanks where microbes
eat unwanted materials, and chemical disinfection processes
that kill pathogens. After these procedures,
typical treated wastewater in the US is already cleaner than most
natural bodies of water, making it safe to discharge
into rivers and lakes. If we plan on reusing the water
for non-potable purposes, such as irrigation or washing cars, it gets even further disinfected 
to prevent bacteria from growing during storage. But if we want it clean enough to drink, there's much more treatment to be done. One common process
includes microfiltration, where membranes with pores
one millionth of a meter across filter out small particles
and larger microorganisms. Next, the water passes through an even
finer reverse osmosis membrane, which can remove particles as small
as a tenth of a billionth of a meter. This membrane is semi-permeable,
allowing water to pass through, but stopping things like salt, viruses,
or unwanted chemicals. After this stage, UV lamps are
plunged into the water, emitting radiation that
permanently damages the genetic material
of any lingering life forms. Sometimes UV disinfection is then combined
with further disinfection processes that use chemicals like hydrogen peroxide to handle a wide range
of microorganisms and micropollutants. At this point, the treated wastewater
is tested rigorously. And if it passes, it can safely enter
the typical pipeline for drinking water, going through the standard
treatment procedures before joining the municipal supply. This approach is called
direct potable reuse, but even though it’s perfectly healthy, there’s still some concern
with such a direct system. Instead, most places opt
for indirect potable reuse, where the treated wastewater is discharged
to an environmental buffer, such as a reservoir, lake, wetland,
or groundwater aquifer. After some time in this environment, any lingering chemicals
from the treatment process will diffuse and degrade. Then, the water can be extracted
and enter the drinking water pipeline. Indirect potable reuse is the
process used in Singapore, and it's become an increasingly common
lifeline for arid regions in the US. But this system is only feasible in places
with centralized sewer systems and infrastructure for pumping
water into people's homes. This means it can’t help communities dealing with the most serious
sanitation issues, where access to clean water
is a daily struggle. Researchers are investigating smaller
scale technologies to recycle sewage into potable water on site. But helping these communities
in the long term will require us to take a closer look
at all the water we’ve been wasting.

finer reverse osmosis membrane, which can remove particles as small
as a tenth of a billionth of a meter. This membrane is semi-permeable,
allowing water to pass through, but stopping things like salt, viruses,
or unwanted chemicals. After this stage, UV lamps are
plunged into the water, emitting radiation that
permanently damages the genetic material
of any lingering life forms. Sometimes UV disinfection is then combined
with further disinfection processes that use chemicals like hydrogen peroxide to handle a wide range
of microorganisms and micropollutants. At this point, the treated wastewater
is tested rigorously. And if it passes, it can safely enter
the typical pipeline for drinking water, going through the standard
treatment procedures before joining the municipal supply. This approach is called
direct potable reuse, but even though it’s perfectly healthy, there’s still some concern
with such a direct system. Instead, most places opt
for indirect potable reuse, where the treated wastewater is discharged
to an environmental buffer, such as a reservoir, lake, wetland,
or groundwater aquifer. After some time in this environment, any lingering chemicals
from the treatment process will diffuse and degrade. Then, the water can be extracted
and enter the drinking water pipeline. Indirect potable reuse is the
process used in Singapore, and it's become an increasingly common
lifeline for arid regions in the US. But this system is only feasible in places
with centralized sewer systems and infrastructure for pumping
water into people's homes. This means it can’t help communities dealing with the most serious
sanitation issues, where access to clean water
is a daily struggle. Researchers are investigating smaller
scale technologies to recycle sewage into potable water on site. But helping these communities
in the long term will require us to take a closer look
at all the water we’ve been wasting.

**Transcript**:
In 2003, Singapore’s national water agency
launched an unprecedented program. Using two new facilities, they planned to provide more than 50%
of their nation’s water supply by recycling wastewater. And yes, we do mean that wastewater. While this might seem
like a desperate decision, this program had been
planned for decades to ensure the island nation
never ran out of clean water. And today, as climate change
increases the frequency and duration of droughts worldwide, more and more regions
are facing this problem. But is it really safe to reuse anything
we flush down the toilet? To answer this, we have to understand exactly
what’s inside this cloudy cocktail. Wastewater is classified
into several types, but the primary three are: gray water used
in sinks, bathing, and laundry; yellow water containing just urine; and black water which has
come into contact with feces. Globally, we generate enough wastewater to fill about 400,000 Olympic-sized
swimming pools every day. In cities and towns with sewage systems, this wastewater combines
in underground pipes, which actually aren’t filled with feces. The average 4,000 liters
of sewage contains only a single liter
of solid fecal material. But sewage is still rife
with dangerous contaminants, including billions of pathogens
and microorganisms, trace chemicals,
and excess inorganic nutrients that can pollute rivers and lakes. So even if we aren’t planning
to drink this concoction, we still need to clean it; which is why sewer systems typically
run to wastewater treatment plants. Most plants remove major contaminants such as feces, pathogens,
and excess nitrogen from all the water they process. And this involves a ton of biological,
chemical, and physical interventions. Some of the most important include
settling tanks to remove large particles, biological reaction tanks where microbes
eat unwanted materials, and chemical disinfection processes
that kill pathogens. After these procedures,
typical treated wastewater in the US is already cleaner than most
natural bodies of water, making it safe to discharge
into rivers and lakes. If we plan on reusing the water
for non-potable purposes, such as irrigation or washing cars, it gets even further disinfected 
to prevent bacteria from growing during storage. But if we want it clean enough to drink, there's much more treatment to be done. One common process
includes microfiltration, where membranes with pores
one millionth of a meter across filter out small particles
and larger microorganisms. Next, the water passes through an even
finer reverse osmosis membrane, which can remove particles as small
as a tenth of a billionth of a meter. This membrane is semi-permeable,

**Transcript**:
Many of us will experience some kind 
of trauma during our lifetime. Sometimes, we escape 
with no long-term effects. But for millions of us, 
those experiences linger, causing symptoms like flashbacks, nightmares, and negative thoughts 
that interfere with everyday life. This phenomenon, 
called post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, isn’t a personal failing; rather, it’s a treatable malfunction 
of certain biological mechanisms that allow us to cope 
with dangerous experiences. To understand PTSD, we first need to understand how the brain 
processes a wide range of ordeals, including the death of a loved one, domestic violence, injury or illness, abuse, rape, war, car accidents, and natural disasters. These events can bring on feelings 
of danger and helplessness, which activate the brain’s alarm system, known as 
the “fight-flight-freeze” response. When this alarm sounds, the hypothalamic, pituitary, 
and adrenal systems, known as the HPA axis, work together to send signals 
to the autonomic nervous system. That’s the network that communicates 
with adrenal glands and internal organs to help regulate functions like
heart rate, digestion, and respiration. These signals start a chemical cascade that floods the body with several 
different stress hormones, causing physiological changes 
that prepare the body to defend itself. Our heart rate speeds up, breathing quickens, and muscles tense. Even after a crisis is over, escalated levels of stress hormones 
may last for days, contributing to jittery feelings, nightmares, and other symptoms. For most people, these experiences
disappear within a few days to two weeks as their hormone levels stabilize. But a small percentage of those
who experience trauma have persistent problems —sometimes vanishing temporarily 
only to resurface months later. We don’t completely understand 
what’s happening in the brain, but one theory is that 
the stress hormone cortisol may be continuously activating 
the “fight-flight-freeze” response while reducing overall brain functioning,
leading to a number of negative symptoms. These symptoms often fall 
into four categories: intrusive thoughts, 
like dreams and flashbacks, avoiding reminders of the trauma, negative thoughts and feelings,
like fear, anger, and guilt, and “reactive” symptoms like irritability 
and difficulty sleeping. Not everyone has all these symptoms, or experiences them to the same extent 
and intensity. When problems last more than a month, 
PTSD is often diagnosed. Genetics, on-going overwhelming stress, and many risk factors 
like preexisting mental illnesses or lack of emotional support, likely play a role in determining 
who will experience PTSD. But the underlying cause 
is still a medical mystery. A major challenge of coping 
with PTSD is sensitivity to triggers, physical and emotional stimuli that the brain associates 
with the original trauma. These can be everyday sensations 
that aren’t inherently dangerous but prompt powerful physical 
and emotional reactions. For example, the smell of a campfire could evoke the memory of being trapped 
in a burning house. For someone with PTSD, that memory activates the same
neurochemical cascade as the original event. That then stirs up the same feelings 
of panic and helplessness as if they’re experiencing 
the trauma all over again. Trying to avoid these triggers,
which are sometimes unpredictable, can lead to isolation. That can leave people feeling invalidated, ignored, or misunderstood, like a pause button has been
pushed on their lives while the rest of the world 
continues around them. But, there are options. If you think you might 
be suffering from PTSD, the first step is an evaluation 
with a mental health professional who can direct you towards 
the many resources available. Psychotherapy can 
be very effective for PTSD, helping patients better 
understand their triggers. And certain medications 
can make symptoms more manageable, as can self- care practices,
like mindfulness and regular exercise. What if you notice signs of PTSD 
in a friend or family member? Social support, acceptance, and
empathy are key to helping and recovery. Let them know you believe their
account of what they’re experiencing, and that you don’t blame them 
for their reactions. If they’re open to it, encourage them to seek evaluation 
and treatment. PTSD has been called “the hidden wound” because it comes 
without outward physical signs. But even if it’s an invisible disorder, 
it doesn’t have to be a silent one.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Many of us will experience some kind 
of trauma during our lifetime. Sometimes, we escape 
with no long-term effects. But for millions of us, 
those experiences linger, causing symptoms like flashbacks, nightmares, and negative thoughts 
that interfere with everyday life. This phenomenon, 
called post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, isn’t a personal failing; rather, it’s a treatable malfunction 
of certain biological mechanisms that allow us to cope 
with dangerous experiences. To understand PTSD, we first need to understand how the brain 
processes a wide range of ordeals, including the death of a loved one, domestic violence, injury or illness, abuse, rape, war, car accidents, and natural disasters. These events can bring on feelings 
of danger and helplessness, which activate the brain’s alarm system, known as 
the “fight-flight-freeze” response. When this alarm sounds, the hypothalamic, pituitary, 
and adrenal systems, known as the HPA axis, work together to send signals 
to the autonomic nervous system. That’s the network that communicates 
with adrenal glands and internal organs to help regulate functions like
heart rate, digestion, and respiration. These signals start a chemical cascade that floods the body with several 
different stress hormones, causing physiological changes 
that prepare the body to defend itself. Our heart rate speeds up, breathing quickens, and muscles tense. Even after a crisis is over, escalated levels of stress hormones 
may last for days, contributing to jittery feelings, nightmares, and other symptoms. For most people, these experiences
disappear within a few days to two weeks as their hormone levels stabilize. But a small percentage of those
who experience trauma have persistent problems —sometimes vanishing temporarily 
only to resurface months later. We don’t completely understand 
what’s happening in the brain, but one theory is that 
the stress hormone cortisol may be continuously activating 
the “fight-flight-freeze” response while reducing overall brain functioning,
leading to a number of negative symptoms. These symptoms often fall 
into four categories: intrusive thoughts, 
like dreams and flashbacks, avoiding reminders of the trauma, negative thoughts and feelings,
like fear, anger, and guilt, and “reactive” symptoms like irritability 
and difficulty sleeping. Not everyone has all these symptoms, or experiences them to the same extent 
and intensity. When problems last more than a month, 
PTSD is often diagnosed. Genetics, on-going overwhelming stress, and many risk factors 
like preexisting mental illnesses or lack of emotional support, likely play a role in determining 
who will experience PTSD. But the underlying cause 
is still a medical mystery. A major challenge of coping 
with PTSD is sensitivity to triggers, physical and emotional stimuli that the brain associates 
with the original trauma. These can be everyday sensations 
that aren’t inherently dangerous but prompt powerful physical 
and emotional reactions. For example, the smell of a campfire could evoke the memory of being trapped 
in a burning house. For someone with PTSD, that memory activates the same
neurochemical cascade as the original event. That then stirs up the same feelings 
of panic and helplessness as if they’re experiencing 
the trauma all over again. Trying to avoid these triggers,
which are sometimes unpredictable, can lead to isolation. That can leave people feeling invalidated, ignored, or misunderstood, like a pause button has been
pushed on their lives while the rest of the world 
continues around them. But, there are options. If you think you might 
be suffering from PTSD, the first step is an evaluation 
with a mental health professional who can direct you towards 
the many resources available. Psychotherapy can 
be very effective for PTSD, helping patients better 
understand their triggers. And certain medications 
can make symptoms more manageable, as can self- care practices,
like mindfulness and regular exercise. What if you notice signs of PTSD 
in a friend or family member? Social support, acceptance, and
empathy are key to helping and recovery. Let them know you believe their
account of what they’re experiencing, and that you don’t blame them 
for their reactions. If they’re open to it, encourage them to seek evaluation 
and treatment. PTSD has been called “the hidden wound” because it comes 
without outward physical signs. But even if it’s an invisible disorder, 
it doesn’t have to be a silent one.
