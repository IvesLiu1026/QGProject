**Transcript**:
Is she turning towards you
or away from you? No one can agree. She's the mysterious subject
of Dutch master Johannes Vermeer's "Girl with the Pearl Earring," a painting often referred to
as the 'Mona Lisa of the North.' Belonging to a Dutch style of idealized, 
sometimes overly expressive paintings known as tronies, the "Girl with the Pearl Earring"
has the allure and subtlety characteristic 
of Vermeer's work. But this painting stands apart from
the quiet narrative scenes that we observe from afar in many
of Vermeer's paintings. A girl reading a letter. A piano lesson. A portrait artist at work. These paintings give us a sense of
intimacy while retaining their distance, a drawn curtain often emphasizes
the separation. We can witness a milkmaid
serenely pouring a bowl of milk, but that milk isn't for us. We're only onlookers. The studied composition
in Vermeer's paintings invokes a balanced harmony. With the checkered floor in many
of his works, Vermeer demonstrates his command
of perspective and foreshortening. That's a technique that uses distortion to give the illusion
of an object receding into the distance. Other elements, like sight lines,
mirrors, and light sources describe the moment through space
and position. The woman reading 
a letter by an open window is precisely placed so the window
can reflect her image back to the viewer. Vermeer would even hide the leg
of an easel for the sake of composition. The absence of these very elements brings
the "Girl with the Pearl Earring" to life. Vermeer's treatment of light and shadow,
or chiaroscuro, uses a dark, flat background to further
spotlight her three-dimensionality. Instead of being like a set piece
in a theatrical narrative scene, she becomes a psychological subject. Her eye contact and slightly parted lips,
as if she is about to say something, draw us into her gaze. Traditional subjects of portraiture
were often nobility or religious figures. So why was Vermeer painting 
an anonymous girl? In the 17th century, the city of Delft,
like the Netherlands in general, had turned against ruling aristocracy
and the Catholic church. After eight decades of rebellion
against Spanish power, the Dutch came to favor the idea
of self-rule and a political republic. Cities like Delft were unsupervised
by kings or bishops, so many artists like Vermeer
were left without traditional patrons. Fortunately, business innovation spearheaded by 
the Dutch East India Company transformed the economic landscape
in the Netherlands. It created a merchant class
and new type of patron. Wishing to be represented
in the paintings they financed, these merchants preferred 
middle class subjects depicted in spaces that looked
like their own homes surrounded by familiar objects. The maps that appear in Vermeer's
paintings, for example, were considered fashionable and worldly by the merchant class of what is known
as the Dutch Golden Age. The oriental turban worn by the "Girl
with the Pearl Earring" also emphasizes the worldliness
of the merchant class, and the pearl itself, a symbol of wealth,
is actually an exaggeration. Vermeer couldn't have afforded
a real pearl of its size. It was likely just a glass or tin drop
varnished to look like a pearl. This mirage of wealth is mirrored
in the painting itself. In greater context, the pearl appears
round and heavy, but a detailed view shows that it's
just a floating smudge of paint. Upon close inspection, we are reminded
of Vermeer's power as an illusion maker. While we may never know the real identity
of the "Girl with the Pearl Earring," we can engage with her portrait
in a way that is unforgettable. As she hangs in her permanent home
in the Mauritshuis Museum in The Hague, her presence is simultaneously penetrating
and subtle. In her enigmatic way, she represents
the birth of a modern perspective on economics, politics, and love.

in Vermeer's paintings invokes a balanced harmony. With the checkered floor in many
of his works, Vermeer demonstrates his command
of perspective and foreshortening. That's a technique that uses distortion to give the illusion
of an object receding into the distance. Other elements, like sight lines,
mirrors, and light sources describe the moment through space
and position. The woman reading 
a letter by an open window is precisely placed so the window
can reflect her image back to the viewer. Vermeer would even hide the leg
of an easel for the sake of composition. The absence of these very elements brings
the "Girl with the Pearl Earring" to life. Vermeer's treatment of light and shadow,
or chiaroscuro, uses a dark, flat background to further
spotlight her three-dimensionality. Instead of being like a set piece
in a theatrical narrative scene, she becomes a psychological subject. Her eye contact and slightly parted lips,
as if she is about to say something, draw us into her gaze. Traditional subjects of portraiture
were often nobility or religious figures. So why was Vermeer painting 
an anonymous girl? In the 17th century, the city of Delft,
like the Netherlands in general, had turned against ruling aristocracy
and the Catholic church. After eight decades of rebellion
against Spanish power, the Dutch came to favor the idea
of self-rule and a political republic. Cities like Delft were unsupervised
by kings or bishops, so many artists like Vermeer
were left without traditional patrons. Fortunately, business innovation spearheaded by 
the Dutch East India Company transformed the economic landscape
in the Netherlands. It created a merchant class
and new type of patron. Wishing to be represented
in the paintings they financed, these merchants preferred 
middle class subjects depicted in spaces that looked
like their own homes surrounded by familiar objects. The maps that appear in Vermeer's
paintings, for example, were considered fashionable and worldly by the merchant class of what is known
as the Dutch Golden Age. The oriental turban worn by the "Girl
with the Pearl Earring" also emphasizes the worldliness
of the merchant class, and the pearl itself, a symbol of wealth,
is actually an exaggeration. Vermeer couldn't have afforded
a real pearl of its size. It was likely just a glass or tin drop
varnished to look like a pearl. This mirage of wealth is mirrored
in the painting itself. In greater context, the pearl appears
round and heavy, but a detailed view shows that it's
just a floating smudge of paint. Upon close inspection, we are reminded
of Vermeer's power as an illusion maker. While we may never know the real identity
of the "Girl with the Pearl Earring," we can engage with her portrait
in a way that is unforgettable. As she hangs in her permanent home
in the Mauritshuis Museum in The Hague, her presence is simultaneously penetrating
and subtle. In her enigmatic way, she represents
the birth of a modern perspective on economics, politics, and love.

**Transcript**:
radiation is frightening at least certain types of it are I mean my Geiger counter doesn't go off near my mobile phone or the Wi-Fi router or my microwave that's because a Geiger counter only measures ionizing radiation that is radiation with enough energy to rip electrons off atoms and it's measured in units called sieverts if you're exposed to more than two sieverts all at once you'll probably die shortly after that but we're exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation all the time bananas for example are rich in potassium and some of that potassium is naturally radioactive so when you eat a banana you're actually exposed to about 0.1 micro sieverts of radiation that's one ten-millionth of a sievert let's use a banana for scale of radiation doses you know since people eat bananas we become radioactive too so you're actually exposed to more radiation if you sleep next to someone than if you sleep alone but I wouldn't worry about that because that dose is insignificant compared to the natural background radiation of Earth I mean there's ionizing radiation coming out of the soil and the rocks and the air and even from space the level of radiation here in Sydney is about 0.15 microsieverts per hour and that's about average globally the levels usually between point 1 and point 2 microsieverts per hour but there are places with significantly higher levels so who on earth you think receives the maximum dose of ionizing radiation let's answer that question by going to the most radioactive places on earth some places you'd expect to have high levels of radiation might surprise you I'm in her rush MA and that is the peace dome it was about 600 meters above that dome where the world's first nuclear bomb was detonated over a city it was detonated there to have maximum destructive impact with a level of radiation today almost 70 years later is only 0.3 microsieverts per hour this is the mine where uranium was discovered it's also the place where Marie Curie obtained her raw material 2007 microsiemens per hour it's about ten times the natural background that you would have nowadays most of the uranium has been removed but in this wall there's still a small piece and you can see under UV light it flores's look at that florescent uranium ore this is the lab of Marie Curie she won two Nobel prizes one in physics and one in chemistry and she conducted a lot of her work here and this is her office she would have said right there apparently there are only a few parts of this area which are still radioactive one is this doorknob what it climbs looked a lot much bit but that's like 10 times the background yes more that's it and another is the back of her chair you can still detect alpha particles coming off this spot right here apparently after she was worth being a lab she would come open the door leaving traces of radium here and then go and pull out her chair welcome to New Mexico this is the Trinity bomb test site where the world's first nuclear bomb was set off right here right in this spot this whole area was vaporized in fact there was so much heat liberated by that bomb that it fused all of the desert sand into this green glass and you can still find it here they've actually named this mineral after the test it's called Trinitite yeah this is the only place on earth that this has ever been made the level of radiation here is about 0.8 microsieverts an hour the Trinitite itself is a little bit more radioactive i've got readings of two or three microsieverts an hour off them now which place has higher levels of radiation than anywhere we've seen so far the answer is an airplane you know as you gain altitude there's less atmosphere above you to shield you from cosmic rays so the level of radiation inside the plane can go up to 0.5 microsieverts per hour at 18,000 feet up to one micro sievert per hour at 23,000 feet over two microsieverts per hour at 33,000 feet and over three microsieverts per hour at even higher altitudes and towards the poles that is two noble nuclear reactor number four it melted down on April 26 1986 so what happened was so much heat was generated inside that reactor that it basically blew the top off spreading radioactive isotopes throughout this whole surrounding area and over into Europe and that is why we can still detect the contamination here today now right now it's reading around five microsieverts an hour if I stayed here for one hour my body would receive a similar dose to what you'd receive when you get a dental x-ray so this is not a huge amount of radiation and one of the reasons why the radiation level is not too high is because they actually removed a couple meters worth of topsoil from this whole area then they dumped it somewhere that's why we can stand here we're driving into the Fukushima exclusion zone now I'm just watching as the levels on my Geiger counter go up as we approach the zone see those black bags at the side of the road the Japanese are doing now exactly what the people in Chernobyl did collecting up meters and meters of topsoil the mask is probably overkill it's just to stop radioactive dust from getting into my lungs this is definitely one of the most radioactive places where I've been even though the release of radioactive material was less than true noble only about 10% because it's much fresher only three years since the accident much less if it has decayed so I've been getting readings up around five to ten microsieverts an hour and I think we won't be staying here too long because of that I'm about to go into the hospital at Pripyat and this is where the firemen were taken after they fought the fires at the Chernobyl reactor and in the basement of this building they have left all of the firemen's clothing once they realized it was so contaminated they chucked it down there but you can see there's a huge pile how about Judah read upside the bear I'm getting half hundred Mike receive it's another bill that basement was the most radioactive place I visited and it's one of the most radioactive places on earth if I'd stay down there for one hour I would have received 2,000 micro sieverts that's a year's worth of natural background radiation every yellow pixel here represents a banana now that might seem like a lot but consider that in a CT scan the patient receives about 7,000 micro sieverts that's three years worth of natural background radiation it's been estimated that the people living around Fukushima will receive an additional 10,000 micro sieverts over their lifetime due to the nuclear power disaster for comparison us radiation workers are limited to a maximum of 50,000 microsieverts per year but that's less than another occupation astronaut an astronaut on the space station for six months will receive about 80,000 micro sieverts worth of radiation but not even they are exposed to the highest levels of ionizing radiation so can you guess who is the answer is a smokers lungs a smokers lungs on average receive 160,000 microsieverts worth of radiation every year that's due to the radioactive polonium and radioactive lead in the tobacco that they're smoking so not only are they exposed to carcinogens and toxins they also receive very high levels of radiation so it's not the people of Fukushima or Chernobyl or radiation workers or even astronauts who receive the highest doses of ionizing radiation that honor goes to your ordinary average smoker hey as you can see over the last few months I've been traveling around the world actually filming a documentary for television it should be on in the middle of next year but being in places like Chernobyl and Fukushima reminded me of this book the day of the Triffids it's about a post-apocalyptic world in which plants take over I know it sounds like a crazy idea but it's actually a brilliant book so you should really check it out if you're looking for something to do over the holidays now you can download

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 1 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since Question 1 does not directly address the concept of ionizing radiation ripping particles off atoms, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of ionizing radiation, I would select Question 1, but with the understanding that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

altitudes and towards the poles that is two noble nuclear reactor number four it melted down on April 26 1986 so what happened was so much heat was generated inside that reactor that it basically blew the top off spreading radioactive isotopes throughout this whole surrounding area and over into Europe and that is why we can still detect the contamination here today now right now it's reading around five microsieverts an hour if I stayed here for one hour my body would receive a similar dose to what you'd receive when you get a dental x-ray so this is not a huge amount of radiation and one of the reasons why the radiation level is not too high is because they actually removed a couple meters worth of topsoil from this whole area then they dumped it somewhere that's why we can stand here we're driving into the Fukushima exclusion zone now I'm just watching as the levels on my Geiger counter go up as we approach the zone see those black bags at the side of the road the Japanese are doing now exactly what the people in Chernobyl did collecting up meters and meters of topsoil the mask is probably overkill it's just to stop radioactive dust from getting into my lungs this is definitely one of the most radioactive places where I've been even though the release of radioactive material was less than true noble only about 10% because it's much fresher only three years since the accident much less if it has decayed so I've been getting readings up around five to ten microsieverts an hour and I think we won't be staying here too long because of that I'm about to go into the hospital at Pripyat and this is where the firemen were taken after they fought the fires at the Chernobyl reactor and in the basement of this building they have left all of the firemen's clothing once they realized it was so contaminated they chucked it down there but you can see there's a huge pile how about Judah read upside the bear I'm getting half hundred Mike receive it's another bill that basement was the most radioactive place I visited and it's one of the most radioactive places on earth if I'd stay down there for one hour I would have received 2,000 micro sieverts that's a year's worth of natural background radiation every yellow pixel here represents a banana now that might seem like a lot but consider that in a CT scan the patient receives about 7,000 micro sieverts that's three years worth of natural background radiation it's been estimated that the people living around Fukushima will receive an additional 10,000 micro sieverts over their lifetime due to the nuclear power disaster for comparison us radiation workers are limited to a maximum of 50,000 microsieverts per year but that's less than another occupation astronaut an astronaut on the space station for six months will receive about 80,000 micro sieverts worth of radiation but not even they are exposed to the highest levels of ionizing radiation so can you guess who is the answer is a smokers lungs a smokers lungs on average receive 160,000 microsieverts worth of radiation every year that's due to the radioactive polonium and radioactive lead in the tobacco that they're smoking so not only are they exposed to carcinogens and toxins they also receive very high levels of radiation so it's not the people of Fukushima or Chernobyl or radiation workers or even astronauts who receive the highest doses of ionizing radiation that honor goes to your ordinary average smoker hey as you can see over the last few months I've been traveling around the world actually filming a documentary for

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 1: What type of radiation is measured by a Geiger counter?**

However, this question does not directly ask about the unit of measurement for ionizing radiation. 

A more relevant question would be one that directly asks about the unit of measurement for ionizing radiation. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. 

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that **none of the generated MCQs** exactly match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one that is somewhat related, I would say:

**Question 2: What happens if you're exposed to more than two sieverts of radiation all at once?**

This question at least mentions the unit "sieverts", which is the correct unit of measurement for ionizing radiation.

But again, this is not a perfect match.

If I really had to choose an index, I would say: **2**, but please note that this is not a perfect match.

It would be better to generate a new MCQ that directly asks about the unit of measurement for ionizing radiation, such as:

**Question: Ionizing radiation is measured in units called ______.**

This would be a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
radiation is frightening at least certain types of it are I mean my Geiger counter doesn't go off near my mobile phone or the Wi-Fi router or my microwave that's because a Geiger counter only measures ionizing radiation that is radiation with enough energy to rip electrons off atoms and it's measured in units called sieverts if you're exposed to more than two sieverts all at once you'll probably die shortly after that but we're exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation all the time bananas for example are rich in potassium and some of that potassium is naturally radioactive so when you eat a banana you're actually exposed to about 0.1 micro sieverts of radiation that's one ten-millionth of a sievert let's use a banana for scale of radiation doses you know since people eat bananas we become radioactive too so you're actually exposed to more radiation if you sleep next to someone than if you sleep alone but I wouldn't worry about that because that dose is insignificant compared to the natural background radiation of Earth I mean there's ionizing radiation coming out of the soil and the rocks and the air and even from space the level of radiation here in Sydney is about 0.15 microsieverts per hour and that's about average globally the levels usually between point 1 and point 2 microsieverts per hour but there are places with significantly higher levels so who on earth you think receives the maximum dose of ionizing radiation let's answer that question by going to the most radioactive places on earth some places you'd expect to have high levels of radiation might surprise you I'm in her rush MA and that is the peace dome it was about 600 meters above that dome where the world's first nuclear bomb was detonated over a city it was detonated there to have maximum destructive impact with a level of radiation today almost 70 years later is only 0.3 microsieverts per hour this is the mine where uranium was discovered it's also the place where Marie Curie obtained her raw material 2007 microsiemens per hour it's about ten times the natural background that you would have nowadays most of the uranium has been removed but in this wall there's still a small piece and you can see under UV light it flores's look at that florescent uranium ore this is the lab of Marie Curie she won two Nobel prizes one in physics and one in chemistry and she conducted a lot of her work here and this is her office she would have said right there apparently there are only a few parts of this area which are still radioactive one is this doorknob what it climbs looked a lot much bit but that's like 10 times the background yes more that's it and another is the back of her chair you can still detect alpha particles coming off this spot right here apparently after she was worth being a lab she would come open the door leaving traces of radium here and then go and pull out her chair welcome to New Mexico this is the Trinity bomb test site where the world's first nuclear bomb was set off right here right in this spot this whole area was vaporized in fact there was so much heat liberated by that bomb that it fused all of the desert sand into this green glass and you can still find it here they've actually named this mineral after the test it's called Trinitite yeah this is the only place on earth that this has ever been made the level of radiation here is about 0.8 microsieverts an hour the Trinitite itself is a little bit more radioactive i've got readings of two or three microsieverts an hour off them now which place has higher levels of radiation than

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the element in bananas that contains radiation, and the correct answer is Potassium.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 mentions bananas as a source of radiation, but it asks about the average level of radiation exposure in Sydney, not about the element in bananas that contains radiation.

However, I can suggest that Question 3 is the closest match, although it's not a perfect match.

her raw material 2007 microsiemens per hour it's about ten times the natural background that you would have nowadays most of the uranium has been removed but in this wall there's still a small piece and you can see under UV light it flores's look at that florescent uranium ore this is the lab of Marie Curie she won two Nobel prizes one in physics and one in chemistry and she conducted a lot of her work here and this is her office she would have said right there apparently there are only a few parts of this area which are still radioactive one is this doorknob what it climbs looked a lot much bit but that's like 10 times the background yes more that's it and another is the back of her chair you can still detect alpha particles coming off this spot right here apparently after she was worth being a lab she would come open the door leaving traces of radium here and then go and pull out her chair welcome to New Mexico this is the Trinity bomb test site where the world's first nuclear bomb was set off right here right in this spot this whole area was vaporized in fact there was so much heat liberated by that bomb that it fused all of the desert sand into this green glass and you can still find it here they've actually named this mineral after the test it's called Trinitite yeah this is the only place on earth that this has ever been made the level of radiation here is about 0.8 microsieverts an hour the Trinitite itself is a little bit more radioactive i've got readings of two or three microsieverts an hour off them now which place has higher levels of radiation than anywhere we've seen so far the answer is an airplane you know as you gain altitude there's less atmosphere above you to shield you from cosmic rays so the level of radiation inside the plane can go up to 0.5 microsieverts per hour at 18,000 feet up to one micro sievert per hour at 23,000 feet over two microsieverts per hour at 33,000 feet and over three microsieverts per hour at even higher altitudes and towards the poles that is two noble nuclear reactor number four it melted down on April 26 1986 so what happened was so much heat was generated inside that reactor that it basically blew the top off spreading radioactive isotopes throughout this whole surrounding area and over into Europe and that is why we can still detect the contamination here today now right now it's reading around five microsieverts an hour if I stayed here for one hour my body would receive a similar dose to what you'd receive when you get a dental x-ray so this is not a huge amount of radiation and one of the reasons why the radiation level is not too high is because they actually removed a couple meters worth of topsoil from this whole area then they dumped it somewhere that's why we can stand here we're driving into the Fukushima exclusion zone now I'm just watching as the levels on my Geiger counter go up as we approach the zone see those black bags at the side of the road the Japanese are doing now exactly what the people in Chernobyl did collecting up meters and meters of topsoil the mask is probably overkill it's just to stop radioactive dust from getting into my lungs this is definitely one of the most radioactive places where I've been even though the release of radioactive material was less than true noble only about 10% because it's much fresher only three years since the accident much less if it has decayed so I've been getting readings up around five to ten microsieverts an hour and I think we won't be staying here too long because of that I'm about to go into the hospital at Pripyat and this is where the firemen were taken after they fought the fires at the Chernobyl reactor and in the basement of this building they have left all of the firemen's clothing once they realized it was so contaminated they chucked it down there but you can see there's a huge pile how about Judah read upside the bear I'm getting half hundred Mike receive it's another bill that basement was the most radioactive place I visited and it's one of the most radioactive places on earth if I'd stay down there for one hour I would have received 2,000 micro sieverts that's a year's worth of natural background radiation every yellow pixel here represents a banana now that might seem like a lot but consider that in a CT scan the patient receives about 7,000 micro sieverts that's three years worth of natural background radiation it's been estimated that the people living around Fukushima will receive an additional 10,000 micro sieverts over their lifetime due to the nuclear power disaster for comparison us radiation workers are limited to a maximum of 50,000 microsieverts per year but that's less than another occupation astronaut an astronaut on the space station for six months will receive about 80,000 micro sieverts worth of radiation but not even they are exposed to the highest levels of ionizing radiation so can you guess who is the answer is a smokers lungs a smokers lungs on average receive 160,000 microsieverts worth of radiation every year that's due to the radioactive polonium and radioactive lead in the tobacco that they're smoking so not only are they exposed to carcinogens and toxins they also receive very high levels of radiation so it's not the people of Fukushima or Chernobyl or radiation workers or even astronauts who receive the highest doses of ionizing radiation that honor goes to your ordinary average smoker hey as you can see over the last few months I've been traveling around the world actually filming a documentary for television it should be on in the middle of next year but being in places like Chernobyl and Fukushima reminded me of this book the day of the Triffids it's about a post-apocalyptic world in which plants take over I know it sounds like a crazy idea but it's actually a brilliant book so you should really check it out if you're looking for something to do over the holidays now you can download

**Transcript**:
radiation is frightening at least certain types of it are I mean my Geiger counter doesn't go off near my mobile phone or the Wi-Fi router or my microwave that's because a Geiger counter only measures ionizing radiation that is radiation with enough energy to rip electrons off atoms and it's measured in units called sieverts if you're exposed to more than two sieverts all at once you'll probably die shortly after that but we're exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation all the time bananas for example are rich in potassium and some of that potassium is naturally radioactive so when you eat a banana you're actually exposed to about 0.1 micro sieverts of radiation that's one ten-millionth of a sievert let's use a banana for scale of radiation doses you know since people eat bananas we become radioactive too so you're actually exposed to more radiation if you sleep next to someone than if you sleep alone but I wouldn't worry about that because that dose is insignificant compared to the natural background radiation of Earth I mean there's ionizing radiation coming out of the soil and the rocks and the air and even from space the level of radiation here in Sydney is about 0.15 microsieverts per hour and that's about average globally the levels usually between point 1 and point 2 microsieverts per hour but there are places with significantly higher levels so who on earth you think receives the maximum dose of ionizing radiation let's answer that question by going to the most radioactive places on earth some places you'd expect to have high levels of radiation might surprise you I'm in her rush MA and that is the peace dome it was about 600 meters above that dome where the world's first nuclear bomb was detonated over a city it was detonated there to have maximum

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 1 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since Question 1 does not directly address the concept of ionizing radiation ripping particles off atoms, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of ionizing radiation, I would select Question 1, but with the understanding that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 1: What type of radiation is measured by a Geiger counter?**

However, this question does not directly ask about the unit of measurement for ionizing radiation. 

A more relevant question would be one that directly asks about the unit of measurement for ionizing radiation. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. 

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that **none of the generated MCQs** exactly match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one that is somewhat related, I would say:

**Question 2: What happens if you're exposed to more than two sieverts of radiation all at once?**

This question at least mentions the unit "sieverts", which is the correct unit of measurement for ionizing radiation.

But again, this is not a perfect match.

If I really had to choose an index, I would say: **2**, but please note that this is not a perfect match.

It would be better to generate a new MCQ that directly asks about the unit of measurement for ionizing radiation, such as:

**Question: Ionizing radiation is measured in units called ______.**

This would be a perfect match.

die shortly after that but we're exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation all the time bananas for example are rich in potassium and some of that potassium is naturally radioactive so when you eat a banana you're actually exposed to about 0.1 micro sieverts of radiation that's one ten-millionth of a sievert let's use a banana for scale of radiation doses you know since people eat bananas we become radioactive too so you're actually exposed to more radiation if you sleep next to someone than if you sleep alone but I wouldn't worry about that because that dose is insignificant compared to the natural background radiation of Earth I mean there's ionizing radiation coming out of the soil and the rocks and the air and even from space the level of radiation here in Sydney is about 0.15 microsieverts per hour and that's about average globally the levels usually between point 1 and point 2 microsieverts per hour but there are places with significantly higher levels so who on earth you think receives the maximum dose of ionizing radiation let's answer that question by going to the most radioactive places on earth some places you'd expect to have high levels of radiation might surprise you I'm in her rush MA and that is the peace dome it was about 600 meters above that dome where the world's first nuclear bomb was detonated over a city it was detonated there to have maximum destructive impact with a level of radiation today almost 70 years later is only 0.3 microsieverts per hour this is the mine where uranium was discovered it's also the place where Marie Curie obtained her raw material 2007 microsiemens per hour it's about ten times the natural background that you would have nowadays most of the uranium has been removed but in this wall there's still a small piece and you can see under UV light it flores's look at that florescent uranium ore this is the lab of Marie Curie she won two Nobel prizes one in physics and one in chemistry and she conducted a lot of her work here and this is her office she would have said right there apparently there are only a few parts of this area which are still radioactive one is this doorknob what it climbs looked a lot much bit but that's like 10 times the background yes more that's it and another is the back of her chair you can still detect alpha particles coming off this spot right here apparently after she was worth being a lab she would come open the door leaving traces of radium here and then go and pull out her chair welcome to New Mexico this is the Trinity bomb test site where the world's first nuclear bomb was set off right here right in this spot this whole area was vaporized in fact there was so much heat liberated by that bomb that it fused all of the desert sand into this green glass and you can still find it here they've actually named this mineral after the test it's called Trinitite yeah this is the only place on earth that this has ever been made the level of radiation here is about 0.8 microsieverts an hour the Trinitite itself is a little bit more radioactive i've got readings of two or three microsieverts an hour off them now which place has higher levels of radiation than anywhere we've seen so far the answer is an airplane you know as you gain altitude there's less atmosphere above you to shield you from cosmic rays so the level of radiation inside the plane can go up to 0.5 microsieverts per hour at 18,000 feet up to one micro sievert per hour at 23,000 feet over two microsieverts per hour at 33,000 feet and over three microsieverts per hour at even higher altitudes and towards the poles that is two noble nuclear reactor number four it melted down on April 26 1986 so what happened was so much heat was generated inside that reactor that it basically blew the top off spreading radioactive isotopes throughout this whole surrounding area and over into Europe and that is why we can still detect the contamination here today now right now it's reading around five microsieverts an hour if I stayed here for one hour my body would receive a similar dose to what you'd receive when you get a dental x-ray so this is not a huge amount of radiation and one of the reasons why the radiation level is not too high is because they actually removed a couple meters worth of topsoil from this whole area then they dumped it somewhere that's why we can stand here we're driving into the Fukushima exclusion zone now I'm just watching as the levels on my Geiger counter go up as we approach the zone see those black bags at the side of the road the Japanese are doing now exactly what the people in Chernobyl did collecting up meters and meters of topsoil the mask is probably overkill it's just to stop radioactive dust from getting into my lungs this is definitely one of the most radioactive places where I've been even though the release of radioactive material was less than true noble only about 10% because it's much fresher only three years since the accident much less if it has decayed so I've been getting readings up around five to ten microsieverts an hour and I think we won't be staying here too long because of that I'm about to go into the hospital at Pripyat and this is where the firemen were taken after they fought the fires at the Chernobyl reactor and in the basement of this building they have left all of the firemen's clothing once they realized it was so contaminated they chucked it down there but you can see there's a huge pile how about Judah read upside the bear I'm getting half hundred Mike receive it's another bill that basement was the most radioactive place I visited and it's one of the most radioactive places on earth if I'd stay down there for one hour I would have received 2,000 micro sieverts that's a year's worth of natural background radiation every yellow pixel here represents a banana now that might seem like a lot but consider that in a CT scan the patient receives about 7,000 micro sieverts that's three years worth of natural background radiation it's been estimated that the people living around Fukushima will receive an additional 10,000 micro sieverts over their lifetime due to the nuclear power disaster for comparison us radiation workers are limited to a maximum of 50,000 microsieverts per year but that's less than another occupation astronaut an astronaut on the space station for six months will receive about 80,000 micro sieverts worth of radiation but not even they are exposed to the highest levels of ionizing radiation so can you guess who is the answer is a smokers lungs a smokers lungs on average receive 160,000 microsieverts worth of radiation every year that's due to the radioactive polonium and radioactive lead in the tobacco that they're smoking so not only are they exposed to carcinogens and toxins they also receive very high levels of radiation so it's not the people of Fukushima or Chernobyl or radiation workers or even astronauts who receive the highest doses of ionizing radiation that honor goes to your ordinary average smoker hey as you can see over the last few months I've been traveling around the world actually filming a documentary for television it should be on in the middle of next year but being in places like Chernobyl and Fukushima reminded me of this book the day of the Triffids it's about a post-apocalyptic world in which plants take over I know it sounds like a crazy idea but it's actually a brilliant book so you should really check it out if you're looking for something to do over the holidays now you can download

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the element in bananas that contains radiation, and the correct answer is Potassium.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 mentions bananas as a source of radiation, but it asks about the average level of radiation exposure in Sydney, not about the element in bananas that contains radiation.

However, I can suggest that Question 3 is the closest match, although it's not a perfect match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3

Please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs do not contain a question that directly asks about the element in bananas that contains radiation.

**Transcript**:
we're used to dividing how people vote in elections according to the categories of right wing and left wing but there might be another way of labeling an electorate that taps into something broader and deeper in human personality we might apportion people into the camps of romantic and classical voters which one might you be part of here is some of what separates these two fundamental electoral types romantic believes that a far better world could be just around the corner if only bold and swift action could be taken if we entered an agreement or scrapped an agreement started a war or ended a war the romantic considers a degree of impatience to be a vital resource in governing a nation they may not think too badly of a bit of anger either so long as it's handled correctly you can be too forgiving after all the romantic is excited by how things might ideally be and always judges what currently exists in the world by the standard of a better imagined alternative most of the time the current state of things arouses them to intense disappointment as they consider the injustice a--'s prevarications compromises and timidity of almost everyone in government for their part the classical voter is highly distrustful of sudden gestures and actions they pay special attention to what can go wrong they're very concerned to mitigate the downside they're aware that most things could be a lot worse before condemning a policy they consider the standard of policy across history and may regard a current arrangement as bearable under the circumstances their view of people is fundamentally rather dark they believe that everyone is probably slightly worse than they seem they feel humans have deeply dangerous impulses lusts and drives and believe that the task of politics is to try and contain them rather than liberate genius strength beauty or benevolence high ideals make them nervous they are led by a desire not to make anything worse insofar as they hope for improvement it's in a cautious modest way they dare to suppose that the world may be a marginally better place in about 300 years time romantics see a lot that's wrong with the world and feel confident about analyzing who might be to blame for it perhaps this particular social group or that class a problem can't just be no one's fault and therefore the task of politics is to identify the wrongdoers and respond appropriately romantics feel a basic trust in their own capacity for purity they are sure they would be unable to be as shabby as their enemies whom they can therefore attack with a relatively clean conscience classical voters also notice what's wrong but they're highly aware of their own capacity for sinfulness and error which makes them hesitant about apportioning blame they recognize how easily they might have been active wrongdoers if circumstances have been different and suppose that no one has a monopoly on righteousness they would suggest that evil is pretty proportionately distributed across all groups and classes and that a priority is therefore for us to tolerantly cut each other slack at every turn romantic voters believe that everything great in history is the result of talented individuals taking destiny into their hands and struggling against the inertia and conservatism of the mass and most importantly of institutions classical voters are deeply worried by the possibility of lone actors taking matters into their hands and through natural weaknesses which all of us even the most intelligent are afflicted by creating disaster they are therefore on the side of legally grounded extremely slow-moving institutions that are designed to restrain individual power and contain the capacity of any one person to shift the direction of the group to quickly romantic voters believe it's possible to understand a situational issue so clearly one can be sure of complete justice and rightness vertol those who don't agree don't have to be listened to politely they are evidently wrong and can be silenced or sidelined as required classical voters are extremely alert to the possibility of error in their own and others analyses of policy but they are therefore committed to hearing and tolerating dissenting views in which they suspect a portion of the truth may always be lodged [Music] romantic voters feel that the best way for a nation to be safe in the world is for it to seem prominently strong classical voters feel that the best way to be safe in the world is to be thought well of and will therefore avoid actions that could upset alarm or confuse neighbors they're aware of how easily strength arouses the desire of others to be equally strong back they suspect the best way to proceed might be to train and private for the worst but extend a hand of friendship at every public turn both romantic and classical political orientations have important truths to impart neither is wholly right or wrong they need to be balanced and none of us are in any case ever simply one or the other but because a good political landscape requires a judicious balance of throath temperaments at this point in history in many countries it might be the classical electoral attitude whose distinctive claims and wisdom we need to listen to most intently and which is most ripe for rediscovery you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 1: Knowledge**

However, the options provided in Question 1 do not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, based on the content and intent of the questions, I would recommend:

**Question 3: Application**

 Options: A. A government official who is a romantic voter might respond to a social crisis by immediately implementing a new policy to address the issue., B. A government official who is a classical voter might respond to a social crisis by first conducting a thorough analysis of the situation and considering multiple perspectives., C. A romantic voters believe that the best way to be safe in the world is for a nation to seem prominently strong., D. Classical voters believe that the best way to be safe in the world is to be thought well of by neighbors.

Although the options do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, option A implies that romantic voters value bold and swift action, which aligns with the idea that impatience is a vital resource for governing a nation.

However, if I had to choose an index, I would say that **Question 1** is the closest match in terms of content, but **Question 3** is a better match in terms of intent.

If I had to redesign a question to match the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

**New Question:** Which type of voter believes that impatience is a vital resource for governing a nation?
Options: A. Romantic voter, B. Classical voter

This new question directly matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent.

**Transcript**:
So a few years ago, I did something really brave, or some would say really stupid. I ran for Congress. For years, I had existed
safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run. The sitting congresswoman
had been in my district since 1992. She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her
in a Democratic primary. But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo. The polls, however,
told a very different story. My pollsters told me
that I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win. But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart
in a New York City congressional race. I swore I was going to win. I had the endorsement
from the New York Daily News, the Wall Street Journal
snapped pictures of me on election day, and CNBC called it one of the hottest
races in the country. I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy
an Indian girl was running. But on election day, the polls were right, and I only got 19 percent of the vote, and the same papers
that said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes. Don't do the math. It was humiliating. Now, before you get the wrong idea, this is not a talk
about the importance of failure. Nor is it about leaning in. I tell you the story
of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time
in my entire life that I had done something
that was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect. And I'm not alone: so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate
towards careers and professions that they know
they're going to be great in, that they know they're
going to be perfect in, and it's no wonder why. Most girls are taught
to avoid risk and failure. We're taught to smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's. Boys, on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars
and then just jump off headfirst. And by the time they're adults, whether they're negotiating a raise
or even asking someone out on a date, they're habituated
to take risk after risk. They're rewarded for it. It's often said in Silicon Valley, no one even takes you seriously
unless you've had two failed start-ups. In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave. Some people worry
about our federal deficit, but I, I worry about our bravery deficit. Our economy, our society,
we're just losing out because we're not raising
our girls to be brave. The bravery deficit is why
women are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look. In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders
handled an assignment that was too difficult for them. She found that bright girls
were quick to give up. The higher the IQ,
the more likely they were to give up. Bright boys, on the other hand, found the difficult material
to be a challenge. They found it energizing. They were more likely
to redouble their efforts. What's going on? Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys
in every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability. The difference is in how boys
and girls approach a challenge. And it doesn't just end in fifth grade. An HP report found
that men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent
of the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100 percent
of the qualifications. 100 percent. This study is usually invoked
as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence. But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized
to aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious. (Applause) And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take
less risks in our careers. And so those 600,000 jobs
that are open right now in computing and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy
is being left behind on all the innovation and problems
women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect. (Applause) So in 2012, I started a company
to teach girls to code, and what I found
is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave. Coding, it's an endless process
of trial and error, of trying to get the right command
in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference
between success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying
to build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection. We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect. Every Girls Who Code teacher
tells me the same story. During the first week,
when the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over
and she'll say, "I don't know what code to write." The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor. If she didn't know any better,
she'd think that her student spent the past 20 minutes
just staring at the screen. But if she presses undo a few times, she'll see that her student
wrote code and then deleted it. She tried, she came close, but she didn't get it exactly right. Instead of showing
the progress that she made, she'd rather show nothing at all. Perfection or bust. It turns out that our girls
are really good at coding, but it's not enough
just to teach them to code. My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor
at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours
with computer science students. When the guys are struggling
with an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, "Professor, there's something
wrong with my code." The girls will come in and say, "Professor, there's something
wrong with me." We have to begin to undo
the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it
with building a sisterhood that lets girls know
that they are not alone. Because trying harder
is not going to fix a broken system. I can't tell you how many women tell me, "I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling. When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network
cheering them on, they will build incredible things, and I see this every day. Take, for instance,
two of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run -- yes, Tampon Run -- to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming. Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love
for her new country by building an app
to help Americans get to the polls. Or a 16-year-old girl
who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer
is benign or malignant in the off chance
that she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer. These are just
three examples of thousands, thousands of girls who have been
socialized to be imperfect, who have learned to keep trying,
who have learned perseverance. And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé, they will not defer their dreams. And those dreams have never been
more important for our country. For the American economy,
for any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind
half our population. We have to socialize our girls
to be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now. We cannot wait for them
to learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old. We have to teach them
to be brave in schools and early in their careers, when it has the most potential
to impact their lives and the lives of others, and we have to show them
that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous. And so I need each of you
to tell every young woman you know -- your sister, your niece,
your employee, your colleague -- to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach
girls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement
of young women who are brave and who will build
a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you. It's such a powerful vision you have.
You have a vision. Tell me how it's going. How many girls
are involved now in your program? Reshma Saujani: Yeah.
So in 2012, we taught 20 girls. This year we'll teach 40,000
in all 50 states. (Applause) And that number is really powerful, because last year we only graduated
7,500 women in computer science. Like, the problem is so bad that we can make
that type of change quickly. CA: And you're working with some
of the companies in this room even, who are welcoming
graduates from your program? RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft
to Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there. And if you're not signed up,
I'm going to find you, because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code
classroom in their office. CA: And you have some stories
back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams,
good things happen. RS: Great things happen. I mean, I think that it's crazy to me
to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all
consumer purchases are made by women. Women use social media at a rate
of 600 percent more than men. We own the Internet, and we should be building
the companies of tomorrow. And I think when companies
have diverse teams, and they have incredible women
that are part of their engineering teams, they build awesome things,
and we see it every day. CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there.
You're doing incredibly important work. This whole community is cheering you on.
More power to you. Thank you. RS: Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So a few years ago, I did something really brave, or some would say really stupid. I ran for Congress. For years, I had existed
safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run. The sitting congresswoman
had been in my district since 1992. She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her
in a Democratic primary. But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo. The polls, however,
told a very different story. My pollsters told me
that I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win. But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart

**Transcript**:
Since the dawn of humanity, an estimated 100.8 billion
people have lived and died, a number that increases by about
.8% of the world's population each year. What happens to all 
of those people's bodies after they die and will the planet eventually
run out of burial space? When a person's heart stops beating, the body passes through several
stages before it begins decomposing. Within minutes after death, the blood begins settling in
the lower-most parts of the body. Usually eight to twelve hours later, the skin in those areas is discolored
by livor mortis, or post-mortem stain. And while at the moment of death
the body's muscles relax completely in a condition called primary flaccidity, they stiffen about two to six hours later
in what's known as rigor mortis. This stiffening spreads 
through the muscles, and its speed can be affected by age,
gender, and the surrounding environment. The body also changes temperature, usually cooling off 
to match its environment. Next comes decomposition, the process by which bacteria and insects
break apart the body. Many factors affect 
the rate of decomposition. There is, however, a basic guide of the
effect of the environment on decompositon called Casper's Law. It says that if all other 
factors are equal, a body exposed to air decomposes twice
as fast as one immersed in water and eight times as fast 
as one buried in earth. Soil acidity also greatly 
affects bone preservation. High-acidity soils with 
a pH of less than 5.3 will rapidly decompose bone, whereas in a neutral or basic soil
with a pH of 7 or more, a skeleton can remain in relatively
good condition for centuries. Different cultures throughout history have
developed unique approaches to burials. As far back as 
the first Neanderthal burials, death was accompanied by rituals, like the positioning, coloring,

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Since the dawn of humanity, an estimated 100.8 billion
people have lived and died, a number that increases by about
.8% of the world's population each year. What happens to all 
of those people's bodies after they die and will the planet eventually
run out of burial space? When a person's heart stops beating, the body passes through several
stages before it begins decomposing. Within minutes after death, the blood begins settling in
the lower-most parts of the body. Usually eight to twelve hours later, the skin in those areas is discolored
by livor mortis, or post-mortem stain. And while at the moment of death
the body's muscles relax completely in a condition called primary flaccidity, they stiffen about two to six hours later
in what's known as rigor mortis. This stiffening spreads 
through the muscles, and its speed can be affected by age,
gender, and the surrounding environment. The body also changes temperature, usually cooling off 
to match its environment. Next comes decomposition, the process by which bacteria and insects
break apart the body. Many factors affect 
the rate of decomposition. There is, however, a basic guide of the
effect of the environment on decompositon called Casper's Law. It says that if all other 
factors are equal, a body exposed to air decomposes twice
as fast as one immersed in water and eight times as fast 
as one buried in earth. Soil acidity also greatly 
affects bone preservation. High-acidity soils with 
a pH of less than 5.3 will rapidly decompose bone, whereas in a neutral or basic soil
with a pH of 7 or more, a skeleton can remain in relatively
good condition for centuries. Different cultures throughout history have
developed unique approaches to burials. As far back as 
the first Neanderthal burials, death was accompanied by rituals, like the positioning, coloring,
or decorating of corpses. Traditional Christian burials decorate
the body in dress, while in traditional Islam, a body is wrapped in a piece 
of ritual fabric with the face oriented toward Mecca. Traditional Hindus ceremonially burn
the body, and Zoroastrians, followers of one of the

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related.

The ground truth MCQ is about post-mortem stain, which is mentioned in the transcript as "livor mortis." While there isn't a direct match, Question 3 mentions "Casper's Law," which is related to the decomposition process, but it doesn't specifically mention post-mortem stain.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the concept of post-mortem changes, I would suggest Question 2, which is about decomposition. But please note that this is a weak match, as the question intent and options are not directly related to post-mortem stain.

If I had to provide an index, I would say Question 2 is the closest match, but I want to emphasize that it's not a strong match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content of the transcript, I can identify a question that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the first burial observed in human history, and the correct answer is "Neanderthals." While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 5 mentions different burial practices, including traditional Hindu burial, which involves burning the body, and traditional Zoroastrian burial, which involves exposing the body to scavenging birds. However, it does not specifically ask about the first burial observed in human history.

That being said, if I had to choose a question that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 5, as it discusses different burial practices, but it is not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
It begins with a bit of discomfort and soon becomes a pressing sensation
that's impossible to ignore. Finally, it's all you can think about, and out of sheer desperation, you go on a hunt for a bathroom
until "ahh." Humans should urinate at least
four to six times a day, but occasionally, the pressures of modern
life forces us to clench and hold it in. How bad is this habit,
and how long can our bodies withstand it? The answers lie in the workings
of the bladder, an oval pouch 
that sits inside the pelvis. Surrounding this structure 
are several other organs that together make up the whole
urinary system. Two kidneys, two ureters, two urethral sphincters, and a urethra. Constantly trickling down from the kidneys
is the yellowish liquid known as urine. The kidneys make urine from a mix
of water and the body's waste products, funneling the unwanted fluid
into two muscular tubes called ureters. These carry it downward into
the hollow organ known as the bladder. This organ's muscular wall is made of
tissue called detrusor muscle which relaxes as the bladder fills
allowing it to inflate like a balloon. As the bladder gets full, 
the detrusor contracts. The internal urethral sphincter
automatically and involuntarily opens, and the urine is released. Whooshing downwards, 
the fluid enters the urethra and stops short at the external
urethral sphincter. This works like a tap. When you want to delay urinating,
you keep the sphincter closed. When you want to release it,
you can voluntarily open the flood gates. But how do you sense 
your bladder's fullness so you know when to pee? Inside the layers of detrusor muscles
are millions of stretch receptors that get triggered as the bladder fills. They send signals along your nerves
to the sacral region in your spinal cord. A reflex signal travels back to
your bladder, making the detrusor muscle 
contract slightly and increasing the bladder's pressure
so you're aware that it's filling up. Simultaneously, the internal 
urethral sphincter opens. This is called the micturition reflex. The brain can counter it if it's not
a good time to urinate by sending another signal to contract
the external urethral sphincter. With about 150 to 200 milliliters of urine
inside of it, the bladder's muscular wall 
is stretched enough for you to sense 
that there's urine within. At about 400 to 500 milliliters,
the pressure becomes uncomfortable. The bladder can go on stretching,
but only to a point. Above 1,000 milliliters, it may burst. Most people would lose bladder
control before this happens, but in very rare cases, such as when as a person can't sense
the need to urinate, the pouch can rupture painfully
requiring surgery to fix. But under normal circumstances, your decision to urinate stops the brain's
signal to the external urethral sphincter, causing it to relax 
and the bladder to empty. The external urethral sphincter
is one of the muscles of the pelvic floor, and it provides support to the urethra
and bladder neck. It's lucky we have these 
pelvic floor muscles because placing pressure on the system
by coughing, sneezing, laughing, or jumping could cause bladder leakage. Instead, the pelvic floor muscles
keep the region sealed until you're ready to go. But holding it in for too long, forcing out your urine too fast, or urinating without proper
physical support may over time weaken or overwork
that muscular sling. That can lead to an overactive
pelvic floor, bladder pain, urgency, or urinary incontinence. So in the interest of long-term health, it's not a great habit to hold your pee. But in the short term, at least,
your body and brain have got you covered, so you can conveniently choose
your moment of sweet release.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking about the composition of the bladder wall. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 7, which asks about the function of the detrusor muscle in the bladder. Although the questions are not identical, they both relate to the bladder's structure and function.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them directly ask about the composition of the bladder wall. But Question 7 mentions the detrusor muscle, which is a key component of the bladder wall.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 7.

Note: The generated MCQs could be improved by adding a question that directly asks about the composition of the bladder wall, with options that include muscle, ligament, bone, skin, etc. This would provide a more direct match with the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It begins with a bit of discomfort and soon becomes a pressing sensation
that's impossible to ignore. Finally, it's all you can think about, and out of sheer desperation, you go on a hunt for a bathroom
until "ahh." Humans should urinate at least
four to six times a day, but occasionally, the pressures of modern
life forces us to clench and hold it in. How bad is this habit,
and how long can our bodies withstand it? The answers lie in the workings
of the bladder, an oval pouch 
that sits inside the pelvis. Surrounding this structure 
are several other organs that together make up the whole
urinary system. Two kidneys, two ureters, two urethral sphincters, and a urethra. Constantly trickling down from the kidneys
is the yellowish liquid known as urine. The kidneys make urine from a mix
of water and the body's waste products, funneling the unwanted fluid
into two muscular tubes called ureters. These carry it downward into
the hollow organ known as the bladder. This organ's muscular wall is made of
tissue called detrusor muscle which relaxes as the bladder fills
allowing it to inflate like a balloon. As the bladder gets full, 
the detrusor contracts. The internal urethral sphincter
automatically and involuntarily opens, and the urine is released. Whooshing downwards, 
the fluid enters the urethra and stops short at the external
urethral sphincter. This works like a tap. When you want to delay urinating,
you keep the sphincter closed. When you want to release it,
you can voluntarily open the flood gates. But how do you sense 
your bladder's fullness so you know when to pee? Inside the layers of detrusor muscles
are millions of stretch receptors that get triggered as the bladder fills. They send signals along your nerves
to the sacral region in your spinal cord. A reflex signal travels back to
your bladder, making the detrusor muscle 
contract slightly and increasing the bladder's pressure
so you're aware that it's filling up. Simultaneously, the internal 
urethral sphincter opens. This is called the micturition reflex. The brain can counter it if it's not
a good time to urinate by sending another signal to contract
the external urethral sphincter. With about 150 to 200 milliliters of urine
inside of it, the bladder's muscular wall 
is stretched enough for you to sense 
that there's urine within. At about 400 to 500 milliliters,
the pressure becomes uncomfortable. The bladder can go on stretching,
but only to a point. Above 1,000 milliliters, it may burst. Most people would lose bladder
control before this happens, but in very rare cases, such as when as a person can't sense
the need to urinate, the pouch can rupture painfully
requiring surgery to fix. But under normal circumstances, your decision to urinate stops the brain's
signal to the external urethral sphincter, causing it to relax 
and the bladder to empty. The external urethral sphincter
is one of the muscles of the pelvic floor, and it provides support to the urethra
and bladder neck. It's lucky we have these 
pelvic floor muscles because placing pressure on the system
by coughing, sneezing, laughing, or jumping could cause bladder leakage. Instead, the pelvic floor muscles
keep the region sealed until you're ready to go. But holding it in for too long, forcing out your urine too fast, or urinating without proper
physical support may over time weaken or overwork
that muscular sling. That can lead to an overactive
pelvic floor, bladder pain, urgency, or urinary incontinence. So in the interest of long-term health, it's not a great habit to hold your pee. But in the short term, at least,
your body and brain have got you covered, so you can conveniently choose
your moment of sweet release.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the volume of urine at which the bladder wall is stretched enough to sense that there's urine within. The closest generated MCQ is Question 5, which asks about what happens to the bladder when it becomes too full. Although the question intent is not exactly the same, it is related to the bladder's capacity and its behavior when it is full.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more similar in terms of question intent, I would suggest that none of the generated MCQs are a good match. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 5 is the closest.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 5

Please note that this is not an exact match, and it would be better to generate a new MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
What do a seventeen-year-old Pakistani, a Norwegian explorer, a Tibetan monk, and an American pastor have in common? They were all awarded 
the Nobel Peace Prize. Among the top prestigious awards
in the world, this prize has honored 
some of the most celebrated and revered international figures
and organizations in history. To understand how it all got started,
we have to go back to the 1800s. Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel was then mostly known 
for the invention of dynamite, a breakthrough which launched his career
as a successful inventor and businessman. 30 years later, he had become
extremely wealthy, but never married, and had no children. When his will was opened after his death, it came as a surprise that his fortune
was to be used for five prizes in physics, chemistry, 
medicine, literature, and peace. These prizes illustrated his lifelong
commitment to sciences and his passion for literature. But what about peace? Because Nobel's name was tied
to inventions used in the war industry, many have assumed that he created 
the peace prize out of regret. However, this is all speculation
as he never expressed any such sentiments, and his inventions were also used
for constructive purposes. Instead, many historians connect Alfred
Nobel's interest for the peace cause to his decade-long friendship 
and correspondence with an Austrian pacifist 
named Bertha Von Suttner. Von Suttner was one of the leaders
of the international peace movement, and in 1905, after Nobel's death, she became the first woman
to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Nobel's will outlined three criteria
for the Peace Prize, which unlike the other 
Sweden-based prizes, would be administered in Norway. Disarmament, peace congresses,
and brotherhood between nations. These standards have since been expanded to include 
other ways of promoting peace, such as human rights and negotiations. And the prize doesn't just have to go
to one person. About a third of Noble Peace Prizes
have been shared by two or three laureates. So how do nominations for the prize work? According to the Nobel Foundation, a valid nomination can come from
a member of a national assembly, state government, or an international court. Eligible nominators also include
university rectors, professors of the social sciences, 
history, philosophy, law, and theology, and previous recipients 
of the Peace Prize. But if you want to know more about
who was recently nominated, you'll have to be patient. All information about nominations
remains secret for 50 years. Take Martin Luther King Jr. We didn't actually know who nominated him
until 2014. His nominators turned out 
to be the Quakers, who had won the prize previously, and eight members 
of the Swedish Parliament. There's no limit to the number of times
a person or organization can be nominated. In fact, Jane Addams, recognized as the founder 
of social work in the United States, was nominated 91 times before
finally being awarded the prize. The absence of a laureate can also
be symbolic. The 1948 decision not to award the prize
following the death of Mahatma Gandhi has been interpreted as an attempt
to respectfully honor the so-called missing laureate. As with the other Nobel Prizes, the Peace Prize can't be 
awarded posthumously. The secret selection process 
takes almost a year, and is carried out by 
the five appointed members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee who are forbidden from having
any official political function in Norway. Starting with a large pool of nominations, exceeding 300 in recent years, they access each candidate's work
and create a short list. Finally, the chairman 
of the Nobel Committee publicly announces 
the laureate in October. The awards ceremony takes place
on December 10th, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. The prize itself includes a gold medal inscribed with the Latin words,
"Pro pace et fraternitate gentium," or "For the peace and brotherhood of men," as well as a diploma 
and a large cash prize. Recently, it's been 
8 million Swedish kronor, or roughly a million US dollars, which is split in the case 
of multiple laureates. And while laureates can use the prize
money as they choose, in recent years, many have donated it
to humanitarian or social causes. For many years, the Nobel Peace Prize
was predominately awarded to European and North American men. But in recent years, significant changes
have been taking place, making the prize more global than ever. 23 organizations and 103 individuals, that's 87 men and 16 women, have made up the 126 Nobel Peace Prize 
laureates in history. They include Desmond Tutu for his
nonviolent campaign against apartheid in South Africa, Jody Williams for her campaign to ban
and clear anti-personnel mines, Rigoberta Menchú Tum for her work
for social justice and reconciliation based on respect for the rights
of indigenous peoples, Martti Ahtisaari for his efforts
to resolve international conflicts in Namibia, Kosovo, and Indonesia, and Aung San Suu Kyi for her nonviolent
struggle for democracy and human rights in Myanmar. They're just a few examples of the people
who have inspired us, challenged us, and demonstrated through their actions that there are many paths to peace.

of the international peace movement, and in 1905, after Nobel's death, she became the first woman
to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Nobel's will outlined three criteria
for the Peace Prize, which unlike the other 
Sweden-based prizes, would be administered in Norway. Disarmament, peace congresses,
and brotherhood between nations. These standards have since been expanded to include 
other ways of promoting peace, such as human rights and negotiations. And the prize doesn't just have to go
to one person. About a third of Noble Peace Prizes
have been shared by two or three laureates. So how do nominations for the prize work? According to the Nobel Foundation, a valid nomination can come from
a member of a national assembly, state government, or an international court. Eligible nominators also include
university rectors, professors of the social sciences, 
history, philosophy, law, and theology, and previous recipients 
of the Peace Prize. But if you want to know more about
who was recently nominated, you'll have to be patient. All information about nominations
remains secret for 50 years. Take Martin Luther King Jr. We didn't actually know who nominated him
until 2014. His nominators turned out 
to be the Quakers, who had won the prize previously, and eight members 
of the Swedish Parliament. There's no limit to the number of times
a person or organization can be nominated. In fact, Jane Addams, recognized as the founder 
of social work in the United States, was nominated 91 times before
finally being awarded the prize. The absence of a laureate can also
be symbolic. The 1948 decision not to award the prize
following the death of Mahatma Gandhi has been interpreted as an attempt
to respectfully honor the so-called missing laureate. As with the other Nobel Prizes, the Peace Prize can't be 
awarded posthumously. The secret selection process 
takes almost a year, and is carried out by 
the five appointed members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee who are forbidden from having
any official political function in Norway. Starting with a large pool of nominations, exceeding 300 in recent years, they access each candidate's work
and create a short list. Finally, the chairman 
of the Nobel Committee publicly announces 
the laureate in October. The awards ceremony takes place
on December 10th, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. The prize itself includes a gold medal inscribed with the Latin words,
"Pro pace et fraternitate gentium," or "For the peace and brotherhood of men," as well as a diploma 
and a large cash prize. Recently, it's been 
8 million Swedish kronor, or roughly a million US dollars, which is split in the case 
of multiple laureates. And while laureates can use the prize
money as they choose, in recent years, many have donated it
to humanitarian or social causes. For many years, the Nobel Peace Prize
was predominately awarded to European and North American men. But in recent years, significant changes
have been taking place, making the prize more global than ever. 23 organizations and 103 individuals, that's 87 men and 16 women, have made up the 126 Nobel Peace Prize 
laureates in history. They include Desmond Tutu for his
nonviolent campaign against apartheid in South Africa, Jody Williams for her campaign to ban
and clear anti-personnel mines, Rigoberta Menchú Tum for her work
for social justice and reconciliation based on respect for the rights
of indigenous peoples, Martti Ahtisaari for his efforts
to resolve international conflicts in Namibia, Kosovo, and Indonesia, and Aung San Suu Kyi for her nonviolent
struggle for democracy and human rights in Myanmar. They're just a few examples of the people
who have inspired us, challenged us, and demonstrated through their actions that there are many paths to peace.

**Transcript**:
What do a seventeen-year-old Pakistani, a Norwegian explorer, a Tibetan monk, and an American pastor have in common? They were all awarded 
the Nobel Peace Prize. Among the top prestigious awards
in the world, this prize has honored 
some of the most celebrated and revered international figures
and organizations in history. To understand how it all got started,
we have to go back to the 1800s. Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel was then mostly known 
for the invention of dynamite, a breakthrough which launched his career
as a successful inventor and businessman. 30 years later, he had become
extremely wealthy, but never married, and had no children. When his will was opened after his death, it came as a surprise that his fortune
was to be used for five prizes in physics, chemistry, 
medicine, literature, and peace. These prizes illustrated his lifelong
commitment to sciences and his passion for literature. But what about peace? Because Nobel's name was tied
to inventions used in the war industry, many have assumed that he created 
the peace prize out of regret. However, this is all speculation
as he never expressed any such sentiments, and his inventions were also used
for constructive purposes. Instead, many historians connect Alfred
Nobel's interest for the peace cause to his decade-long friendship

**Transcript**:
Prolonged space travel takes
a severe toll on the human body. Microgravity impairs muscle
and bone growth, and high doses of radiation
cause irreversible mutations. As we seriously consider the human
species becoming space-faring, a big question stands. Even if we break free 
from Earth's orbit and embark on long-duration
journeys among the stars, can we adapt to the extreme
environments of space? This won't be the first time that humans
have adapted to harsh environments and evolved superhuman capabilities. Not fantastical powers like laser vision
or invisibility, but physiological adaptations
for survival in tough conditions. For example, on the Himalayan mountains where the highest elevation 
is nine kilometers above sea level, an unacclimated lowland human
will experience symptoms of hypoxia, commonly known as mountain sickness. At these altitudes, the body usually
produces extra red blood cells, thickening the blood 
and impeding its flow. But Himalayans who have lived on
these mountains for thousands of years permanently evolved mechanisms
to circumvent this process and maintain normal blood flow. Cases like that prove that humans
can develop permanent lifesaving traits. But natural adaptation 
for entire human populations could take tens of thousands of years. Recent scientific advances may help us
accelerate human adaptation to single generations. To thrive as a species 
during space travel, we could potentially develop methods to quickly program protective abilities
into ourselves. A beta version of these methods
is gene therapy, which we can currently use to correct
genetic diseases. Gene editing technology,
which is improving rapidly, allows scientists to directly change
the human genome to stop undesirable processes
or make helpful substances. An example of an unwanted process is what happens when our bodies
are exposed to ionizing radiation. Without an atmospheric barrier
and a magnetic field like Earth's, most planets and moons are bombarded
with these dangerous subatomic particles. They can pass through nearly anything and would cause potentially cancerous
DNA damage to space explorers. But what if we could turn the tables
on radiation? Human skin produces a pigment
called melanin that protects us from the filtered
radiation on Earth. Melanin exists in many forms
across species, and some melanin-expressing fungi use the pigment to convert radiation
into chemical energy. Instead of trying to shield 
the human body, or rapidly repair damage, we could potentially engineer humans to adopt and express these fungal,
melanin-based energy-harvesting systems. They'd then convert radiation into
useful energy while protecting our DNA. This sounds pretty sci-fi, but may actually be achievable 
with current technology. But technology isn't the only obstacle. There are ongoing debates 
on the consequences and ethics of such radical alterations
to our genetic fabric. Besides radiation, variation in gravitational strength
is another challenge for space travelers. Until we develop artificial gravity
in a space ship or on another planet, we should assume that astronauts
will spend time living in microgravity. On Earth, human bone and muscle
custodial cells respond to the stress 
of gravity's incessant tugging by renewing old cells in processes
known as remodeling and regeneration. But in a microgravity environment
like Mars, human bone and muscle cells
won't get these cues, resulting in osteoporosis 
and muscle atrophy. So, how could we provide 
an artificial signal for cells to counteract bone and muscle loss? Again, this is speculative, but biochemically engineered microbes
inside our bodies could churn out bone and muscle
remodeling signaling factors. Or humans could be genetically engineered to produce more of these signals
in the absence of gravity. Radiation exposure and microgravity
are only two of the many challenges we will encounter in the hostile
conditions of space. But if we're ethically prepared
to use them, gene editing and microbial engineering
are two flexible tools that could be adapted to many scenarios. In the near future, we may decide
to further develop and tune these genetic tools
for the harsh realities of space living.

**Transcript**:
Prolonged space travel takes
a severe toll on the human body. Microgravity impairs muscle
and bone growth, and high doses of radiation
cause irreversible mutations. As we seriously consider the human
species becoming space-faring, a big question stands. Even if we break free 
from Earth's orbit and embark on long-duration
journeys among the stars, can we adapt to the extreme
environments of space? This won't be the first time that humans
have adapted to harsh environments and evolved superhuman capabilities. Not fantastical powers like laser vision
or invisibility, but physiological adaptations
for survival in tough conditions. For example, on the Himalayan mountains where the highest elevation 
is nine kilometers above sea level, an unacclimated lowland human
will experience symptoms of hypoxia, commonly known as mountain sickness. At these altitudes, the body usually
produces extra red blood cells, thickening the blood 
and impeding its flow. But Himalayans who have lived on
these mountains for thousands of years permanently evolved mechanisms
to circumvent this process and maintain normal blood flow. Cases like that prove that humans
can develop permanent lifesaving traits. But natural adaptation 
for entire human populations could take tens of thousands of years. Recent scientific advances may help us
accelerate human adaptation to single generations. To thrive as a species 
during space travel, we could potentially develop methods to quickly program protective abilities
into ourselves. A beta version of these methods
is gene therapy, which we can currently use to correct
genetic diseases. Gene editing technology,
which is improving rapidly, allows scientists to directly change
the human genome to stop undesirable processes
or make helpful substances. An example of an unwanted process is what happens when our bodies
are exposed to ionizing radiation. Without an atmospheric barrier
and a magnetic field like Earth's, most planets and moons are bombarded
with these dangerous subatomic particles. They can pass through nearly anything and would cause potentially cancerous
DNA damage to space explorers. But what if we could turn the tables
on radiation? Human skin produces a pigment
called melanin that protects us from the filtered
radiation on Earth. Melanin exists in many forms
across species, and some melanin-expressing fungi use the pigment to convert radiation
into chemical energy. Instead of trying to shield 
the human body, or rapidly repair damage, we could potentially engineer humans to adopt and express these fungal,
melanin-based energy-harvesting systems. They'd then convert radiation into
useful energy while protecting our DNA. This sounds pretty sci-fi, but may actually be achievable 
with current technology. But technology isn't the only obstacle. There are ongoing debates 
on the consequences and ethics of such radical alterations
to our genetic fabric. Besides radiation, variation in gravitational strength
is another challenge for space travelers. Until we develop artificial gravity
in a space ship or on another planet, we should assume that astronauts
will spend time living in microgravity. On Earth, human bone and muscle
custodial cells respond to the stress 
of gravity's incessant tugging by renewing old cells in processes
known as remodeling and regeneration. But in a microgravity environment
like Mars, human bone and muscle cells
won't get these cues, resulting in osteoporosis 
and muscle atrophy. So, how could we provide 
an artificial signal for cells to counteract bone and muscle loss? Again, this is speculative, but biochemically engineered microbes
inside our bodies could churn out bone and muscle
remodeling signaling factors. Or humans could be genetically engineered to produce more of these signals
in the absence of gravity. Radiation exposure and microgravity
are only two of the many challenges we will encounter in the hostile
conditions of space. But if we're ethically prepared
to use them, gene editing and microbial engineering
are two flexible tools that could be adapted to many scenarios. In the near future, we may decide
to further develop and tune these genetic tools
for the harsh realities of space living.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

This question has a similar intent to the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the challenges faced by space travelers. The options in Question 7 also overlap with the ground truth MCQ, specifically regarding microgravity-induced bone and muscle loss (osteoporosis and muscle atrophy) and radiation exposure (although this is not an option in Question 7, it is mentioned in the ground truth MCQ). However, it's worth noting that Question 7 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only addresses one aspect of the challenges faced by astronauts (bone and muscle loss) and does not provide an option that combines radiation exposure and muscle atrophy.

A more comprehensive match would be a question that addresses both radiation exposure and microgravity-induced muscle atrophy, but such a question is not present among the generated MCQs. Therefore, Question 7 is the closest match based on the available options.

**Transcript**:
Your favorite band is great
at playing music, but not so great at being organized. They keep misplacing 
their instruments on tour, and it's driving their manager mad. On the day of the big concert, the band wakes up 
to find themselves tied up in a windowless, 
soundproof practice room. Their manager explains what's happening. Outside, there are ten large boxes. Each contains one of your instruments, but don't be fooled by the pictures -
they've been randomly placed. I'm going to let you out one at a time. While you're outside, you can look
inside any five boxes before security
takes you back to the tour bus. You can't touch the instruments or in any way communicate what you find
to the others. No marking the boxes, shouting, nothing. If each one of you 
can find your own instrument, then you can play tonight. Otherwise, the label is dropping you. You have three minutes to think about it
before we start. The band is in despair. After all, each musician only has a 50%
chance of finding their instrument by picking five random boxes. And the chances that all ten will succeed
are even lower - just 1 in 1024. But suddenly, the drummer comes up
with a valid strategy that has a better than 35% chance
of working. Can you figure out what it was? Pause the video on the next screen
if you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Here's what the drummer said: Everyone first open the box
with the picture of your instrument. If your instrument is inside, you're done. Otherwise, look at whatever's in there, and then open the box 
with that picture on it. Keep going that way until you find
your instrument. The bandmates are skeptical, but amazingly enough,
they all find what they need. And a few hours later, they're playing
to thousands of adoring fans. So why did the drummer's strategy work? Each musician follows a linked sequence that starts with the box whose outside
matches their instrument and ends with the box 
actually containing it. Note that if they kept going,
that would lead them back to the start, so this is a loop. For example, if the boxes 
are arranged like so, the singer would open the first box
to find the drums, go to the eighth box to find the bass, and find her microphone in the third box, which would point back to the first. This works much better 
than random guessing because by starting with the box 
with the picture of their instrument, each musician restricts their search to
the loop that contains their instrument, and there are decent odds, about 35%, that all of the loops 
will be of length five or less. How do we calculate those odds? For the sake of simplicity, 
we'll demonstrate with a simplified case, four instruments and no more than 
two guesses allowed for each musician. Let's start by finding 
the odds of failure, the chance that someone will need
to open three or four boxes before they find their instrument. There are six distinct four-box loops. One fun way to count them 
is to make a square, put an instrument at each corner, and draw the diagonals. See how many unique loops you can find, and keep in mind that these two 
are considered the same, they just start at different points. These two, however, are different. We can visualize the eight distinct
three-box loops using triangles. You'll find four possible triangles depending on which instrument 
you leave out, and two distinct paths on each. So of the 24 possible 
combinations of boxes, there are 14 that lead to faliure, and ten that result in success. That computational strategy works for any
even number of musicians, but if you want a shortcut, it generalizes to a handy equation. Plug in ten musicians, 
and we get odds of about 35%. What if there were 1,000 musicians? 1,000,000? As n increases, 
the odds approach about 30%. Not a guarantee, but with a bit of
musician's luck, it's far from hopeless. Hi everybody, if you liked this riddle,

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since the ground truth MCQ asks about the probability of finding the instrument if the boxes are chosen at random, and none of the generated MCQs exactly match this question, I will choose the one that is closest in terms of probability.

The correct answer is not among the generated MCQs, but if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of different possibilities to arrange 10 instruments in 10 boxes. The closest generated MCQ is Question 4, which asks about the probability of success for a musician using the drummer's strategy. However, this is not a direct match.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that asks about the number of possible combinations or arrangements of the instruments. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs address this topic directly.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 8, which asks about the probability of failure for a musician using the drummer's strategy. This question mentions the number of possible combinations (24) and the number of combinations that lead to failure (14), but it does not directly address the number of possible arrangements of the instruments.

**Transcript**:
Your favorite band is great
at playing music, but not so great at being organized. They keep misplacing 
their instruments on tour, and it's driving their manager mad. On the day of the big concert, the band wakes up 
to find themselves tied up in a windowless, 
soundproof practice room. Their manager explains what's happening. Outside, there are ten large boxes. Each contains one of your instruments, but don't be fooled by the pictures -
they've been randomly placed. I'm going to let you out one at a time. While you're outside, you can look
inside any five boxes before security
takes you back to the tour bus. You can't touch the instruments or in any way communicate what you find
to the others. No marking the boxes, shouting, nothing. If each one of you 
can find your own instrument, then you can play tonight. Otherwise, the label is dropping you. You have three minutes to think about it
before we start. The band is in despair. After all, each musician only has a 50%
chance of finding their instrument by picking five random boxes. And the chances that all ten will succeed
are even lower - just 1 in 1024. But suddenly, the drummer comes up
with a valid strategy that has a better than 35% chance
of working. Can you figure out what it was? Pause the video on the next screen
if you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Here's what the drummer said: Everyone first open the box
with the picture of your instrument. If your instrument is inside, you're done. Otherwise, look at whatever's in there, and then open the box 
with that picture on it. Keep going that way until you find
your instrument. The bandmates are skeptical, but amazingly enough,
they all find what they need. And a few hours later, they're playing
to thousands of adoring fans. So why did the drummer's strategy work? Each musician follows a linked sequence that starts with the box whose outside
matches their instrument and ends with the box 
actually containing it. Note that if they kept going,
that would lead them back to the start, so this is a loop. For example, if the boxes 
are arranged like so, the singer would open the first box
to find the drums, go to the eighth box to find the bass, and find her microphone in the third box, which would point back to the first. This works much better 
than random guessing because by starting with the box 
with the picture of their instrument, each musician restricts their search to
the loop that contains their instrument, and there are decent odds, about 35%, that all of the loops 
will be of length five or less. How do we calculate those odds? For the sake of simplicity, 
we'll demonstrate with a simplified case, four instruments and no more than 
two guesses allowed for each musician. Let's start by finding 
the odds of failure, the chance that someone will need
to open three or four boxes before they find their instrument. There are six distinct four-box loops. One fun way to count them 
is to make a square, put an instrument at each corner, and draw the diagonals. See how many unique loops you can find, and keep in mind that these two 
are considered the same, they just start at different points. These two, however, are different. We can visualize the eight distinct
three-box loops using triangles. You'll find four possible triangles depending on which instrument 
you leave out, and two distinct paths on each. So of the 24 possible 
combinations of boxes, there are 14 that lead to faliure, and ten that result in success. That computational strategy works for any
even number of musicians, but if you want a shortcut, it generalizes to a handy equation. Plug in ten musicians, 
and we get odds of about 35%. What if there were 1,000 musicians? 1,000,000? As n increases, 
the odds approach about 30%. Not a guarantee, but with a bit of
musician's luck, it's far from hopeless. Hi everybody, if you liked this riddle,
try solving these two.

**Transcript**:
When I was first learning to meditate, the instruction was to simply
pay attention to my breath, and when my mind wandered,
to bring it back. Sounded simple enough. Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats, sweating through T-shirts
in the middle of winter. I'd take naps every chance I got
because it was really hard work. Actually, it was exhausting. The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something
really important. So why is it so hard to pay attention? Well, studies show that even when we're really
trying to pay attention to something -- like maybe this talk -- at some point, about half of us
will drift off into a daydream, or have this urge
to check our Twitter feed. So what's going on here? It turns out that we're fighting one
of the most evolutionarily-conserved learning processes
currently known in science, one that's conserved back to the most basic
nervous systems known to man. This reward-based learning process is called positive
and negative reinforcement, and basically goes like this. We see some food that looks good, our brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!" We eat the food, we taste it -- it tastes good. And especially with sugar, our bodies send a signal
to our brain that says, "Remember what you're eating
and where you found it." We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time. See food, eat food, feel good, repeat. Trigger, behavior, reward. Simple, right? Well, after a while,
our creative brains say, "You know what? You can use this for more
than just remembering where food is. You know, next time you feel bad, why don't you try eating
something good so you'll feel better?" We thank our brains for the great idea, try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream
when we're mad or sad, we feel better. Same process, just a different trigger. Instead of this hunger signal
coming from our stomach, this emotional signal -- feeling sad -- triggers that urge to eat. Maybe in our teenage years, we were a nerd at school, and we see those rebel kids
outside smoking and we think, "Hey, I want to be cool." So we start smoking. The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork,
and that was no accident. See cool, smoke to be cool, feel good. Repeat. Trigger, behavior, reward. And each time we do this, we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit. So later, feeling stressed out triggers
that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet. Now, with these same brain processes, we've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves
with these habits. Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes
of morbidity and mortality in the world. So back to my breath. What if instead of fighting our brains, or trying to force ourselves
to pay attention, we instead tapped into this natural,
reward-based learning process ... but added a twist? What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening
in our momentary experience? I'll give you an example. In my lab, we studied whether mindfulness training
could help people quit smoking. Now, just like trying to force myself
to pay attention to my breath, they could try to force
themselves to quit smoking. And the majority of them
had tried this before and failed -- on average, six times. Now, with mindfulness training, we dropped the bit about forcing
and instead focused on being curious. In fact, we even told them to smoke. What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke, just be really curious
about what it's like when you do." And what did they notice? Well here's an example
from one of our smokers. She said, "Mindful smoking: smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!" Now, she knew, cognitively
that smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program. What she discovered just by being
curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit. (Laughter) Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom. She moved from knowing in her head
that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones, and the spell of smoking was broken. She started to become
disenchanted with her behavior. Now, the prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain
from an evolutionary perspective, it understands on an intellectual level
that we shouldn't smoke. And it tries its hardest
to help us change our behavior, to help us stop smoking, to help us stop eating that second,
that third, that fourth cookie. We call this cognitive control. We're using cognition
to control our behavior. Unfortunately, this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline
when we get stressed out, which isn't that helpful. Now, we can all relate to this
in our own experience. We're much more likely to do things
like yell at our spouse or kids when we're stressed out or tired, even though we know
it's not going to be helpful. We just can't help ourselves. When the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our old habits, which is why this disenchantment
is so important. Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them
at a deeper level -- to know it in our bones so we don't have to force
ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior. We're just less interested
in doing it in the first place. And this is what mindfulness is all about: Seeing really clearly what we get
when we get caught up in our behaviors, becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance,
naturally letting go. This isn't to say that, poof,
magically we quit smoking. But over time, as we learn
to see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old habits and form new ones. The paradox here is that mindfulness is just
about being really interested in getting close and personal with what's actually happening
in our bodies and minds from moment to moment. This willingness
to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant
cravings go away as quickly as possible. And this willingness
to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally rewarding. What does curiosity feel like? It feels good. And what happens when we get curious? We start to notice that cravings
are simply made up of body sensations -- oh, there's tightness, there's tension, there's restlessness -- and that these body
sensations come and go. These are bite-size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered
by this huge, scary craving that we choke on. In other words, when we get curious, we step out of our old,
fear-based, reactive habit patterns, and we step into being. We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting
that next data point. Now, this might sound
too simplistic to affect behavior. But in one study,
we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy
at helping people quit smoking. So it actually works. And when we studied
the brains of experienced meditators, we found that parts of a neural network
of self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play. Now, one current hypothesis
is that a region of this network, called the posterior cingulate cortex, is activated not necessarily
by craving itself but when we get caught up in it,
when we get sucked in, and it takes us for a ride. In contrast, when we let go -- step out of the process just by being curiously aware
of what's happening -- this same brain region quiets down. Now we're testing app and online-based
mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and, ironically, use the same technology
that's driving us to distraction to help us step out
of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking, of stress eating
and other addictive behaviors. Now, remember that bit
about context-dependent memory? We can deliver these tools
to peoples' fingertips in the contexts that matter most. So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity
to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke
or stress eat or whatever arises. So if you don't smoke or stress eat, maybe the next time you feel this urge
to check your email when you're bored, or you're trying to distract
yourself from work, or maybe to compulsively respond
to that text message when you're driving, see if you can tap into
this natural capacity, just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body
and mind in that moment. It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless
and exhaustive habit loops ... or step out of it. Instead of see text message,
compulsively text back, feel a little bit better -- notice the urge, get curious, feel the joy of letting go and repeat. Thank you. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

This question is about the role of the prefrontal cortex in controlling behavior, which is related to the ground truth MCQ about which part of the brain knows it's bad to smoke. The correct option in Question 8 mentions that the prefrontal cortex "tries to help us change our behavior", which is consistent with the ground truth MCQ's correct option stating that the pre-frontal cortex knows it's bad to smoke. 

Although the questions are not identical, they both relate to the function of the prefrontal cortex, making Question 8 the most similar generated MCQ.

Reviewer: Brian Greene Could human civilization eventually spread
across the whole Milky Way galaxy? Could we move beyond 
our small blue planet to establish colonies in the multitude
of star systems out there? This question's a pretty daunting one. There are around 300 billion stars
in the galaxy, which is about 160,000 light-years across. So far we've sent a single spacecraft
outside our solar system, trudging along at 0.006% of 
the speed of light. At that rate, it would take over 
2.5 billion years just to get from one end of the galaxy
to the other. And then there's the question 
of human survival. The gulf between stars is simply enormous. We couldn't live sustainably 
on most planets, and we require a lot of resources
to stay alive. And yet, decades ago, scholars found
that it's theoretically possible to not just spread human civilization
across the galaxy, but to do so quite quickly, without breaking any known 
laws of physics. Their idea is based on the work
of a mathematician named John von Neumann, who designed on paper machines 
that could self-replicate and create new generations of themselves. These would later come to be known
as von Neumann machines. In the context of space exploration, von Neumann machines could be
built on Earth and launched into space. There, the self-sufficient machines
would land on distant planets. They would then mine the available
resources and harvest energy, build replicas of themselves, launch those to the nearest planets, and continue the cycle. The result is the creation 
of millions of probes spreading outwards into the universe
like a drop of ink in a fishbowl. Scholars crunched the numbers and found
that a single von Neumann machine traveling at 5% of the speed of light should be able to replicate throughout
our galaxy in 4 million years or less. That may sound like a long time, but when you consider that our universe
is 14 billion years old, on a cosmic scale, it's incredibly fast - the equivalent of about 2.5 hours
in an entire year. Creating von Neumann machines
would require a few technologies we don't have yet, including advanced 
artificial intelligence, miniaturization, and better propulsion systems. If we wanted to use them to spread actual
humans throughout the galaxy, we would need 
yet another technological leap - the ability to artificially 
grow biological organisms and bodies using raw elements 
and genetic information. Regardless, if in the last billion years an alien civilization 
created such a machine and set it multiplying its way toward us, our galaxy would be 
swarming with them by now. So then where are all these machines? Some astronomers, like Carl Sagan, say that intelligent aliens wouldn't
build self-replicating machines at all. They might hurtle out of control, scavenging planets to their cores
in order to keep replicating. Others take the machines absence as proof that intelligent alien civilizations 
don't exist, or that they go extinct before they can
develop the necessary technologies. But all this hasn't stopped people from
imagining what it would be like if they were out there. Science fiction author David Brin writes about a universe in which
many different von Neumann machines exist and proliferate simultaneously. Some are designed 
to greet young civilizations, others to locate and destroy them
before they become a threat. In fact, in Brin's story "Lungfish," some von Neumann machines are keeping
a close watch over the Earth right now, waiting for us to reach a certain level
of sophistication before they make their move. For now, all we have is curiosity 
and theory. But the next time 
you look at the night sky, consider that billions of
self-replicating machines could be advancing between stars
in our galaxy right now. If they exist, one of them will eventually
land on Earth, or maybe, just maybe,
they're already here.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 6. 

Although Question 6 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of question intent and content. Question 6 discusses the potential risks of intelligent aliens building self-replicating machines, which is related to the idea of alien Von-Neumann Machines. However, it does not directly address the existence or discovery of such machines.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the existence or discovery of alien Von-Neumann Machines. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 6, but with the understanding that it is not a perfect match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

This question is about the concerns regarding von Neumann Machines, specifically the argument made by some astronomers like Carl Sagan. Although it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest one in terms of content and intent.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the concerns of von Neumann Machines in a more general sense, while Question 6 is more specific about Carl Sagan's argument.

If I had to choose an index, I would choose Question 6 (Index 6).

Reviewer: Brian Greene Could human civilization eventually spread
across the whole Milky Way galaxy? Could we move beyond 
our small blue planet to establish colonies in the multitude
of star systems out there? This question's a pretty daunting one. There are around 300 billion stars
in the galaxy, which is about 160,000 light-years across. So far we've sent a single spacecraft
outside our solar system, trudging along at 0.006% of 
the speed of light. At that rate, it would take over 
2.5 billion years just to get from one end of the galaxy
to the other. And then there's the question 
of human survival. The gulf between stars is simply enormous. We couldn't live sustainably 
on most planets, and we require a lot of resources
to stay alive. And yet, decades ago, scholars found
that it's theoretically possible to not just spread human civilization
across the galaxy, but to do so quite quickly, without breaking any known 
laws of physics. Their idea is based on the work
of a mathematician named John von Neumann, who designed on paper machines 
that could self-replicate and create new generations of themselves. These would later come to be known
as von Neumann machines. In the context of space exploration, von Neumann machines could be
built on Earth and launched into space. There, the self-sufficient machines
would land on distant planets. They would then mine the available
resources and harvest energy, build replicas of themselves, launch those to the nearest planets, and continue the cycle. The result is the creation 
of millions of probes spreading outwards into the universe
like a drop of ink in a fishbowl. Scholars crunched the numbers and found
that a single von Neumann machine traveling at 5% of the speed of light should be able to replicate throughout
our galaxy in 4 million years or less. That may sound like a long time, but when you consider that our universe
is 14 billion years old, on a cosmic scale, it's incredibly fast - the equivalent of about 2.5 hours
in an entire year. Creating von Neumann machines
would require a few technologies we don't have yet, including advanced 
artificial intelligence, miniaturization, and better propulsion systems. If we wanted to use them to spread actual
humans throughout the galaxy, we would need 
yet another technological leap - the ability to artificially 
grow biological organisms and bodies using raw elements 
and genetic information. Regardless, if in the last billion years an alien civilization 
created such a machine and set it multiplying its way toward us, our galaxy would be 
swarming with them by now. So then where are all these machines? Some astronomers, like Carl Sagan, say that intelligent aliens wouldn't
build self-replicating machines at all. They might hurtle out of control, scavenging planets to their cores
in order to keep replicating. Others take the machines absence as proof that intelligent alien civilizations 
don't exist, or that they go extinct before they can
develop the necessary technologies. But all this hasn't stopped people from
imagining what it would be like if they were out there. Science fiction author David Brin writes about a universe in which
many different von Neumann machines exist and proliferate simultaneously. Some are designed 
to greet young civilizations, others to locate and destroy them
before they become a threat. In fact, in Brin's story "Lungfish," some von Neumann machines are keeping
a close watch over the Earth right now, waiting for us to reach a certain level
of sophistication before they make their move. For now, all we have is curiosity 
and theory. But the next time 
you look at the night sky, consider that billions of
self-replicating machines could be advancing between stars
in our galaxy right now. If they exist, one of them will eventually
land on Earth, or maybe, just maybe,
they're already here.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 6. 

Although Question 6 does not directly mention "Alien von Neumann Machines," its content and options are closely related to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the current status of alien von Neumann machines, while Question 6 asks about the potential risks associated with intelligent aliens building self-replicating machines, which is a relevant and related topic.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose Question 10. Question 10 asks, "What is the main question posed by the transcript about the possibility of intelligent alien civilizations creating von Neumann machines?" and one of its options is "A. Are they already here on Earth?" which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the current status or existence of alien von Neumann machines.

**Transcript**:
This is the Bop. The Bop is a type of social dance. Dance is a language, and social dance is an expression
that emerges from a community. A social dance isn't choreographed
by any one person. It can't be traced to any one moment. Each dance has steps
that everyone can agree on, but it's about the individual
and their creative identity. Because of that, social dances bubble up, they change, and they spread like wildfire. They are as old as our remembered history. In African-American social dances, we see over 200 years of how African and African-American
traditions influenced our history. The present always contains the past. And the past shapes who we are and who we will be. (Clapping) The Juba dance was born
from enslaved Africans' experience on the plantation. Brought to the Americas, stripped of a common spoken language, this dance was a way for enslaved Africans
to remember where they're from. It may have looked something like this. Slapping thighs, shuffling feet and patting hands: this was how they got around
the slave owners' ban on drumming, improvising complex rhythms just like ancestors did
with drums in Haiti or in the Yoruba communities
of West Africa. It was about keeping
cultural traditions alive and retaining a sense of inner freedom under captivity. It was the same subversive spirit
that created this dance: the Cakewalk, a dance that parodied the mannerisms
of Southern high society -- a way for the enslaved
to throw shade at the masters. The crazy thing about this dance is that the Cakewalk
was performed for the masters, who never suspected
they were being made fun of. Now you might recognize this one. 1920s -- the Charleston. The Charleston was all about
improvisation and musicality, making its way into Lindy Hop, swing dancing and even the Kid n Play, originally called the Funky Charleston. Started by a tight-knit Black community
near Charleston, South Carolina, the Charleston permeated dance halls where young women suddenly had
the freedom to kick their heels and move their legs. Now, social dance is about
community and connection; if you knew the steps, it meant you belonged to a group. But what if it becomes a worldwide craze? Enter the Twist. It's no surprise that the Twist
can be traced back to the 19th century, brought to America from the Congo during slavery. But in the late '50s, right before the Civil Rights Movement, the Twist is popularized
by Chubby Checker and Dick Clark. Suddenly, everybody's doing the Twist: white teenagers, kids in Latin America, making its way into songs and movies. Through social dance, the boundaries between groups
become blurred. The story continues in the 1980s and '90s. Along with the emergence of hip-hop, African-American social dance
took on even more visibility, borrowing from its long past, shaping culture and being shaped by it. Today, these dances continue
to evolve, grow and spread. Why do we dance? To move, to let loose, to express. Why do we dance together? To heal, to remember, to say: "We speak a common language. We exist and we are free."

**Transcript**:
I’ve invited you all here today because
I wanted to talk to you about some ugly stereotypes that are going around. I’ve been hearing a lot of unfair, unseemly, and
unscientific generalizations being made lately. And they mostly have to do with sex. And your hormones. People have a nasty habit of equating “hormones”
with a particular set of behaviors and conditions, most of which have to do with reproduction,
or sexual development, or acts that include what my brother John has referred to as “skoodilypooping.” For example, people will say that “hormones”
are why Kevin has zits, and is being all moody, or why Hannah, who’s three months pregnant,
just cried watching a commercial for car insurance -- which, let’s be honest, I do that too. Now, I’m not saying that hormones aren’t
at the root of sexual attraction, or zits, or occasional bouts of extreme emotion, because
they are. That’s just not all that they do. Not even close. When people talk about “hormones” in
the contexts that I just mentioned, what really they mean is "sex hormones." But sex hormones are just one kind of hormone
that you have coursing through your body right now. In fact, there are at least 50 different types
of these chemical messengers at work in your body at this very minute, but only a very few
of them have anything at all to do with sex. The truth is, from birth to death, just about
every cell and function in your body is under your hormones’ constant influence. They’re floating through your blood, regulating
your metabolism, your sleep cycle, your response to stress, and the general and incredibly important
overall homeostasis that keeps you not dead. Some hormones are just there to make other
hormones trigger even more hormones -- in a kind of chemical relay race that biologists
refer to, rather elegantly, as “cascades.” These hormones run through you no matter what
your mood is, or whether you have zits. So the reality is: We’re all hormonal ... all
of the time. OK, to begin to understand our hormones -- and
the endocrine system that produces, releases, and re-absorbs them -- we have to step back
and take a broad view. Not just by emphasizing that sex hormones aren’t
the only hormones you have -- but also by looking at how your hormones interact with
your other organ systems. Because, if anything, your body has two bosses
-- two complementary systems that are constantly shouting instructions over each other, to
all of your bits and pieces. Both your endocrine system and your nervous
system are constantly trafficking information around your corpus, gathering intel, making
demands, controlling your every move. They just have totally different ways of doing
it. Your nervous system uses lightning-fast
electrochemical action potentials, delivered by an expressway made of
neurons to specific cells and organs. But your endocrine system prefers a slower,
wider stream of data. It secretes hormones that travel through your
blood -- NOT through neurons -- so they move more slowly, but they also produce widespread effects
that last a whole lot longer than an action potential. Now, compared to your heart or brain or other,
arguably more glamorous organs, your endocrine system’s organs and glands are kinda small
and lumpy. They’re also rogues -- instead of being all
nestled together like in your other organ systems, these guys are scattered all over the place, from your
brain to your throat, to your kidneys, to your genitals. A gland is a just any structure that makes
and secretes a hormone. And the master gland in your body is the pituitary, which produces
many hormones that signal other glands -- like the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal
glands -- to make their own hormones. The endocrine system also includes a few organs
-- like the gonads, the pancreas, and the placenta in pregnant women -- all of which
have some other non-hormonal functions and are made up of multiple tissue types. And technically the hypothalamus in your brain
is in the endocrine club too, since in addition to all of its busy brain duties, it does produce
and release hormones. So, thanks to these glands and organs, you’ve got
all these hormones diffusing through your blood, doing all sorts of different things, but the thing to
remember about them is that a hormone can only trigger a reaction in specific cells -- their so-called
target cells -- that have the right receptors for it. So, just like some keys can open many locks,
while others only work with one, so too can the hormone-target-cell relationship either
be widespread or localized. You’re probably gonna want an example of
that. So, your thyroid -- at the bottom of your throat -- produces the hormone thyroxine,
which stimulates metabolism and binds to receptors in most of the cells in your body. But your pituitary -- which is nestled all
comfy under your brain -- produces follicle-stimulating hormone, which helps regulate growth and triggers
sexual maturity, and it only targets specific cells in the ovaries and testes. So how do hormones bind to their target cells? Well, chemically, most hormones are either
made of amino acids -- including their more complex structures like peptides or proteins
-- or they’re derived from lipids, like cholesterol. And this is key, because a hormone’s chemical
structure determines if it’s water soluble, like most amino acid-based ones are, or lipid
soluble, like steroids are. Solubility is important because your cell
membranes are made of lipids. That means that water soluble ones can’t
get across them. So target cells for those kinds of hormones have receptors for them
on the outside of their membranes. Lipid-soluble hormones, on the other hand,
can just basically glide right through that cell membrane, so their receptor sites are
inside their target cells. Either way, when a target cell is activated,
the hormone alters its activity, by either increasing or decreasing some of its functions
-- usually with the goal of maintaining your body’s homeostasis in one way or another. So, if hormones are keeping your body IN balance,
what’s putting your body out of balance? I don’t know -- could I interest you in
some pie? If you have a couple of nice, generous helpings
of strawberry-rhubarb pie -- and just to make things interesting, let’s say they’re a la mode --
your blood glucose level is gonna go through the roof. And the pancreas regulates your blood sugar by
releasing two different hormones -- insulin and glucagon. Once you have a belly full of that pie,
beta cells in your pancreas release insulin, which helps lower your blood sugar by increasing
the rate at which your cells store the sugar either as glycogen or as fat for later use. Now, let’s say you’ve done the opposite:
You’ve eaten no pie -- you’re pie-less -- in fact, you’ve eaten nothing for hours. If your blood sugar drops too low, then alpha
cells in the pancreas will instead send out glucagon, which helps raise your blood sugar
levels, in part by decreasing the storage of sugar in your cells, and triggering their
release of glucose back into the blood. Lots of different endocrine-related illnesses
-- like diabetes or hyperthyroidism -- tend to be the result of either hyper (too much)
or hypo (too little) secretion of certain hormones, which throw your homeostasis off
balance. But there are lots of more common -- and less
obvious -- ways your hormones can get out of balance, not because of some disorder,
but because these signaling chemicals are just caught up in a chain reaction, which
can take a while to subside. Some hormones just exist to control other
hormones, which in turn control still more hormones. So as soon as one starts to trickle out, you can
pretty quickly wind up with a cascade on your hands. You’ve got a few different hormone cascades
going on at any given moment, but one of the big ones -- one that’s really worth understanding
-- is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, or the HPA axis, because you don’t want
to have to say that every time. This is a complex series of interactions between
three glands that ultimately regulates lots of your body’s daily processes, like digestion, sexuality,
immune response, and how you handle stress. And it’s complex not just because of all
the glands involved -- it’s also one of the more crucial instances of your endocrine
system coordinating with your nervous system. Specifically, it’s behind that fight-or-flight
response that everybody keeps talking about. The HPA Axis is essentially the endocrine system’s
companion to the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic system, in times of high stress,
does things like speed up your heart rate and direct blood away from the digestive organs
and to the muscles. But many of the other effects of the stress
response are carried out by your endocrine system. And getting your nervous and endocrine
systems to work together in times of crisis is where the hypothalamus comes in. It’s the hub of where the two systems meet
-- it keeps tabs on what’s going on all over your body, analyzing your blood for signs
that something might be off. So, let’s revisit our fight-or-flight scene from a few
lessons ago -- the old Burning House Scenario. So you’re sleeping, dreaming about petting pandas with
Emma Watson or whatever, when the smoke alarm goes off. Well, action potentials in your brain trigger
neurons in your hypothalamus to release the peptide hormone CRH, or corticotropin releasing hormone. The CRH makes the very short trip through
the bloodstream to the anterior pituitary gland, where, because it’s water soluble, it
binds to receptors on the outside of its target cells. There, it triggers the release of adrenocorticotropic
hormone, or ACTH. The ACTH travels -- again through the bloodstream -- to the adrenal cortices
of the adrenal glands on top of your kidneys. When the ACTH binds to receptors on cells
in an adrenal cortex, it triggers the release of a frenzy of different freak-out compounds known
as glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid hormones. Typically these guys help us deal with day-to-day stress
by keeping our blood sugar and blood pressure balanced. But under major stress -- like waking up
in a burning building stress -- these hormones, like cortisol, cause the classic fight-or-flight
response: ramping up your blood pressure, dumping glucose into your bloodstream, shutting
down non-emergency services like your immune system and sperm and egg development. And guess what? Now that all these stress
hormones are pulsing through your blood, the hypothalamus back in the brain senses them. And because its job is to monitor and maintain
balance whenever possible, it then stops secreting CRH, which -- eventually -- causes the other
glands to stop secreting their panic hormones. Now, because this element of the stress response
is hormonal rather than electrical, it comes on more slowly than the nervous system part,
and it takes longer to subside, too, as those stress hormones linger in the blood before
being broken down by enzymes. So. We’re a long way from teenage crushes and zits
and crying over commercials at this point, aren’t we? As a life-long owner of hormones, I hope you’ll
join me in dispelling the stereotypes that surround these powerful and important chemicals,
and give them the respect they rightly deserve. Today we looked at the endocrine system, and
how it uses glands to produce hormones. These hormones are either amino-acid based and water
soluble, or steroidal and lipid-soluble, and may target many types of cells or just turn
on specific ones. We also touched on hormone cascades, and how the HPA axis effects your
stress response. Thank you to our Headmaster of Learning, Thomas

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of types of chemical messengers (hormones) at work in the body at a given time. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask about the number of hormones.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of hormones and their role in the body, I would suggest:

**Generated MCQ 2: According to the transcript, what is the main function of the pituitary gland?**

This MCQ is not directly related to the number of hormones, but it does ask about the pituitary gland, which is mentioned in the transcript as the "master gland" that produces many hormones.

That being said, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: **2** (with the caveat that it's not a good match).

Please note that it would be better to generate new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
I’ve invited you all here today because
I wanted to talk to you about some ugly stereotypes that are going around. I’ve been hearing a lot of unfair, unseemly, and
unscientific generalizations being made lately. And they mostly have to do with sex. And your hormones. People have a nasty habit of equating “hormones”
with a particular set of behaviors and conditions, most of which have to do with reproduction,
or sexual development, or acts that include what my brother John has referred to as “skoodilypooping.” For example, people will say that “hormones”
are why Kevin has zits, and is being all moody, or why Hannah, who’s three months pregnant,
just cried watching a commercial for car insurance -- which, let’s be honest, I do that too. Now, I’m not saying that hormones aren’t
at the root of sexual attraction, or zits, or occasional bouts of extreme emotion, because
they are. That’s just not all that they do. Not even close. When people talk about “hormones” in
the contexts that I just mentioned, what really they mean is "sex hormones." But sex hormones are just one kind of hormone
that you have coursing through your body right now. In fact, there are at least 50 different types
of these chemical messengers at work in your body at this very minute, but only a very few
of them have anything at all to do with sex. The truth is, from birth to death, just about
every cell and function in your body is under your hormones’ constant influence. They’re floating through your blood, regulating
your metabolism, your sleep cycle, your response to stress, and the general and incredibly important
overall homeostasis that keeps you not dead. Some hormones are just there to make other
hormones trigger even more hormones -- in a kind of chemical relay race that biologists
refer to, rather elegantly, as “cascades.” These hormones run through you no matter what
your mood is, or whether you have zits. So the reality is: We’re all hormonal ... all
of the time. OK, to begin to understand our hormones -- and
the endocrine system that produces, releases, and re-absorbs them -- we have to step back
and take a broad view. Not just by emphasizing that sex hormones aren’t
the only hormones you have -- but also by looking at how your hormones interact with
your other organ systems. Because, if anything, your body has two bosses
-- two complementary systems that are constantly shouting instructions over each other, to
all of your bits and pieces. Both your endocrine system and your nervous
system are constantly trafficking information around your corpus, gathering intel, making
demands, controlling your every move. They just have totally different ways of doing
it. Your nervous system uses lightning-fast
electrochemical action potentials, delivered by an expressway made of
neurons to specific cells and organs. But your endocrine system prefers a slower,
wider stream of data. It secretes hormones that travel through your
blood -- NOT through neurons -- so they move more slowly, but they also produce widespread effects
that last a whole lot longer than an action potential. Now, compared to your heart or brain or other,
arguably more glamorous organs, your endocrine system’s organs and glands are kinda small
and lumpy. They’re also rogues -- instead of being all
nestled together like in your other organ systems, these guys are scattered all over the place, from your
brain to your throat, to your kidneys, to your genitals. A gland is a just any structure that makes
and secretes a hormone. And the master gland in your body is the pituitary, which produces
many hormones that signal other glands -- like the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal
glands -- to make their own hormones. The endocrine system also includes a few organs
-- like the gonads, the pancreas, and the placenta in pregnant women -- all of which
have some other non-hormonal functions and are made up of multiple tissue types. And technically the hypothalamus in your brain
is in the endocrine club too, since in addition to all of its busy brain duties, it does produce
and release hormones. So, thanks to these glands and organs, you’ve got
all these hormones diffusing through your blood, doing all sorts of different things, but the thing to
remember about them is that a hormone can only trigger a reaction in specific cells -- their so-called
target cells -- that have the right receptors for it. So, just like some keys can open many locks,
while others only work with one, so too can the hormone-target-cell relationship either
be widespread or localized. You’re probably gonna want an example of
that. So, your thyroid -- at the bottom of your throat -- produces the hormone thyroxine,
which stimulates metabolism and binds to receptors in most of the cells in your body. But your pituitary -- which is nestled all
comfy under your brain -- produces follicle-stimulating hormone, which helps regulate growth and triggers
sexual maturity, and it only targets specific cells in the ovaries and testes. So how do hormones bind to their target cells? Well, chemically, most hormones are either
made of amino acids -- including their more complex structures like peptides or proteins
-- or they’re derived from lipids, like cholesterol. And this is key, because a hormone’s chemical
structure determines if it’s water soluble, like most amino acid-based ones are, or lipid
soluble, like steroids are. Solubility is important because your cell
membranes are made of lipids. That means that water soluble ones can’t
get across them. So target cells for those kinds of hormones have receptors for them
on the outside of their membranes. Lipid-soluble hormones, on the other hand,
can just basically glide right through that cell membrane, so their receptor sites are
inside their target cells. Either way, when a target cell is activated,
the hormone alters its activity, by either increasing or decreasing some of its functions
-- usually with the goal of maintaining your body’s homeostasis in one way or another. So, if hormones are keeping your body IN balance,
what’s putting your body out of balance? I don’t know -- could I interest you in
some pie? If you have a couple of nice, generous helpings
of strawberry-rhubarb pie -- and just to make things interesting, let’s say they’re a la mode --
your blood glucose level is gonna go through the roof. And the pancreas regulates your blood sugar by
releasing two different hormones -- insulin and glucagon. Once you have a belly full of that pie,
beta cells in your pancreas release insulin, which helps lower your blood sugar by increasing
the rate at which your cells store the sugar either as glycogen or as fat for later use. Now, let’s say you’ve done the opposite:
You’ve eaten no pie -- you’re pie-less -- in fact, you’ve eaten nothing for hours. If your blood sugar drops too low, then alpha
cells in the pancreas will instead send out glucagon, which helps raise your blood sugar
levels, in part by decreasing the storage of sugar in your cells, and triggering their
release of glucose back into the blood. Lots of different endocrine-related illnesses
-- like diabetes or hyperthyroidism -- tend to be the result of either hyper (too much)
or hypo (too little) secretion of certain hormones, which throw your homeostasis off
balance. But there are lots of more common -- and less
obvious -- ways your hormones can get out of balance, not because of some disorder,
but because these signaling chemicals are just caught up in a chain reaction, which
can take a while to subside. Some hormones just exist to control other
hormones, which in turn control still more hormones. So as soon as one starts to trickle out, you can
pretty quickly wind up with a cascade on your hands. You’ve got a few different hormone cascades
going on at any given moment, but one of the big ones -- one that’s really worth understanding
-- is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, or the HPA axis, because you don’t want
to have to say that every time. This is a complex series of interactions between
three glands that ultimately regulates lots of your body’s daily processes, like digestion, sexuality,
immune response, and how you handle stress. And it’s complex not just because of all
the glands involved -- it’s also one of the more crucial instances of your endocrine
system coordinating with your nervous system. Specifically, it’s behind that fight-or-flight
response that everybody keeps talking about. The HPA Axis is essentially the endocrine system’s
companion to the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic system, in times of high stress,
does things like speed up your heart rate and direct blood away from the digestive organs
and to the muscles. But many of the other effects of the stress
response are carried out by your endocrine system. And getting your nervous and endocrine
systems to work together in times of crisis is where the hypothalamus comes in. It’s the hub of where the two systems meet
-- it keeps tabs on what’s going on all over your body, analyzing your blood for signs
that something might be off. So, let’s revisit our fight-or-flight scene from a few
lessons ago -- the old Burning House Scenario. So you’re sleeping, dreaming about petting pandas with
Emma Watson or whatever, when the smoke alarm goes off. Well, action potentials in your brain trigger
neurons in your hypothalamus to release the peptide hormone CRH, or corticotropin releasing hormone. The CRH makes the very short trip through
the bloodstream to the anterior pituitary gland, where, because it’s water soluble, it
binds to receptors on the outside of its target cells. There, it triggers the release of adrenocorticotropic
hormone, or ACTH. The ACTH travels -- again through the bloodstream -- to the adrenal cortices
of the adrenal glands on top of your kidneys. When the ACTH binds to receptors on cells
in an adrenal cortex, it triggers the release of a frenzy of different freak-out compounds known
as glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid hormones. Typically these guys help us deal with day-to-day stress
by keeping our blood sugar and blood pressure balanced. But under major stress -- like waking up
in a burning building stress -- these hormones, like cortisol, cause the classic fight-or-flight
response: ramping up your blood pressure, dumping glucose into your bloodstream, shutting
down non-emergency services like your immune system and sperm and egg development. And guess what? Now that all these stress
hormones are pulsing through your blood, the hypothalamus back in the brain senses them. And because its job is to monitor and maintain
balance whenever possible, it then stops secreting CRH, which -- eventually -- causes the other
glands to stop secreting their panic hormones. Now, because this element of the stress response
is hormonal rather than electrical, it comes on more slowly than the nervous system part,
and it takes longer to subside, too, as those stress hormones linger in the blood before
being broken down by enzymes. So. We’re a long way from teenage crushes and zits
and crying over commercials at this point, aren’t we? As a life-long owner of hormones, I hope you’ll
join me in dispelling the stereotypes that surround these powerful and important chemicals,
and give them the respect they rightly deserve. Today we looked at the endocrine system, and
how it uses glands to produce hormones. These hormones are either amino-acid based and water
soluble, or steroidal and lipid-soluble, and may target many types of cells or just turn
on specific ones. We also touched on hormone cascades, and how the HPA axis effects your
stress response. Thank you to our Headmaster of Learning, Thomas

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 2: According to the transcript, what is the main function of the pituitary gland? Options: A. To produce hormones that regulate growth and development, B. To produce hormones that stimulate metabolism, C. To produce hormones that regulate the reproductive system, D. To produce hormones that regulate the immune system**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the "master gland of the body." A more accurate match would be a question that asks about the identity of the master gland, rather than its function.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would suggest:

**No exact match found, but Question 2 is the closest related to the pituitary gland.**

If I were to generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be:

**Question: What is the master gland of the body? Options: A. Thyroid, B. Pituitary, C. Adrenal, D. Pineal**

This new question exactly matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
I’ve invited you all here today because
I wanted to talk to you about some ugly stereotypes that are going around. I’ve been hearing a lot of unfair, unseemly, and
unscientific generalizations being made lately. And they mostly have to do with sex. And your hormones. People have a nasty habit of equating “hormones”
with a particular set of behaviors and conditions, most of which have to do with reproduction,
or sexual development, or acts that include what my brother John has referred to as “skoodilypooping.” For example, people will say that “hormones”
are why Kevin has zits, and is being all moody, or why Hannah, who’s three months pregnant,
just cried watching a commercial for car insurance -- which, let’s be honest, I do that too. Now, I’m not saying that hormones aren’t
at the root of sexual attraction, or zits, or occasional bouts of extreme emotion, because
they are. That’s just not all that they do. Not even close. When people talk about “hormones” in
the contexts that I just mentioned, what really they mean is "sex hormones." But sex hormones are just one kind of hormone
that you have coursing through your body right now. In fact, there are at least 50 different types
of these chemical messengers at work in your body at this very minute, but only a very few
of them have anything at all to do with sex. The truth is, from birth to death, just about
every cell and function in your body is under your hormones’ constant influence. They’re floating through your blood, regulating
your metabolism, your sleep cycle, your response to stress, and the general and incredibly important
overall homeostasis that keeps you not dead. Some hormones are just there to make other
hormones trigger even more hormones -- in a kind of chemical relay race that biologists
refer to, rather elegantly, as “cascades.” These hormones run through you no matter what
your mood is, or whether you have zits. So the reality is: We’re all hormonal ... all
of the time. OK, to begin to understand our hormones -- and
the endocrine system that produces, releases, and re-absorbs them -- we have to step back
and take a broad view. Not just by emphasizing that sex hormones aren’t
the only hormones you have -- but also by looking at how your hormones interact with
your other organ systems. Because, if anything, your body has two bosses
-- two complementary systems that are constantly shouting instructions over each other, to
all of your bits and pieces. Both your endocrine system and your nervous
system are constantly trafficking information around your corpus, gathering intel, making
demands, controlling your every move. They just have totally different ways of doing
it. Your nervous system uses lightning-fast
electrochemical action potentials, delivered by an expressway made of
neurons to specific cells and organs. But your endocrine system prefers a slower,
wider stream of data. It secretes hormones that travel through your
blood -- NOT through neurons -- so they move more slowly, but they also produce widespread effects
that last a whole lot longer than an action potential. Now, compared to your heart or brain or other,
arguably more glamorous organs, your endocrine system’s organs and glands are kinda small
and lumpy. They’re also rogues -- instead of being all
nestled together like in your other organ systems, these guys are scattered all over the place, from your
brain to your throat, to your kidneys, to your genitals. A gland is a just any structure that makes
and secretes a hormone. And the master gland in your body is the pituitary, which produces
many hormones that signal other glands -- like the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal
glands -- to make their own hormones. The endocrine system also includes a few organs
-- like the gonads, the pancreas, and the placenta in pregnant women -- all of which
have some other non-hormonal functions and are made up of multiple tissue types. And technically the hypothalamus in your brain
is in the endocrine club too, since in addition to all of its busy brain duties, it does produce
and release hormones. So, thanks to these glands and organs, you’ve got
all these hormones diffusing through your blood, doing all sorts of different things, but the thing to
remember about them is that a hormone can only trigger a reaction in specific cells -- their so-called
target cells -- that have the right receptors for it. So, just like some keys can open many locks,
while others only work with one, so too can the hormone-target-cell relationship either
be widespread or localized. You’re probably gonna want an example of
that. So, your thyroid -- at the bottom of your throat -- produces the hormone thyroxine,
which stimulates metabolism and binds to receptors in most of the cells in your body. But your pituitary -- which is nestled all
comfy under your brain -- produces follicle-stimulating hormone, which helps regulate growth and triggers
sexual maturity, and it only targets specific cells in the ovaries and testes. So how do hormones bind to their target cells? Well, chemically, most hormones are either
made of amino acids -- including their more complex structures like peptides or proteins
-- or they’re derived from lipids, like cholesterol. And this is key, because a hormone’s chemical
structure determines if it’s water soluble, like most amino acid-based ones are, or lipid
soluble, like steroids are. Solubility is important because your cell
membranes are made of lipids. That means that water soluble ones can’t
get across them. So target cells for those kinds of hormones have receptors for them
on the outside of their membranes. Lipid-soluble hormones, on the other hand,
can just basically glide right through that cell membrane, so their receptor sites are
inside their target cells. Either way, when a target cell is activated,
the hormone alters its activity, by either increasing or decreasing some of its functions
-- usually with the goal of maintaining your body’s homeostasis in one way or another. So, if hormones are keeping your body IN balance,
what’s putting your body out of balance? I don’t know -- could I interest you in
some pie? If you have a couple of nice, generous helpings
of strawberry-rhubarb pie -- and just to make things interesting, let’s say they’re a la mode --
your blood glucose level is gonna go through the roof. And the pancreas regulates your blood sugar by
releasing two different hormones -- insulin and glucagon. Once you have a belly full of that pie,
beta cells in your pancreas release insulin, which helps lower your blood sugar by increasing
the rate at which your cells store the sugar either as glycogen or as fat for later use. Now, let’s say you’ve done the opposite:
You’ve eaten no pie -- you’re pie-less -- in fact, you’ve eaten nothing for hours. If your blood sugar drops too low, then alpha
cells in the pancreas will instead send out glucagon, which helps raise your blood sugar
levels, in part by decreasing the storage of sugar in your cells, and triggering their
release of glucose back into the blood. Lots of different endocrine-related illnesses
-- like diabetes or hyperthyroidism -- tend to be the result of either hyper (too much)
or hypo (too little) secretion of certain hormones, which throw your homeostasis off
balance. But there are lots of more common -- and less
obvious -- ways your hormones can get out of balance, not because of some disorder,
but because these signaling chemicals are just caught up in a chain reaction, which
can take a while to subside. Some hormones just exist to control other
hormones, which in turn control still more hormones. So as soon as one starts to trickle out, you can
pretty quickly wind up with a cascade on your hands. You’ve got a few different hormone cascades
going on at any given moment, but one of the big ones -- one that’s really worth understanding
-- is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, or the HPA axis, because you don’t want
to have to say that every time. This is a complex series of interactions between
three glands that ultimately regulates lots of your body’s daily processes, like digestion, sexuality,
immune response, and how you handle stress. And it’s complex not just because of all
the glands involved -- it’s also one of the more crucial instances of your endocrine
system coordinating with your nervous system. Specifically, it’s behind that fight-or-flight
response that everybody keeps talking about. The HPA Axis is essentially the endocrine system’s
companion to the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic system, in times of high stress,
does things like speed up your heart rate and direct blood away from the digestive organs
and to the muscles. But many of the other effects of the stress
response are carried out by your endocrine system. And getting your nervous and endocrine
systems to work together in times of crisis is where the hypothalamus comes in. It’s the hub of where the two systems meet
-- it keeps tabs on what’s going on all over your body, analyzing your blood for signs
that something might be off. So, let’s revisit our fight-or-flight scene from a few
lessons ago -- the old Burning House Scenario. So you’re sleeping, dreaming about petting pandas with
Emma Watson or whatever, when the smoke alarm goes off. Well, action potentials in your brain trigger
neurons in your hypothalamus to release the peptide hormone CRH, or corticotropin releasing hormone. The CRH makes the very short trip through
the bloodstream to the anterior pituitary gland, where, because it’s water soluble, it
binds to receptors on the outside of its target cells. There, it triggers the release of adrenocorticotropic
hormone, or ACTH. The ACTH travels -- again through the bloodstream -- to the adrenal cortices
of the adrenal glands on top of your kidneys. When the ACTH binds to receptors on cells
in an adrenal cortex, it triggers the release of a frenzy of different freak-out compounds known
as glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid hormones. Typically these guys help us deal with day-to-day stress
by keeping our blood sugar and blood pressure balanced. But under major stress -- like waking up
in a burning building stress -- these hormones, like cortisol, cause the classic fight-or-flight
response: ramping up your blood pressure, dumping glucose into your bloodstream, shutting
down non-emergency services like your immune system and sperm and egg development. And guess what? Now that all these stress
hormones are pulsing through your blood, the hypothalamus back in the brain senses them. And because its job is to monitor and maintain
balance whenever possible, it then stops secreting CRH, which -- eventually -- causes the other
glands to stop secreting their panic hormones. Now, because this element of the stress response
is hormonal rather than electrical, it comes on more slowly than the nervous system part,
and it takes longer to subside, too, as those stress hormones linger in the blood before
being broken down by enzymes. So. We’re a long way from teenage crushes and zits
and crying over commercials at this point, aren’t we? As a life-long owner of hormones, I hope you’ll
join me in dispelling the stereotypes that surround these powerful and important chemicals,
and give them the respect they rightly deserve. Today we looked at the endocrine system, and
how it uses glands to produce hormones. These hormones are either amino-acid based and water
soluble, or steroidal and lipid-soluble, and may target many types of cells or just turn
on specific ones. We also touched on hormone cascades, and how the HPA axis effects your
stress response. Thank you to our Headmaster of Learning, Thomas

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of types of chemical messengers (hormones) at work in the body at a given time. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask about the number of hormones.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of hormones and their role in the body, I would suggest:

**Generated MCQ 2: According to the transcript, what is the main function of the pituitary gland?**

This MCQ is not directly related to the number of hormones, but it does ask about the pituitary gland, which is mentioned in the transcript as the "master gland" that produces many hormones.

That being said, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: **2** (with the caveat that it's not a good match).

Please note that it would be better to generate new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
I’ve invited you all here today because
I wanted to talk to you about some ugly stereotypes that are going around. I’ve been hearing a lot of unfair, unseemly, and
unscientific generalizations being made lately. And they mostly have to do with sex. And your hormones. People have a nasty habit of equating “hormones”
with a particular set of behaviors and conditions, most of which have to do with reproduction,
or sexual development, or acts that include what my brother John has referred to as “skoodilypooping.” For example, people will say that “hormones”
are why Kevin has zits, and is being all moody, or why Hannah, who’s three months pregnant,
just cried watching a commercial for car insurance -- which, let’s be honest, I do that too. Now, I’m not saying that hormones aren’t
at the root of sexual attraction, or zits, or occasional bouts of extreme emotion, because
they are. That’s just not all that they do. Not even close. When people talk about “hormones” in
the contexts that I just mentioned, what really they mean is "sex hormones." But sex hormones are just one kind of hormone
that you have coursing through your body right now. In fact, there are at least 50 different types
of these chemical messengers at work in your body at this very minute, but only a very few
of them have anything at all to do with sex. The truth is, from birth to death, just about
every cell and function in your body is under your hormones’ constant influence. They’re floating through your blood, regulating
your metabolism, your sleep cycle, your response to stress, and the general and incredibly important
overall homeostasis that keeps you not dead. Some hormones are just there to make other
hormones trigger even more hormones -- in a kind of chemical relay race that biologists
refer to, rather elegantly, as “cascades.” These hormones run through you no matter what
your mood is, or whether you have zits. So the reality is: We’re all hormonal ... all
of the time. OK, to begin to understand our hormones -- and
the endocrine system that produces, releases, and re-absorbs them -- we have to step back
and take a broad view. Not just by emphasizing that sex hormones aren’t
the only hormones you have -- but also by looking at how your hormones interact with
your other organ systems. Because, if anything, your body has two bosses
-- two complementary systems that are constantly shouting instructions over each other, to
all of your bits and pieces. Both your endocrine system and your nervous
system are constantly trafficking information around your corpus, gathering intel, making
demands, controlling your every move. They just have totally different ways of doing
it. Your nervous system uses lightning-fast
electrochemical action potentials, delivered by an expressway made of
neurons to specific cells and organs. But your endocrine system prefers a slower,
wider stream of data. It secretes hormones that travel through your
blood -- NOT through neurons -- so they move more slowly, but they also produce widespread effects
that last a whole lot longer than an action potential. Now, compared to your heart or brain or other,
arguably more glamorous organs, your endocrine system’s organs and glands are kinda small
and lumpy. They’re also rogues -- instead of being all
nestled together like in your other organ systems, these guys are scattered all over the place, from your
brain to your throat, to your kidneys, to your genitals. A gland is a just any structure that makes
and secretes a hormone. And the master gland in your body is the pituitary, which produces
many hormones that signal other glands -- like the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal
glands -- to make their own hormones. The endocrine system also includes a few organs
-- like the gonads, the pancreas, and the placenta in pregnant women -- all of which
have some other non-hormonal functions and are made up of multiple tissue types. And technically the hypothalamus in your brain
is in the endocrine club too, since in addition to all of its busy brain duties, it does produce
and release hormones. So, thanks to these glands and organs, you’ve got
all these hormones diffusing through your blood, doing all sorts of different things, but the thing to
remember about them is that a hormone can only trigger a reaction in specific cells -- their so-called
target cells -- that have the right receptors for it. So, just like some keys can open many locks,
while others only work with one, so too can the hormone-target-cell relationship either
be widespread or localized. You’re probably gonna want an example of
that. So, your thyroid -- at the bottom of your throat -- produces the hormone thyroxine,
which stimulates metabolism and binds to receptors in most of the cells in your body. But your pituitary -- which is nestled all
comfy under your brain -- produces follicle-stimulating hormone, which helps regulate growth and triggers
sexual maturity, and it only targets specific cells in the ovaries and testes. So how do hormones bind to their target cells? Well, chemically, most hormones are either
made of amino acids -- including their more complex structures like peptides or proteins
-- or they’re derived from lipids, like cholesterol. And this is key, because a hormone’s chemical
structure determines if it’s water soluble, like most amino acid-based ones are, or lipid
soluble, like steroids are. Solubility is important because your cell
membranes are made of lipids. That means that water soluble ones can’t
get across them. So target cells for those kinds of hormones have receptors for them
on the outside of their membranes. Lipid-soluble hormones, on the other hand,
can just basically glide right through that cell membrane, so their receptor sites are
inside their target cells. Either way, when a target cell is activated,
the hormone alters its activity, by either increasing or decreasing some of its functions
-- usually with the goal of maintaining your body’s homeostasis in one way or another. So, if hormones are keeping your body IN balance,
what’s putting your body out of balance? I don’t know -- could I interest you in
some pie? If you have a couple of nice, generous helpings
of strawberry-rhubarb pie -- and just to make things interesting, let’s say they’re a la mode --
your blood glucose level is gonna go through the roof. And the pancreas regulates your blood sugar by
releasing two different hormones -- insulin and glucagon. Once you have a belly full of that pie,
beta cells in your pancreas release insulin, which helps lower your blood sugar by increasing
the rate at which your cells store the sugar either as glycogen or as fat for later use. Now, let’s say you’ve done the opposite:
You’ve eaten no pie -- you’re pie-less -- in fact, you’ve eaten nothing for hours. If your blood sugar drops too low, then alpha
cells in the pancreas will instead send out glucagon, which helps raise your blood sugar
levels, in part by decreasing the storage of sugar in your cells, and triggering their
release of glucose back into the blood. Lots of different endocrine-related illnesses
-- like diabetes or hyperthyroidism -- tend to be the result of either hyper (too much)
or hypo (too little) secretion of certain hormones, which throw your homeostasis off
balance. But there are lots of more common -- and less
obvious -- ways your hormones can get out of balance, not because of some disorder,
but because these signaling chemicals are just caught up in a chain reaction, which
can take a while to subside. Some hormones just exist to control other
hormones, which in turn control still more hormones. So as soon as one starts to trickle out, you can
pretty quickly wind up with a cascade on your hands. You’ve got a few different hormone cascades
going on at any given moment, but one of the big ones -- one that’s really worth understanding
-- is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, or the HPA axis, because you don’t want
to have to say that every time. This is a complex series of interactions between
three glands that ultimately regulates lots of your body’s daily processes, like digestion, sexuality,
immune response, and how you handle stress. And it’s complex not just because of all
the glands involved -- it’s also one of the more crucial instances of your endocrine
system coordinating with your nervous system. Specifically, it’s behind that fight-or-flight
response that everybody keeps talking about. The HPA Axis is essentially the endocrine system’s
companion to the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic system, in times of high stress,
does things like speed up your heart rate and direct blood away from the digestive organs
and to the muscles. But many of the other effects of the stress
response are carried out by your endocrine system. And getting your nervous and endocrine
systems to work together in times of crisis is where the hypothalamus comes in. It’s the hub of where the two systems meet
-- it keeps tabs on what’s going on all over your body, analyzing your blood for signs
that something might be off. So, let’s revisit our fight-or-flight scene from a few
lessons ago -- the old Burning House Scenario. So you’re sleeping, dreaming about petting pandas with
Emma Watson or whatever, when the smoke alarm goes off. Well, action potentials in your brain trigger
neurons in your hypothalamus to release the peptide hormone CRH, or corticotropin releasing hormone. The CRH makes the very short trip through
the bloodstream to the anterior pituitary gland, where, because it’s water soluble, it
binds to receptors on the outside of its target cells. There, it triggers the release of adrenocorticotropic
hormone, or ACTH. The ACTH travels -- again through the bloodstream -- to the adrenal cortices
of the adrenal glands on top of your kidneys. When the ACTH binds to receptors on cells
in an adrenal cortex, it triggers the release of a frenzy of different freak-out compounds known
as glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid hormones. Typically these guys help us deal with day-to-day stress
by keeping our blood sugar and blood pressure balanced. But under major stress -- like waking up
in a burning building stress -- these hormones, like cortisol, cause the classic fight-or-flight
response: ramping up your blood pressure, dumping glucose into your bloodstream, shutting
down non-emergency services like your immune system and sperm and egg development. And guess what? Now that all these stress
hormones are pulsing through your blood, the hypothalamus back in the brain senses them. And because its job is to monitor and maintain
balance whenever possible, it then stops secreting CRH, which -- eventually -- causes the other
glands to stop secreting their panic hormones. Now, because this element of the stress response
is hormonal rather than electrical, it comes on more slowly than the nervous system part,
and it takes longer to subside, too, as those stress hormones linger in the blood before
being broken down by enzymes. So. We’re a long way from teenage crushes and zits
and crying over commercials at this point, aren’t we? As a life-long owner of hormones, I hope you’ll
join me in dispelling the stereotypes that surround these powerful and important chemicals,
and give them the respect they rightly deserve. Today we looked at the endocrine system, and
how it uses glands to produce hormones. These hormones are either amino-acid based and water
soluble, or steroidal and lipid-soluble, and may target many types of cells or just turn
on specific ones. We also touched on hormone cascades, and how the HPA axis effects your
stress response. Thank you to our Headmaster of Learning, Thomas

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 2: According to the transcript, what is the main function of the pituitary gland? Options: A. To produce hormones that regulate growth and development, B. To produce hormones that stimulate metabolism, C. To produce hormones that regulate the reproductive system, D. To produce hormones that regulate the immune system**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the "master gland of the body." A more accurate match would be a question that asks about the identity of the master gland, rather than its function.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would suggest:

**No exact match found, but Question 2 is the closest related to the pituitary gland.**

If I were to generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be:

**Question: What is the master gland of the body? Options: A. Thyroid, B. Pituitary, C. Adrenal, D. Pineal**

This new question exactly matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It's not hard to imagine a world
where at any given moment, you and everyone you know could be
wiped out without warning at the push of a button. This was the reality for millions
of people during the 45-year period after World War II, now known as the Cold War. As the United States and Soviet Union
faced off across the globe, each knew that the other had nuclear
weapons capable of destroying it. And destruction never loomed closer
than during the 13 days of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1961, the U.S. unsuccessfully tried to
overthrow Cuba's new communist government. That failed attempt was known
as the Bay of Pigs, and it convinced Cuba to seek help
from the U.S.S.R. Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev
was happy to comply by secretly deploying nuclear
missiles to Cuba, not only to protect the island, but to counteract the threat from
U.S. missiles in Italy and Turkey. By the time U.S. intelligence 
discovered the plan, the materials to create the missiles
were already in place. At an emergency meeting on
October 16, 1962, military advisors urged an airstrike
on missile sites and invasion of the island. But President John F. Kennedy chose
a more careful approach. On October 22, he announced that the
the U.S. Navy would intercept all shipments to Cuba. There was just one problem: a naval blockade was considered
an act of war. Although the President called it
a quarantine that did not block basic necessities, the Soviets didn't appreciate 
the distinction. In an outraged letter to Kennedy, Khrushchev wrote, "The violation 
of freedom to use international waters and international airspace
is an act of aggression which pushes mankind toward the abyss
of world nuclear missile war." Thus ensued the most intense
six days of the Cold War. While the U.S. demanded the removal
of the missiles, Cuba and the U.S.S.R insisted
they were only defensive. And as the weapons continued
to be armed, the U.S. prepared for a possible invasion. On October 27, a spy plane piloted
by Major Rudolph Anderson was shot down by a Soviet missile. The same day, a nuclear-armed Soviet
submarine was hit by a small-depth charge from a U.S. Navy vessel trying
to signal it to come up. The commanders on the sub,
too deep to communicate with the surface, thought war had begun
and prepared to launch a nuclear torpedo. That decision had to be made unanimously
by three officers. The captain and political officer
both authorized the launch, but Vasili Arkhipov, 
second in command, refused. His decision saved the day
and perhaps the world. But the crisis wasn't over. For the first time in history, the U.S. Military set itself
to DEFCON 2, the defense readiness one step
away from nuclear war. With hundreds of nuclear missiles
ready to launch, the metaphorical Doomsday Clock
stood at one minute to midnight. But diplomacy carried on. In Washington, D.C., Attorney General
Robert Kennedy secretly met with Soviet Ambassador
Anatoly Dobrynin. After intense negotiation,
they reached the following proposal. The U.S. would remove their missiles
from Turkey and Italy and promise to never invade Cuba in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal
from Cuba under U.N. inspection. Once the meeting had concluded, Dobrynin cabled Moscow saying 
time is of the essence and we shouldn't miss the chance. And at 9 a.m. the next day, a message arrived from Khrushchev announcing the Soviet missiles would be
removed from Cuba. The crisis was now over. While criticized at the time by their
respective governments for bargaining with the enemy, contemporary historical analysis
shows great admiration for Kennedy's and Khrushchev's ability
to diplomatically solve the crisis. But the disturbing lesson was that
a slight communication error, or split-second decision by a commander,
could have thwarted all their efforts, as it nearly did if not for 
Vasili Arkhipov's courageous choice. The Cuban Missile Crisis revealed just how
fragile human politics are compared to the terrifying power
they can unleash.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 has some relevance. However, the question intent is not the same.

A more relevant question would be one that asks about the Soviet Union's intentions or actions regarding Cuba. Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 is the closest, but it asks about the Soviet premier's name, not the Soviet Union's intentions.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that Question 4 is the closest, but with a low similarity score.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4 (with a low similarity score)

Please note that a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that asks about the Soviet Union's intentions or actions regarding Cuba, with options that include "defend" as the correct answer.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the closest match would be a question that discusses the U.S. actions during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

The most similar generated MCQ would be Question 5, but it doesn't directly address the reason behind the U.S. calling the blockade a quarantine.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible match based on the topic.

A possible match could be a generated MCQ that asks about the U.S. actions during the Cuban Missile Crisis, specifically the reason behind the U.S. calling the blockade a quarantine. Unfortunately, such a question is not present in the generated MCQs.

However, if I had to choose an index, I would say that the closest match would be a question that is not present in the list. But if I had to choose from the existing list, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match, but it's not a direct match.

Index: None (or 5, but it's not a direct match)

**Transcript**:
It's not hard to imagine a world
where at any given moment, you and everyone you know could be
wiped out without warning at the push of a button. This was the reality for millions
of people during the 45-year period after World War II, now known as the Cold War. As the United States and Soviet Union
faced off across the globe, each knew that the other had nuclear
weapons capable of destroying it. And destruction never loomed closer
than during the 13 days of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1961, the U.S. unsuccessfully tried to
overthrow Cuba's new communist government. That failed attempt was known
as the Bay of Pigs, and it convinced Cuba to seek help
from the U.S.S.R. Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev
was happy to comply by secretly deploying nuclear
missiles to Cuba, not only to protect the island, but to counteract the threat from
U.S. missiles in Italy and Turkey. By the time U.S. intelligence 
discovered the plan, the materials to create the missiles
were already in place. At an emergency meeting on
October 16, 1962, military advisors urged an airstrike
on missile sites and invasion of the island. But President John F. Kennedy chose
a more careful approach. On October 22, he announced that the
the U.S. Navy would intercept all shipments to Cuba. There was just one problem: a naval blockade was considered
an act of war. Although the President called it
a quarantine that did not block basic necessities, the Soviets didn't appreciate 
the distinction. In an outraged letter to Kennedy, Khrushchev wrote, "The violation 
of freedom to use international waters and international airspace
is an act of aggression which pushes mankind toward the abyss
of world nuclear missile war." Thus ensued the most intense
six days of the Cold War. While the U.S. demanded the removal
of the missiles, Cuba and the U.S.S.R insisted
they were only defensive. And as the weapons continued
to be armed, the U.S. prepared for a possible invasion. On October 27, a spy plane piloted
by Major Rudolph Anderson was shot down by a Soviet missile. The same day, a nuclear-armed Soviet
submarine was hit by a small-depth charge from a U.S. Navy vessel trying
to signal it to come up. The commanders on the sub,
too deep to communicate with the surface, thought war had begun
and prepared to launch a nuclear torpedo. That decision had to be made unanimously
by three officers. The captain and political officer
both authorized the launch, but Vasili Arkhipov, 
second in command, refused. His decision saved the day
and perhaps the world. But the crisis wasn't over. For the first time in history, the U.S. Military set itself
to DEFCON 2, the defense readiness one step
away from nuclear war. With hundreds of nuclear missiles
ready to launch, the metaphorical Doomsday Clock
stood at one minute to midnight. But diplomacy carried on. In Washington, D.C., Attorney General
Robert Kennedy secretly met with Soviet Ambassador
Anatoly Dobrynin. After intense negotiation,
they reached the following proposal. The U.S. would remove their missiles
from Turkey and Italy and promise to never invade Cuba in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal
from Cuba under U.N. inspection. Once the meeting had concluded, Dobrynin cabled Moscow saying 
time is of the essence and we shouldn't miss the chance. And at 9 a.m. the next day, a message arrived from Khrushchev announcing the Soviet missiles would be
removed from Cuba. The crisis was now over. While criticized at the time by their
respective governments for bargaining with the enemy, contemporary historical analysis
shows great admiration for Kennedy's and Khrushchev's ability
to diplomatically solve the crisis. But the disturbing lesson was that
a slight communication error, or split-second decision by a commander,
could have thwarted all their efforts, as it nearly did if not for 
Vasili Arkhipov's courageous choice. The Cuban Missile Crisis revealed just how
fragile human politics are compared to the terrifying power
they can unleash.

Have you ever walked into a grocery store and wondered where all those variety
of apples came from? You might find SnapDragon, Pixie Crunch, Cosmic Crisp, Jazz, or Ambrosia next to the more familiar
Red Delicious and Granny Smith. These delightfully descriptive names belong to just a handful of the over
7,500 apple varieties in the world. This huge diversity exists largely because
of humanity's efforts to bear new fruit. Fruit breeding is a way to fulfill
the expectations of farmers and consumers who seek specific qualities in an apple. On the one hand, farmers may want them
to be disease-resistant and to store well. On the other, consumers are swayed
by appearance, taste, and novelty. So, breeders have to consider everything from how well apples grow
in certain climates to their color, taste, and size. And sometimes finding the perfect
fit means breeding something new. To create apples 
with desirable characteristics, breeders first need to find parent
apples that carry those characteristics. Once the parents have been selected, they have to wait until the trees
bloom in the spring. The breeder takes the pollen
from one bloom, called the father, and transfers it by hand to the other
parent bloom, called the mother, through a process 
called cross-pollination. Once the mother bloom 
turns into an apple, the seeds are collected and then planted. It takes about five years for these seeds
to grow into trees that produce apples, but because of the way 
traits are inherited, all of the seedlings produced will have
different sets of genes and characteristics. This means that to achieve 
a desired quality, it takes a lot of offspring, not to mention patience 
on the breeder's part. When a seedling does bear fruit
with the desired qualities, it's selected for further evaluation. Of the original crossed seedlings, about one in every 5,000 makes it
to this prestigious stage. They're then sent to new farms where breeders can assess how various
climates and soil types affect the plant's growth. The fruit of the seedling 
and its many clones must then be collected and sampled
to ensure consistency. Breeders study about 45 traits
in an apple, like the texture 
and firmness of the flesh, when it ripens, how sugary its juice is, and how long it stays fresh. Over several years, they weed out
all the bad apples, selecting only those 
whose fruits are the best. These exclusive plants 
officially form the cultivar, or new apple variety. To ensure an exact copy of this cultivar, all apple trees must be grafted 
from the original seedling. Branches, called scion wood, are cut from the original tree 
and grown to generate more scion wood. Segments of these trees are then grafted
onto root stalk - that's the lower section of another tree that's been chosen 
from a different cultivar for its superior roots 
and growing ability. Finally, this fusion creates 
a new apple tree with the desired qualities. Each new plant takes up to four years before it starts producing 
the fruit we eat. Apple breeding may be a difficult art,
but it's accessible to all: universities, companies, and even individuals can create
new cultivars. But to fully own an apple, the breeder
faces a final challenge - naming the fruit. After a cultivar is patented, a breeder chooses a name
for its trademark. That final step grants them long-lasting
rights over the apple and its clones. That name must be completely original, and the catchier, the better, of course. With over 7,500 varieties and counting, that's why we have apples called
Pink Lady, Sweet Tango, Kiku, and EverCrisp. The more we work with nature's bounty
to breed new cultivars, the more creative and delectable
these names will become.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

Here's why:

- The ground truth MCQ asks about the definition of a cultivar, and the correct answer is "A new variety."
- Question 6 from the generated MCQs asks about the purpose of grafting branches from the original tree onto root stalk, and the correct answer is "To create a new apple tree with the desired qualities." This process is directly related to creating a new cultivar.
- Although the questions are not identical, they both relate to the concept of creating a new apple variety, which is the core idea of a cultivar.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content. If I had to choose the closest match based on the provided options, I would choose Question 6.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever walked into a grocery store and wondered where all those variety
of apples came from? You might find SnapDragon, Pixie Crunch, Cosmic Crisp, Jazz, or Ambrosia next to the more familiar
Red Delicious and Granny Smith. These delightfully descriptive names belong to just a handful of the over
7,500 apple varieties in the world. This huge diversity exists largely because
of humanity's efforts to bear new fruit. Fruit breeding is a way to fulfill
the expectations of farmers and consumers who seek specific qualities in an apple. On the one hand, farmers may want them
to be disease-resistant and to store well. On the other, consumers are swayed
by appearance, taste, and novelty. So, breeders have to consider everything from how well apples grow
in certain climates to their color, taste, and size. And sometimes finding the perfect
fit means breeding something new. To create apples 
with desirable characteristics, breeders first need to find parent
apples that carry those characteristics. Once the parents have been selected, they have to wait until the trees
bloom in the spring. The breeder takes the pollen
from one bloom, called the father, and transfers it by hand to the other
parent bloom, called the mother, through a process 
called cross-pollination. Once the mother bloom 
turns into an apple, the seeds are collected and then planted. It takes about five years for these seeds
to grow into trees that produce apples, but because of the way 
traits are inherited, all of the seedlings produced will have
different sets of genes and characteristics. This means that to achieve 
a desired quality, it takes a lot of offspring, not to mention patience 
on the breeder's part. When a seedling does bear fruit
with the desired qualities, it's selected for further evaluation. Of the original crossed seedlings, about one in every 5,000 makes it
to this prestigious stage. They're then sent to new farms where breeders can assess how various
climates and soil types affect the plant's growth. The fruit of the seedling 
and its many clones must then be collected and sampled
to ensure consistency. Breeders study about 45 traits
in an apple, like the texture 
and firmness of the flesh, when it ripens, how sugary its juice is, and how long it stays fresh. Over several years, they weed out
all the bad apples, selecting only those 
whose fruits are the best. These exclusive plants 
officially form the cultivar, or new apple variety. To ensure an exact copy of this cultivar, all apple trees must be grafted 
from the original seedling. Branches, called scion wood, are cut from the original tree 
and grown to generate more scion wood. Segments of these trees are then grafted
onto root stalk - that's the lower section of another tree that's been chosen 
from a different cultivar for its superior roots 
and growing ability. Finally, this fusion creates 
a new apple tree with the desired qualities. Each new plant takes up to four years before it starts producing 
the fruit we eat. Apple breeding may be a difficult art,
but it's accessible to all: universities, companies, and even individuals can create
new cultivars. But to fully own an apple, the breeder
faces a final challenge - naming the fruit. After a cultivar is patented, a breeder chooses a name
for its trademark. That final step grants them long-lasting
rights over the apple and its clones. That name must be completely original, and the catchier, the better, of course. With over 7,500 varieties and counting, that's why we have apples called
Pink Lady, Sweet Tango, Kiku, and EverCrisp. The more we work with nature's bounty
to breed new cultivars, the more creative and delectable
these names will become.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ in terms of the topic of creating new apple varieties. However, a more relevant generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ's intent is not available.

That being said, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 5, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

However, I noticed that the correct answer for the ground truth MCQ is "D. All of the above" which includes "Universities, Companies, and even Individuals". Among the generated MCQs, none of them exactly match this question. But I can suggest a better match.

A better match would be to create a new MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ. Since that is not available among the generated MCQs, I will choose the closest one in terms of the topic.

But if I really had to choose one from the existing generated MCQs, I would say Question 5 is not the best match, but Question 10 has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ in terms of apple breeding.

However, I must emphasize that the correct answer for the ground truth MCQ "D. All of the above" has the option "Universities" which is mentioned in the transcript as "universities, companies, and even individuals can create new cultivars." 

With that in mind, I found a better match, but it is still not an exact match.

- So the other group of ants
[Dr. Corrie Moreau, curator/ants] that we have today are bullet ants. 
[Dr. Corrie Moreau, curator/ants] - Why are they called bullet ants?
[Bullet ant, Paraponera clavata] - Well, they're called bullet ants
[Bullet ant, Paraponera clavata] because their sting is so painful
[* causing excruciating pain, numbness & trembling] it feels like you were shot by a gun.
[* causing excruciating pain, numbness & trembling] - And you've experienced
this firsthand? - I have, just once, I'd like
to keep it that way. And so you can see they're
actually quite tremendous ants, I mean, they're really foreboding,
[* worker bullet ants are 18–30 mm long] they're crazy big and they're cool.
[* worker bullet ants are 18–30 mm long] - Are they the largest ant? - They're one of the largest ants. There's another genus called Dinoponera.
[Dinoponera, Dinoponera australis] In some ways larger.
[* females may surpass 30–40 mm in length] Not as painful of a sting, though.
[* females may surpass 30–40 mm in length] This is Paraponera.
[Bullet ant, Paraponera clavata] We're studying the gut bacteria
actually in this group of ants. But we're also
interested in the venom. And so what I was telling
you is part of the reason I brought them back
alive is that at one point I had tried to milk them, because
my colleague was like, "It's because we weren't sure if
we'd have permits to bring back alive." - Yeah.
- You can just milk them. So I can show you how
I attempted to do it and I will tell you that it
didn't work in the end. When I got the venom back
it was actually not usable. But let me grab my equipment. - It's not every day you get to
milk a venomous ant. At work. - So this is our fancy equipment. So if you think about, like, how they milk the venom
from spiders, right? Usually they just have
them bite something and squirt the venom inside
and it's the same principle. So again, we just have
our empty tubes, and we have a little
bit of parafilm, right, which is essentially just like
a waxy kind of paper-y thing that we can stretch
across the top of this. And we're going to get them
to try to sting through the tube and deposit their venom
on the side of the tube. - Wow.
- Yeah. One thing I have noticed is, what's really interesting
actually, is with these bullet ants, when you collect them in the
wild they're incredibly aggressive. You disturb them at all, and they
just go into immediate attack mode. In fact in the field, if you
even like blow on them, you can physically
hear them stridulate, which is a way of communicating
between individuals. And now that they've been
in the lab for just a few days, they're actually almost docile. And so I'm curious to see whether
they'll even sting through this. But we'll try. Yeah, see, this one stridulates. So now let's see if we
put her abdomen up, yeah, she is depositing
her sting through. - Oh!
- See that? - Sting it! Sting it! - So you see, she's got her sting out, this is where I don't want
to lose control of her. She'll try to sting through, oh, there, you saw that sting go? That's huge. 
- Yeah. Wow. Focus your anger. - We will try to get another one to sting 
- Come on, ladies. - You look like a new victim,
raaah, let's get her all mad. - Yeaaaah! Oh, she's stridulating. - She's actually kinda not
mad as much anymore. - They're—they're just
like, they're like, "Corrie, we wanna hang out,
I thought we were cool." - I know, that's probably
exactly what they think. - Like, "Come on, Corrie," "I read your latest paper about
climactic regional distribution" "of my sister species." I don't even know if that's
what you've written about, I don't even know if that—
those words even make sense. - You don't read all my
scientific publications? - Um, I probably couldn't
get through the abstract. Not—not just yours, but most. - I won't take it personally. Oh, yeah, she's got a very big sting,
so let's see if I can get her to— - Yeah. Sting it. - So that's how you milk a
bullet ant for their venom. So essentially, just getting them
to sting through this material, they have now
deposited their venom all over the top of this
and inside of that tube, so I can just shove
that in there and then take it back
to an analytical lab to look at what are the—what's
the chemistry within the venom. Now, I've already told you that
that didn't work so successfully, so in a sense, what we need to do
is dissect out the venom glad, and that's where it
gets a little more tricky, because in this case, you
can see they're big and— - Cranky. - Cranky. And they
don't like to hold still. Do this under the microscope. Okay, so now, again, we're
gonna just pull off her abdomen, oh God, these are some tough ants.
[* abdomen] Even tougher than the bullet ants.
- Wow. - So now we've got—
- You did it. - —her body separated
from her abdomen. I wanna just tease apart some
of the parts of the abdomen and then we can usually pull the
venom gland out through the sting. So I'm just gonna start
pulling apart the body, and since I don't want to
rupture the venom gland, I wanna try not to stab too much. - Yeah, this is meticulous work, dissecting ants. 
- Yeah. - What is the smallest ant that
you'll work on under a microscope? - Oh, I'll work on anyone. - Even the ones
that are so small that you can't even see
them on the labels? - Yep, even those. I've had to
dissect out their guts, too. - How do you even get
forceps that small? - Suspense, right? 
- Yeah, the pressure. - Yeah, nothing like having
to dissect on camera, too. As if it's not hard enough, right? - Yeah, all the viewers are
at home, quietly judging you. They're like, "Well, when
I dissected ants last—" - I was thinking they were biting
their fingernails in suspense. - Yeah, that too. - So at the one end, let's see if I can put it
in a good orientation— you can actually
see the left side, if you look through
the microscope, you can actually see the sting hanging all the way out.
[* sting] - Oh yeah!
- It's like a giant hypodermic needle. - Yeah. - And then starting at the
other end on the right side, we can actually start to see
those parts of the digestive system. So first you have the crop, right?
[* crop] So it's that social food sharing organ,
which then transitions into the mid gut and then into what's called the ileum
[* mid gut, * ileum] and then finally into the rectum,
[* rectum] and then alongside that is where the venom gland sits.
[* venom gland] - That's amazing.
- Yeah, it's really awesome. One of the things that's cool
when you first open them up is that the contents within the gut, you can see fat and
you can see the trachea and all those other things,
and even within the gut, it's either clear like it
almost looks like water, or sometimes you can see
things that look like waste, but within the venom sac,
it's actually almost like oil. And so when you burst it,
it's literally like oil coming out, not like liquid, like, you
know, in the same sense. - Cool.
- Yeah. - Nice.
- So now the question is, are you gonna hold
a bullet ant for 10 seconds? The Brain Scoop is brought to you by the Field Museum in Chicago It still has brains on it.

**Transcript**:
- So the other group of ants
[Dr. Corrie Moreau, curator/ants] that we have today are bullet ants. 
[Dr. Corrie Moreau, curator/ants] - Why are they called bullet ants?
[Bullet ant, Paraponera clavata] - Well, they're called bullet ants
[Bullet ant, Paraponera clavata] because their sting is so painful
[* causing excruciating pain, numbness & trembling] it feels like you were shot by a gun.
[* causing excruciating pain, numbness & trembling] - And you've experienced
this firsthand? - I have, just once, I'd like
to keep it that way. And so you can see they're
actually quite tremendous ants, I mean, they're really foreboding,
[* worker bullet ants are 18–30 mm long] they're crazy big and they're cool.
[* worker bullet ants are 18–30 mm long] - Are they the largest ant? - They're one of the largest ants. There's another genus called Dinoponera.
[Dinoponera, Dinoponera australis] In some ways larger.
[* females may surpass 30–40 mm in length] Not as painful of a sting, though.
[* females may surpass 30–40 mm in length] This is Paraponera.
[Bullet ant, Paraponera clavata] We're studying the gut bacteria
actually in this group of ants. But we're also
interested in the venom. And so what I was telling
you is part of the reason I brought them back
alive is that at one point I had tried to milk them, because
my colleague was like, "It's because we weren't sure if
we'd have permits to bring back alive." - Yeah.
- You can just milk them. So I can show you how
I attempted to do it and I will tell you that it
didn't work in the end. When I got the venom back
it was actually not usable. But let me grab my equipment. - It's not every day you get to
milk a venomous ant. At work. - So this is our fancy equipment. So if you think about, like, how they milk the venom
from spiders, right? Usually they just have
them bite something and squirt the venom inside
and it's the same principle. So again, we just have
our empty tubes, and we have a little
bit of parafilm, right, which is essentially just like
a waxy kind of paper-y thing that we can stretch
across the top of this. And we're going to get them
to try to sting through the tube and deposit their venom
on the side of the tube. - Wow.
- Yeah. One thing I have noticed is, what's really interesting
actually, is with these bullet ants, when you collect them in the
wild they're incredibly aggressive. You disturb them at all, and they
just go into immediate attack mode. In fact in the field, if you
even like blow on them, you can physically
hear them stridulate, which is a way of communicating
between individuals. And now that they've been
in the lab for just a few days, they're actually almost docile. And so I'm curious to see whether
they'll even sting through this. But we'll try. Yeah, see, this one stridulates. So now let's see if we
put her abdomen up, yeah, she is depositing
her sting through. - Oh!
- See that? - Sting it! Sting it! - So you see, she's got her sting out, this is where I don't want
to lose control of her. She'll try to sting through, oh, there, you saw that sting go? That's huge. 
- Yeah. Wow. Focus your anger. - We will try to get another one to sting 
- Come on, ladies. - You look like a new victim,
raaah, let's get her all mad. - Yeaaaah! Oh, she's stridulating. - She's actually kinda not
mad as much anymore. - They're—they're just
like, they're like, "Corrie, we wanna hang out,
I thought we were cool." - I know, that's probably
exactly what they think. - Like, "Come on, Corrie," "I read your latest paper about
climactic regional distribution" "of my sister species." I don't even know if that's
what you've written about, I don't even know if that—
those words even make sense. - You don't read all my
scientific publications? - Um, I probably couldn't
get through the abstract. Not—not just yours, but most. - I won't take it personally. Oh, yeah, she's got a very big sting,
so let's see if I can get her to— - Yeah. Sting it. - So that's how you milk a
bullet ant for their venom. So essentially, just getting them
to sting through this material, they have now
deposited their venom all over the top of this
and inside of that tube, so I can just shove
that in there and then take it back
to an analytical lab to look at what are the—what's
the chemistry within the venom. Now, I've already told you that
that didn't work so successfully, so in a sense, what we need to do
is dissect out the venom glad, and that's where it
gets a little more tricky, because in this case, you
can see they're big and— - Cranky. - Cranky. And they
don't like to hold still. Do this under the microscope. Okay, so now, again, we're
gonna just pull off her abdomen, oh God, these are some tough ants.
[* abdomen] Even tougher than the bullet ants.
- Wow. - So now we've got—
- You did it. - —her body separated
from her abdomen. I wanna just tease apart some
of the parts of the abdomen and then we can usually pull the
venom gland out through the sting. So I'm just gonna start
pulling apart the body, and since I don't want to
rupture the venom gland, I wanna try not to stab too much. - Yeah, this is meticulous work, dissecting ants. 
- Yeah. - What is the smallest ant that
you'll work on under a microscope? - Oh, I'll work on anyone. - Even the ones
that are so small that you can't even see
them on the labels? - Yep, even those. I've had to
dissect out their guts, too. - How do you even get
forceps that small? - Suspense, right? 
- Yeah, the pressure. - Yeah, nothing like having
to dissect on camera, too. As if it's not hard enough, right? - Yeah, all the viewers are
at home, quietly judging you. They're like, "Well, when
I dissected ants last—" - I was thinking they were biting
their fingernails in suspense. - Yeah, that too. - So at the one end, let's see if I can put it
in a good orientation— you can actually
see the left side, if you look through
the microscope, you can actually see the sting hanging all the way out.
[* sting] - Oh yeah!
- It's like a giant hypodermic needle. - Yeah. - And then starting at the
other end on the right side, we can actually start to see
those parts of the digestive system. So first you have the crop, right?
[* crop] So it's that social food sharing organ,
which then transitions into the mid gut and then into what's called the ileum
[* mid gut, * ileum] and then finally into the rectum,
[* rectum] and then alongside that is where the venom gland sits.
[* venom gland] - That's amazing.
- Yeah, it's really awesome. One of the things that's cool
when you first open them up is that the contents within the gut, you can see fat and
you can see the trachea and all those other things,
and even within the gut, it's either clear like it
almost looks like water, or sometimes you can see
things that look like waste, but within the venom sac,
it's actually almost like oil. And so when you burst it,

**Transcript**:
In most of the world, this is a strange sight. It’s a TV commercial for a prescription drug. These ads are illegal in most countries. but in the US, they’re everywhere. On average, 80 of them air every hour on American television. "Ask your doctor." "...my doctor told me..." "Ask your doctor." The American Medical Association, a major group of doctors, has called for a ban on these direct-to-consumer ads. But there’s a case to be made for them too. So today we’ll take a look at both sides. First, a little background. Before the 1980s, prescription drug commercials were unheard of in the US. Drug companies focused their marketing solely on doctors, and they didn’t want to hurt those relationships. When asked by Congress in 1984, if direct-to-consumer advertising should be allowed, one pharmaceutical executive said: And an executive at Schering-Plough, which is now part of Merck, said: Needless to say, they changed their minds. At the time there was a larger cultural shift
in health care toward empowering patients to make decisions rather than just listening
to their doctors. And advertisements fit with that trend. Drug Ads started appearing in print publications, but there was still another thing keeping them off TV, and that was FDA’s regulations at the
time. They were interpreted as requiring ads to
include all of the information about the drug’s risks and side effects, which simply wasn’t feasible to do in a tv or radio commercial the way it was in
a magazine. There was a bizarre loophole though: The ads didn’t have to mention the drug’s risks, if they also didn’t mention the disease
or condition that the drug was supposed to treat. Here’s what that looked like — in an ad
for Claritin back before it was available over the counter: "It’s time." "It’s time!" "Don’t wait another minute with Claritin." "Claritin." "I’ll ask my doctor!" "It’s time to see your doctor." "Mr. Wilkin, the doctor will see you now." "At last, a clear day is here." Confused? Yeah, everyone was. So in 1997, the FDA clarified that the industry could run the full drug ads and wouldn’t have to give ALL the risk information from
the label, as long as they included the major side effects and referred viewers to another source for the rest. That’s why the commercials direct us to
phone numbers or print ads. Come for the pharmaceutical fine print — stay for “the secret to crisp contact in soggy conditions” That new FDA guidance removed the main barrier keeping drugs off of television. and you can guess what happened next... spending on ads quadrupled by 2004. And now, we know the names of prescription drugs like we know the names of cars and clothing brands. "Lunesta, Xanax, Celebrex, Flomax, and HGH." "And as of Thursday, Lipitor." "Oh and if you have trouble sleeping, Marla has Ambien. I prefer Lunesta." "Lipitor, Baby Aspirin... Flomax." "Flomax?" "…and some Cialis! I’m just assuming." So that’s how we got here. Drug ads are now the most frequent form of health communication that most Americans see. So what does that mean for public health? Are those prescriptions going to the right
people? Or are they going to people who probably won’t benefit from the drug — people for whom the potential risks outweigh the potential benefits? Well, the answer seems to be: both. A clever experiment in 2005 tested this by
sending actors to real primary care doctors. Dr. Richard Kravitz: We helped them make appointments. In half of the visits, the actors reported
symptoms of depression. In the other half of the visits, the actors
said they were feeling down after becoming unemployed. The study authors called this an “adjustment disorder.” In some visits, the actors mentioned seeing
an advertisement for Paxil on TV, that's an antidepressant. In others, they didn’t bring up medication
at all. And the doctors seemed to take patients more seriously if they mentioned seeing the Paxil commercial. They were more likely to refer patients to
a mental health consultation, And much more likely to prescribe an antidepressant. That may be a good thing for those with major depression, who might benefit from an medication. But it’s more questionable for those with
a more temporary condition. This study, and others, have shown that doctors can be persuaded to broaden the scope of who gets treated with drugs. And advertisements often seem designed to encourage that. Take Androgel — it was approved to treat men with hypogonadism: that’s extremely low testosterone levels due to injury or disease. But here’s how it was promoted by Abbott:
"Millions of men 45 and older just don’t feel like they used to. Are you one of them? Remember when you had more energy for 18 holes with your buddies? More passion for the one you love." Some middle aged men don’t feel like they
used to? You don’t say. A study looking back at 10 years of testosterone prescriptions found that only half had been diagnosed with hypogonadism in the previous year. Drug ads give the industry an incentive to
make healthy people feel unhealthy. “Latisse is the only FDA approved prescription treatment for inadequate, or not enough lashes.” And they contribute to unrealistic expectations about what pharmaceuticals can do. So what’s wrong with that? Well, every single drug comes with risks. Big ad campaigns are usually for newer drugs, for which not all the risks may be known yet. In the case of the painkiller Vioxx, a massive ad campaign led millions of people with arthritis to switch to Vioxx instead of sticking with
older drugs like Ibuprofen. “It’s a beautiful morning…ask your doctor
today about Vioxx, and find out what Vioxx can do for you." Vioxx was more expensive and not actually more effective, and... “The manufacturer of Vioxx have just recently pulled this popular arthritis drug from the market over health concerns." Merck withdrew the drug after it became clear that it increased the risk of heart attacks
and stroke. A Kaiser Permanente study later confirmed
that ad exposure was linked to inappropriate prescribing of Vioxx and a similar drug called Celebrex. So that’s a worst case scenario. But there is also an argument that these ads can be good for public health. Sidney Taurel: “There are many diseases for which people don’t seek treatment. So if you can educate through direct-to-consumer
about the fact that this can be treated, you will get a better outcome for everyone.” In their view, more communication with your doctor is always a good thing. And it’s up to the doctor to make the right
prescribing decisions. Surveys of the public have confirmed that
drug ads prompt people to visit their doctor, in some cases for diabetes, hypertension, depression — these are conditions that are thought to be under treated. In the case of the HPV vaccine, that's now recommended for all pre-teens to prevent cervical and other cancers, Merck’s ad blitz for Gardasil
probably reached more people than a government communications effort could. And whatever you think of erectile dysfunction drugs, they got men to see their doctors and undergo the required heart screening, potentially catching problems not yet treated. But the strongest argument in favor of drug
ads may be the legal one. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of prescription drug advertising back in the 1970s, when the state of Virginia tried to prohibit pharmacists from advertising their prices. Harry Blackmun: “We further hold that so called commercial speech is not wholly outside the protection of the 1st and 14th amendments. The individual consumer and society in general may have strong interests in the free flow of commercial information.” It was the first time that the Court said
advertisements were entitled to free speech protections. There was only one dissenting Justice at the time: William Rehnquist — who Ronald Reagan would later appoint Chief Justice —
In his dissent, Rehnquist wrote a kind of uncanny prediction of the type of commercials that would come decades later: "Don't spend another sleepless night. Ask your doctor to prescribe Seconal without delay." Rehnquist worried that ads would “generate patient pressure on physicians to prescribe” drugs; and that they’d end up being “advertised on television.” And as we know now, for better or for worse, that’s exactly what happened.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. However, the options provided in Question 1 do not directly answer the question in the ground truth MCQ. 

A more relevant question would be one that directly asks about the time period when direct-to-consumer drug ads started appearing in the U.S. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question.

However, Question 2 mentions the main barrier that kept prescription drug commercials off of television before 1997 and implies that direct-to-consumer drug ads were not common before the 1990s. Question 3 mentions the result of the FDA's new guidance on prescription drug commercials in 1997, which led to an increase in the number of prescription drug commercials on television.

Considering these points, the most similar generated MCQ would be a combination of Questions 2 and 3, but since we need to choose one, I would choose Question 3, as it implies the start of direct-to-consumer drug ads on television after the FDA's new guidance in 1997.

However, if I had to choose a question that is closest to the ground truth MCQ based on the available options, I would choose Question 1, as it talks about the marketing strategies of pharmaceutical companies in the US before and after the 1980s.

for Claritin back before it was available over the counter: "It’s time." "It’s time!" "Don’t wait another minute with Claritin." "Claritin." "I’ll ask my doctor!" "It’s time to see your doctor." "Mr. Wilkin, the doctor will see you now." "At last, a clear day is here." Confused? Yeah, everyone was. So in 1997, the FDA clarified that the industry could run the full drug ads and wouldn’t have to give ALL the risk information from
the label, as long as they included the major side effects and referred viewers to another source for the rest. That’s why the commercials direct us to
phone numbers or print ads. Come for the pharmaceutical fine print — stay for “the secret to crisp contact in soggy conditions” That new FDA guidance removed the main barrier keeping drugs off of television. and you can guess what happened next... spending on ads quadrupled by 2004. And now, we know the names of prescription drugs like we know the names of cars and clothing brands. "Lunesta, Xanax, Celebrex, Flomax, and HGH." "And as of Thursday, Lipitor." "Oh and if you have trouble sleeping, Marla has Ambien. I prefer Lunesta." "Lipitor, Baby Aspirin... Flomax." "Flomax?" "…and some Cialis! I’m just assuming." So that’s how we got here. Drug ads are now the most frequent form of health communication that most Americans see. So what does that mean for public health? Are those prescriptions going to the right
people? Or are they going to people who probably won’t benefit from the drug — people for whom the potential risks outweigh the potential benefits? Well, the answer seems to be: both. A clever experiment in 2005 tested this by
sending actors to real primary care doctors. Dr. Richard Kravitz: We helped them make appointments. In half of the visits, the actors reported
symptoms of depression. In the other half of the visits, the actors
said they were feeling down after becoming unemployed. The study authors called this an “adjustment disorder.” In some visits, the actors mentioned seeing
an advertisement for Paxil on TV, that's an antidepressant. In others, they didn’t bring up medication
at all. And the doctors seemed to take patients more seriously if they mentioned seeing the Paxil commercial. They were more likely to refer patients to
a mental health consultation, And much more likely to prescribe an antidepressant. That may be a good thing for those with major depression, who might benefit from an medication. But it’s more questionable for those with
a more temporary condition. This study, and others, have shown that doctors can be persuaded to broaden the scope of who gets treated with drugs. And advertisements often seem designed to encourage that. Take Androgel — it was approved to treat men with hypogonadism: that’s extremely low testosterone levels due to injury or disease. But here’s how it was promoted by Abbott:
"Millions of men 45 and older just don’t feel like they used to. Are you one of them? Remember when you had more energy for 18 holes with your buddies? More passion for the one you love." Some middle aged men don’t feel like they
used to? You don’t say. A study looking back at 10 years of testosterone prescriptions found that only half had been diagnosed with hypogonadism in the previous year. Drug ads give the industry an incentive to
make healthy people feel unhealthy. “Latisse is the only FDA approved prescription treatment for inadequate, or not enough lashes.” And they contribute to unrealistic expectations about what pharmaceuticals can do. So what’s wrong with that? Well, every single drug comes with risks. Big ad campaigns are usually for newer drugs, for which not all the risks may be known yet. In the case of the painkiller Vioxx, a massive ad campaign led millions of people with arthritis to switch to Vioxx instead of sticking with
older drugs like Ibuprofen. “It’s a beautiful morning…ask your doctor
today about Vioxx, and find out what Vioxx can do for you." Vioxx was more expensive and not actually more effective, and... “The manufacturer of Vioxx have just recently pulled this popular arthritis drug from the market over health concerns." Merck withdrew the drug after it became clear that it increased the risk of heart attacks
and stroke. A Kaiser Permanente study later confirmed
that ad exposure was linked to inappropriate prescribing of Vioxx and a similar drug called Celebrex. So that’s a worst case scenario. But there is also an argument that these ads can be good for public health. Sidney Taurel: “There are many diseases for which people don’t seek treatment. So if you can educate through direct-to-consumer
about the fact that this can be treated, you will get a better outcome for everyone.” In their view, more communication with your doctor is always a good thing. And it’s up to the doctor to make the right
prescribing decisions. Surveys of the public have confirmed that
drug ads prompt people to visit their doctor, in some cases for diabetes, hypertension, depression — these are conditions that are thought to be under treated. In the case of the HPV vaccine, that's now recommended for all pre-teens to prevent cervical and other cancers, Merck’s ad blitz for Gardasil
probably reached more people than a government communications effort could. And whatever you think of erectile dysfunction drugs, they got men to see their doctors and undergo the required heart screening, potentially catching problems not yet treated. But the strongest argument in favor of drug
ads may be the legal one. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of prescription drug advertising back in the 1970s, when the state of Virginia tried to prohibit pharmacists from advertising their prices. Harry Blackmun: “We further hold that so called commercial speech is not wholly outside the protection of the 1st and 14th amendments. The individual consumer and society in general may have strong interests in the free flow of commercial information.” It was the first time that the Court said
advertisements were entitled to free speech protections. There was only one dissenting Justice at the time: William Rehnquist — who Ronald Reagan would later appoint Chief Justice —
In his dissent, Rehnquist wrote a kind of uncanny prediction of the type of commercials that would come decades later: "Don't spend another sleepless night. Ask your doctor to prescribe Seconal without delay." Rehnquist worried that ads would “generate patient pressure on physicians to prescribe” drugs; and that they’d end up being “advertised on television.” And as we know now, for better or for worse, that’s exactly what happened.

**Transcript**:
Language is an essential part of our lives
that we often take for granted. With it, we can communicate our thoughts
and feelings, lose ourselves in novels, send text messages, and greet friends. It's hard to imagine being unable
to turn thoughts into words. But if the delicate web of language
networks in your brain became disrupted by stroke,
illness, or trauma, you could find yourself truly
at a loss for words. This disorder, called aphasia,
can impair all aspects of communication. People who have aphasia remain
as intelligent as ever. They know what they want to say, but can't always get their words
to come out correctly. They may unintentionally use
substitutions called paraphasias, switching related words,
like saying "dog" for "cat," or words that sound similar,
such as "house" for "horse." Sometimes, their words may even be
unrecognizable. There are several types of aphasia
grouped into two categories: fluent, or receptive, aphasia and non-fluent, or expressive, aphasia. People with fluent aphasia may have
normal vocal inflection but use words that lack meaning. They have difficulty comprehending
the speech of others and are frequently unable to recognize
their own speech errors. People with non-fluent aphasia,
on the other hand, may have good comprehension but will experience long hesitations
between words and make grammatical errors. We all have that tip-of-the-tongue feeling
from time to time when we can't think of a word, but having aphasia can make it hard
to name simple, everyday objects. Even reading and writing can be difficult
and frustrating. So how does this language loss happen? The human brain has two hemispheres. In most people, the left hemisphere
governs language. We know this because in 1861, the physician Paul Broca studied a patient who lost the ability to use all 
but a single word, "tan." During a postmortem study
of that patient's brain, Broca discovered a large lesion
in the left hemisphere now known as Broca's area. Scientists today believe that Broca's area
is responsible in part for naming objects and coordinating the muscles
involved in speech. Behind Broca's area is Wernicke's area
near the auditory cortex. That's where the brain attaches
meaning to speech sounds. Damage to Wernicke's area impairs the
brain's ability to comprehend language. Aphasia is caused by injury to one or
both of these specialized language areas. Fortunately, there are other areas
of the brain which support these language centers and can assist with communication. Even brain areas that control movement
are connected to language. FMRI studies found that when we hear
action words, like "run" or "dance," parts of the brain responsible
for movement light up as if the body was actually running
or dancing. Our other hemisphere contributes
to language, too, enhancing the rhythm and intonation
of our speech. These non-language areas sometimes
assist people with aphasia when communication is difficult. So how common is aphasia? Approximately 1 million people
in the U.S. alone have it, with an estimated 80,000 new cases
per year. About one-third of stroke survivors
suffer from aphasia making it more prevalent 
than Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis, yet less widely known. There is one rare form of aphasia called
primary progressive aphasia, or PPA, which is not caused by stroke
or brain injury, but is actually a form of dementia in which language loss 
is the first symptom. The goal in treating PPA is to maintain
language function for as long as possible before other symptoms of dementia
eventually occur. However, when aphasia is acquired
from a stroke or brain trauma, language improvement may be achieved
through speech therapy. Our brain's ability to repair itself,
known as brain plasticity, permits areas surrounding
a brain lesion to take over some functions during
the recovery process. Scientists have been conducting
experiments using new forms of technology, which they believe may encourage brain
plasticity in people with aphasia. Meanwhile, many people with aphasia
remain isolated, afraid that others won't understand
them or give them extra time to speak. By offering them the time and flexibility
to communicate in whatever way they can, you can help open the door 
to language again, moving beyond the limitations of aphasia.

**Transcript**:
Language is an essential part of our lives
that we often take for granted. With it, we can communicate our thoughts
and feelings, lose ourselves in novels, send text messages, and greet friends. It's hard to imagine being unable
to turn thoughts into words. But if the delicate web of language
networks in your brain became disrupted by stroke,
illness, or trauma, you could find yourself truly
at a loss for words. This disorder, called aphasia,
can impair all aspects of communication. People who have aphasia remain
as intelligent as ever. They know what they want to say, but can't always get their words
to come out correctly. They may unintentionally use
substitutions called paraphasias, switching related words,
like saying "dog" for "cat," or words that sound similar,
such as "house" for "horse." Sometimes, their words may even be
unrecognizable. There are several types of aphasia
grouped into two categories: fluent, or receptive, aphasia and non-fluent, or expressive, aphasia. People with fluent aphasia may have
normal vocal inflection but use words that lack meaning. They have difficulty comprehending
the speech of others and are frequently unable to recognize
their own speech errors. People with non-fluent aphasia,
on the other hand, may have good comprehension but will experience long hesitations
between words and make grammatical errors. We all have that tip-of-the-tongue feeling
from time to time when we can't think of a word, but having aphasia can make it hard
to name simple, everyday objects. Even reading and writing can be difficult
and frustrating. So how does this language loss happen? The human brain has two hemispheres. In most people, the left hemisphere
governs language. We know this because in 1861, the physician Paul Broca studied a patient who lost the ability to use all 
but a single word, "tan." During a postmortem study
of that patient's brain, Broca discovered a large lesion
in the left hemisphere now known as Broca's area. Scientists today believe that Broca's area
is responsible in part for naming objects and coordinating the muscles
involved in speech. Behind Broca's area is Wernicke's area
near the auditory cortex. That's where the brain attaches
meaning to speech sounds. Damage to Wernicke's area impairs the
brain's ability to comprehend language. Aphasia is caused by injury to one or
both of these specialized language areas. Fortunately, there are other areas
of the brain which support these language centers and can assist with communication. Even brain areas that control movement
are connected to language. FMRI studies found that when we hear
action words, like "run" or "dance," parts of the brain responsible
for movement light up as if the body was actually running
or dancing. Our other hemisphere contributes
to language, too, enhancing the rhythm and intonation
of our speech. These non-language areas sometimes
assist people with aphasia when communication is difficult. So how common is aphasia? Approximately 1 million people
in the U.S. alone have it, with an estimated 80,000 new cases
per year. About one-third of stroke survivors
suffer from aphasia making it more prevalent 
than Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis, yet less widely known. There is one rare form of aphasia called
primary progressive aphasia, or PPA, which is not caused by stroke
or brain injury, but is actually a form of dementia in which language loss 
is the first symptom. The goal in treating PPA is to maintain
language function for as long as possible before other symptoms of dementia
eventually occur. However, when aphasia is acquired
from a stroke or brain trauma, language improvement may be achieved
through speech therapy. Our brain's ability to repair itself,
known as brain plasticity, permits areas surrounding
a brain lesion to take over some functions during
the recovery process. Scientists have been conducting
experiments using new forms of technology, which they believe may encourage brain
plasticity in people with aphasia. Meanwhile, many people with aphasia
remain isolated, afraid that others won't understand
them or give them extra time to speak. By offering them the time and flexibility
to communicate in whatever way they can, you can help open the door 
to language again, moving beyond the limitations of aphasia.

**Transcript**:
Summer is upon us, which means it’s time
to grill up some barbeque and make s’mores around a campfire. But is wood or charcoal better fuel? Fires are a combustion chemical reaction:
you take some fuel, add some heat, and react those molecules with oxygen, then, poof you
have a roaring fire. And it’s an exothermic reaction, meaning
it releases energy in the form of light and heat, the flames you see and feel, and some
other byproducts. Wood and charcoal are a little different chemically,
so charcoal releases more heat energy and less smoke when it burns. Wood is made up of long chains of glucose
molecules, called cellulose, plus some other structural organic compounds. When those compounds are heated to about 250
degrees Celsius, they’ll start to break apart in a process called pyrolysis. These organic molecules break down into simpler
molecular components and release volatile gases, which evaporate easily and are combustible. Water, carbon dioxide, and volatile gases
combine to create smoke. And the gases reacting with oxygen create
lots of heat, which causes even more pyrolysis and combustion reactions, and creates more
flames. If you try to start a fire with damp wood,
or fresh wood that contains a lot of water, heat will boil the liquid water into vapor,
which isn’t a combustible gas. This basically releases energy into the air,
instead of generating more heat. The remaining material from burning wood is
called char or charcoal, which is 70 to 80% pure carbon. And there are some other leftover minerals
which become ashes. Industrial companies can mass produce charcoal
by heating up wood or wood products without much oxygen. This initiates the pyrolysis step, but doesn’t
really cause combustion, since there’s not much oxygen for the volatile gases to react
with. So, from a chemical standpoint, charcoal seems
like the better fuel source, because it’s mostly carbon, burning it releases more heat
energy for a longer period of time, with fewer smoky byproducts. But from an industrial standpoint, there are
also big economic issues that come into play. Industrial factories need massive amounts
of fuel. And since charcoal is a product of wood pyrolysis,
it’s become a big factor toward deforestation in parts of Africa and South America. So policies and research efforts need to be
initiated to conserve these resources, or use them more efficiently. Ultimately, whether you use charcoal for smoke-free
grilling, or wood for a big toasty bonfire, use whatever fuel suits your needs to have
a fun and safe summer! Thanks to Patreon patrons Lauren, Rob Margolis,

molecules, called cellulose, plus some other structural organic compounds. When those compounds are heated to about 250
degrees Celsius, they’ll start to break apart in a process called pyrolysis. These organic molecules break down into simpler
molecular components and release volatile gases, which evaporate easily and are combustible. Water, carbon dioxide, and volatile gases
combine to create smoke. And the gases reacting with oxygen create
lots of heat, which causes even more pyrolysis and combustion reactions, and creates more
flames. If you try to start a fire with damp wood,
or fresh wood that contains a lot of water, heat will boil the liquid water into vapor,
which isn’t a combustible gas. This basically releases energy into the air,
instead of generating more heat. The remaining material from burning wood is
called char or charcoal, which is 70 to 80% pure carbon. And there are some other leftover minerals
which become ashes. Industrial companies can mass produce charcoal
by heating up wood or wood products without much oxygen. This initiates the pyrolysis step, but doesn’t
really cause combustion, since there’s not much oxygen for the volatile gases to react
with. So, from a chemical standpoint, charcoal seems
like the better fuel source, because it’s mostly carbon, burning it releases more heat
energy for a longer period of time, with fewer smoky byproducts. But from an industrial standpoint, there are
also big economic issues that come into play. Industrial factories need massive amounts
of fuel. And since charcoal is a product of wood pyrolysis,
it’s become a big factor toward deforestation in parts of Africa and South America. So policies and research efforts need to be
initiated to conserve these resources, or use them more efficiently. Ultimately, whether you use charcoal for smoke-free
grilling, or wood for a big toasty bonfire, use whatever fuel suits your needs to have
a fun and safe summer! Thanks to Patreon patrons Lauren, Rob Margolis,

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9: What is the leftover material from burning wood? Options: A. Charcoal, B. Ashes, C. Volatile gases, D. Heat Correct Option: B

However, the correct option should be A (or the question should be adjusted to make B the correct answer, e.g., "What are some leftover materials from burning wood, besides charcoal?"), as the ground truth MCQ states that the remaining material left behind from burning wood is called "char."

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 9.

**Transcript**:
Physicists, air traffic controllers, and video game creators all have at least one thing in common: vectors. What exactly are they,
and why do they matter? To answer,
we first need to understand scalars. A scalar is a quantity with magnitude. It tells us how much 
of something there is. The distance between you and a bench, and the volume and temperature
of the beverage in your cup are all described by scalars. Vector quantities also have a magnitude
plus an extra piece of information, direction. To navigate to your bench, you need to know how far away it is
and in what direction, not just the distance,
but the displacement. What makes vectors special
and useful in all sorts of fields is that they don't change 
based on perspective but remain invariant 
to the coordinate system. What does that mean? Let's say you and a friend 
are moving your tent. You stand on opposite sides
so you're facing in opposite directions. Your friend moves two steps to the right
and three steps forward while you move two steps to the left
and three steps back. But even though it seems 
like you're moving differently, you both end up moving 
the same distance in the same direction following the same vector. No matter which way you face, or what coordinate system you place
over the camp ground, the vector doesn't change. Let's use the familiar 
Cartesian coordinate system with its x and y axes. We call these two directions
our coordinate basis because they're used to describe 
everything we graph. Let's say the tent starts at the origin
and ends up over here at point B. The straight arrow connecting
the two points is the vector from the origin to B. When your friend thinks about
where he has to move, it can be written mathematically
as 2x + 3y, or, like this, which is called an array. Since you're facing the other way, your coordinate basis
points in opposite directions, which we can call x prime
and y prime, and your movement 
can be written like this, or with this array. If we look at the two arrays,
they're clearly not the same, but an array alone doesn't completely
describe a vector. Each needs a basis to give it context, and when we properly assign them, we see that they are in fact
describing the same vector. You can think of elements in the array
as individual letters. Just as a sequence of letters
only becomes a word in the context of a particular language, an array acquires meaning as a vector
when assigned a coordinate basis. And just as different words
in two languages can convey the same idea, different representations from two bases
can describe the same vector. The vector is the essence 
of what's being communicated, regardless of the language 
used to describe it. It turns out that scalars also share
this coordinate invariance property. In fact, all quantities with this property
are members of a group called tensors. Various types of tensors contain different
amounts of information. Does that mean there's something that
can convey more information than vectors? Absolutely. Say you're designing a video game, and you want to realistically model
how water behaves. Even if you have forces acting
in the same direction with the same magnitude, depending on how they're oriented,
you might see waves or whirls. When force, a vector, is combined with
another vector that provides orientation, we have the physical quantity
called stress, which is an example 
of a second order tensor. These tensors are also used outside of
video games for all sorts of purposes, including scientific simulations, car designs, and brain imaging. Scalars, vectors, and the tensor family
present us with a relatively simple way of making sense of complex ideas
and interactions, and as such, they're a prime example of
the elegance, beauty, and fundamental usefulness of mathematics.

**Question 3: A physicist, an air traffic controller, and a video game creator all use vectors in their work. What is one reason why vectors are useful in these fields? Options: A. Vectors can convey complex ideas and interactions in a simple way., B. Vectors can change based on the coordinate system used., C. Vectors can only be used to describe movement., D.

However, this question doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the properties of vectors.

A better match would be a generated MCQ that combines the properties of vectors mentioned in the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, such a question is not present in the generated MCQs.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 2: According to the transcript, what does the term "coordinate invariance" mean? Options: A. The value of a quantity remains the same regardless of the coordinate system used., B. The value of a quantity changes based on the coordinate system used., C. The value of a quantity depends on the direction of the coordinate system., D. The value of a quantity depends on the magnitude of the coordinate system. Correct Option: A** and **Question 1: What is the main difference between a scalar and a vector quantity? Options: A. A scalar has magnitude, while a vector has direction., B. A scalar has direction, while a vector has magnitude., C. A scalar has both magnitude and direction., D. A vector has both magnitude and direction, but a scalar does not. Correct Option: A** together cover the properties of vectors mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I really had to choose one, I would say that **Question 6: According to the transcript, what is the relationship between a vector and its representation in an array? Options: A. A vector is a sequence of letters, and an array is a word., B. A vector is a word, and an array is a sequence of letters., C. A vector is a word, and an array is a word that conveys the same idea., D. A vector is a sequence of letters, and an array is a word that conveys a different idea. Correct Option: C** is not the best match, but **Question 4: If you and a friend are moving your tent, and you both move the same distance in the same direction, but you are facing in opposite directions, what can be concluded about the vectors describing your movements? Options: A. The vectors are different., B. The vectors are the same., C. The vectors depend on the coordinate system used., D. The vectors depend on the magnitude of the movement. Correct Option: B** is a better match.

However, I think I can propose an alternative.

Let's look at **Question 7: What is the relationship between tensors and scalars? Options: A. Tensors are a type of scalar., B. Scalars are a type of tensor., C. Tensors and scalars are both quantities with magnitude, but tensors have direction., D. Tensors and scalars are both quantities with direction, but tensors have magnitude. Correct Option: C** and **Question 2: According to the transcript, what does the term "coordinate invariance" mean? Options: A. The value of a quantity remains the same regardless of the coordinate system used., B. The value of a quantity changes based on the coordinate system used., C. The value of a quantity depends on the direction of the coordinate system., D. The value of a quantity depends on the magnitude of the coordinate system. Correct Option: A**.

If we combine these two questions, we can see that **Question 7** talks about the magnitude and direction of tensors (which include vectors) and **Question 2** talks about the coordinate invariance of vectors.

However, I think a better match would be **Question 4**.

So, my final answer is: **4**

Although this question does not directly ask which description is a vector, it gets at the heart of the difference between scalars and vectors, which is the key concept being tested in the ground truth MCQ. The correct option in Question 1 (A. A scalar has magnitude, while a vector has direction) highlights the essential characteristic of vectors, which is the presence of direction in addition to magnitude.

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that Question 1 doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about identifying a vector from a set of options. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in this regard.

But if I had to choose the closest match based on the available options, I would say that **Question 4** is a distant second in terms of similarity, as it deals with vectors and direction. However, it's still not a direct match.

If I'm being completely honest, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 1** is the closest in terms of concept, but not in terms of question intent and options.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: **1** (with the caveat that it's not a perfect match)

**Transcript**:
Physicists, air traffic controllers, and video game creators all have at least one thing in common: vectors. What exactly are they,
and why do they matter? To answer,
we first need to understand scalars. A scalar is a quantity with magnitude. It tells us how much 
of something there is. The distance between you and a bench, and the volume and temperature
of the beverage in your cup are all described by scalars. Vector quantities also have a magnitude
plus an extra piece of information, direction. To navigate to your bench, you need to know how far away it is
and in what direction, not just the distance,
but the displacement. What makes vectors special
and useful in all sorts of fields is that they don't change 
based on perspective but remain invariant 
to the coordinate system. What does that mean? Let's say you and a friend 
are moving your tent. You stand on opposite sides
so you're facing in opposite directions. Your friend moves two steps to the right
and three steps forward while you move two steps to the left
and three steps back. But even though it seems 
like you're moving differently, you both end up moving 
the same distance in the same direction following the same vector. No matter which way you face, or what coordinate system you place
over the camp ground, the vector doesn't change. Let's use the familiar 
Cartesian coordinate system with its x and y axes. We call these two directions
our coordinate basis because they're used to describe 
everything we graph. Let's say the tent starts at the origin
and ends up over here at point B. The straight arrow connecting
the two points is the vector from the origin to B. When your friend thinks about
where he has to move, it can be written mathematically
as 2x + 3y, or, like this, which is called an array. Since you're facing the other way, your coordinate basis
points in opposite directions, which we can call x prime
and y prime, and your movement 
can be written like this, or with this array. If we look at the two arrays,
they're clearly not the same, but an array alone doesn't completely
describe a vector. Each needs a basis to give it context, and when we properly assign them, we see that they are in fact
describing the same vector. You can think of elements in the array
as individual letters. Just as a sequence of letters
only becomes a word in the context of a particular language, an array acquires meaning as a vector
when assigned a coordinate basis. And just as different words
in two languages can convey the same idea, different representations from two bases
can describe the same vector. The vector is the essence 
of what's being communicated, regardless of the language 
used to describe it. It turns out that scalars also share
this coordinate invariance property. In fact, all quantities with this property
are members of a group called tensors. Various types of tensors contain different
amounts of information. Does that mean there's something that
can convey more information than vectors? Absolutely. Say you're designing a video game, and you want to realistically model
how water behaves. Even if you have forces acting
in the same direction with the same magnitude, depending on how they're oriented,
you might see waves or whirls. When force, a vector, is combined with
another vector that provides orientation, we have the physical quantity
called stress, which is an example 
of a second order tensor. These tensors are also used outside of
video games for all sorts of purposes, including scientific simulations, car designs, and brain imaging. Scalars, vectors, and the tensor family
present us with a relatively simple way of making sense of complex ideas
and interactions, and as such, they're a prime example of
the elegance, beauty, and fundamental usefulness of mathematics.

**Transcript**:
Is she turning towards you
or away from you? No one can agree. She's the mysterious subject
of Dutch master Johannes Vermeer's "Girl with the Pearl Earring," a painting often referred to
as the 'Mona Lisa of the North.' Belonging to a Dutch style of idealized, 
sometimes overly expressive paintings known as tronies, the "Girl with the Pearl Earring"
has the allure and subtlety characteristic 
of Vermeer's work. But this painting stands apart from
the quiet narrative scenes that we observe from afar in many
of Vermeer's paintings. A girl reading a letter. A piano lesson. A portrait artist at work. These paintings give us a sense of
intimacy while retaining their distance, a drawn curtain often emphasizes
the separation. We can witness a milkmaid
serenely pouring a bowl of milk, but that milk isn't for us. We're only onlookers. The studied composition
in Vermeer's paintings invokes a balanced harmony. With the checkered floor in many
of his works, Vermeer demonstrates his command
of perspective and foreshortening. That's a technique that uses distortion to give the illusion
of an object receding into the distance. Other elements, like sight lines,
mirrors, and light sources describe the moment through space
and position. The woman reading 
a letter by an open window is precisely placed so the window
can reflect her image back to the viewer. Vermeer would even hide the leg
of an easel for the sake of composition. The absence of these very elements brings
the "Girl with the Pearl Earring" to life. Vermeer's treatment of light and shadow,
or chiaroscuro, uses a dark, flat background to further
spotlight her three-dimensionality. Instead of being like a set piece
in a theatrical narrative scene, she becomes a psychological subject. Her eye contact and slightly parted lips,
as if she is about to say something, draw us into her gaze. Traditional subjects of portraiture
were often nobility or religious figures. So why was Vermeer painting 
an anonymous girl? In the 17th century, the city of Delft,
like the Netherlands in general, had turned against ruling aristocracy
and the Catholic church. After eight decades of rebellion
against Spanish power, the Dutch came to favor the idea
of self-rule and a political republic. Cities like Delft were unsupervised
by kings or bishops, so many artists like Vermeer
were left without traditional patrons. Fortunately, business innovation spearheaded by 
the Dutch East India Company transformed the economic landscape
in the Netherlands. It created a merchant class
and new type of patron. Wishing to be represented
in the paintings they financed, these merchants preferred 
middle class subjects depicted in spaces that looked
like their own homes surrounded by familiar objects. The maps that appear in Vermeer's
paintings, for example, were considered fashionable and worldly by the merchant class of what is known
as the Dutch Golden Age. The oriental turban worn by the "Girl
with the Pearl Earring" also emphasizes the worldliness
of the merchant class, and the pearl itself, a symbol of wealth,
is actually an exaggeration. Vermeer couldn't have afforded
a real pearl of its size. It was likely just a glass or tin drop
varnished to look like a pearl. This mirage of wealth is mirrored
in the painting itself. In greater context, the pearl appears
round and heavy, but a detailed view shows that it's
just a floating smudge of paint. Upon close inspection, we are reminded
of Vermeer's power as an illusion maker. While we may never know the real identity
of the "Girl with the Pearl Earring," we can engage with her portrait
in a way that is unforgettable. As she hangs in her permanent home
in the Mauritshuis Museum in The Hague, her presence is simultaneously penetrating
and subtle. In her enigmatic way, she represents
the birth of a modern perspective on economics, politics, and love.

**Transcript**:
Is she turning towards you
or away from you? No one can agree. She's the mysterious subject
of Dutch master Johannes Vermeer's "Girl with the Pearl Earring," a painting often referred to
as the 'Mona Lisa of the North.' Belonging to a Dutch style of idealized, 
sometimes overly expressive paintings known as tronies, the "Girl with the Pearl Earring"
has the allure and subtlety characteristic 
of Vermeer's work. But this painting stands apart from
the quiet narrative scenes that we observe from afar in many
of Vermeer's paintings. A girl reading a letter. A piano lesson. A portrait artist at work. These paintings give us a sense of
intimacy while retaining their distance, a drawn curtain often emphasizes
the separation. We can witness a milkmaid
serenely pouring a bowl of milk, but that milk isn't for us. We're only onlookers. The studied composition
in Vermeer's paintings invokes a balanced harmony. With the checkered floor in many
of his works, Vermeer demonstrates his command
of perspective and foreshortening. That's a technique that uses distortion to give the illusion
of an object receding into the distance. Other elements, like sight lines,
mirrors, and light sources describe the moment through space
and position. The woman reading 
a letter by an open window is precisely placed so the window
can reflect her image back to the viewer. Vermeer would even hide the leg
of an easel for the sake of composition. The absence of these very elements brings
the "Girl with the Pearl Earring" to life. Vermeer's treatment of light and shadow,
or chiaroscuro, uses a dark, flat background to further
spotlight her three-dimensionality. Instead of being like a set piece
in a theatrical narrative scene, she becomes a psychological subject. Her eye contact and slightly parted lips,
as if she is about to say something, draw us into her gaze. Traditional subjects of portraiture
were often nobility or religious figures. So why was Vermeer painting 
an anonymous girl? In the 17th century, the city of Delft,
like the Netherlands in general, had turned against ruling aristocracy
and the Catholic church. After eight decades of rebellion
against Spanish power, the Dutch came to favor the idea
of self-rule and a political republic. Cities like Delft were unsupervised
by kings or bishops, so many artists like Vermeer
were left without traditional patrons. Fortunately, business innovation spearheaded by 
the Dutch East India Company transformed the economic landscape
in the Netherlands. It created a merchant class
and new type of patron. Wishing to be represented
in the paintings they financed, these merchants preferred 
middle class subjects depicted in spaces that looked
like their own homes surrounded by familiar objects. The maps that appear in Vermeer's
paintings, for example, were considered fashionable and worldly by the merchant class of what is known
as the Dutch Golden Age. The oriental turban worn by the "Girl
with the Pearl Earring" also emphasizes the worldliness
of the merchant class, and the pearl itself, a symbol of wealth,
is actually an exaggeration. Vermeer couldn't have afforded
a real pearl of its size. It was likely just a glass or tin drop
varnished to look like a pearl. This mirage of wealth is mirrored
in the painting itself. In greater context, the pearl appears
round and heavy, but a detailed view shows that it's
just a floating smudge of paint. Upon close inspection, we are reminded
of Vermeer's power as an illusion maker. While we may never know the real identity
of the "Girl with the Pearl Earring," we can engage with her portrait
in a way that is unforgettable. As she hangs in her permanent home
in the Mauritshuis Museum in The Hague, her presence is simultaneously penetrating
and subtle. In her enigmatic way, she represents
the birth of a modern perspective on economics, politics, and love.

**Transcript**:
radiation is frightening at least certain types of it are I mean my Geiger counter doesn't go off near my mobile phone or the Wi-Fi router or my microwave that's because a Geiger counter only measures ionizing radiation that is radiation with enough energy to rip electrons off atoms and it's measured in units called sieverts if you're exposed to more than two sieverts all at once you'll probably die shortly after that but we're exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation all the time bananas for example are rich in potassium and some of that potassium is naturally radioactive so when you eat a banana you're actually exposed to about 0.1 micro sieverts of radiation that's one ten-millionth of a sievert let's use a banana for scale of radiation doses you know since people eat bananas we become radioactive too so you're actually exposed to more radiation if you sleep next to someone than if you sleep alone but I wouldn't worry about that because that dose is insignificant compared to the natural background radiation of Earth I mean there's ionizing radiation coming out of the soil and the rocks and the air and even from space the level of radiation here in Sydney is about 0.15 microsieverts per hour and that's about average globally the levels usually between point 1 and point 2 microsieverts per hour but there are places with significantly higher levels so who on earth you think receives the maximum dose of ionizing radiation let's answer that question by going to the most radioactive places on earth some places you'd expect to have high levels of radiation might surprise you I'm in her rush MA and that is the peace dome it was about 600 meters above that dome where the world's first nuclear bomb was detonated over a city it was detonated there to have maximum destructive impact with a level of radiation today almost 70 years later is only 0.3 microsieverts per hour this is the mine where uranium was discovered it's also the place where Marie Curie obtained her raw material 2007 microsiemens per hour it's about ten times the natural background that you would have nowadays most of the uranium has been removed but in this wall there's still a small piece and you can see under UV light it flores's look at that florescent uranium ore this is the lab of Marie Curie she won two Nobel prizes one in physics and one in chemistry and she conducted a lot of her work here and this is her office she would have said right there apparently there are only a few parts of this area which are still radioactive one is this doorknob what it climbs looked a lot much bit but that's like 10 times the background yes more that's it and another is the back of her chair you can still detect alpha particles coming off this spot right here apparently after she was worth being a lab she would come open the door leaving traces of radium here and then go and pull out her chair welcome to New Mexico this is the Trinity bomb test site where the world's first nuclear bomb was set off right here right in this spot this whole area was vaporized in fact there was so much heat liberated by that bomb that it fused all of the desert sand into this green glass and you can still find it here they've actually named this mineral after the test it's called Trinitite yeah this is the only place on earth that this has ever been made the level of radiation here is about 0.8 microsieverts an hour the Trinitite itself is a little bit more radioactive i've got readings of two or three microsieverts an hour off them now which place has higher levels of radiation than anywhere we've seen so far the answer is an airplane you know as you gain altitude there's less atmosphere above you to shield you from cosmic rays so the level of radiation inside the plane can go up to 0.5 microsieverts per hour at 18,000 feet up to one micro sievert per hour at 23,000 feet over two microsieverts per hour at 33,000 feet and over three microsieverts per hour at even higher altitudes and towards the poles that is two noble nuclear reactor number four it melted down on April 26 1986 so what happened was so much heat was generated inside that reactor that it basically blew the top off spreading radioactive isotopes throughout this whole surrounding area and over into Europe and that is why we can still detect the contamination here today now right now it's reading around five microsieverts an hour if I stayed here for one hour my body would receive a similar dose to what you'd receive when you get a dental x-ray so this is not a huge amount of radiation and one of the reasons why the radiation level is not too high is because they actually removed a couple meters worth of topsoil from this whole area then they dumped it somewhere that's why we can stand here we're driving into the Fukushima exclusion zone now I'm just watching as the levels on my Geiger counter go up as we approach the zone see those black bags at the side of the road the Japanese are doing now exactly what the people in Chernobyl did collecting up meters and meters of topsoil the mask is probably overkill it's just to stop radioactive dust from getting into my lungs this is definitely one of the most radioactive places where I've been even though the release of radioactive material was less than true noble only about 10% because it's much fresher only three years since the accident much less if it has decayed so I've been getting readings up around five to ten microsieverts an hour and I think we won't be staying here too long because of that I'm about to go into the hospital at Pripyat and this is where the firemen were taken after they fought the fires at the Chernobyl reactor and in the basement of this building they have left all of the firemen's clothing once they realized it was so contaminated they chucked it down there but you can see there's a huge pile how about Judah read upside the bear I'm getting half hundred Mike receive it's another bill that basement was the most radioactive place I visited and it's one of the most radioactive places on earth if I'd stay down there for one hour I would have received 2,000 micro sieverts that's a year's worth of natural background radiation every yellow pixel here represents a banana now that might seem like a lot but consider that in a CT scan the patient receives about 7,000 micro sieverts that's three years worth of natural background radiation it's been estimated that the people living around Fukushima will receive an additional 10,000 micro sieverts over their lifetime due to the nuclear power disaster for comparison us radiation workers are limited to a maximum of 50,000 microsieverts per year but that's less than another occupation astronaut an astronaut on the space station for six months will receive about 80,000 micro sieverts worth of radiation but not even they are exposed to the highest levels of ionizing radiation so can you guess who is the answer is a smokers lungs a smokers lungs on average receive 160,000 microsieverts worth of radiation every year that's due to the radioactive polonium and radioactive lead in the tobacco that they're smoking so not only are they exposed to carcinogens and toxins they also receive very high levels of radiation so it's not the people of Fukushima or Chernobyl or radiation workers or even astronauts who receive the highest doses of ionizing radiation that honor goes to your ordinary average smoker hey as you can see over the last few months I've been traveling around the world actually filming a documentary for television it should be on in the middle of next year but being in places like Chernobyl and Fukushima reminded me of this book the day of the Triffids it's about a post-apocalyptic world in which plants take over I know it sounds like a crazy idea but it's actually a brilliant book so you should really check it out if you're looking for something to do over the holidays now you can download

**Transcript**:
radiation is frightening at least certain types of it are I mean my Geiger counter doesn't go off near my mobile phone or the Wi-Fi router or my microwave that's because a Geiger counter only measures ionizing radiation that is radiation with enough energy to rip electrons off atoms and it's measured in units called sieverts if you're exposed to more than two sieverts all at once you'll probably die shortly after that but we're exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation all the time bananas for example are rich in potassium and some of that potassium is naturally radioactive so when you eat a banana you're actually exposed to about 0.1 micro sieverts of radiation that's one ten-millionth of a sievert let's use a banana for scale of radiation doses you know since people eat bananas we become radioactive too so you're actually exposed to more radiation if you sleep next to someone than if you sleep alone but I wouldn't worry about that because that dose is insignificant compared to the natural background radiation of Earth I mean there's ionizing radiation coming out of the soil and the rocks and the air and even from space the level of radiation here in Sydney is about 0.15 microsieverts per hour and that's about average globally the levels usually between point 1 and point 2 microsieverts per hour but there are places with significantly higher levels so who on earth you think receives the maximum dose of ionizing radiation let's answer that question by going to the most radioactive places on earth some places you'd expect to have high levels of radiation might surprise you I'm in her rush MA and that is the peace dome it was about 600 meters above that dome where the world's first nuclear bomb was detonated over a city it was detonated there to have maximum destructive impact with a level of radiation today almost 70 years later is only 0.3 microsieverts per hour this is the mine where uranium was discovered it's also the place where Marie Curie obtained her raw material 2007 microsiemens per hour it's about ten times the natural background that you would have nowadays most of the uranium has been removed but in this wall there's still a small piece and you can see under UV light it flores's look at that florescent uranium ore this is the lab of Marie Curie she won two Nobel prizes one in physics and one in chemistry and she conducted a lot of her work here and this is her office she would have said right there apparently there are only a few parts of this area which are still radioactive one is this doorknob what it climbs looked a lot much bit but that's like 10 times the background yes more that's it and another is the back of her chair you can still detect alpha particles coming off this spot right here apparently after she was worth being a lab she would come open the door leaving traces of radium here and then go and pull out her chair welcome to New Mexico this is the Trinity bomb test site where the world's first nuclear bomb was set off right here right in this spot this whole area was vaporized in fact there was so much heat liberated by that bomb that it fused all of the desert sand into this green glass and you can still find it here they've actually named this mineral after the test it's called Trinitite yeah this is the only place on earth that this has ever been made the level of radiation here is about

altitudes and towards the poles that is two noble nuclear reactor number four it melted down on April 26 1986 so what happened was so much heat was generated inside that reactor that it basically blew the top off spreading radioactive isotopes throughout this whole surrounding area and over into Europe and that is why we can still detect the contamination here today now right now it's reading around five microsieverts an hour if I stayed here for one hour my body would receive a similar dose to what you'd receive when you get a dental x-ray so this is not a huge amount of radiation and one of the reasons why the radiation level is not too high is because they actually removed a couple meters worth of topsoil from this whole area then they dumped it somewhere that's why we can stand here we're driving into the Fukushima exclusion zone now I'm just watching as the levels on my Geiger counter go up as we approach the zone see those black bags at the side of the road the Japanese are doing now exactly what the people in Chernobyl did collecting up meters and meters of topsoil the mask is probably overkill it's just to stop radioactive dust from getting into my lungs this is definitely one of the most radioactive places where I've been even though the release of radioactive material was less than true noble only about 10% because it's much fresher only three years since the accident much less if it has decayed so I've been getting readings up around five to ten microsieverts an hour and I think we won't be staying here too long because of that I'm about to go into the hospital at Pripyat and this is where the firemen were taken after they fought the fires at the Chernobyl reactor and in the basement of this building they have left all of the firemen's clothing once they realized it was so contaminated they chucked it down there but you can see there's a huge pile how about Judah read upside the bear I'm getting half hundred Mike receive it's another bill that basement was the most radioactive place I visited and it's one of the most radioactive places on earth if I'd stay down there for one hour I would have received 2,000 micro sieverts that's a year's worth of natural background radiation every yellow pixel here represents a banana now that might seem like a lot but consider that in a CT scan the patient receives about 7,000 micro sieverts that's three years worth of natural background radiation it's been estimated that the people living around Fukushima will receive an additional 10,000 micro sieverts over their lifetime due to the nuclear power disaster for comparison us radiation workers are limited to a maximum of 50,000 microsieverts per year but that's less than another occupation astronaut an astronaut on the space station for six months will receive about 80,000 micro sieverts worth of radiation but not even they are exposed to the highest levels of ionizing radiation so can you guess who is the answer is a smokers lungs a smokers lungs on average receive 160,000 microsieverts worth of radiation every year that's due to the radioactive polonium and radioactive lead in the tobacco that they're smoking so not only are they exposed to carcinogens and toxins they also receive very high levels of radiation so it's not the people of Fukushima or Chernobyl or radiation workers or even astronauts who receive the highest doses of ionizing radiation that honor goes to your ordinary average smoker hey as you can see over the last few months I've been traveling around the world actually filming a documentary for television it should be on in the middle of next year but being in places like Chernobyl and Fukushima reminded me of this book the day of the Triffids it's about a post-apocalyptic world in which

**Transcript**:
radiation is frightening at least certain types of it are I mean my Geiger counter doesn't go off near my mobile phone or the Wi-Fi router or my microwave that's because a Geiger counter only measures ionizing radiation that is radiation with enough energy to rip electrons off atoms and it's measured in units called sieverts if you're exposed to more than two sieverts all at once you'll probably die shortly after that but we're exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation all the time bananas for example are rich in potassium and some of that potassium is naturally radioactive so when you eat a banana you're actually exposed to about 0.1 micro sieverts of radiation that's one ten-millionth of a sievert let's use a banana for scale of radiation doses you know since people eat bananas we become radioactive too so you're actually exposed to more radiation if you sleep next to someone than if you sleep alone but I wouldn't worry about that because that dose is insignificant compared to the natural background radiation of Earth I mean there's ionizing radiation coming out of the soil and the rocks and the air and even from space the level of radiation here in Sydney is about 0.15 microsieverts per hour and that's about average globally the levels usually between point 1 and point 2 microsieverts per hour but there are places with significantly higher levels so who on earth you think receives the maximum dose of ionizing radiation let's answer that question by going to the most radioactive places on earth some places you'd expect to have high levels of radiation might surprise you I'm in her rush MA and that is the peace dome it was about 600 meters above that dome where the world's first nuclear bomb was detonated over a city it was detonated there to have maximum destructive impact with a level of radiation today almost 70 years later is only 0.3 microsieverts per hour this is the mine where uranium was discovered it's also the place where Marie Curie obtained her raw material 2007 microsiemens per hour it's about ten times the natural background that you would have nowadays most of the uranium has been removed but in this wall there's still a small piece and you can see under UV light it flores's look at that florescent uranium ore this is the lab of Marie Curie she won two Nobel prizes one in physics and one in chemistry and she conducted a lot of her work here and this is her office she would have said right there apparently there are only a few parts of this area which are still radioactive one is this doorknob what it climbs looked a lot much bit but that's like 10 times the background yes more that's it and another is the back of her chair you can still detect alpha particles coming off this spot right here apparently after she was worth being a lab she would come open the door leaving traces of radium here and then go and pull out her chair welcome to New Mexico this is the Trinity bomb test site where the world's first nuclear bomb was set off right here right in this spot this whole area was vaporized in fact there was so much heat liberated by that bomb that it fused all of the desert sand into this green glass and you can still find it here they've actually named this mineral after the test it's called Trinitite yeah this is the only place on earth that this has ever been made the level of radiation here is about 0.8 microsieverts an hour the Trinitite itself is a little bit more radioactive i've got readings of two or three microsieverts an hour off them now which place has higher levels of radiation than

can still find it here they've actually named this mineral after the test it's called Trinitite yeah this is the only place on earth that this has ever been made the level of radiation here is about 0.8 microsieverts an hour the Trinitite itself is a little bit more radioactive i've got readings of two or three microsieverts an hour off them now which place has higher levels of radiation than anywhere we've seen so far the answer is an airplane you know as you gain altitude there's less atmosphere above you to shield you from cosmic rays so the level of radiation inside the plane can go up to 0.5 microsieverts per hour at 18,000 feet up to one micro sievert per hour at 23,000 feet over two microsieverts per hour at 33,000 feet and over three microsieverts per hour at even higher altitudes and towards the poles that is two noble nuclear reactor number four it melted down on April 26 1986 so what happened was so much heat was generated inside that reactor that it basically blew the top off spreading radioactive isotopes throughout this whole surrounding area and over into Europe and that is why we can still detect the contamination here today now right now it's reading around five microsieverts an hour if I stayed here for one hour my body would receive a similar dose to what you'd receive when you get a dental x-ray so this is not a huge amount of radiation and one of the reasons why the radiation level is not too high is because they actually removed a couple meters worth of topsoil from this whole area then they dumped it somewhere that's why we can stand here we're driving into the Fukushima exclusion zone now I'm just watching as the levels on my Geiger counter go up as we approach the zone see those black bags at the side of the road the Japanese are doing now exactly what the people in Chernobyl did collecting up meters and meters of topsoil the mask is probably overkill it's just to stop radioactive dust from getting into my lungs this is definitely one of the most radioactive places where I've been even though the release of radioactive material was less than true noble only about 10% because it's much fresher only three years since the accident much less if it has decayed so I've been getting readings up around five to ten microsieverts an hour and I think we won't be staying here too long because of that I'm about to go into the hospital at Pripyat and this is where the firemen were taken after they fought the fires at the Chernobyl reactor and in the basement of this building they have left all of the firemen's clothing once they realized it was so contaminated they chucked it down there but you can see there's a huge pile how about Judah read upside the bear I'm getting half hundred Mike receive it's another bill that basement was the most radioactive place I visited and it's one of the most radioactive places on earth if I'd stay down there for one hour I would have received 2,000 micro sieverts that's a year's worth of natural background radiation every yellow pixel here represents a banana now that might seem like a lot but consider that in a CT scan the patient receives about 7,000 micro sieverts that's three years worth of natural background radiation it's been estimated that the people living around Fukushima will receive an additional 10,000 micro sieverts over their lifetime due to the nuclear power disaster for comparison us radiation workers are limited to a maximum of 50,000 microsieverts per year but that's less than another occupation astronaut an astronaut on the space station for six months will receive about 80,000 micro sieverts worth of radiation but not even they are exposed to the highest levels of ionizing radiation so can you guess who is the answer is a smokers lungs a smokers lungs on average receive 160,000 microsieverts worth of radiation every year that's due to the radioactive polonium and radioactive lead in the tobacco that they're smoking so not only are they exposed to carcinogens and toxins they also receive very high levels of radiation so it's not the people of Fukushima or Chernobyl or radiation workers or even astronauts who receive the highest doses of ionizing radiation that honor goes to your ordinary average smoker hey as you can see over the last few months I've been traveling around the world actually filming a documentary for television it should be on in the middle of next year but being in places like Chernobyl and Fukushima reminded me of this book the day of the Triffids it's about a post-apocalyptic world in which

**Transcript**:
radiation is frightening at least certain types of it are I mean my Geiger counter doesn't go off near my mobile phone or the Wi-Fi router or my microwave that's because a Geiger counter only measures ionizing radiation that is radiation with enough energy to rip electrons off atoms and it's measured in units called sieverts if you're exposed to more than two sieverts all at once you'll probably die shortly after that but we're exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation all the time bananas for example are rich in potassium and some of that potassium is naturally radioactive so when you eat a banana you're actually exposed to about 0.1 micro sieverts of radiation that's one ten-millionth of a sievert let's use a banana for scale of radiation doses you know since people eat bananas we become radioactive too so you're actually exposed to more radiation if you sleep next to someone than if you sleep alone but I wouldn't worry about that because that dose is insignificant compared to the natural background radiation of Earth I mean there's ionizing radiation coming out of the soil and the rocks and the air and even from space the level of radiation here in Sydney is about 0.15 microsieverts per hour and that's about average globally the levels usually between point 1 and point 2 microsieverts per hour but there are places with significantly higher levels so who on earth you think receives the maximum dose of ionizing radiation let's answer that question by going to the most radioactive places on earth some places you'd expect to have high levels of radiation might surprise you I'm in her rush MA and that is the peace dome it was about 600 meters above that dome where the world's first nuclear bomb was detonated over a city it was detonated there to have maximum destructive impact with a level of radiation today almost 70 years later is only 0.3 microsieverts per hour this is the mine where uranium was discovered it's also the place where Marie Curie obtained her raw material 2007 microsiemens per hour it's about ten times the natural background that you would have nowadays most of the uranium has been removed but in this wall there's still a small piece and you can see under UV light it flores's look at that florescent uranium ore this is the lab of Marie Curie she won two Nobel prizes one in physics and one in chemistry and she conducted a lot of her work here and this is her office she would have said right there apparently there are only a few parts of this area which are still radioactive one is this doorknob what it climbs looked a lot much bit but that's like 10 times the background yes more that's it and another is the back of her chair you can still detect alpha particles coming off this spot right here apparently after she was worth being a lab she would come open the door leaving traces of radium here and then go and pull out her chair welcome to New Mexico this is the Trinity bomb test site where the world's first nuclear

her work here and this is her office she would have said right there apparently there are only a few parts of this area which are still radioactive one is this doorknob what it climbs looked a lot much bit but that's like 10 times the background yes more that's it and another is the back of her chair you can still detect alpha particles coming off this spot right here apparently after she was worth being a lab she would come open the door leaving traces of radium here and then go and pull out her chair welcome to New Mexico this is the Trinity bomb test site where the world's first nuclear bomb was set off right here right in this spot this whole area was vaporized in fact there was so much heat liberated by that bomb that it fused all of the desert sand into this green glass and you can still find it here they've actually named this mineral after the test it's called Trinitite yeah this is the only place on earth that this has ever been made the level of radiation here is about 0.8 microsieverts an hour the Trinitite itself is a little bit more radioactive i've got readings of two or three microsieverts an hour off them now which place has higher levels of radiation than anywhere we've seen so far the answer is an airplane you know as you gain altitude there's less atmosphere above you to shield you from cosmic rays so the level of radiation inside the plane can go up to 0.5 microsieverts per hour at 18,000 feet up to one micro sievert per hour at 23,000 feet over two microsieverts per hour at 33,000 feet and over three microsieverts per hour at even higher altitudes and towards the poles that is two noble nuclear reactor number four it melted down on April 26 1986 so what happened was so much heat was generated inside that reactor that it basically blew the top off spreading radioactive isotopes throughout this whole surrounding area and over into Europe and that is why we can still detect the contamination here today now right now it's reading around five microsieverts an hour if I stayed here for one hour my body would receive a similar dose to what you'd receive when you get a dental x-ray so this is not a huge amount of radiation and one of the reasons why the radiation level is not too high is because they actually removed a couple meters worth of topsoil from this whole area then they dumped it somewhere that's why we can stand here we're driving into the Fukushima exclusion zone now I'm just watching as the levels on my Geiger counter go up as we approach the zone see those black bags at the side of the road the Japanese are doing now exactly what the people in Chernobyl did collecting up meters and meters of topsoil the mask is probably overkill it's just to stop radioactive dust from getting into my lungs this is definitely one of the most radioactive places where I've been even though the release of radioactive material was less than true noble only about 10% because it's much fresher only three years since the accident much less if it has decayed so I've been getting readings up around five to ten microsieverts an hour and I think we won't be staying here too long because of that I'm about to go into the hospital at Pripyat and this is where the firemen were taken after they fought the fires at the Chernobyl reactor and in the basement of this building they have left all of the firemen's clothing once they realized it was so contaminated they chucked it down there but you can see there's a huge pile how about Judah read upside the bear I'm getting half hundred Mike receive it's another bill that basement was the most radioactive place I visited and it's one of the most radioactive places on earth if I'd stay down there for one hour I would have received 2,000 micro sieverts that's a year's worth of natural background radiation every yellow pixel here represents a banana now that might seem like a lot but consider that in a CT scan the patient receives about 7,000 micro sieverts that's three years worth of natural background radiation it's been estimated that the people living around Fukushima will receive an additional 10,000 micro sieverts over their lifetime due to the nuclear power disaster for comparison us radiation workers are limited to a maximum of 50,000 microsieverts per year but that's less than another occupation astronaut an astronaut on the space station for six months will receive about 80,000 micro sieverts worth of radiation but not even they are exposed to the highest levels of ionizing radiation so can you guess who is the answer is a smokers lungs a smokers lungs on average receive 160,000 microsieverts worth of radiation every year that's due to the radioactive polonium and radioactive lead in the tobacco that they're smoking so not only are they exposed to carcinogens and toxins they also receive very high levels of radiation so it's not the people of Fukushima or Chernobyl or radiation workers or even astronauts who receive the highest doses of ionizing radiation that honor goes to your ordinary average smoker hey as you can see over the last few months I've been traveling around the world actually filming a documentary for television it should be on in the middle of next year but being in places like Chernobyl and Fukushima reminded me of this book the day of the Triffids it's about a post-apocalyptic world in which plants take over I know it sounds like a crazy idea but it's actually a brilliant book so you should really check it out if you're looking for something to do over the holidays now you can download this book for free by going to audible.com/veritasium or you can pick any other book of your choosing for a one-month free trial audible is a great audiobook website with over 150,000 titles in all areas of literature including fiction nonfiction and periodicals so I really want to thank audible for supporting me and I want to thank you for watching

types romantic believes that a far better world could be just around the corner if only bold and swift action could be taken if we entered an agreement or scrapped an agreement started a war or ended a war the romantic considers a degree of impatience to be a vital resource in governing a nation they may not think too badly of a bit of anger either so long as it's handled correctly you can be too forgiving after all the romantic is excited by how things might ideally be and always judges what currently exists in the world by the standard of a better imagined alternative most of the time the current state of things arouses them to intense disappointment as they consider the injustice a--'s prevarications compromises and timidity of almost everyone in government for their part the classical voter is highly distrustful of sudden gestures and actions they pay special attention to what can go wrong they're very concerned to mitigate the downside they're aware that most things could be a lot worse before condemning a policy they consider the standard of policy across history and may regard a current arrangement as bearable under the circumstances their view of people is fundamentally rather dark they believe that everyone is probably slightly worse than they seem they feel humans have deeply dangerous impulses lusts and drives and believe that the task of politics is to try and contain them rather than liberate genius strength beauty or benevolence high ideals make them nervous they are led by a desire not to make anything worse insofar as they hope for improvement it's in a cautious modest way they dare to suppose that the world may be a marginally better place in about 300 years time romantics see a lot that's wrong with the world and feel confident about analyzing who might be to blame for it perhaps this particular social group or that class a problem can't just be no one's fault and therefore the task of politics is to identify the wrongdoers and respond appropriately romantics feel a basic trust in their own capacity for purity they are sure they would be unable to be as shabby as their enemies whom they can therefore attack with a relatively clean conscience classical voters also notice what's wrong but they're highly aware of their own capacity for sinfulness and error which makes them hesitant about apportioning blame they recognize how easily they might have been active wrongdoers if circumstances have been different and suppose that no one has a monopoly on righteousness they would suggest that evil is pretty proportionately distributed across all groups and classes and that a priority is therefore for us to tolerantly cut each other slack at every turn romantic voters believe that everything great in history is the result of talented individuals taking destiny into their hands and struggling against the inertia and conservatism of the mass and most importantly of institutions classical voters are deeply worried by the possibility of lone actors taking matters into their hands and through natural weaknesses which all of us even the most intelligent are afflicted by creating disaster they are therefore on the side of legally grounded extremely slow-moving institutions that are designed to restrain individual power and contain the capacity of any one person to shift the direction of the group to quickly romantic voters believe it's possible to understand a situational issue so clearly one can be sure of complete justice and rightness vertol those who don't agree don't have to be listened to politely they are evidently wrong and can be silenced or sidelined as required classical voters are extremely alert to the possibility of error in their own and others analyses of policy but they are therefore committed to hearing and tolerating dissenting views in which they suspect a portion of the truth may always be lodged [Music] romantic voters feel that the best way for a nation to be safe in the world is for it to seem prominently strong classical voters feel that the best way to be safe in the world is to be thought well of and will therefore avoid actions that could upset alarm or confuse neighbors they're aware of how easily strength arouses the desire of others to be equally strong back they suspect the best way to proceed might be to train and private for the worst but extend a hand of friendship at every public turn both romantic and classical political orientations have important truths to impart neither is wholly right or wrong they need to be balanced and none of us are in any case ever simply one or the other but because a good political landscape requires a judicious balance of throath temperaments at this point in history in many countries it might be the classical electoral attitude whose distinctive claims and wisdom we need to listen to most intently and which is most ripe for rediscovery you

**Transcript**:
So a few years ago, I did something really brave, or some would say really stupid. I ran for Congress. For years, I had existed
safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run. The sitting congresswoman
had been in my district since 1992. She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her
in a Democratic primary. But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo. The polls, however,
told a very different story. My pollsters told me
that I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win. But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart
in a New York City congressional race. I swore I was going to win. I had the endorsement
from the New York Daily News, the Wall Street Journal
snapped pictures of me on election day, and CNBC called it one of the hottest
races in the country. I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy
an Indian girl was running. But on election day, the polls were right, and I only got 19 percent of the vote, and the same papers
that said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes. Don't do the math. It was humiliating. Now, before you get the wrong idea, this is not a talk
about the importance of failure. Nor is it about leaning in. I tell you the story
of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time
in my entire life that I had done something
that was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect. And I'm not alone: so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate
towards careers and professions that they know
they're going to be great in, that they know they're
going to be perfect in, and it's no wonder why. Most girls are taught
to avoid risk and failure. We're taught to smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's. Boys, on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars
and then just jump off headfirst. And by the time they're adults, whether they're negotiating a raise
or even asking someone out on a date, they're habituated
to take risk after risk. They're rewarded for it. It's often said in Silicon Valley, no one even takes you seriously
unless you've had two failed start-ups. In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave. Some people worry
about our federal deficit, but I, I worry about our bravery deficit. Our economy, our society,
we're just losing out because we're not raising
our girls to be brave. The bravery deficit is why
women are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look. In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders
handled an assignment that was too difficult for them. She found that bright girls
were quick to give up. The higher the IQ,
the more likely they were to give up. Bright boys, on the other hand, found the difficult material
to be a challenge. They found it energizing. They were more likely
to redouble their efforts. What's going on? Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys
in every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability. The difference is in how boys
and girls approach a challenge. And it doesn't just end in fifth grade. An HP report found
that men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent
of the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100 percent
of the qualifications. 100 percent. This study is usually invoked
as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence. But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized
to aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious. (Applause) And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take
less risks in our careers. And so those 600,000 jobs
that are open right now in computing and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy
is being left behind on all the innovation and problems
women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect. (Applause) So in 2012, I started a company
to teach girls to code, and what I found
is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave. Coding, it's an endless process
of trial and error, of trying to get the right command
in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference
between success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying
to build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection. We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect. Every Girls Who Code teacher
tells me the same story. During the first week,
when the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over
and she'll say, "I don't know what code to write." The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor. If she didn't know any better,
she'd think that her student spent the past 20 minutes
just staring at the screen. But if she presses undo a few times, she'll see that her student
wrote code and then deleted it. She tried, she came close, but she didn't get it exactly right. Instead of showing
the progress that she made, she'd rather show nothing at all. Perfection or bust. It turns out that our girls
are really good at coding, but it's not enough
just to teach them to code. My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor
at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours
with computer science students. When the guys are struggling
with an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, "Professor, there's something
wrong with my code." The girls will come in and say, "Professor, there's something
wrong with me." We have to begin to undo
the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it
with building a sisterhood that lets girls know
that they are not alone. Because trying harder
is not going to fix a broken system. I can't tell you how many women tell me, "I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling. When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network
cheering them on, they will build incredible things, and I see this every day. Take, for instance,
two of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run -- yes, Tampon Run -- to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming. Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love
for her new country by building an app
to help Americans get to the polls. Or a 16-year-old girl
who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer
is benign or malignant in the off chance
that she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer. These are just
three examples of thousands, thousands of girls who have been
socialized to be imperfect, who have learned to keep trying,
who have learned perseverance. And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé, they will not defer their dreams. And those dreams have never been
more important for our country. For the American economy,
for any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind
half our population. We have to socialize our girls
to be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now. We cannot wait for them
to learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old. We have to teach them
to be brave in schools and early in their careers, when it has the most potential
to impact their lives and the lives of others, and we have to show them
that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous. And so I need each of you
to tell every young woman you know -- your sister, your niece,
your employee, your colleague -- to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach
girls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement
of young women who are brave and who will build
a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you. It's such a powerful vision you have.
You have a vision. Tell me how it's going. How many girls
are involved now in your program? Reshma Saujani: Yeah.
So in 2012, we taught 20 girls. This year we'll teach 40,000
in all 50 states. (Applause) And that number is really powerful, because last year we only graduated
7,500 women in computer science. Like, the problem is so bad that we can make
that type of change quickly. CA: And you're working with some
of the companies in this room even, who are welcoming
graduates from your program? RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft
to Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there. And if you're not signed up,
I'm going to find you, because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code
classroom in their office. CA: And you have some stories
back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams,
good things happen. RS: Great things happen. I mean, I think that it's crazy to me
to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all
consumer purchases are made by women. Women use social media at a rate
of 600 percent more than men. We own the Internet, and we should be building
the companies of tomorrow. And I think when companies
have diverse teams, and they have incredible women
that are part of their engineering teams, they build awesome things,
and we see it every day. CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there.
You're doing incredibly important work. This whole community is cheering you on.
More power to you. Thank you. RS: Thank you. (Applause)

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 5, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Since the dawn of humanity, an estimated 100.8 billion
people have lived and died, a number that increases by about
.8% of the world's population each year. What happens to all 
of those people's bodies after they die and will the planet eventually
run out of burial space? When a person's heart stops beating, the body passes through several
stages before it begins decomposing. Within minutes after death, the blood begins settling in
the lower-most parts of the body. Usually eight to twelve hours later, the skin in those areas is discolored
by livor mortis, or post-mortem stain. And while at the moment of death
the body's muscles relax completely in a condition called primary flaccidity, they stiffen about two to six hours later
in what's known as rigor mortis. This stiffening spreads 
through the muscles, and its speed can be affected by age,
gender, and the surrounding environment. The body also changes temperature, usually cooling off 
to match its environment. Next comes decomposition, the process by which bacteria and insects
break apart the body. Many factors affect 
the rate of decomposition. There is, however, a basic guide of the
effect of the environment on decompositon called Casper's Law. It says that if all other 
factors are equal, a body exposed to air decomposes twice
as fast as one immersed in water and eight times as fast 
as one buried in earth. Soil acidity also greatly 
affects bone preservation. High-acidity soils with 
a pH of less than 5.3 will rapidly decompose bone, whereas in a neutral or basic soil
with a pH of 7 or more, a skeleton can remain in relatively
good condition for centuries. Different cultures throughout history have
developed unique approaches to burials. As far back as 
the first Neanderthal burials, death was accompanied by rituals, like the positioning, coloring,
or decorating of corpses. Traditional Christian burials decorate
the body in dress, while in traditional Islam, a body is wrapped in a piece 
of ritual fabric with the face oriented toward Mecca. Traditional Hindus ceremonially burn
the body, and Zoroastrians, followers of one of the
oldest monotheistic religions, traditionally place bodies atop a tower
to expose them to the Sun and scavenging birds.` Before the Industrial Revolution,
burials were simple and accessible. These days, with suitable burial land
running out in high-population areas, purchasing private gravesites
can be costly, and many people can't afford
simple burials. Even cremation, the second most common
burial practice in the world, comes with a high cost. As for the question 
of running out of space, the issue isn't so much about total land
in the world as it is that large populations cluster
together within cities. Most of the big cities in the world may run out of suitable burial grounds
within a century. For London, it's even sooner. That may happen by 2035. So are there alternatives
to traditional burials that might help with the space issue? In some countries, skyscraper cemeteries
enable vertical burials. Some options focus on the body's
relationship with the environment. Promession, for example, freeze-dries
and pulverizes the body, creating a powder 
that can turn into compost when mixed with oxygen and water. There are also green burials that use
special materials, such as biodegradable caskets, urns that sprout trees, and burial suits that grow mushrooms. Eternal reefs take that concept
to the depths of the ocean using a mixture of ashes and cement
to create marine habitats for sea life. Death is an inevitable part
of the human condition, but how we treat bodies and burials
continues to evolve. We may each have different spiritual, religious, or practical approaches to dying, but the ever-increasing demand
for burial space might give us a push to be creative about where our bodies go
after the final stages of life.

by livor mortis, or post-mortem stain. And while at the moment of death
the body's muscles relax completely in a condition called primary flaccidity, they stiffen about two to six hours later
in what's known as rigor mortis. This stiffening spreads 
through the muscles, and its speed can be affected by age,
gender, and the surrounding environment. The body also changes temperature, usually cooling off 
to match its environment. Next comes decomposition, the process by which bacteria and insects
break apart the body. Many factors affect 
the rate of decomposition. There is, however, a basic guide of the
effect of the environment on decompositon called Casper's Law. It says that if all other 
factors are equal, a body exposed to air decomposes twice
as fast as one immersed in water and eight times as fast 
as one buried in earth. Soil acidity also greatly 
affects bone preservation. High-acidity soils with 
a pH of less than 5.3 will rapidly decompose bone, whereas in a neutral or basic soil
with a pH of 7 or more, a skeleton can remain in relatively
good condition for centuries. Different cultures throughout history have
developed unique approaches to burials. As far back as 
the first Neanderthal burials, death was accompanied by rituals, like the positioning, coloring,
or decorating of corpses. Traditional Christian burials decorate
the body in dress, while in traditional Islam, a body is wrapped in a piece 
of ritual fabric with the face oriented toward Mecca. Traditional Hindus ceremonially burn
the body, and Zoroastrians, followers of one of the
oldest monotheistic religions, traditionally place bodies atop a tower
to expose them to the Sun and scavenging birds.` Before the Industrial Revolution,
burials were simple and accessible. These days, with suitable burial land
running out in high-population areas, purchasing private gravesites
can be costly, and many people can't afford
simple burials. Even cremation, the second most common
burial practice in the world, comes with a high cost. As for the question 
of running out of space, the issue isn't so much about total land
in the world as it is that large populations cluster
together within cities. Most of the big cities in the world may run out of suitable burial grounds
within a century. For London, it's even sooner. That may happen by 2035. So are there alternatives
to traditional burials that might help with the space issue? In some countries, skyscraper cemeteries
enable vertical burials. Some options focus on the body's
relationship with the environment. Promession, for example, freeze-dries
and pulverizes the body, creating a powder 
that can turn into compost when mixed with oxygen and water. There are also green burials that use
special materials, such as biodegradable caskets, urns that sprout trees, and burial suits that grow mushrooms. Eternal reefs take that concept
to the depths of the ocean using a mixture of ashes and cement
to create marine habitats for sea life. Death is an inevitable part
of the human condition, but how we treat bodies and burials
continues to evolve. We may each have different spiritual, religious, or practical approaches to dying, but the ever-increasing demand
for burial space might give us a push to be creative about where our bodies go
after the final stages of life.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 7, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It begins with a bit of discomfort and soon becomes a pressing sensation
that's impossible to ignore. Finally, it's all you can think about, and out of sheer desperation, you go on a hunt for a bathroom
until "ahh." Humans should urinate at least
four to six times a day, but occasionally, the pressures of modern
life forces us to clench and hold it in. How bad is this habit,
and how long can our bodies withstand it? The answers lie in the workings
of the bladder, an oval pouch 
that sits inside the pelvis. Surrounding this structure 
are several other organs that together make up the whole
urinary system. Two kidneys, two ureters, two urethral sphincters, and a urethra. Constantly trickling down from the kidneys
is the yellowish liquid known as urine. The kidneys make urine from a mix
of water and the body's waste products, funneling the unwanted fluid
into two muscular tubes called ureters. These carry it downward into
the hollow organ known as the bladder. This organ's muscular wall is made of
tissue called detrusor muscle which relaxes as the bladder fills
allowing it to inflate like a balloon. As the bladder gets full, 
the detrusor contracts. The internal urethral sphincter
automatically and involuntarily opens, and the urine is released. Whooshing downwards, 
the fluid enters the urethra and stops short at the external
urethral sphincter. This works like a tap. When you want to delay urinating,
you keep the sphincter closed. When you want to release it,
you can voluntarily open the flood gates. But how do you sense 
your bladder's fullness so you know when to pee? Inside the layers of detrusor muscles
are millions of stretch receptors that get triggered as the bladder fills. They send signals along your nerves
to the sacral region in your spinal cord. A reflex signal travels back to
your bladder, making the detrusor muscle 
contract slightly and increasing the bladder's pressure
so you're aware that it's filling up. Simultaneously, the internal 
urethral sphincter opens. This is called the micturition reflex. The brain can counter it if it's not
a good time to urinate by sending another signal to contract
the external urethral sphincter. With about 150 to 200 milliliters of urine
inside of it, the bladder's muscular wall 
is stretched enough for you to sense 
that there's urine within. At about 400 to 500 milliliters,
the pressure becomes uncomfortable. The bladder can go on stretching,
but only to a point. Above 1,000 milliliters, it may burst. Most people would lose bladder
control before this happens, but in very rare cases, such as when as a person can't sense
the need to urinate, the pouch can rupture painfully
requiring surgery to fix. But under normal circumstances, your decision to urinate stops the brain's
signal to the external urethral sphincter, causing it to relax 
and the bladder to empty. The external urethral sphincter
is one of the muscles of the pelvic floor, and it provides support to the urethra
and bladder neck. It's lucky we have these 
pelvic floor muscles because placing pressure on the system
by coughing, sneezing, laughing, or jumping could cause bladder leakage. Instead, the pelvic floor muscles
keep the region sealed until you're ready to go. But holding it in for too long, forcing out your urine too fast, or urinating without proper
physical support may over time weaken or overwork
that muscular sling. That can lead to an overactive
pelvic floor, bladder pain, urgency, or urinary incontinence. So in the interest of long-term health, it's not a great habit to hold your pee. But in the short term, at least,
your body and brain have got you covered, so you can conveniently choose
your moment of sweet release.

**Transcript**:
It begins with a bit of discomfort and soon becomes a pressing sensation
that's impossible to ignore. Finally, it's all you can think about, and out of sheer desperation, you go on a hunt for a bathroom
until "ahh." Humans should urinate at least
four to six times a day, but occasionally, the pressures of modern
life forces us to clench and hold it in. How bad is this habit,
and how long can our bodies withstand it? The answers lie in the workings
of the bladder, an oval pouch 
that sits inside the pelvis. Surrounding this structure 
are several other organs that together make up the whole
urinary system. Two kidneys, two ureters, two urethral sphincters, and a urethra. Constantly trickling down from the kidneys
is the yellowish liquid known as urine. The kidneys make urine from a mix
of water and the body's waste products, funneling the unwanted fluid
into two muscular tubes called ureters. These carry it downward into
the hollow organ known as the bladder. This organ's muscular wall is made of
tissue called detrusor muscle which relaxes as the bladder fills
allowing it to inflate like a balloon. As the bladder gets full, 
the detrusor contracts. The internal urethral sphincter
automatically and involuntarily opens, and the urine is released. Whooshing downwards, 
the fluid enters the urethra and stops short at the external
urethral sphincter. This works like a tap. When you want to delay urinating,
you keep the sphincter closed. When you want to release it,
you can voluntarily open the flood gates. But how do you sense 
your bladder's fullness so you know when to pee? Inside the layers of detrusor muscles
are millions of stretch receptors that get triggered as the bladder fills. They send signals along your nerves
to the sacral region in your spinal cord. A reflex signal travels back to
your bladder, making the detrusor muscle 
contract slightly and increasing the bladder's pressure
so you're aware that it's filling up. Simultaneously, the internal 
urethral sphincter opens. This is called the micturition reflex. The brain can counter it if it's not
a good time to urinate by sending another signal to contract
the external urethral sphincter. With about 150 to 200 milliliters of urine
inside of it, the bladder's muscular wall 
is stretched enough for you to sense 
that there's urine within. At about 400 to 500 milliliters,
the pressure becomes uncomfortable. The bladder can go on stretching,
but only to a point. Above 1,000 milliliters, it may burst. Most people would lose bladder
control before this happens, but in very rare cases, such as when as a person can't sense
the need to urinate, the pouch can rupture painfully
requiring surgery to fix. But under normal circumstances, your decision to urinate stops the brain's
signal to the external urethral sphincter, causing it to relax 
and the bladder to empty. The external urethral sphincter
is one of the muscles of the pelvic floor, and it provides support to the urethra
and bladder neck. It's lucky we have these 
pelvic floor muscles because placing pressure on the system
by coughing, sneezing, laughing, or jumping could cause bladder leakage. Instead, the pelvic floor muscles
keep the region sealed until you're ready to go. But holding it in for too long, forcing out your urine too fast, or urinating without proper
physical support may over time weaken or overwork
that muscular sling. That can lead to an overactive
pelvic floor, bladder pain, urgency, or urinary incontinence. So in the interest of long-term health, it's not a great habit to hold your pee. But in the short term, at least,
your body and brain have got you covered, so you can conveniently choose
your moment of sweet release.

**Transcript**:
What do a seventeen-year-old Pakistani, a Norwegian explorer, a Tibetan monk, and an American pastor have in common? They were all awarded 
the Nobel Peace Prize. Among the top prestigious awards
in the world, this prize has honored 
some of the most celebrated and revered international figures
and organizations in history. To understand how it all got started,
we have to go back to the 1800s. Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel was then mostly known 
for the invention of dynamite, a breakthrough which launched his career
as a successful inventor and businessman. 30 years later, he had become
extremely wealthy, but never married, and had no children. When his will was opened after his death, it came as a surprise that his fortune
was to be used for five prizes in physics, chemistry, 
medicine, literature, and peace. These prizes illustrated his lifelong
commitment to sciences and his passion for literature. But what about peace? Because Nobel's name was tied
to inventions used in the war industry, many have assumed that he created 
the peace prize out of regret. However, this is all speculation
as he never expressed any such sentiments, and his inventions were also used
for constructive purposes. Instead, many historians connect Alfred
Nobel's interest for the peace cause to his decade-long friendship 
and correspondence with an Austrian pacifist 
named Bertha Von Suttner. Von Suttner was one of the leaders
of the international peace movement, and in 1905, after Nobel's death, she became the first woman
to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Nobel's will outlined three criteria
for the Peace Prize, which unlike the other 
Sweden-based prizes, would be administered in Norway. Disarmament, peace congresses,
and brotherhood between nations. These standards have since been expanded to include 
other ways of promoting peace, such as human rights and negotiations. And the prize doesn't just have to go
to one person. About a third of Noble Peace Prizes
have been shared by two or three laureates. So how do nominations for the prize work? According to the Nobel Foundation, a valid nomination can come from
a member of a national assembly, state government, or an international court. Eligible nominators also include
university rectors, professors of the social sciences, 
history, philosophy, law, and theology, and previous recipients 
of the Peace Prize. But if you want to know more about
who was recently nominated, you'll have to be patient. All information about nominations
remains secret for 50 years. Take Martin Luther King Jr. We didn't actually know who nominated him
until 2014. His nominators turned out 
to be the Quakers, who had won the prize previously, and eight members 
of the Swedish Parliament. There's no limit to the number of times
a person or organization can be nominated. In fact, Jane Addams, recognized as the founder 
of social work in the United States, was nominated 91 times before
finally being awarded the prize. The absence of a laureate can also
be symbolic. The 1948 decision not to award the prize
following the death of Mahatma Gandhi has been interpreted as an attempt
to respectfully honor the so-called missing laureate. As with the other Nobel Prizes, the Peace Prize can't be 
awarded posthumously. The secret selection process 
takes almost a year, and is carried out by 
the five appointed members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee who are forbidden from having
any official political function in Norway. Starting with a large pool of nominations, exceeding 300 in recent years, they access each candidate's work
and create a short list. Finally, the chairman 
of the Nobel Committee publicly announces 
the laureate in October. The awards ceremony takes place
on December 10th, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. The prize itself includes a gold medal inscribed with the Latin words,
"Pro pace et fraternitate gentium," or "For the peace and brotherhood of men," as well as a diploma 
and a large cash prize. Recently, it's been 
8 million Swedish kronor, or roughly a million US dollars, which is split in the case 
of multiple laureates. And while laureates can use the prize
money as they choose, in recent years, many have donated it
to humanitarian or social causes. For many years, the Nobel Peace Prize
was predominately awarded to European and North American men. But in recent years, significant changes
have been taking place, making the prize more global than ever. 23 organizations and 103 individuals, that's 87 men and 16 women, have made up the 126 Nobel Peace Prize 
laureates in history. They include Desmond Tutu for his
nonviolent campaign against apartheid in South Africa, Jody Williams for her campaign to ban
and clear anti-personnel mines, Rigoberta Menchú Tum for her work
for social justice and reconciliation based on respect for the rights
of indigenous peoples, Martti Ahtisaari for his efforts
to resolve international conflicts in Namibia, Kosovo, and Indonesia, and Aung San Suu Kyi for her nonviolent
struggle for democracy and human rights in Myanmar. They're just a few examples of the people
who have inspired us, challenged us, and demonstrated through their actions that there are many paths to peace.

**Transcript**:
What do a seventeen-year-old Pakistani, a Norwegian explorer, a Tibetan monk, and an American pastor have in common? They were all awarded 
the Nobel Peace Prize. Among the top prestigious awards
in the world, this prize has honored 
some of the most celebrated and revered international figures
and organizations in history. To understand how it all got started,
we have to go back to the 1800s. Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel was then mostly known 
for the invention of dynamite, a breakthrough which launched his career
as a successful inventor and businessman. 30 years later, he had become
extremely wealthy, but never married, and had no children. When his will was opened after his death, it came as a surprise that his fortune
was to be used for five prizes in physics, chemistry, 
medicine, literature, and peace. These prizes illustrated his lifelong
commitment to sciences and his passion for literature. But what about peace? Because Nobel's name was tied
to inventions used in the war industry, many have assumed that he created 
the peace prize out of regret. However, this is all speculation
as he never expressed any such sentiments, and his inventions were also used
for constructive purposes. Instead, many historians connect Alfred
Nobel's interest for the peace cause to his decade-long friendship 
and correspondence with an Austrian pacifist 
named Bertha Von Suttner. Von Suttner was one of the leaders
of the international peace movement, and in 1905, after Nobel's death, she became the first woman
to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Nobel's will outlined three criteria
for the Peace Prize, which unlike the other 
Sweden-based prizes, would be administered in Norway. Disarmament, peace congresses,
and brotherhood between nations. These standards have since been expanded to include 
other ways of promoting peace, such as human rights and negotiations. And the prize doesn't just have to go
to one person. About a third of Noble Peace Prizes
have been shared by two or three laureates. So how do nominations for the prize work? According to the Nobel Foundation, a valid nomination can come from
a member of a national assembly, state government, or an international court. Eligible nominators also include
university rectors, professors of the social sciences, 
history, philosophy, law, and theology, and previous recipients 
of the Peace Prize. But if you want to know more about
who was recently nominated, you'll have to be patient. All information about nominations
remains secret for 50 years. Take Martin Luther King Jr. We didn't actually know who nominated him
until 2014. His nominators turned out 
to be the Quakers, who had won the prize previously, and eight members 
of the Swedish Parliament. There's no limit to the number of times
a person or organization can be nominated. In fact, Jane Addams, recognized as the founder 
of social work in the United States, was nominated 91 times before
finally being awarded the prize. The absence of a laureate can also
be symbolic. The 1948 decision not to award the prize
following the death of Mahatma Gandhi has been interpreted as an attempt
to respectfully honor the so-called missing laureate. As with the other Nobel Prizes, the Peace Prize can't be 
awarded posthumously. The secret selection process 
takes almost a year, and is carried out by 
the five appointed members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee who are forbidden from having
any official political function in Norway. Starting with a large pool of nominations, exceeding 300 in recent years, they access each candidate's work
and create a short list. Finally, the chairman 
of the Nobel Committee publicly announces 
the laureate in October. The awards ceremony takes place
on December 10th, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. The prize itself includes a gold medal inscribed with the Latin words,
"Pro pace et fraternitate gentium," or "For the peace and brotherhood of men," as well as a diploma 
and a large cash prize. Recently, it's been 
8 million Swedish kronor, or roughly a million US dollars, which is split in the case 
of multiple laureates. And while laureates can use the prize
money as they choose, in recent years, many have donated it
to humanitarian or social causes. For many years, the Nobel Peace Prize
was predominately awarded to European and North American men. But in recent years, significant changes
have been taking place, making the prize more global than ever. 23 organizations and 103 individuals, that's 87 men and 16 women, have made up the 126 Nobel Peace Prize 
laureates in history. They include Desmond Tutu for his
nonviolent campaign against apartheid in South Africa, Jody Williams for her campaign to ban
and clear anti-personnel mines, Rigoberta Menchú Tum for her work
for social justice and reconciliation based on respect for the rights
of indigenous peoples, Martti Ahtisaari for his efforts
to resolve international conflicts in Namibia, Kosovo, and Indonesia, and Aung San Suu Kyi for her nonviolent
struggle for democracy and human rights in Myanmar. They're just a few examples of the people
who have inspired us, challenged us, and demonstrated through their actions that there are many paths to peace.

**Transcript**:
Prolonged space travel takes
a severe toll on the human body. Microgravity impairs muscle
and bone growth, and high doses of radiation
cause irreversible mutations. As we seriously consider the human
species becoming space-faring, a big question stands. Even if we break free 
from Earth's orbit and embark on long-duration
journeys among the stars, can we adapt to the extreme
environments of space? This won't be the first time that humans
have adapted to harsh environments and evolved superhuman capabilities. Not fantastical powers like laser vision
or invisibility, but physiological adaptations
for survival in tough conditions. For example, on the Himalayan mountains where the highest elevation 
is nine kilometers above sea level, an unacclimated lowland human
will experience symptoms of hypoxia, commonly known as mountain sickness. At these altitudes, the body usually
produces extra red blood cells, thickening the blood 
and impeding its flow. But Himalayans who have lived on
these mountains for thousands of years permanently evolved mechanisms
to circumvent this process and maintain normal blood flow. Cases like that prove that humans
can develop permanent lifesaving traits. But natural adaptation 
for entire human populations could take tens of thousands of years. Recent scientific advances may help us
accelerate human adaptation to single generations. To thrive as a species 
during space travel, we could potentially develop methods to quickly program protective abilities
into ourselves. A beta version of these methods
is gene therapy, which we can currently use to correct
genetic diseases. Gene editing technology,
which is improving rapidly, allows scientists to directly change
the human genome to stop undesirable processes
or make helpful substances. An example of an unwanted process is what happens when our bodies
are exposed to ionizing radiation. Without an atmospheric barrier
and a magnetic field like Earth's, most planets and moons are bombarded
with these dangerous subatomic particles. They can pass through nearly anything and would cause potentially cancerous
DNA damage to space explorers. But what if we could turn the tables
on radiation? Human skin produces a pigment
called melanin that protects us from the filtered
radiation on Earth. Melanin exists in many forms
across species, and some melanin-expressing fungi use the pigment to convert radiation
into chemical energy. Instead of trying to shield 
the human body, or rapidly repair damage, we could potentially engineer humans to adopt and express these fungal,
melanin-based energy-harvesting systems. They'd then convert radiation into
useful energy while protecting our DNA. This sounds pretty sci-fi, but may actually be achievable 
with current technology. But technology isn't the only obstacle. There are ongoing debates 
on the consequences and ethics of such radical alterations
to our genetic fabric. Besides radiation, variation in gravitational strength
is another challenge for space travelers. Until we develop artificial gravity
in a space ship or on another planet, we should assume that astronauts
will spend time living in microgravity. On Earth, human bone and muscle
custodial cells respond to the stress 
of gravity's incessant tugging by renewing old cells in processes
known as remodeling and regeneration. But in a microgravity environment
like Mars, human bone and muscle cells
won't get these cues, resulting in osteoporosis 
and muscle atrophy. So, how could we provide 
an artificial signal for cells to counteract bone and muscle loss? Again, this is speculative, but biochemically engineered microbes
inside our bodies could churn out bone and muscle
remodeling signaling factors. Or humans could be genetically engineered to produce more of these signals
in the absence of gravity. Radiation exposure and microgravity
are only two of the many challenges we will encounter in the hostile
conditions of space. But if we're ethically prepared
to use them, gene editing and microbial engineering
are two flexible tools that could be adapted to many scenarios. In the near future, we may decide
to further develop and tune these genetic tools
for the harsh realities of space living.

**Transcript**:
Prolonged space travel takes
a severe toll on the human body. Microgravity impairs muscle
and bone growth, and high doses of radiation
cause irreversible mutations. As we seriously consider the human
species becoming space-faring, a big question stands. Even if we break free 
from Earth's orbit and embark on long-duration
journeys among the stars, can we adapt to the extreme
environments of space? This won't be the first time that humans
have adapted to harsh environments and evolved superhuman capabilities. Not fantastical powers like laser vision
or invisibility, but physiological adaptations
for survival in tough conditions. For example, on the Himalayan mountains where the highest elevation 
is nine kilometers above sea level, an unacclimated lowland human
will experience symptoms of hypoxia, commonly known as mountain sickness. At these altitudes, the body usually
produces extra red blood cells, thickening the blood 
and impeding its flow. But Himalayans who have lived on
these mountains for thousands of years permanently evolved mechanisms
to circumvent this process and maintain normal blood flow. Cases like that prove that humans
can develop permanent lifesaving traits. But natural adaptation 
for entire human populations could take tens of thousands of years. Recent scientific advances may help us
accelerate human adaptation to single generations. To thrive as a species 
during space travel, we could potentially develop methods to quickly program protective abilities
into ourselves. A beta version of these methods
is gene therapy, which we can currently use to correct
genetic diseases. Gene editing technology,
which is improving rapidly, allows scientists to directly change
the human genome to stop undesirable processes
or make helpful substances. An example of an unwanted process is what happens when our bodies
are exposed to ionizing radiation. Without an atmospheric barrier
and a magnetic field like Earth's, most planets and moons are bombarded
with these dangerous subatomic particles. They can pass through nearly anything and would cause potentially cancerous
DNA damage to space explorers. But what if we could turn the tables
on radiation? Human skin produces a pigment
called melanin that protects us from the filtered
radiation on Earth. Melanin exists in many forms
across species, and some melanin-expressing fungi use the pigment to convert radiation
into chemical energy. Instead of trying to shield 
the human body, or rapidly repair damage, we could potentially engineer humans to adopt and express these fungal,
melanin-based energy-harvesting systems. They'd then convert radiation into
useful energy while protecting our DNA. This sounds pretty sci-fi, but may actually be achievable 
with current technology. But technology isn't the only obstacle. There are ongoing debates 
on the consequences and ethics of such radical alterations
to our genetic fabric. Besides radiation, variation in gravitational strength
is another challenge for space travelers. Until we develop artificial gravity
in a space ship or on another planet, we should assume that astronauts
will spend time living in microgravity. On Earth, human bone and muscle
custodial cells respond to the stress 
of gravity's incessant tugging by renewing old cells in processes
known as remodeling and regeneration. But in a microgravity environment
like Mars, human bone and muscle cells
won't get these cues, resulting in osteoporosis 
and muscle atrophy. So, how could we provide 
an artificial signal for cells to counteract bone and muscle loss? Again, this is speculative, but biochemically engineered microbes
inside our bodies could churn out bone and muscle
remodeling signaling factors. Or humans could be genetically engineered to produce more of these signals
in the absence of gravity. Radiation exposure and microgravity
are only two of the many challenges we will encounter in the hostile
conditions of space. But if we're ethically prepared
to use them, gene editing and microbial engineering
are two flexible tools that could be adapted to many scenarios. In the near future, we may decide
to further develop and tune these genetic tools
for the harsh realities of space living.

**Transcript**:
Your favorite band is great
at playing music, but not so great at being organized. They keep misplacing 
their instruments on tour, and it's driving their manager mad. On the day of the big concert, the band wakes up 
to find themselves tied up in a windowless, 
soundproof practice room. Their manager explains what's happening. Outside, there are ten large boxes. Each contains one of your instruments, but don't be fooled by the pictures -
they've been randomly placed. I'm going to let you out one at a time. While you're outside, you can look
inside any five boxes before security
takes you back to the tour bus. You can't touch the instruments or in any way communicate what you find
to the others. No marking the boxes, shouting, nothing. If each one of you 
can find your own instrument, then you can play tonight. Otherwise, the label is dropping you. You have three minutes to think about it
before we start. The band is in despair. After all, each musician only has a 50%
chance of finding their instrument by picking five random boxes. And the chances that all ten will succeed
are even lower - just 1 in 1024. But suddenly, the drummer comes up
with a valid strategy that has a better than 35% chance
of working. Can you figure out what it was? Pause the video on the next screen
if you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Here's what the drummer said: Everyone first open the box
with the picture of your instrument. If your instrument is inside, you're done. Otherwise, look at whatever's in there, and then open the box 
with that picture on it. Keep going that way until you find
your instrument. The bandmates are skeptical, but amazingly enough,
they all find what they need. And a few hours later, they're playing
to thousands of adoring fans. So why did the drummer's strategy work? Each musician follows a linked sequence that starts with the box whose outside
matches their instrument and ends with the box 
actually containing it. Note that if they kept going,
that would lead them back to the start, so this is a loop. For example, if the boxes 
are arranged like so, the singer would open the first box
to find the drums, go to the eighth box to find the bass, and find her microphone in the third box, which would point back to the first. This works much better 
than random guessing because by starting with the box 
with the picture of their instrument, each musician restricts their search to
the loop that contains their instrument, and there are decent odds, about 35%, that all of the loops 
will be of length five or less. How do we calculate those odds? For the sake of simplicity, 
we'll demonstrate with a simplified case, four instruments and no more than 
two guesses allowed for each musician. Let's start by finding 
the odds of failure, the chance that someone will need
to open three or four boxes before they find their instrument. There are six distinct four-box loops. One fun way to count them 
is to make a square, put an instrument at each corner, and draw the diagonals. See how many unique loops you can find, and keep in mind that these two 
are considered the same, they just start at different points. These two, however, are different. We can visualize the eight distinct
three-box loops using triangles. You'll find four possible triangles depending on which instrument 
you leave out, and two distinct paths on each. So of the 24 possible 
combinations of boxes, there are 14 that lead to faliure, and ten that result in success. That computational strategy works for any
even number of musicians, but if you want a shortcut, it generalizes to a handy equation. Plug in ten musicians, 
and we get odds of about 35%. What if there were 1,000 musicians? 1,000,000? As n increases, 
the odds approach about 30%. Not a guarantee, but with a bit of
musician's luck, it's far from hopeless. Hi everybody, if you liked this riddle,
try solving these two.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Suppose there are just 5 musicians. What would the chances be for each musician to find his instrument if they chose the boxes at random?

Correct Option: A

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: According to the transcript, what is the probability of success for a musician using the drummer's strategy?

to find the drums, go to the eighth box to find the bass, and find her microphone in the third box, which would point back to the first. This works much better 
than random guessing because by starting with the box 
with the picture of their instrument, each musician restricts their search to
the loop that contains their instrument, and there are decent odds, about 35%, that all of the loops 
will be of length five or less. How do we calculate those odds? For the sake of simplicity, 
we'll demonstrate with a simplified case, four instruments and no more than 
two guesses allowed for each musician. Let's start by finding 
the odds of failure, the chance that someone will need
to open three or four boxes before they find their instrument. There are six distinct four-box loops. One fun way to count them 
is to make a square, put an instrument at each corner, and draw the diagonals. See how many unique loops you can find, and keep in mind that these two 
are considered the same, they just start at different points. These two, however, are different. We can visualize the eight distinct
three-box loops using triangles. You'll find four possible triangles depending on which instrument 
you leave out, and two distinct paths on each. So of the 24 possible 
combinations of boxes, there are 14 that lead to faliure, and ten that result in success. That computational strategy works for any
even number of musicians, but if you want a shortcut, it generalizes to a handy equation. Plug in ten musicians, 
and we get odds of about 35%. What if there were 1,000 musicians? 1,000,000? As n increases, 
the odds approach about 30%. Not a guarantee, but with a bit of
musician's luck, it's far from hopeless. Hi everybody, if you liked this riddle,

**Transcript**:
Your favorite band is great
at playing music, but not so great at being organized. They keep misplacing 
their instruments on tour, and it's driving their manager mad. On the day of the big concert, the band wakes up 
to find themselves tied up in a windowless, 
soundproof practice room. Their manager explains what's happening. Outside, there are ten large boxes. Each contains one of your instruments, but don't be fooled by the pictures -
they've been randomly placed. I'm going to let you out one at a time. While you're outside, you can look
inside any five boxes before security
takes you back to the tour bus. You can't touch the instruments or in any way communicate what you find
to the others. No marking the boxes, shouting, nothing. If each one of you 
can find your own instrument, then you can play tonight. Otherwise, the label is dropping you. You have three minutes to think about it
before we start. The band is in despair. After all, each musician only has a 50%
chance of finding their instrument by picking five random boxes. And the chances that all ten will succeed
are even lower - just 1 in 1024. But suddenly, the drummer comes up
with a valid strategy that has a better than 35% chance
of working. Can you figure out what it was? Pause the video on the next screen
if you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Here's what the drummer said: Everyone first open the box
with the picture of your instrument. If your instrument is inside, you're done. Otherwise, look at whatever's in there, and then open the box 
with that picture on it. Keep going that way until you find
your instrument. The bandmates are skeptical, but amazingly enough,
they all find what they need. And a few hours later, they're playing
to thousands of adoring fans. So why did the drummer's strategy work? Each musician follows a linked sequence that starts with the box whose outside
matches their instrument and ends with the box 
actually containing it. Note that if they kept going,
that would lead them back to the start, so this is a loop. For example, if the boxes 
are arranged like so, the singer would open the first box
to find the drums, go to the eighth box to find the bass, and find her microphone in the third box, which would point back to the first. This works much better

**Transcript**:
When I was first learning to meditate, the instruction was to simply
pay attention to my breath, and when my mind wandered,
to bring it back. Sounded simple enough. Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats, sweating through T-shirts
in the middle of winter. I'd take naps every chance I got
because it was really hard work. Actually, it was exhausting. The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something
really important. So why is it so hard to pay attention? Well, studies show that even when we're really
trying to pay attention to something -- like maybe this talk -- at some point, about half of us
will drift off into a daydream, or have this urge
to check our Twitter feed. So what's going on here? It turns out that we're fighting one
of the most evolutionarily-conserved learning processes
currently known in science, one that's conserved back to the most basic
nervous systems known to man. This reward-based learning process is called positive
and negative reinforcement, and basically goes like this. We see some food that looks good, our brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!" We eat the food, we taste it -- it tastes good. And especially with sugar, our bodies send a signal
to our brain that says, "Remember what you're eating
and where you found it." We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time. See food, eat food, feel good, repeat. Trigger, behavior, reward. Simple, right? Well, after a while,
our creative brains say, "You know what? You can use this for more
than just remembering where food is. You know, next time you feel bad, why don't you try eating
something good so you'll feel better?" We thank our brains for the great idea, try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream
when we're mad or sad, we feel better. Same process, just a different trigger. Instead of this hunger signal
coming from our stomach, this emotional signal -- feeling sad -- triggers that urge to eat. Maybe in our teenage years, we were a nerd at school, and we see those rebel kids
outside smoking and we think, "Hey, I want to be cool." So we start smoking. The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork,
and that was no accident. See cool, smoke to be cool, feel good. Repeat. Trigger, behavior, reward. And each time we do this, we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit. So later, feeling stressed out triggers
that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet. Now, with these same brain processes, we've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves
with these habits. Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes
of morbidity and mortality in the world. So back to my breath. What if instead of fighting our brains, or trying to force ourselves
to pay attention, we instead tapped into this natural,
reward-based learning process ... but added a twist? What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening
in our momentary experience? I'll give you an example. In my lab, we studied whether mindfulness training
could help people quit smoking. Now, just like trying to force myself
to pay attention to my breath, they could try to force
themselves to quit smoking. And the majority of them
had tried this before and failed -- on average, six times. Now, with mindfulness training, we dropped the bit about forcing
and instead focused on being curious. In fact, we even told them to smoke. What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke, just be really curious
about what it's like when you do." And what did they notice? Well here's an example
from one of our smokers. She said, "Mindful smoking: smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!" Now, she knew, cognitively
that smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program. What she discovered just by being
curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit. (Laughter) Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom. She moved from knowing in her head
that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones, and the spell of smoking was broken. She started to become
disenchanted with her behavior. Now, the prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain
from an evolutionary perspective, it understands on an intellectual level
that we shouldn't smoke. And it tries its hardest
to help us change our behavior, to help us stop smoking, to help us stop eating that second,
that third, that fourth cookie. We call this cognitive control. We're using cognition
to control our behavior. Unfortunately, this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline
when we get stressed out, which isn't that helpful. Now, we can all relate to this
in our own experience. We're much more likely to do things
like yell at our spouse or kids when we're stressed out or tired, even though we know
it's not going to be helpful. We just can't help ourselves. When the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our old habits, which is why this disenchantment
is so important. Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them
at a deeper level -- to know it in our bones so we don't have to force
ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior. We're just less interested
in doing it in the first place. And this is what mindfulness is all about: Seeing really clearly what we get
when we get caught up in our behaviors, becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance,
naturally letting go. This isn't to say that, poof,
magically we quit smoking. But over time, as we learn
to see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old habits and form new ones. The paradox here is that mindfulness is just
about being really interested in getting close and personal with what's actually happening
in our bodies and minds from moment to moment. This willingness
to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant
cravings go away as quickly as possible. And this willingness
to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally rewarding. What does curiosity feel like? It feels good. And what happens when we get curious? We start to notice that cravings
are simply made up of body sensations -- oh, there's tightness, there's tension, there's restlessness -- and that these body
sensations come and go. These are bite-size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered
by this huge, scary craving that we choke on. In other words, when we get curious, we step out of our old,
fear-based, reactive habit patterns, and we step into being. We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting
that next data point. Now, this might sound
too simplistic to affect behavior. But in one study,
we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy
at helping people quit smoking. So it actually works. And when we studied
the brains of experienced meditators, we found that parts of a neural network
of self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play. Now, one current hypothesis
is that a region of this network, called the posterior cingulate cortex, is activated not necessarily
by craving itself but when we get caught up in it,
when we get sucked in, and it takes us for a ride. In contrast, when we let go -- step out of the process just by being curiously aware
of what's happening -- this same brain region quiets down. Now we're testing app and online-based
mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and, ironically, use the same technology
that's driving us to distraction to help us step out
of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking, of stress eating
and other addictive behaviors. Now, remember that bit
about context-dependent memory? We can deliver these tools
to peoples' fingertips in the contexts that matter most. So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity
to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke
or stress eat or whatever arises. So if you don't smoke or stress eat, maybe the next time you feel this urge
to check your email when you're bored, or you're trying to distract
yourself from work, or maybe to compulsively respond
to that text message when you're driving, see if you can tap into
this natural capacity, just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body
and mind in that moment. It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless
and exhaustive habit loops ... or step out of it. Instead of see text message,
compulsively text back, feel a little bit better -- notice the urge, get curious, feel the joy of letting go and repeat. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
When I was first learning to meditate, the instruction was to simply
pay attention to my breath, and when my mind wandered,
to bring it back. Sounded simple enough. Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats, sweating through T-shirts
in the middle of winter. I'd take naps every chance I got
because it was really hard work. Actually, it was exhausting. The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something
really important. So why is it so hard to pay attention? Well, studies show that even when we're really
trying to pay attention to something -- like maybe this talk -- at some point, about half of us
will drift off into a daydream, or have this urge
to check our Twitter feed. So what's going on here? It turns out that we're fighting one
of the most evolutionarily-conserved learning processes
currently known in science, one that's conserved back to the most basic
nervous systems known to man. This reward-based learning process is called positive
and negative reinforcement, and basically goes like this. We see some food that looks good, our brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!" We eat the food, we taste it -- it tastes good. And especially with sugar, our bodies send a signal
to our brain that says, "Remember what you're eating
and where you found it." We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time. See food, eat food, feel good, repeat. Trigger, behavior, reward. Simple, right? Well, after a while,
our creative brains say, "You know what? You can use this for more
than just remembering where food is. You know, next time you feel bad, why don't you try eating
something good so you'll feel better?" We thank our brains for the great idea, try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream
when we're mad or sad, we feel better. Same process, just a different trigger. Instead of this hunger signal
coming from our stomach, this emotional signal -- feeling sad -- triggers that urge to eat. Maybe in our teenage years, we were a nerd at school, and we see those rebel kids
outside smoking and we think, "Hey, I want to be cool." So we start smoking. The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork,
and that was no accident. See cool, smoke to be cool, feel good. Repeat. Trigger, behavior, reward. And each time we do this, we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit. So later, feeling stressed out triggers
that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet. Now, with these same brain processes, we've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves
with these habits. Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes
of morbidity and mortality in the world. So back to my breath. What if instead of fighting our brains, or trying to force ourselves
to pay attention, we instead tapped into this natural,
reward-based learning process ... but added a twist? What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening
in our momentary experience? I'll give you an example. In my lab, we studied whether mindfulness training
could help people quit smoking. Now, just like trying to force myself
to pay attention to my breath, they could try to force
themselves to quit smoking. And the majority of them
had tried this before and failed -- on average, six times. Now, with mindfulness training, we dropped the bit about forcing
and instead focused on being curious. In fact, we even told them to smoke. What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke, just be really curious
about what it's like when you do." And what did they notice? Well here's an example
from one of our smokers. She said, "Mindful smoking: smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!" Now, she knew, cognitively
that smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program. What she discovered just by being

Translator: Jessica Ruby
Reviewer: Brian Greene Could human civilization eventually spread
across the whole Milky Way galaxy? Could we move beyond 
our small blue planet to establish colonies in the multitude
of star systems out there? This question's a pretty daunting one. There are around 300 billion stars
in the galaxy, which is about 160,000 light-years across. So far we've sent a single spacecraft
outside our solar system, trudging along at 0.006% of 
the speed of light. At that rate, it would take over 
2.5 billion years just to get from one end of the galaxy
to the other. And then there's the question 
of human survival. The gulf between stars is simply enormous. We couldn't live sustainably 
on most planets, and we require a lot of resources
to stay alive. And yet, decades ago, scholars found
that it's theoretically possible to not just spread human civilization
across the galaxy, but to do so quite quickly, without breaking any known 
laws of physics. Their idea is based on the work
of a mathematician named John von Neumann, who designed on paper machines 
that could self-replicate and create new generations of themselves. These would later come to be known
as von Neumann machines. In the context of space exploration, von Neumann machines could be
built on Earth and launched into space. There, the self-sufficient machines
would land on distant planets. They would then mine the available
resources and harvest energy, build replicas of themselves, launch those to the nearest planets, and continue the cycle. The result is the creation 
of millions of probes spreading outwards into the universe
like a drop of ink in a fishbowl. Scholars crunched the numbers and found
that a single von Neumann machine traveling at 5% of the speed of light should be able to replicate throughout
our galaxy in 4 million years or less. That may sound like a long time, but when you consider that our universe
is 14 billion years old, on a cosmic scale, it's incredibly fast - the equivalent of about 2.5 hours
in an entire year. Creating von Neumann machines
would require a few technologies we don't have yet, including advanced 
artificial intelligence, miniaturization, and better propulsion systems. If we wanted to use them to spread actual
humans throughout the galaxy, we would need 
yet another technological leap - the ability to artificially 
grow biological organisms and bodies using raw elements 
and genetic information. Regardless, if in the last billion years an alien civilization 
created such a machine and set it multiplying its way toward us, our galaxy would be 
swarming with them by now. So then where are all these machines? Some astronomers, like Carl Sagan, say that intelligent aliens wouldn't
build self-replicating machines at all. They might hurtle out of control, scavenging planets to their cores
in order to keep replicating. Others take the machines absence as proof that intelligent alien civilizations 
don't exist, or that they go extinct before they can
develop the necessary technologies. But all this hasn't stopped people from
imagining what it would be like if they were out there. Science fiction author David Brin writes about a universe in which
many different von Neumann machines exist and proliferate simultaneously. Some are designed 
to greet young civilizations, others to locate and destroy them
before they become a threat. In fact, in Brin's story "Lungfish," some von Neumann machines are keeping
a close watch over the Earth right now, waiting for us to reach a certain level
of sophistication before they make their move. For now, all we have is curiosity 
and theory. But the next time 
you look at the night sky, consider that billions of
self-replicating machines could be advancing between stars
in our galaxy right now. If they exist, one of them will eventually
land on Earth, or maybe, just maybe,
they're already here.

Reviewer: Brian Greene Could human civilization eventually spread
across the whole Milky Way galaxy? Could we move beyond 
our small blue planet to establish colonies in the multitude
of star systems out there? This question's a pretty daunting one. There are around 300 billion stars
in the galaxy, which is about 160,000 light-years across. So far we've sent a single spacecraft
outside our solar system, trudging along at 0.006% of 
the speed of light. At that rate, it would take over 
2.5 billion years just to get from one end of the galaxy
to the other. And then there's the question 
of human survival. The gulf between stars is simply enormous. We couldn't live sustainably 
on most planets, and we require a lot of resources
to stay alive. And yet, decades ago, scholars found
that it's theoretically possible to not just spread human civilization
across the galaxy, but to do so quite quickly, without breaking any known 
laws of physics. Their idea is based on the work
of a mathematician named John von Neumann, who designed on paper machines 
that could self-replicate and create new generations of themselves. These would later come to be known
as von Neumann machines. In the context of space exploration, von Neumann machines could be
built on Earth and launched into space. There, the self-sufficient machines
would land on distant planets. They would then mine the available
resources and harvest energy, build replicas of themselves, launch those to the nearest planets, and continue the cycle. The result is the creation 
of millions of probes spreading outwards into the universe
like a drop of ink in a fishbowl. Scholars crunched the numbers and found
that a single von Neumann machine traveling at 5% of the speed of light should be able to replicate throughout
our galaxy in 4 million years or less. That may sound like a long time, but when you consider that our universe
is 14 billion years old, on a cosmic scale, it's incredibly fast - the equivalent of about 2.5 hours
in an entire year. Creating von Neumann machines
would require a few technologies we don't have yet, including advanced 
artificial intelligence, miniaturization, and better propulsion systems. If we wanted to use them to spread actual
humans throughout the galaxy, we would need 
yet another technological leap - the ability to artificially 
grow biological organisms and bodies using raw elements 
and genetic information. Regardless, if in the last billion years an alien civilization 
created such a machine and set it multiplying its way toward us, our galaxy would be 
swarming with them by now. So then where are all these machines? Some astronomers, like Carl Sagan, say that intelligent aliens wouldn't
build self-replicating machines at all. They might hurtle out of control, scavenging planets to their cores
in order to keep replicating. Others take the machines absence as proof that intelligent alien civilizations 
don't exist, or that they go extinct before they can
develop the necessary technologies. But all this hasn't stopped people from
imagining what it would be like if they were out there. Science fiction author David Brin writes about a universe in which
many different von Neumann machines exist and proliferate simultaneously. Some are designed 
to greet young civilizations, others to locate and destroy them
before they become a threat. In fact, in Brin's story "Lungfish," some von Neumann machines are keeping
a close watch over the Earth right now, waiting for us to reach a certain level
of sophistication before they make their move. For now, all we have is curiosity 
and theory. But the next time 
you look at the night sky, consider that billions of
self-replicating machines could be advancing between stars
in our galaxy right now. If they exist, one of them will eventually
land on Earth, or maybe, just maybe,
they're already here.

**Transcript**:
This is the Bop. The Bop is a type of social dance. Dance is a language, and social dance is an expression
that emerges from a community. A social dance isn't choreographed
by any one person. It can't be traced to any one moment. Each dance has steps
that everyone can agree on, but it's about the individual
and their creative identity. Because of that, social dances bubble up, they change, and they spread like wildfire. They are as old as our remembered history. In African-American social dances, we see over 200 years of how African and African-American
traditions influenced our history. The present always contains the past. And the past shapes who we are and who we will be. (Clapping) The Juba dance was born
from enslaved Africans' experience on the plantation. Brought to the Americas, stripped of a common spoken language, this dance was a way for enslaved Africans
to remember where they're from. It may have looked something like this. Slapping thighs, shuffling feet and patting hands: this was how they got around
the slave owners' ban on drumming, improvising complex rhythms just like ancestors did
with drums in Haiti or in the Yoruba communities
of West Africa. It was about keeping
cultural traditions alive and retaining a sense of inner freedom under captivity. It was the same subversive spirit
that created this dance: the Cakewalk, a dance that parodied the mannerisms
of Southern high society -- a way for the enslaved
to throw shade at the masters. The crazy thing about this dance is that the Cakewalk
was performed for the masters, who never suspected
they were being made fun of. Now you might recognize this one. 1920s -- the Charleston. The Charleston was all about
improvisation and musicality, making its way into Lindy Hop, swing dancing and even the Kid n Play, originally called the Funky Charleston. Started by a tight-knit Black community
near Charleston, South Carolina, the Charleston permeated dance halls where young women suddenly had

**Transcript**:
This is the Bop. The Bop is a type of social dance. Dance is a language, and social dance is an expression
that emerges from a community. A social dance isn't choreographed
by any one person. It can't be traced to any one moment. Each dance has steps
that everyone can agree on, but it's about the individual
and their creative identity. Because of that, social dances bubble up, they change, and they spread like wildfire. They are as old as our remembered history. In African-American social dances, we see over 200 years of how African and African-American
traditions influenced our history. The present always contains the past. And the past shapes who we are and who we will be. (Clapping) The Juba dance was born
from enslaved Africans' experience on the plantation. Brought to the Americas, stripped of a common spoken language, this dance was a way for enslaved Africans
to remember where they're from. It may have looked something like this. Slapping thighs, shuffling feet and patting hands: this was how they got around
the slave owners' ban on drumming, improvising complex rhythms just like ancestors did
with drums in Haiti or in the Yoruba communities
of West Africa. It was about keeping
cultural traditions alive and retaining a sense of inner freedom under captivity. It was the same subversive spirit
that created this dance: the Cakewalk, a dance that parodied the mannerisms
of Southern high society -- a way for the enslaved
to throw shade at the masters. The crazy thing about this dance is that the Cakewalk
was performed for the masters, who never suspected
they were being made fun of. Now you might recognize this one. 1920s -- the Charleston. The Charleston was all about
improvisation and musicality, making its way into Lindy Hop, swing dancing and even the Kid n Play, originally called the Funky Charleston. Started by a tight-knit Black community
near Charleston, South Carolina, the Charleston permeated dance halls where young women suddenly had
the freedom to kick their heels and move their legs. Now, social dance is about
community and connection; if you knew the steps, it meant you belonged to a group. But what if it becomes a worldwide craze? Enter the Twist. It's no surprise that the Twist
can be traced back to the 19th century, brought to America from the Congo during slavery. But in the late '50s, right before the Civil Rights Movement, the Twist is popularized

**Transcript**:
I’ve invited you all here today because
I wanted to talk to you about some ugly stereotypes that are going around. I’ve been hearing a lot of unfair, unseemly, and
unscientific generalizations being made lately. And they mostly have to do with sex. And your hormones. People have a nasty habit of equating “hormones”
with a particular set of behaviors and conditions, most of which have to do with reproduction,
or sexual development, or acts that include what my brother John has referred to as “skoodilypooping.” For example, people will say that “hormones”
are why Kevin has zits, and is being all moody, or why Hannah, who’s three months pregnant,
just cried watching a commercial for car insurance -- which, let’s be honest, I do that too. Now, I’m not saying that hormones aren’t
at the root of sexual attraction, or zits, or occasional bouts of extreme emotion, because
they are. That’s just not all that they do. Not even close. When people talk about “hormones” in
the contexts that I just mentioned, what really they mean is "sex hormones." But sex hormones are just one kind of hormone
that you have coursing through your body right now. In fact, there are at least 50 different types
of these chemical messengers at work in your body at this very minute, but only a very few
of them have anything at all to do with sex. The truth is, from birth to death, just about
every cell and function in your body is under your hormones’ constant influence. They’re floating through your blood, regulating
your metabolism, your sleep cycle, your response to stress, and the general and incredibly important
overall homeostasis that keeps you not dead. Some hormones are just there to make other
hormones trigger even more hormones -- in a kind of chemical relay race that biologists
refer to, rather elegantly, as “cascades.” These hormones run through you no matter what
your mood is, or whether you have zits. So the reality is: We’re all hormonal ... all
of the time. OK, to begin to understand our hormones -- and
the endocrine system that produces, releases, and re-absorbs them -- we have to step back
and take a broad view. Not just by emphasizing that sex hormones aren’t
the only hormones you have -- but also by looking at how your hormones interact with
your other organ systems. Because, if anything, your body has two bosses
-- two complementary systems that are constantly shouting instructions over each other, to
all of your bits and pieces. Both your endocrine system and your nervous
system are constantly trafficking information around your corpus, gathering intel, making
demands, controlling your every move. They just have totally different ways of doing
it. Your nervous system uses lightning-fast
electrochemical action potentials, delivered by an expressway made of
neurons to specific cells and organs. But your endocrine system prefers a slower,
wider stream of data. It secretes hormones that travel through your
blood -- NOT through neurons -- so they move more slowly, but they also produce widespread effects
that last a whole lot longer than an action potential. Now, compared to your heart or brain or other,
arguably more glamorous organs, your endocrine system’s organs and glands are kinda small
and lumpy. They’re also rogues -- instead of being all
nestled together like in your other organ systems, these guys are scattered all over the place, from your
brain to your throat, to your kidneys, to your genitals. A gland is a just any structure that makes
and secretes a hormone. And the master gland in your body is the pituitary, which produces
many hormones that signal other glands -- like the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal
glands -- to make their own hormones. The endocrine system also includes a few organs
-- like the gonads, the pancreas, and the placenta in pregnant women -- all of which
have some other non-hormonal functions and are made up of multiple tissue types. And technically the hypothalamus in your brain
is in the endocrine club too, since in addition to all of its busy brain duties, it does produce
and release hormones. So, thanks to these glands and organs, you’ve got
all these hormones diffusing through your blood, doing all sorts of different things, but the thing to
remember about them is that a hormone can only trigger a reaction in specific cells -- their so-called
target cells -- that have the right receptors for it. So, just like some keys can open many locks,
while others only work with one, so too can the hormone-target-cell relationship either
be widespread or localized. You’re probably gonna want an example of
that. So, your thyroid -- at the bottom of your throat -- produces the hormone thyroxine,
which stimulates metabolism and binds to receptors in most of the cells in your body. But your pituitary -- which is nestled all
comfy under your brain -- produces follicle-stimulating hormone, which helps regulate growth and triggers
sexual maturity, and it only targets specific cells in the ovaries and testes. So how do hormones bind to their target cells? Well, chemically, most hormones are either
made of amino acids -- including their more complex structures like peptides or proteins
-- or they’re derived from lipids, like cholesterol. And this is key, because a hormone’s chemical
structure determines if it’s water soluble, like most amino acid-based ones are, or lipid
soluble, like steroids are. Solubility is important because your cell
membranes are made of lipids. That means that water soluble ones can’t
get across them. So target cells for those kinds of hormones have receptors for them
on the outside of their membranes. Lipid-soluble hormones, on the other hand,
can just basically glide right through that cell membrane, so their receptor sites are
inside their target cells. Either way, when a target cell is activated,
the hormone alters its activity, by either increasing or decreasing some of its functions
-- usually with the goal of maintaining your body’s homeostasis in one way or another. So, if hormones are keeping your body IN balance,
what’s putting your body out of balance? I don’t know -- could I interest you in
some pie? If you have a couple of nice, generous helpings
of strawberry-rhubarb pie -- and just to make things interesting, let’s say they’re a la mode --
your blood glucose level is gonna go through the roof. And the pancreas regulates your blood sugar by
releasing two different hormones -- insulin and glucagon. Once you have a belly full of that pie,
beta cells in your pancreas release insulin, which helps lower your blood sugar by increasing
the rate at which your cells store the sugar either as glycogen or as fat for later use. Now, let’s say you’ve done the opposite:
You’ve eaten no pie -- you’re pie-less -- in fact, you’ve eaten nothing for hours. If your blood sugar drops too low, then alpha
cells in the pancreas will instead send out glucagon, which helps raise your blood sugar
levels, in part by decreasing the storage of sugar in your cells, and triggering their
release of glucose back into the blood. Lots of different endocrine-related illnesses
-- like diabetes or hyperthyroidism -- tend to be the result of either hyper (too much)
or hypo (too little) secretion of certain hormones, which throw your homeostasis off
balance. But there are lots of more common -- and less
obvious -- ways your hormones can get out of balance, not because of some disorder,
but because these signaling chemicals are just caught up in a chain reaction, which
can take a while to subside. Some hormones just exist to control other
hormones, which in turn control still more hormones. So as soon as one starts to trickle out, you can
pretty quickly wind up with a cascade on your hands. You’ve got a few different hormone cascades
going on at any given moment, but one of the big ones -- one that’s really worth understanding
-- is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, or the HPA axis, because you don’t want
to have to say that every time. This is a complex series of interactions between
three glands that ultimately regulates lots of your body’s daily processes, like digestion, sexuality,
immune response, and how you handle stress. And it’s complex not just because of all
the glands involved -- it’s also one of the more crucial instances of your endocrine
system coordinating with your nervous system. Specifically, it’s behind that fight-or-flight
response that everybody keeps talking about. The HPA Axis is essentially the endocrine system’s
companion to the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic system, in times of high stress,
does things like speed up your heart rate and direct blood away from the digestive organs
and to the muscles. But many of the other effects of the stress
response are carried out by your endocrine system. And getting your nervous and endocrine
systems to work together in times of crisis is where the hypothalamus comes in. It’s the hub of where the two systems meet
-- it keeps tabs on what’s going on all over your body, analyzing your blood for signs
that something might be off. So, let’s revisit our fight-or-flight scene from a few
lessons ago -- the old Burning House Scenario. So you’re sleeping, dreaming about petting pandas with
Emma Watson or whatever, when the smoke alarm goes off. Well, action potentials in your brain trigger
neurons in your hypothalamus to release the peptide hormone CRH, or corticotropin releasing hormone. The CRH makes the very short trip through
the bloodstream to the anterior pituitary gland, where, because it’s water soluble, it
binds to receptors on the outside of its target cells. There, it triggers the release of adrenocorticotropic
hormone, or ACTH. The ACTH travels -- again through the bloodstream -- to the adrenal cortices
of the adrenal glands on top of your kidneys. When the ACTH binds to receptors on cells
in an adrenal cortex, it triggers the release of a frenzy of different freak-out compounds known
as glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid hormones. Typically these guys help us deal with day-to-day stress
by keeping our blood sugar and blood pressure balanced. But under major stress -- like waking up
in a burning building stress -- these hormones, like cortisol, cause the classic fight-or-flight
response: ramping up your blood pressure, dumping glucose into your bloodstream, shutting
down non-emergency services like your immune system and sperm and egg development. And guess what? Now that all these stress
hormones are pulsing through your blood, the hypothalamus back in the brain senses them. And because its job is to monitor and maintain
balance whenever possible, it then stops secreting CRH, which -- eventually -- causes the other
glands to stop secreting their panic hormones. Now, because this element of the stress response
is hormonal rather than electrical, it comes on more slowly than the nervous system part,
and it takes longer to subside, too, as those stress hormones linger in the blood before
being broken down by enzymes. So. We’re a long way from teenage crushes and zits
and crying over commercials at this point, aren’t we? As a life-long owner of hormones, I hope you’ll
join me in dispelling the stereotypes that surround these powerful and important chemicals,
and give them the respect they rightly deserve. Today we looked at the endocrine system, and
how it uses glands to produce hormones. These hormones are either amino-acid based and water
soluble, or steroidal and lipid-soluble, and may target many types of cells or just turn
on specific ones. We also touched on hormone cascades, and how the HPA axis effects your
stress response. Thank you to our Headmaster of Learning, Thomas

obvious -- ways your hormones can get out of balance, not because of some disorder,
but because these signaling chemicals are just caught up in a chain reaction, which
can take a while to subside. Some hormones just exist to control other
hormones, which in turn control still more hormones. So as soon as one starts to trickle out, you can
pretty quickly wind up with a cascade on your hands. You’ve got a few different hormone cascades
going on at any given moment, but one of the big ones -- one that’s really worth understanding
-- is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, or the HPA axis, because you don’t want
to have to say that every time. This is a complex series of interactions between
three glands that ultimately regulates lots of your body’s daily processes, like digestion, sexuality,
immune response, and how you handle stress. And it’s complex not just because of all
the glands involved -- it’s also one of the more crucial instances of your endocrine
system coordinating with your nervous system. Specifically, it’s behind that fight-or-flight
response that everybody keeps talking about. The HPA Axis is essentially the endocrine system’s
companion to the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic system, in times of high stress,
does things like speed up your heart rate and direct blood away from the digestive organs
and to the muscles. But many of the other effects of the stress
response are carried out by your endocrine system. And getting your nervous and endocrine
systems to work together in times of crisis is where the hypothalamus comes in. It’s the hub of where the two systems meet
-- it keeps tabs on what’s going on all over your body, analyzing your blood for signs
that something might be off. So, let’s revisit our fight-or-flight scene from a few
lessons ago -- the old Burning House Scenario. So you’re sleeping, dreaming about petting pandas with
Emma Watson or whatever, when the smoke alarm goes off. Well, action potentials in your brain trigger
neurons in your hypothalamus to release the peptide hormone CRH, or corticotropin releasing hormone. The CRH makes the very short trip through
the bloodstream to the anterior pituitary gland, where, because it’s water soluble, it
binds to receptors on the outside of its target cells. There, it triggers the release of adrenocorticotropic
hormone, or ACTH. The ACTH travels -- again through the bloodstream -- to the adrenal cortices
of the adrenal glands on top of your kidneys. When the ACTH binds to receptors on cells
in an adrenal cortex, it triggers the release of a frenzy of different freak-out compounds known
as glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid hormones. Typically these guys help us deal with day-to-day stress
by keeping our blood sugar and blood pressure balanced. But under major stress -- like waking up
in a burning building stress -- these hormones, like cortisol, cause the classic fight-or-flight
response: ramping up your blood pressure, dumping glucose into your bloodstream, shutting
down non-emergency services like your immune system and sperm and egg development. And guess what? Now that all these stress
hormones are pulsing through your blood, the hypothalamus back in the brain senses them. And because its job is to monitor and maintain
balance whenever possible, it then stops secreting CRH, which -- eventually -- causes the other
glands to stop secreting their panic hormones. Now, because this element of the stress response
is hormonal rather than electrical, it comes on more slowly than the nervous system part,
and it takes longer to subside, too, as those stress hormones linger in the blood before
being broken down by enzymes. So. We’re a long way from teenage crushes and zits
and crying over commercials at this point, aren’t we? As a life-long owner of hormones, I hope you’ll
join me in dispelling the stereotypes that surround these powerful and important chemicals,
and give them the respect they rightly deserve. Today we looked at the endocrine system, and
how it uses glands to produce hormones. These hormones are either amino-acid based and water
soluble, or steroidal and lipid-soluble, and may target many types of cells or just turn
on specific ones. We also touched on hormone cascades, and how the HPA axis effects your
stress response. Thank you to our Headmaster of Learning, Thomas

**Transcript**:
I’ve invited you all here today because
I wanted to talk to you about some ugly stereotypes that are going around. I’ve been hearing a lot of unfair, unseemly, and
unscientific generalizations being made lately. And they mostly have to do with sex. And your hormones. People have a nasty habit of equating “hormones”
with a particular set of behaviors and conditions, most of which have to do with reproduction,
or sexual development, or acts that include what my brother John has referred to as “skoodilypooping.” For example, people will say that “hormones”
are why Kevin has zits, and is being all moody, or why Hannah, who’s three months pregnant,
just cried watching a commercial for car insurance -- which, let’s be honest, I do that too. Now, I’m not saying that hormones aren’t
at the root of sexual attraction, or zits, or occasional bouts of extreme emotion, because
they are. That’s just not all that they do. Not even close. When people talk about “hormones” in
the contexts that I just mentioned, what really they mean is "sex hormones." But sex hormones are just one kind of hormone
that you have coursing through your body right now. In fact, there are at least 50 different types
of these chemical messengers at work in your body at this very minute, but only a very few
of them have anything at all to do with sex. The truth is, from birth to death, just about
every cell and function in your body is under your hormones’ constant influence. They’re floating through your blood, regulating
your metabolism, your sleep cycle, your response to stress, and the general and incredibly important
overall homeostasis that keeps you not dead. Some hormones are just there to make other
hormones trigger even more hormones -- in a kind of chemical relay race that biologists
refer to, rather elegantly, as “cascades.” These hormones run through you no matter what
your mood is, or whether you have zits. So the reality is: We’re all hormonal ... all
of the time. OK, to begin to understand our hormones -- and
the endocrine system that produces, releases, and re-absorbs them -- we have to step back
and take a broad view. Not just by emphasizing that sex hormones aren’t
the only hormones you have -- but also by looking at how your hormones interact with
your other organ systems. Because, if anything, your body has two bosses
-- two complementary systems that are constantly shouting instructions over each other, to
all of your bits and pieces. Both your endocrine system and your nervous
system are constantly trafficking information around your corpus, gathering intel, making
demands, controlling your every move. They just have totally different ways of doing
it. Your nervous system uses lightning-fast
electrochemical action potentials, delivered by an expressway made of
neurons to specific cells and organs. But your endocrine system prefers a slower,
wider stream of data. It secretes hormones that travel through your
blood -- NOT through neurons -- so they move more slowly, but they also produce widespread effects
that last a whole lot longer than an action potential. Now, compared to your heart or brain or other,
arguably more glamorous organs, your endocrine system’s organs and glands are kinda small
and lumpy. They’re also rogues -- instead of being all
nestled together like in your other organ systems, these guys are scattered all over the place, from your
brain to your throat, to your kidneys, to your genitals. A gland is a just any structure that makes
and secretes a hormone. And the master gland in your body is the pituitary, which produces
many hormones that signal other glands -- like the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal
glands -- to make their own hormones. The endocrine system also includes a few organs
-- like the gonads, the pancreas, and the placenta in pregnant women -- all of which
have some other non-hormonal functions and are made up of multiple tissue types. And technically the hypothalamus in your brain
is in the endocrine club too, since in addition to all of its busy brain duties, it does produce
and release hormones. So, thanks to these glands and organs, you’ve got
all these hormones diffusing through your blood, doing all sorts of different things, but the thing to
remember about them is that a hormone can only trigger a reaction in specific cells -- their so-called
target cells -- that have the right receptors for it. So, just like some keys can open many locks,
while others only work with one, so too can the hormone-target-cell relationship either
be widespread or localized. You’re probably gonna want an example of
that. So, your thyroid -- at the bottom of your throat -- produces the hormone thyroxine,
which stimulates metabolism and binds to receptors in most of the cells in your body. But your pituitary -- which is nestled all
comfy under your brain -- produces follicle-stimulating hormone, which helps regulate growth and triggers
sexual maturity, and it only targets specific cells in the ovaries and testes. So how do hormones bind to their target cells? Well, chemically, most hormones are either
made of amino acids -- including their more complex structures like peptides or proteins
-- or they’re derived from lipids, like cholesterol. And this is key, because a hormone’s chemical
structure determines if it’s water soluble, like most amino acid-based ones are, or lipid
soluble, like steroids are. Solubility is important because your cell
membranes are made of lipids. That means that water soluble ones can’t
get across them. So target cells for those kinds of hormones have receptors for them
on the outside of their membranes. Lipid-soluble hormones, on the other hand,
can just basically glide right through that cell membrane, so their receptor sites are
inside their target cells. Either way, when a target cell is activated,
the hormone alters its activity, by either increasing or decreasing some of its functions
-- usually with the goal of maintaining your body’s homeostasis in one way or another. So, if hormones are keeping your body IN balance,
what’s putting your body out of balance? I don’t know -- could I interest you in
some pie? If you have a couple of nice, generous helpings
of strawberry-rhubarb pie -- and just to make things interesting, let’s say they’re a la mode --
your blood glucose level is gonna go through the roof. And the pancreas regulates your blood sugar by
releasing two different hormones -- insulin and glucagon. Once you have a belly full of that pie,
beta cells in your pancreas release insulin, which helps lower your blood sugar by increasing
the rate at which your cells store the sugar either as glycogen or as fat for later use. Now, let’s say you’ve done the opposite:
You’ve eaten no pie -- you’re pie-less -- in fact, you’ve eaten nothing for hours. If your blood sugar drops too low, then alpha
cells in the pancreas will instead send out glucagon, which helps raise your blood sugar
levels, in part by decreasing the storage of sugar in your cells, and triggering their
release of glucose back into the blood. Lots of different endocrine-related illnesses
-- like diabetes or hyperthyroidism -- tend to be the result of either hyper (too much)
or hypo (too little) secretion of certain hormones, which throw your homeostasis off
balance. But there are lots of more common -- and less
obvious -- ways your hormones can get out of balance, not because of some disorder,
but because these signaling chemicals are just caught up in a chain reaction, which
can take a while to subside. Some hormones just exist to control other
hormones, which in turn control still more hormones. So as soon as one starts to trickle out, you can

balance whenever possible, it then stops secreting CRH, which -- eventually -- causes the other
glands to stop secreting their panic hormones. Now, because this element of the stress response
is hormonal rather than electrical, it comes on more slowly than the nervous system part,
and it takes longer to subside, too, as those stress hormones linger in the blood before
being broken down by enzymes. So. We’re a long way from teenage crushes and zits
and crying over commercials at this point, aren’t we? As a life-long owner of hormones, I hope you’ll
join me in dispelling the stereotypes that surround these powerful and important chemicals,
and give them the respect they rightly deserve. Today we looked at the endocrine system, and
how it uses glands to produce hormones. These hormones are either amino-acid based and water
soluble, or steroidal and lipid-soluble, and may target many types of cells or just turn
on specific ones. We also touched on hormone cascades, and how the HPA axis effects your
stress response. Thank you to our Headmaster of Learning, Thomas

**Transcript**:
I’ve invited you all here today because
I wanted to talk to you about some ugly stereotypes that are going around. I’ve been hearing a lot of unfair, unseemly, and
unscientific generalizations being made lately. And they mostly have to do with sex. And your hormones. People have a nasty habit of equating “hormones”
with a particular set of behaviors and conditions, most of which have to do with reproduction,
or sexual development, or acts that include what my brother John has referred to as “skoodilypooping.” For example, people will say that “hormones”
are why Kevin has zits, and is being all moody, or why Hannah, who’s three months pregnant,
just cried watching a commercial for car insurance -- which, let’s be honest, I do that too. Now, I’m not saying that hormones aren’t
at the root of sexual attraction, or zits, or occasional bouts of extreme emotion, because
they are. That’s just not all that they do. Not even close. When people talk about “hormones” in
the contexts that I just mentioned, what really they mean is "sex hormones." But sex hormones are just one kind of hormone
that you have coursing through your body right now. In fact, there are at least 50 different types
of these chemical messengers at work in your body at this very minute, but only a very few
of them have anything at all to do with sex. The truth is, from birth to death, just about
every cell and function in your body is under your hormones’ constant influence. They’re floating through your blood, regulating
your metabolism, your sleep cycle, your response to stress, and the general and incredibly important
overall homeostasis that keeps you not dead. Some hormones are just there to make other
hormones trigger even more hormones -- in a kind of chemical relay race that biologists
refer to, rather elegantly, as “cascades.” These hormones run through you no matter what
your mood is, or whether you have zits. So the reality is: We’re all hormonal ... all
of the time. OK, to begin to understand our hormones -- and
the endocrine system that produces, releases, and re-absorbs them -- we have to step back
and take a broad view. Not just by emphasizing that sex hormones aren’t
the only hormones you have -- but also by looking at how your hormones interact with
your other organ systems. Because, if anything, your body has two bosses
-- two complementary systems that are constantly shouting instructions over each other, to
all of your bits and pieces. Both your endocrine system and your nervous
system are constantly trafficking information around your corpus, gathering intel, making
demands, controlling your every move. They just have totally different ways of doing
it. Your nervous system uses lightning-fast
electrochemical action potentials, delivered by an expressway made of
neurons to specific cells and organs. But your endocrine system prefers a slower,
wider stream of data. It secretes hormones that travel through your
blood -- NOT through neurons -- so they move more slowly, but they also produce widespread effects
that last a whole lot longer than an action potential. Now, compared to your heart or brain or other,
arguably more glamorous organs, your endocrine system’s organs and glands are kinda small
and lumpy. They’re also rogues -- instead of being all
nestled together like in your other organ systems, these guys are scattered all over the place, from your
brain to your throat, to your kidneys, to your genitals. A gland is a just any structure that makes
and secretes a hormone. And the master gland in your body is the pituitary, which produces
many hormones that signal other glands -- like the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal
glands -- to make their own hormones. The endocrine system also includes a few organs
-- like the gonads, the pancreas, and the placenta in pregnant women -- all of which
have some other non-hormonal functions and are made up of multiple tissue types. And technically the hypothalamus in your brain
is in the endocrine club too, since in addition to all of its busy brain duties, it does produce
and release hormones. So, thanks to these glands and organs, you’ve got
all these hormones diffusing through your blood, doing all sorts of different things, but the thing to
remember about them is that a hormone can only trigger a reaction in specific cells -- their so-called
target cells -- that have the right receptors for it. So, just like some keys can open many locks,
while others only work with one, so too can the hormone-target-cell relationship either
be widespread or localized. You’re probably gonna want an example of
that. So, your thyroid -- at the bottom of your throat -- produces the hormone thyroxine,
which stimulates metabolism and binds to receptors in most of the cells in your body. But your pituitary -- which is nestled all
comfy under your brain -- produces follicle-stimulating hormone, which helps regulate growth and triggers
sexual maturity, and it only targets specific cells in the ovaries and testes. So how do hormones bind to their target cells? Well, chemically, most hormones are either
made of amino acids -- including their more complex structures like peptides or proteins
-- or they’re derived from lipids, like cholesterol. And this is key, because a hormone’s chemical
structure determines if it’s water soluble, like most amino acid-based ones are, or lipid
soluble, like steroids are. Solubility is important because your cell
membranes are made of lipids. That means that water soluble ones can’t
get across them. So target cells for those kinds of hormones have receptors for them
on the outside of their membranes. Lipid-soluble hormones, on the other hand,
can just basically glide right through that cell membrane, so their receptor sites are
inside their target cells. Either way, when a target cell is activated,
the hormone alters its activity, by either increasing or decreasing some of its functions
-- usually with the goal of maintaining your body’s homeostasis in one way or another. So, if hormones are keeping your body IN balance,
what’s putting your body out of balance? I don’t know -- could I interest you in
some pie? If you have a couple of nice, generous helpings
of strawberry-rhubarb pie -- and just to make things interesting, let’s say they’re a la mode --
your blood glucose level is gonna go through the roof. And the pancreas regulates your blood sugar by
releasing two different hormones -- insulin and glucagon. Once you have a belly full of that pie,
beta cells in your pancreas release insulin, which helps lower your blood sugar by increasing
the rate at which your cells store the sugar either as glycogen or as fat for later use. Now, let’s say you’ve done the opposite:
You’ve eaten no pie -- you’re pie-less -- in fact, you’ve eaten nothing for hours. If your blood sugar drops too low, then alpha
cells in the pancreas will instead send out glucagon, which helps raise your blood sugar
levels, in part by decreasing the storage of sugar in your cells, and triggering their
release of glucose back into the blood. Lots of different endocrine-related illnesses
-- like diabetes or hyperthyroidism -- tend to be the result of either hyper (too much)
or hypo (too little) secretion of certain hormones, which throw your homeostasis off
balance. But there are lots of more common -- and less
obvious -- ways your hormones can get out of balance, not because of some disorder,
but because these signaling chemicals are just caught up in a chain reaction, which
can take a while to subside. Some hormones just exist to control other
hormones, which in turn control still more hormones. So as soon as one starts to trickle out, you can
pretty quickly wind up with a cascade on your hands. You’ve got a few different hormone cascades
going on at any given moment, but one of the big ones -- one that’s really worth understanding
-- is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, or the HPA axis, because you don’t want
to have to say that every time. This is a complex series of interactions between
three glands that ultimately regulates lots of your body’s daily processes, like digestion, sexuality,
immune response, and how you handle stress. And it’s complex not just because of all
the glands involved -- it’s also one of the more crucial instances of your endocrine
system coordinating with your nervous system. Specifically, it’s behind that fight-or-flight
response that everybody keeps talking about. The HPA Axis is essentially the endocrine system’s
companion to the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic system, in times of high stress,
does things like speed up your heart rate and direct blood away from the digestive organs
and to the muscles. But many of the other effects of the stress
response are carried out by your endocrine system. And getting your nervous and endocrine
systems to work together in times of crisis is where the hypothalamus comes in. It’s the hub of where the two systems meet
-- it keeps tabs on what’s going on all over your body, analyzing your blood for signs
that something might be off. So, let’s revisit our fight-or-flight scene from a few
lessons ago -- the old Burning House Scenario. So you’re sleeping, dreaming about petting pandas with
Emma Watson or whatever, when the smoke alarm goes off. Well, action potentials in your brain trigger
neurons in your hypothalamus to release the peptide hormone CRH, or corticotropin releasing hormone. The CRH makes the very short trip through
the bloodstream to the anterior pituitary gland, where, because it’s water soluble, it
binds to receptors on the outside of its target cells. There, it triggers the release of adrenocorticotropic
hormone, or ACTH. The ACTH travels -- again through the bloodstream -- to the adrenal cortices
of the adrenal glands on top of your kidneys. When the ACTH binds to receptors on cells
in an adrenal cortex, it triggers the release of a frenzy of different freak-out compounds known
as glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid hormones. Typically these guys help us deal with day-to-day stress
by keeping our blood sugar and blood pressure balanced. But under major stress -- like waking up
in a burning building stress -- these hormones, like cortisol, cause the classic fight-or-flight
response: ramping up your blood pressure, dumping glucose into your bloodstream, shutting
down non-emergency services like your immune system and sperm and egg development. And guess what? Now that all these stress
hormones are pulsing through your blood, the hypothalamus back in the brain senses them. And because its job is to monitor and maintain
balance whenever possible, it then stops secreting CRH, which -- eventually -- causes the other
glands to stop secreting their panic hormones. Now, because this element of the stress response
is hormonal rather than electrical, it comes on more slowly than the nervous system part,
and it takes longer to subside, too, as those stress hormones linger in the blood before
being broken down by enzymes. So. We’re a long way from teenage crushes and zits

**Transcript**:
I’ve invited you all here today because
I wanted to talk to you about some ugly stereotypes that are going around. I’ve been hearing a lot of unfair, unseemly, and
unscientific generalizations being made lately. And they mostly have to do with sex. And your hormones. People have a nasty habit of equating “hormones”
with a particular set of behaviors and conditions, most of which have to do with reproduction,
or sexual development, or acts that include what my brother John has referred to as “skoodilypooping.” For example, people will say that “hormones”
are why Kevin has zits, and is being all moody, or why Hannah, who’s three months pregnant,
just cried watching a commercial for car insurance -- which, let’s be honest, I do that too. Now, I’m not saying that hormones aren’t
at the root of sexual attraction, or zits, or occasional bouts of extreme emotion, because
they are. That’s just not all that they do. Not even close. When people talk about “hormones” in
the contexts that I just mentioned, what really they mean is "sex hormones." But sex hormones are just one kind of hormone
that you have coursing through your body right now. In fact, there are at least 50 different types
of these chemical messengers at work in your body at this very minute, but only a very few
of them have anything at all to do with sex. The truth is, from birth to death, just about
every cell and function in your body is under your hormones’ constant influence. They’re floating through your blood, regulating
your metabolism, your sleep cycle, your response to stress, and the general and incredibly important
overall homeostasis that keeps you not dead. Some hormones are just there to make other
hormones trigger even more hormones -- in a kind of chemical relay race that biologists
refer to, rather elegantly, as “cascades.” These hormones run through you no matter what
your mood is, or whether you have zits. So the reality is: We’re all hormonal ... all
of the time. OK, to begin to understand our hormones -- and
the endocrine system that produces, releases, and re-absorbs them -- we have to step back
and take a broad view. Not just by emphasizing that sex hormones aren’t
the only hormones you have -- but also by looking at how your hormones interact with
your other organ systems. Because, if anything, your body has two bosses
-- two complementary systems that are constantly shouting instructions over each other, to
all of your bits and pieces. Both your endocrine system and your nervous
system are constantly trafficking information around your corpus, gathering intel, making
demands, controlling your every move. They just have totally different ways of doing
it. Your nervous system uses lightning-fast
electrochemical action potentials, delivered by an expressway made of
neurons to specific cells and organs. But your endocrine system prefers a slower,
wider stream of data. It secretes hormones that travel through your
blood -- NOT through neurons -- so they move more slowly, but they also produce widespread effects
that last a whole lot longer than an action potential. Now, compared to your heart or brain or other,
arguably more glamorous organs, your endocrine system’s organs and glands are kinda small
and lumpy. They’re also rogues -- instead of being all
nestled together like in your other organ systems, these guys are scattered all over the place, from your
brain to your throat, to your kidneys, to your genitals. A gland is a just any structure that makes
and secretes a hormone. And the master gland in your body is the pituitary, which produces
many hormones that signal other glands -- like the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal
glands -- to make their own hormones. The endocrine system also includes a few organs
-- like the gonads, the pancreas, and the placenta in pregnant women -- all of which
have some other non-hormonal functions and are made up of multiple tissue types. And technically the hypothalamus in your brain
is in the endocrine club too, since in addition to all of its busy brain duties, it does produce
and release hormones. So, thanks to these glands and organs, you’ve got
all these hormones diffusing through your blood, doing all sorts of different things, but the thing to
remember about them is that a hormone can only trigger a reaction in specific cells -- their so-called
target cells -- that have the right receptors for it. So, just like some keys can open many locks,
while others only work with one, so too can the hormone-target-cell relationship either
be widespread or localized. You’re probably gonna want an example of
that. So, your thyroid -- at the bottom of your throat -- produces the hormone thyroxine,
which stimulates metabolism and binds to receptors in most of the cells in your body. But your pituitary -- which is nestled all
comfy under your brain -- produces follicle-stimulating hormone, which helps regulate growth and triggers
sexual maturity, and it only targets specific cells in the ovaries and testes. So how do hormones bind to their target cells? Well, chemically, most hormones are either
made of amino acids -- including their more complex structures like peptides or proteins
-- or they’re derived from lipids, like cholesterol. And this is key, because a hormone’s chemical
structure determines if it’s water soluble, like most amino acid-based ones are, or lipid
soluble, like steroids are. Solubility is important because your cell
membranes are made of lipids. That means that water soluble ones can’t
get across them. So target cells for those kinds of hormones have receptors for them
on the outside of their membranes. Lipid-soluble hormones, on the other hand,
can just basically glide right through that cell membrane, so their receptor sites are
inside their target cells. Either way, when a target cell is activated,
the hormone alters its activity, by either increasing or decreasing some of its functions
-- usually with the goal of maintaining your body’s homeostasis in one way or another. So, if hormones are keeping your body IN balance,
what’s putting your body out of balance? I don’t know -- could I interest you in
some pie? If you have a couple of nice, generous helpings
of strawberry-rhubarb pie -- and just to make things interesting, let’s say they’re a la mode --
your blood glucose level is gonna go through the roof. And the pancreas regulates your blood sugar by
releasing two different hormones -- insulin and glucagon. Once you have a belly full of that pie,
beta cells in your pancreas release insulin, which helps lower your blood sugar by increasing
the rate at which your cells store the sugar either as glycogen or as fat for later use. Now, let’s say you’ve done the opposite:
You’ve eaten no pie -- you’re pie-less -- in fact, you’ve eaten nothing for hours. If your blood sugar drops too low, then alpha
cells in the pancreas will instead send out glucagon, which helps raise your blood sugar
levels, in part by decreasing the storage of sugar in your cells, and triggering their
release of glucose back into the blood. Lots of different endocrine-related illnesses
-- like diabetes or hyperthyroidism -- tend to be the result of either hyper (too much)
or hypo (too little) secretion of certain hormones, which throw your homeostasis off
balance. But there are lots of more common -- and less
obvious -- ways your hormones can get out of balance, not because of some disorder,
but because these signaling chemicals are just caught up in a chain reaction, which
can take a while to subside. Some hormones just exist to control other
hormones, which in turn control still more hormones. So as soon as one starts to trickle out, you can
pretty quickly wind up with a cascade on your hands. You’ve got a few different hormone cascades
going on at any given moment, but one of the big ones -- one that’s really worth understanding
-- is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, or the HPA axis, because you don’t want
to have to say that every time. This is a complex series of interactions between
three glands that ultimately regulates lots of your body’s daily processes, like digestion, sexuality,
immune response, and how you handle stress. And it’s complex not just because of all
the glands involved -- it’s also one of the more crucial instances of your endocrine
system coordinating with your nervous system. Specifically, it’s behind that fight-or-flight
response that everybody keeps talking about. The HPA Axis is essentially the endocrine system’s
companion to the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic system, in times of high stress,
does things like speed up your heart rate and direct blood away from the digestive organs
and to the muscles. But many of the other effects of the stress
response are carried out by your endocrine system. And getting your nervous and endocrine
systems to work together in times of crisis is where the hypothalamus comes in. It’s the hub of where the two systems meet
-- it keeps tabs on what’s going on all over your body, analyzing your blood for signs
that something might be off. So, let’s revisit our fight-or-flight scene from a few
lessons ago -- the old Burning House Scenario. So you’re sleeping, dreaming about petting pandas with
Emma Watson or whatever, when the smoke alarm goes off. Well, action potentials in your brain trigger
neurons in your hypothalamus to release the peptide hormone CRH, or corticotropin releasing hormone. The CRH makes the very short trip through
the bloodstream to the anterior pituitary gland, where, because it’s water soluble, it
binds to receptors on the outside of its target cells. There, it triggers the release of adrenocorticotropic
hormone, or ACTH. The ACTH travels -- again through the bloodstream -- to the adrenal cortices
of the adrenal glands on top of your kidneys. When the ACTH binds to receptors on cells
in an adrenal cortex, it triggers the release of a frenzy of different freak-out compounds known
as glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid hormones. Typically these guys help us deal with day-to-day stress
by keeping our blood sugar and blood pressure balanced. But under major stress -- like waking up
in a burning building stress -- these hormones, like cortisol, cause the classic fight-or-flight
response: ramping up your blood pressure, dumping glucose into your bloodstream, shutting
down non-emergency services like your immune system and sperm and egg development. And guess what? Now that all these stress
hormones are pulsing through your blood, the hypothalamus back in the brain senses them. And because its job is to monitor and maintain
balance whenever possible, it then stops secreting CRH, which -- eventually -- causes the other
glands to stop secreting their panic hormones. Now, because this element of the stress response
is hormonal rather than electrical, it comes on more slowly than the nervous system part,
and it takes longer to subside, too, as those stress hormones linger in the blood before
being broken down by enzymes. So. We’re a long way from teenage crushes and zits
and crying over commercials at this point, aren’t we? As a life-long owner of hormones, I hope you’ll
join me in dispelling the stereotypes that surround these powerful and important chemicals,
and give them the respect they rightly deserve. Today we looked at the endocrine system, and
how it uses glands to produce hormones. These hormones are either amino-acid based and water
soluble, or steroidal and lipid-soluble, and may target many types of cells or just turn
on specific ones. We also touched on hormone cascades, and how the HPA axis effects your
stress response. Thank you to our Headmaster of Learning, Thomas

**Transcript**:
It's not hard to imagine a world
where at any given moment, you and everyone you know could be
wiped out without warning at the push of a button. This was the reality for millions
of people during the 45-year period after World War II, now known as the Cold War. As the United States and Soviet Union
faced off across the globe, each knew that the other had nuclear
weapons capable of destroying it. And destruction never loomed closer
than during the 13 days of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1961, the U.S. unsuccessfully tried to
overthrow Cuba's new communist government. That failed attempt was known
as the Bay of Pigs, and it convinced Cuba to seek help
from the U.S.S.R. Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev
was happy to comply by secretly deploying nuclear
missiles to Cuba, not only to protect the island, but to counteract the threat from
U.S. missiles in Italy and Turkey. By the time U.S. intelligence 
discovered the plan, the materials to create the missiles
were already in place. At an emergency meeting on
October 16, 1962, military advisors urged an airstrike
on missile sites and invasion of the island. But President John F. Kennedy chose
a more careful approach. On October 22, he announced that the
the U.S. Navy would intercept all shipments to Cuba. There was just one problem: a naval blockade was considered
an act of war. Although the President called it
a quarantine that did not block basic necessities, the Soviets didn't appreciate 
the distinction. In an outraged letter to Kennedy, Khrushchev wrote, "The violation 
of freedom to use international waters and international airspace
is an act of aggression which pushes mankind toward the abyss
of world nuclear missile war." Thus ensued the most intense
six days of the Cold War. While the U.S. demanded the removal
of the missiles, Cuba and the U.S.S.R insisted
they were only defensive. And as the weapons continued
to be armed, the U.S. prepared for a possible invasion. On October 27, a spy plane piloted
by Major Rudolph Anderson was shot down by a Soviet missile. The same day, a nuclear-armed Soviet
submarine was hit by a small-depth charge from a U.S. Navy vessel trying
to signal it to come up. The commanders on the sub,
too deep to communicate with the surface, thought war had begun
and prepared to launch a nuclear torpedo. That decision had to be made unanimously
by three officers. The captain and political officer
both authorized the launch, but Vasili Arkhipov, 
second in command, refused. His decision saved the day
and perhaps the world. But the crisis wasn't over. For the first time in history, the U.S. Military set itself
to DEFCON 2, the defense readiness one step
away from nuclear war. With hundreds of nuclear missiles
ready to launch, the metaphorical Doomsday Clock
stood at one minute to midnight. But diplomacy carried on. In Washington, D.C., Attorney General
Robert Kennedy secretly met with Soviet Ambassador
Anatoly Dobrynin. After intense negotiation,
they reached the following proposal. The U.S. would remove their missiles
from Turkey and Italy and promise to never invade Cuba in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal
from Cuba under U.N. inspection. Once the meeting had concluded, Dobrynin cabled Moscow saying 
time is of the essence and we shouldn't miss the chance. And at 9 a.m. the next day, a message arrived from Khrushchev announcing the Soviet missiles would be
removed from Cuba. The crisis was now over. While criticized at the time by their
respective governments for bargaining with the enemy, contemporary historical analysis
shows great admiration for Kennedy's and Khrushchev's ability
to diplomatically solve the crisis. But the disturbing lesson was that
a slight communication error, or split-second decision by a commander,
could have thwarted all their efforts, as it nearly did if not for 
Vasili Arkhipov's courageous choice. The Cuban Missile Crisis revealed just how
fragile human politics are compared to the terrifying power
they can unleash.

**Transcript**:
It's not hard to imagine a world
where at any given moment, you and everyone you know could be
wiped out without warning at the push of a button. This was the reality for millions
of people during the 45-year period after World War II, now known as the Cold War. As the United States and Soviet Union
faced off across the globe, each knew that the other had nuclear
weapons capable of destroying it. And destruction never loomed closer
than during the 13 days of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1961, the U.S. unsuccessfully tried to
overthrow Cuba's new communist government. That failed attempt was known
as the Bay of Pigs, and it convinced Cuba to seek help
from the U.S.S.R. Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev
was happy to comply by secretly deploying nuclear
missiles to Cuba, not only to protect the island, but to counteract the threat from
U.S. missiles in Italy and Turkey. By the time U.S. intelligence 
discovered the plan, the materials to create the missiles
were already in place. At an emergency meeting on
October 16, 1962, military advisors urged an airstrike
on missile sites and invasion of the island. But President John F. Kennedy chose
a more careful approach. On October 22, he announced that the
the U.S. Navy would intercept all shipments to Cuba. There was just one problem: a naval blockade was considered
an act of war. Although the President called it
a quarantine that did not block basic necessities, the Soviets didn't appreciate 
the distinction. In an outraged letter to Kennedy, Khrushchev wrote, "The violation 
of freedom to use international waters and international airspace
is an act of aggression which pushes mankind toward the abyss
of world nuclear missile war." Thus ensued the most intense
six days of the Cold War. While the U.S. demanded the removal
of the missiles, Cuba and the U.S.S.R insisted

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever walked into a grocery store and wondered where all those variety
of apples came from? You might find SnapDragon, Pixie Crunch, Cosmic Crisp, Jazz, or Ambrosia next to the more familiar
Red Delicious and Granny Smith. These delightfully descriptive names belong to just a handful of the over
7,500 apple varieties in the world. This huge diversity exists largely because
of humanity's efforts to bear new fruit. Fruit breeding is a way to fulfill
the expectations of farmers and consumers who seek specific qualities in an apple. On the one hand, farmers may want them
to be disease-resistant and to store well. On the other, consumers are swayed
by appearance, taste, and novelty. So, breeders have to consider everything from how well apples grow
in certain climates to their color, taste, and size. And sometimes finding the perfect
fit means breeding something new. To create apples 
with desirable characteristics, breeders first need to find parent
apples that carry those characteristics. Once the parents have been selected, they have to wait until the trees
bloom in the spring. The breeder takes the pollen
from one bloom, called the father, and transfers it by hand to the other
parent bloom, called the mother, through a process 
called cross-pollination. Once the mother bloom 
turns into an apple, the seeds are collected and then planted. It takes about five years for these seeds
to grow into trees that produce apples, but because of the way 
traits are inherited, all of the seedlings produced will have
different sets of genes and characteristics. This means that to achieve 
a desired quality, it takes a lot of offspring, not to mention patience 
on the breeder's part. When a seedling does bear fruit
with the desired qualities, it's selected for further evaluation. Of the original crossed seedlings, about one in every 5,000 makes it
to this prestigious stage. They're then sent to new farms where breeders can assess how various
climates and soil types affect the plant's growth. The fruit of the seedling 
and its many clones must then be collected and sampled
to ensure consistency. Breeders study about 45 traits
in an apple, like the texture 
and firmness of the flesh, when it ripens, how sugary its juice is, and how long it stays fresh. Over several years, they weed out
all the bad apples, selecting only those 
whose fruits are the best. These exclusive plants 
officially form the cultivar, or new apple variety. To ensure an exact copy of this cultivar, all apple trees must be grafted 
from the original seedling. Branches, called scion wood, are cut from the original tree 
and grown to generate more scion wood. Segments of these trees are then grafted
onto root stalk - that's the lower section of another tree that's been chosen 
from a different cultivar for its superior roots 
and growing ability. Finally, this fusion creates 
a new apple tree with the desired qualities. Each new plant takes up to four years before it starts producing 
the fruit we eat. Apple breeding may be a difficult art,
but it's accessible to all: universities, companies, and even individuals can create
new cultivars. But to fully own an apple, the breeder
faces a final challenge - naming the fruit. After a cultivar is patented, a breeder chooses a name
for its trademark. That final step grants them long-lasting
rights over the apple and its clones. That name must be completely original, and the catchier, the better, of course. With over 7,500 varieties and counting, that's why we have apples called
Pink Lady, Sweet Tango, Kiku, and EverCrisp. The more we work with nature's bounty
to breed new cultivars, the more creative and delectable
these names will become.

7,500 apple varieties in the world. This huge diversity exists largely because
of humanity's efforts to bear new fruit. Fruit breeding is a way to fulfill
the expectations of farmers and consumers who seek specific qualities in an apple. On the one hand, farmers may want them
to be disease-resistant and to store well. On the other, consumers are swayed
by appearance, taste, and novelty. So, breeders have to consider everything from how well apples grow
in certain climates to their color, taste, and size. And sometimes finding the perfect
fit means breeding something new. To create apples 
with desirable characteristics, breeders first need to find parent
apples that carry those characteristics. Once the parents have been selected, they have to wait until the trees
bloom in the spring. The breeder takes the pollen
from one bloom, called the father, and transfers it by hand to the other
parent bloom, called the mother, through a process 
called cross-pollination. Once the mother bloom 
turns into an apple, the seeds are collected and then planted. It takes about five years for these seeds
to grow into trees that produce apples, but because of the way 
traits are inherited, all of the seedlings produced will have
different sets of genes and characteristics. This means that to achieve 
a desired quality, it takes a lot of offspring, not to mention patience 
on the breeder's part. When a seedling does bear fruit
with the desired qualities, it's selected for further evaluation. Of the original crossed seedlings, about one in every 5,000 makes it
to this prestigious stage. They're then sent to new farms where breeders can assess how various
climates and soil types affect the plant's growth. The fruit of the seedling 
and its many clones must then be collected and sampled
to ensure consistency. Breeders study about 45 traits
in an apple, like the texture 
and firmness of the flesh, when it ripens, how sugary its juice is, and how long it stays fresh. Over several years, they weed out
all the bad apples, selecting only those 
whose fruits are the best. These exclusive plants 
officially form the cultivar, or new apple variety. To ensure an exact copy of this cultivar, all apple trees must be grafted 
from the original seedling. Branches, called scion wood, are cut from the original tree 
and grown to generate more scion wood. Segments of these trees are then grafted
onto root stalk - that's the lower section of another tree that's been chosen 
from a different cultivar for its superior roots 
and growing ability. Finally, this fusion creates 
a new apple tree with the desired qualities. Each new plant takes up to four years before it starts producing 
the fruit we eat. Apple breeding may be a difficult art,
but it's accessible to all: universities, companies, and even individuals can create
new cultivars. But to fully own an apple, the breeder
faces a final challenge - naming the fruit. After a cultivar is patented, a breeder chooses a name
for its trademark. That final step grants them long-lasting
rights over the apple and its clones. That name must be completely original, and the catchier, the better, of course. With over 7,500 varieties and counting, that's why we have apples called
Pink Lady, Sweet Tango, Kiku, and EverCrisp. The more we work with nature's bounty
to breed new cultivars, the more creative and delectable
these names will become.

**Transcript**:
- So the other group of ants
[Dr. Corrie Moreau, curator/ants] that we have today are bullet ants. 
[Dr. Corrie Moreau, curator/ants] - Why are they called bullet ants?
[Bullet ant, Paraponera clavata] - Well, they're called bullet ants
[Bullet ant, Paraponera clavata] because their sting is so painful
[* causing excruciating pain, numbness & trembling] it feels like you were shot by a gun.
[* causing excruciating pain, numbness & trembling] - And you've experienced
this firsthand? - I have, just once, I'd like
to keep it that way. And so you can see they're
actually quite tremendous ants, I mean, they're really foreboding,
[* worker bullet ants are 18–30 mm long] they're crazy big and they're cool.
[* worker bullet ants are 18–30 mm long] - Are they the largest ant? - They're one of the largest ants. There's another genus called Dinoponera.
[Dinoponera, Dinoponera australis] In some ways larger.
[* females may surpass 30–40 mm in length] Not as painful of a sting, though.
[* females may surpass 30–40 mm in length] This is Paraponera.
[Bullet ant, Paraponera clavata] We're studying the gut bacteria
actually in this group of ants. But we're also
interested in the venom. And so what I was telling
you is part of the reason I brought them back
alive is that at one point I had tried to milk them, because
my colleague was like, "It's because we weren't sure if
we'd have permits to bring back alive." - Yeah.
- You can just milk them. So I can show you how
I attempted to do it and I will tell you that it
didn't work in the end. When I got the venom back
it was actually not usable. But let me grab my equipment. - It's not every day you get to
milk a venomous ant. At work. - So this is our fancy equipment. So if you think about, like, how they milk the venom
from spiders, right? Usually they just have
them bite something and squirt the venom inside
and it's the same principle. So again, we just have
our empty tubes, and we have a little
bit of parafilm, right, which is essentially just like
a waxy kind of paper-y thing that we can stretch
across the top of this. And we're going to get them
to try to sting through the tube and deposit their venom
on the side of the tube. - Wow.
- Yeah. One thing I have noticed is, what's really interesting
actually, is with these bullet ants, when you collect them in the
wild they're incredibly aggressive. You disturb them at all, and they
just go into immediate attack mode. In fact in the field, if you
even like blow on them, you can physically
hear them stridulate, which is a way of communicating
between individuals. And now that they've been
in the lab for just a few days, they're actually almost docile. And so I'm curious to see whether
they'll even sting through this. But we'll try. Yeah, see, this one stridulates. So now let's see if we
put her abdomen up, yeah, she is depositing
her sting through. - Oh!
- See that? - Sting it! Sting it! - So you see, she's got her sting out, this is where I don't want
to lose control of her. She'll try to sting through, oh, there, you saw that sting go? That's huge. 
- Yeah. Wow. Focus your anger. - We will try to get another one to sting 
- Come on, ladies. - You look like a new victim,
raaah, let's get her all mad. - Yeaaaah! Oh, she's stridulating. - She's actually kinda not
mad as much anymore. - They're—they're just
like, they're like, "Corrie, we wanna hang out,
I thought we were cool." - I know, that's probably
exactly what they think. - Like, "Come on, Corrie," "I read your latest paper about
climactic regional distribution" "of my sister species." I don't even know if that's
what you've written about, I don't even know if that—
those words even make sense. - You don't read all my
scientific publications? - Um, I probably couldn't
get through the abstract. Not—not just yours, but most. - I won't take it personally. Oh, yeah, she's got a very big sting,
so let's see if I can get her to— - Yeah. Sting it. - So that's how you milk a
bullet ant for their venom. So essentially, just getting them
to sting through this material, they have now
deposited their venom all over the top of this
and inside of that tube, so I can just shove
that in there and then take it back
to an analytical lab to look at what are the—what's
the chemistry within the venom. Now, I've already told you that
that didn't work so successfully, so in a sense, what we need to do
is dissect out the venom glad, and that's where it
gets a little more tricky, because in this case, you
can see they're big and— - Cranky. - Cranky. And they
don't like to hold still. Do this under the microscope. Okay, so now, again, we're
gonna just pull off her abdomen, oh God, these are some tough ants.
[* abdomen] Even tougher than the bullet ants.
- Wow. - So now we've got—
- You did it. - —her body separated
from her abdomen. I wanna just tease apart some
of the parts of the abdomen and then we can usually pull the
venom gland out through the sting. So I'm just gonna start
pulling apart the body, and since I don't want to
rupture the venom gland, I wanna try not to stab too much. - Yeah, this is meticulous work, dissecting ants. 
- Yeah. - What is the smallest ant that
you'll work on under a microscope? - Oh, I'll work on anyone. - Even the ones
that are so small that you can't even see
them on the labels? - Yep, even those. I've had to
dissect out their guts, too. - How do you even get
forceps that small? - Suspense, right? 
- Yeah, the pressure. - Yeah, nothing like having
to dissect on camera, too. As if it's not hard enough, right? - Yeah, all the viewers are
at home, quietly judging you. They're like, "Well, when
I dissected ants last—" - I was thinking they were biting
their fingernails in suspense. - Yeah, that too. - So at the one end, let's see if I can put it
in a good orientation— you can actually
see the left side, if you look through
the microscope, you can actually see the sting hanging all the way out.
[* sting] - Oh yeah!
- It's like a giant hypodermic needle. - Yeah. - And then starting at the
other end on the right side, we can actually start to see
those parts of the digestive system. So first you have the crop, right?
[* crop] So it's that social food sharing organ,
which then transitions into the mid gut and then into what's called the ileum
[* mid gut, * ileum] and then finally into the rectum,
[* rectum] and then alongside that is where the venom gland sits.
[* venom gland] - That's amazing.
- Yeah, it's really awesome. One of the things that's cool
when you first open them up is that the contents within the gut, you can see fat and
you can see the trachea and all those other things,
and even within the gut, it's either clear like it
almost looks like water, or sometimes you can see
things that look like waste, but within the venom sac,
it's actually almost like oil. And so when you burst it,
it's literally like oil coming out, not like liquid, like, you
know, in the same sense. - Cool.
- Yeah. - Nice.
- So now the question is, are you gonna hold
a bullet ant for 10 seconds? The Brain Scoop is brought to you by the Field Museum in Chicago It still has brains on it.

- It's like a giant hypodermic needle. - Yeah. - And then starting at the
other end on the right side, we can actually start to see
those parts of the digestive system. So first you have the crop, right?
[* crop] So it's that social food sharing organ,
which then transitions into the mid gut and then into what's called the ileum
[* mid gut, * ileum] and then finally into the rectum,
[* rectum] and then alongside that is where the venom gland sits.
[* venom gland] - That's amazing.
- Yeah, it's really awesome. One of the things that's cool
when you first open them up is that the contents within the gut, you can see fat and
you can see the trachea and all those other things,
and even within the gut, it's either clear like it
almost looks like water, or sometimes you can see
things that look like waste, but within the venom sac,
it's actually almost like oil. And so when you burst it,
it's literally like oil coming out, not like liquid, like, you
know, in the same sense. - Cool.
- Yeah. - Nice.
- So now the question is, are you gonna hold
a bullet ant for 10 seconds? The Brain Scoop is brought to you by the Field Museum in Chicago It still has brains on it.

**Transcript**:
In most of the world, this is a strange sight. It’s a TV commercial for a prescription drug. These ads are illegal in most countries. but in the US, they’re everywhere. On average, 80 of them air every hour on American television. "Ask your doctor." "...my doctor told me..." "Ask your doctor." The American Medical Association, a major group of doctors, has called for a ban on these direct-to-consumer ads. But there’s a case to be made for them too. So today we’ll take a look at both sides. First, a little background. Before the 1980s, prescription drug commercials were unheard of in the US. Drug companies focused their marketing solely on doctors, and they didn’t want to hurt those relationships. When asked by Congress in 1984, if direct-to-consumer advertising should be allowed, one pharmaceutical executive said: And an executive at Schering-Plough, which is now part of Merck, said: Needless to say, they changed their minds. At the time there was a larger cultural shift
in health care toward empowering patients to make decisions rather than just listening
to their doctors. And advertisements fit with that trend. Drug Ads started appearing in print publications, but there was still another thing keeping them off TV, and that was FDA’s regulations at the
time. They were interpreted as requiring ads to
include all of the information about the drug’s risks and side effects, which simply wasn’t feasible to do in a tv or radio commercial the way it was in
a magazine. There was a bizarre loophole though: The ads didn’t have to mention the drug’s risks, if they also didn’t mention the disease
or condition that the drug was supposed to treat. Here’s what that looked like — in an ad
for Claritin back before it was available over the counter: "It’s time." "It’s time!" "Don’t wait another minute with Claritin." "Claritin." "I’ll ask my doctor!" "It’s time to see your doctor." "Mr. Wilkin, the doctor will see you now." "At last, a clear day is here." Confused? Yeah, everyone was. So in 1997, the FDA clarified that the industry could run the full drug ads and wouldn’t have to give ALL the risk information from
the label, as long as they included the major side effects and referred viewers to another source for the rest. That’s why the commercials direct us to
phone numbers or print ads. Come for the pharmaceutical fine print — stay for “the secret to crisp contact in soggy conditions” That new FDA guidance removed the main barrier keeping drugs off of television. and you can guess what happened next... spending on ads quadrupled by 2004. And now, we know the names of prescription drugs like we know the names of cars and clothing brands. "Lunesta, Xanax, Celebrex, Flomax, and HGH." "And as of Thursday, Lipitor." "Oh and if you have trouble sleeping, Marla has Ambien. I prefer Lunesta." "Lipitor, Baby Aspirin... Flomax." "Flomax?" "…and some Cialis! I’m just assuming." So that’s how we got here. Drug ads are now the most frequent form of health communication that most Americans see. So what does that mean for public health? Are those prescriptions going to the right
people? Or are they going to people who probably won’t benefit from the drug — people for whom the potential risks outweigh the potential benefits? Well, the answer seems to be: both. A clever experiment in 2005 tested this by
sending actors to real primary care doctors. Dr. Richard Kravitz: We helped them make appointments. In half of the visits, the actors reported
symptoms of depression. In the other half of the visits, the actors
said they were feeling down after becoming unemployed. The study authors called this an “adjustment disorder.” In some visits, the actors mentioned seeing
an advertisement for Paxil on TV, that's an antidepressant. In others, they didn’t bring up medication
at all. And the doctors seemed to take patients more seriously if they mentioned seeing the Paxil commercial. They were more likely to refer patients to
a mental health consultation, And much more likely to prescribe an antidepressant. That may be a good thing for those with major depression, who might benefit from an medication. But it’s more questionable for those with
a more temporary condition. This study, and others, have shown that doctors can be persuaded to broaden the scope of who gets treated with drugs. And advertisements often seem designed to encourage that. Take Androgel — it was approved to treat men with hypogonadism: that’s extremely low testosterone levels due to injury or disease. But here’s how it was promoted by Abbott:
"Millions of men 45 and older just don’t feel like they used to. Are you one of them? Remember when you had more energy for 18 holes with your buddies? More passion for the one you love." Some middle aged men don’t feel like they
used to? You don’t say. A study looking back at 10 years of testosterone prescriptions found that only half had been diagnosed with hypogonadism in the previous year. Drug ads give the industry an incentive to
make healthy people feel unhealthy. “Latisse is the only FDA approved prescription treatment for inadequate, or not enough lashes.” And they contribute to unrealistic expectations about what pharmaceuticals can do. So what’s wrong with that? Well, every single drug comes with risks. Big ad campaigns are usually for newer drugs, for which not all the risks may be known yet. In the case of the painkiller Vioxx, a massive ad campaign led millions of people with arthritis to switch to Vioxx instead of sticking with
older drugs like Ibuprofen. “It’s a beautiful morning…ask your doctor
today about Vioxx, and find out what Vioxx can do for you." Vioxx was more expensive and not actually more effective, and... “The manufacturer of Vioxx have just recently pulled this popular arthritis drug from the market over health concerns." Merck withdrew the drug after it became clear that it increased the risk of heart attacks
and stroke. A Kaiser Permanente study later confirmed
that ad exposure was linked to inappropriate prescribing of Vioxx and a similar drug called Celebrex. So that’s a worst case scenario. But there is also an argument that these ads can be good for public health. Sidney Taurel: “There are many diseases for which people don’t seek treatment. So if you can educate through direct-to-consumer
about the fact that this can be treated, you will get a better outcome for everyone.” In their view, more communication with your doctor is always a good thing. And it’s up to the doctor to make the right
prescribing decisions. Surveys of the public have confirmed that
drug ads prompt people to visit their doctor, in some cases for diabetes, hypertension, depression — these are conditions that are thought to be under treated. In the case of the HPV vaccine, that's now recommended for all pre-teens to prevent cervical and other cancers, Merck’s ad blitz for Gardasil
probably reached more people than a government communications effort could. And whatever you think of erectile dysfunction drugs, they got men to see their doctors and undergo the required heart screening, potentially catching problems not yet treated. But the strongest argument in favor of drug
ads may be the legal one. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of prescription drug advertising back in the 1970s, when the state of Virginia tried to prohibit pharmacists from advertising their prices. Harry Blackmun: “We further hold that so called commercial speech is not wholly outside the protection of the 1st and 14th amendments. The individual consumer and society in general may have strong interests in the free flow of commercial information.” It was the first time that the Court said
advertisements were entitled to free speech protections. There was only one dissenting Justice at the time: William Rehnquist — who Ronald Reagan would later appoint Chief Justice —
In his dissent, Rehnquist wrote a kind of uncanny prediction of the type of commercials that would come decades later: "Don't spend another sleepless night. Ask your doctor to prescribe Seconal without delay." Rehnquist worried that ads would “generate patient pressure on physicians to prescribe” drugs; and that they’d end up being “advertised on television.” And as we know now, for better or for worse, that’s exactly what happened.

**Transcript**:
Language is an essential part of our lives
that we often take for granted. With it, we can communicate our thoughts
and feelings, lose ourselves in novels, send text messages, and greet friends. It's hard to imagine being unable
to turn thoughts into words. But if the delicate web of language
networks in your brain became disrupted by stroke,
illness, or trauma, you could find yourself truly
at a loss for words. This disorder, called aphasia,
can impair all aspects of communication. People who have aphasia remain
as intelligent as ever. They know what they want to say, but can't always get their words
to come out correctly. They may unintentionally use
substitutions called paraphasias, switching related words,
like saying "dog" for "cat," or words that sound similar,
such as "house" for "horse." Sometimes, their words may even be
unrecognizable. There are several types of aphasia
grouped into two categories: fluent, or receptive, aphasia and non-fluent, or expressive, aphasia. People with fluent aphasia may have
normal vocal inflection but use words that lack meaning. They have difficulty comprehending
the speech of others and are frequently unable to recognize
their own speech errors. People with non-fluent aphasia,
on the other hand, may have good comprehension but will experience long hesitations
between words and make grammatical errors. We all have that tip-of-the-tongue feeling
from time to time when we can't think of a word, but having aphasia can make it hard
to name simple, everyday objects. Even reading and writing can be difficult
and frustrating. So how does this language loss happen? The human brain has two hemispheres. In most people, the left hemisphere
governs language. We know this because in 1861, the physician Paul Broca studied a patient who lost the ability to use all 
but a single word, "tan." During a postmortem study
of that patient's brain, Broca discovered a large lesion
in the left hemisphere now known as Broca's area. Scientists today believe that Broca's area
is responsible in part for naming objects and coordinating the muscles
involved in speech. Behind Broca's area is Wernicke's area
near the auditory cortex. That's where the brain attaches
meaning to speech sounds. Damage to Wernicke's area impairs the
brain's ability to comprehend language. Aphasia is caused by injury to one or
both of these specialized language areas. Fortunately, there are other areas
of the brain which support these language centers and can assist with communication. Even brain areas that control movement
are connected to language. FMRI studies found that when we hear
action words, like "run" or "dance," parts of the brain responsible
for movement light up as if the body was actually running
or dancing. Our other hemisphere contributes
to language, too, enhancing the rhythm and intonation
of our speech. These non-language areas sometimes
assist people with aphasia when communication is difficult. So how common is aphasia? Approximately 1 million people
in the U.S. alone have it, with an estimated 80,000 new cases
per year. About one-third of stroke survivors
suffer from aphasia making it more prevalent 
than Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis, yet less widely known. There is one rare form of aphasia called
primary progressive aphasia, or PPA, which is not caused by stroke
or brain injury, but is actually a form of dementia in which language loss 
is the first symptom. The goal in treating PPA is to maintain
language function for as long as possible before other symptoms of dementia
eventually occur. However, when aphasia is acquired
from a stroke or brain trauma, language improvement may be achieved
through speech therapy. Our brain's ability to repair itself,
known as brain plasticity, permits areas surrounding
a brain lesion to take over some functions during
the recovery process. Scientists have been conducting
experiments using new forms of technology, which they believe may encourage brain
plasticity in people with aphasia. Meanwhile, many people with aphasia
remain isolated, afraid that others won't understand
them or give them extra time to speak. By offering them the time and flexibility
to communicate in whatever way they can, you can help open the door 
to language again, moving beyond the limitations of aphasia.

**Transcript**:
Language is an essential part of our lives
that we often take for granted. With it, we can communicate our thoughts
and feelings, lose ourselves in novels, send text messages, and greet friends. It's hard to imagine being unable
to turn thoughts into words. But if the delicate web of language
networks in your brain became disrupted by stroke,
illness, or trauma, you could find yourself truly
at a loss for words. This disorder, called aphasia,
can impair all aspects of communication. People who have aphasia remain
as intelligent as ever. They know what they want to say, but can't always get their words
to come out correctly. They may unintentionally use
substitutions called paraphasias, switching related words,
like saying "dog" for "cat," or words that sound similar,
such as "house" for "horse." Sometimes, their words may even be
unrecognizable. There are several types of aphasia
grouped into two categories: fluent, or receptive, aphasia and non-fluent, or expressive, aphasia. People with fluent aphasia may have
normal vocal inflection but use words that lack meaning. They have difficulty comprehending
the speech of others and are frequently unable to recognize
their own speech errors. People with non-fluent aphasia,
on the other hand, may have good comprehension but will experience long hesitations
between words and make grammatical errors. We all have that tip-of-the-tongue feeling
from time to time when we can't think of a word, but having aphasia can make it hard
to name simple, everyday objects. Even reading and writing can be difficult
and frustrating. So how does this language loss happen? The human brain has two hemispheres. In most people, the left hemisphere
governs language. We know this because in 1861, the physician Paul Broca studied a patient who lost the ability to use all 
but a single word, "tan." During a postmortem study
of that patient's brain, Broca discovered a large lesion
in the left hemisphere now known as Broca's area. Scientists today believe that Broca's area
is responsible in part for naming objects and coordinating the muscles
involved in speech. Behind Broca's area is Wernicke's area
near the auditory cortex. That's where the brain attaches
meaning to speech sounds. Damage to Wernicke's area impairs the
brain's ability to comprehend language. Aphasia is caused by injury to one or
both of these specialized language areas. Fortunately, there are other areas
of the brain which support these language centers and can assist with communication. Even brain areas that control movement
are connected to language. FMRI studies found that when we hear
action words, like "run" or "dance," parts of the brain responsible
for movement light up as if the body was actually running
or dancing. Our other hemisphere contributes
to language, too, enhancing the rhythm and intonation
of our speech. These non-language areas sometimes
assist people with aphasia when communication is difficult. So how common is aphasia? Approximately 1 million people
in the U.S. alone have it, with an estimated 80,000 new cases
per year. About one-third of stroke survivors
suffer from aphasia making it more prevalent 
than Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis, yet less widely known. There is one rare form of aphasia called
primary progressive aphasia, or PPA, which is not caused by stroke
or brain injury, but is actually a form of dementia in which language loss 
is the first symptom. The goal in treating PPA is to maintain
language function for as long as possible before other symptoms of dementia
eventually occur. However, when aphasia is acquired
from a stroke or brain trauma, language improvement may be achieved
through speech therapy. Our brain's ability to repair itself,
known as brain plasticity, permits areas surrounding
a brain lesion to take over some functions during
the recovery process. Scientists have been conducting
experiments using new forms of technology, which they believe may encourage brain
plasticity in people with aphasia. Meanwhile, many people with aphasia
remain isolated, afraid that others won't understand
them or give them extra time to speak. By offering them the time and flexibility
to communicate in whatever way they can, you can help open the door 
to language again, moving beyond the limitations of aphasia.

**Transcript**:
Summer is upon us, which means it’s time
to grill up some barbeque and make s’mores around a campfire. But is wood or charcoal better fuel? Fires are a combustion chemical reaction:
you take some fuel, add some heat, and react those molecules with oxygen, then, poof you
have a roaring fire. And it’s an exothermic reaction, meaning
it releases energy in the form of light and heat, the flames you see and feel, and some
other byproducts. Wood and charcoal are a little different chemically,
so charcoal releases more heat energy and less smoke when it burns. Wood is made up of long chains of glucose
molecules, called cellulose, plus some other structural organic compounds. When those compounds are heated to about 250
degrees Celsius, they’ll start to break apart in a process called pyrolysis. These organic molecules break down into simpler
molecular components and release volatile gases, which evaporate easily and are combustible. Water, carbon dioxide, and volatile gases
combine to create smoke. And the gases reacting with oxygen create
lots of heat, which causes even more pyrolysis and combustion reactions, and creates more
flames. If you try to start a fire with damp wood,
or fresh wood that contains a lot of water, heat will boil the liquid water into vapor,
which isn’t a combustible gas. This basically releases energy into the air,
instead of generating more heat. The remaining material from burning wood is
called char or charcoal, which is 70 to 80% pure carbon. And there are some other leftover minerals
which become ashes. Industrial companies can mass produce charcoal
by heating up wood or wood products without much oxygen. This initiates the pyrolysis step, but doesn’t
really cause combustion, since there’s not much oxygen for the volatile gases to react
with. So, from a chemical standpoint, charcoal seems
like the better fuel source, because it’s mostly carbon, burning it releases more heat
energy for a longer period of time, with fewer smoky byproducts. But from an industrial standpoint, there are
also big economic issues that come into play. Industrial factories need massive amounts
of fuel. And since charcoal is a product of wood pyrolysis,
it’s become a big factor toward deforestation in parts of Africa and South America. So policies and research efforts need to be
initiated to conserve these resources, or use them more efficiently. Ultimately, whether you use charcoal for smoke-free
grilling, or wood for a big toasty bonfire, use whatever fuel suits your needs to have
a fun and safe summer! Thanks to Patreon patrons Lauren, Rob Margolis,

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Physicists, air traffic controllers, and video game creators all have at least one thing in common: vectors. What exactly are they,
and why do they matter? To answer,
we first need to understand scalars. A scalar is a quantity with magnitude. It tells us how much 
of something there is. The distance between you and a bench, and the volume and temperature
of the beverage in your cup are all described by scalars. Vector quantities also have a magnitude
plus an extra piece of information, direction. To navigate to your bench, you need to know how far away it is
and in what direction, not just the distance,
but the displacement. What makes vectors special
and useful in all sorts of fields is that they don't change 
based on perspective but remain invariant 
to the coordinate system. What does that mean? Let's say you and a friend 
are moving your tent. You stand on opposite sides
so you're facing in opposite directions. Your friend moves two steps to the right
and three steps forward while you move two steps to the left
and three steps back. But even though it seems 
like you're moving differently, you both end up moving 
the same distance in the same direction following the same vector. No matter which way you face, or what coordinate system you place
over the camp ground, the vector doesn't change. Let's use the familiar 
Cartesian coordinate system with its x and y axes. We call these two directions
our coordinate basis because they're used to describe 
everything we graph. Let's say the tent starts at the origin
and ends up over here at point B. The straight arrow connecting
the two points is the vector from the origin to B. When your friend thinks about
where he has to move, it can be written mathematically
as 2x + 3y, or, like this, which is called an array. Since you're facing the other way, your coordinate basis
points in opposite directions, which we can call x prime
and y prime, and your movement 
can be written like this, or with this array. If we look at the two arrays,
they're clearly not the same, but an array alone doesn't completely
describe a vector. Each needs a basis to give it context, and when we properly assign them, we see that they are in fact
describing the same vector. You can think of elements in the array
as individual letters. Just as a sequence of letters
only becomes a word in the context of a particular language, an array acquires meaning as a vector
when assigned a coordinate basis. And just as different words
in two languages can convey the same idea, different representations from two bases
can describe the same vector. The vector is the essence 
of what's being communicated, regardless of the language 
used to describe it. It turns out that scalars also share
this coordinate invariance property. In fact, all quantities with this property
are members of a group called tensors. Various types of tensors contain different
amounts of information. Does that mean there's something that
can convey more information than vectors? Absolutely. Say you're designing a video game, and you want to realistically model
how water behaves. Even if you have forces acting
in the same direction with the same magnitude, depending on how they're oriented,
you might see waves or whirls. When force, a vector, is combined with
another vector that provides orientation, we have the physical quantity
called stress, which is an example 
of a second order tensor. These tensors are also used outside of
video games for all sorts of purposes, including scientific simulations, car designs, and brain imaging. Scalars, vectors, and the tensor family
present us with a relatively simple way of making sense of complex ideas
and interactions, and as such, they're a prime example of
the elegance, beauty, and fundamental usefulness of mathematics.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Physicists, air traffic controllers, and video game creators all have at least one thing in common: vectors. What exactly are they,
and why do they matter? To answer,
we first need to understand scalars. A scalar is a quantity with magnitude. It tells us how much 
of something there is. The distance between you and a bench, and the volume and temperature
of the beverage in your cup are all described by scalars. Vector quantities also have a magnitude
plus an extra piece of information, direction. To navigate to your bench, you need to know how far away it is
and in what direction, not just the distance,
but the displacement. What makes vectors special
and useful in all sorts of fields is that they don't change 
based on perspective but remain invariant 
to the coordinate system. What does that mean? Let's say you and a friend 
are moving your tent. You stand on opposite sides
so you're facing in opposite directions. Your friend moves two steps to the right
and three steps forward while you move two steps to the left
and three steps back. But even though it seems 
like you're moving differently, you both end up moving 
the same distance in the same direction following the same vector. No matter which way you face, or what coordinate system you place
over the camp ground, the vector doesn't change. Let's use the familiar 
Cartesian coordinate system with its x and y axes. We call these two directions
our coordinate basis because they're used to describe 
everything we graph. Let's say the tent starts at the origin
and ends up over here at point B. The straight arrow connecting
the two points is the vector from the origin to B. When your friend thinks about
where he has to move, it can be written mathematically
as 2x + 3y, or, like this, which is called an array. Since you're facing the other way, your coordinate basis
points in opposite directions, which we can call x prime
and y prime, and your movement 
can be written like this, or with this array. If we look at the two arrays,
they're clearly not the same, but an array alone doesn't completely
describe a vector. Each needs a basis to give it context, and when we properly assign them, we see that they are in fact
describing the same vector. You can think of elements in the array
as individual letters. Just as a sequence of letters
only becomes a word in the context of a particular language, an array acquires meaning as a vector
when assigned a coordinate basis. And just as different words
in two languages can convey the same idea, different representations from two bases
can describe the same vector. The vector is the essence 
of what's being communicated, regardless of the language 
used to describe it. It turns out that scalars also share
this coordinate invariance property. In fact, all quantities with this property
are members of a group called tensors. Various types of tensors contain different
amounts of information. Does that mean there's something that
can convey more information than vectors? Absolutely. Say you're designing a video game, and you want to realistically model
how water behaves. Even if you have forces acting
in the same direction with the same magnitude, depending on how they're oriented,
you might see waves or whirls. When force, a vector, is combined with
another vector that provides orientation, we have the physical quantity
called stress, which is an example 
of a second order tensor. These tensors are also used outside of
video games for all sorts of purposes, including scientific simulations, car designs, and brain imaging. Scalars, vectors, and the tensor family
present us with a relatively simple way of making sense of complex ideas
and interactions, and as such, they're a prime example of
the elegance, beauty, and fundamental usefulness of mathematics.
