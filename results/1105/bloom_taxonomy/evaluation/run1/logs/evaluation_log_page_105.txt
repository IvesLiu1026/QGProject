**Transcript**:
[Music] this crew is plugging an old oil well it no longer has an owner and it was never properly sealed so for decades it's been sitting here pumping out environmental toxins unchecked this is what's called an orphan well you can actually smell the methane gas and some of the stuff it leaks out can poison us benzene or xylene we know they're carcinogenic across america there are an estimated 1 million orphan oil and gas wells that's like having an extra two and a half million cars on the road every year plugging them would stop any leaks and could help in our fight against rising methane levels this is some low hanging fruit there's no other ways to abate these emissions other than to plug these wells but the problem is we don't always know where they are we didn't pull whales all over nine times my team we're pulling them in the field surrounded by cows horses they've been discovered under houses and schools and even in people's front yards this has really been everyone's dirty little secret so who's responsible for cleaning up this mess and who's actually doing it [Music] nowadays when companies are done with a well they're required by law to plug it essentially fill it with cement before abandoning it but americans have been drilling for oil for over 150 years before there were any regulations of any kind so many early operators before 1950 would simply fill the holes with sand cannon balls or trash throwing down telephone poles rags trash whatever just to jam it up curtis shuck is a retired oil exec for the last three years he's been plugging wells across the country with his non-profit the well done foundation we joined him on a well hunt in louisiana here he found an orphaned one right next to the bayou if you didn't know what you were looking for it'd be easy to miss look at this crazy beautiful ecosystem that is right next to this you know this legacy well here this water inundates this whole area this goes under water and because the the casing integrity has been compromised it starts to bubble gas up around it today it's harder for a well to become orphaned but it still happens especially when there are downturns in the oil industry usually it's because operators have gone bankrupt so there's no responsible party left to plug the well so they fall to the state they become a ward of the state similar to an orphan child and states often don't have the funds to keep plugging them all i just couldn't believe my eyes that you know in any universe it would be okay to leave something like that behind to walk away to plug these wells curtis hires local guys that work in the oil industry and they use the same gear to plug wells as they do to drill them this truck right here is made for fixed whales next time i tell you you're gonna have to add a water truck a cement truck and a rig his team's plugging 75 wells in louisiana over the next few years like this one in cattle parish it's typically a two-day process beginning with the tubing that runs the depth of the well [Music] we're watching the whale and what that means we got to get out of the pipe shop you get all everything out the well and you put cement and water down in there dining well to kind of freeze it up this well is about 4 000 feet deep [Music] so terrance and his crew will spend most of the day pulling out and stacking pipe usually the pipes won't go to waste some of them will get sold if not they'll get recycled the next day the crew returns to plug the well first they have to flush down high pressure water to clean out the hole then they add cement they stop out of oil and stop from putting another whale there we've got cement to the surface the methane emissions have been stopped they cut the well off three feet below the surface we'll weld the monument cap on the top and then we'll restore the surface area like we were never even here [Music] but plugging is expensive if you don't have the money to plug it on your own you better learn to like looking at it it can start at thirty thousand dollars and go up to as much as a million per well depending on the geology landowner hunter lawler planned to foot the bill himself until curtis adopted this well well done pays for its plugins with donations and carbon credits because you really wouldn't want an orphan well anywhere near where you live they can contaminate groundwater and leak oil and salt which create environmental dead zones there have been wells that have buildings built around them and there have been explosions the methane wells leak out is not only 84 times more potent than co2 it's also flammable two dozen people were injured in 1985 when a ross dress for lestor blew up in la it was sitting on an abandoned well leaking methane smaller explosions have also happened in nearby marina del rey colorado and pennsylvania wells can also leak out carcinogenic or even deadly gases around 9 million people live within a mile of one of these wells in the u.s a well that's properly plugged will stop leaking methane except we don't know where to find all these orphan wells so they could be releasing all this bad stuff and no one would know sometimes all that marks a century-old wellbore is a tiny pipe or well casing which nature can swallow up over time to start trying to locate them all adam and mary use state data to develop this map so far they've recorded 81 000 documented wells and identified hot spots in the south appalachia and california but that just scratches the surface there's probably hundreds of thousands of undocumented orphan wells that we just don't know where they are we don't have records curtis and his team have focused on louisiana since 2021 this has been a huge part of this economy little wells and people's front yards [Music] he first starts in state databases to get a general location of a well oftentimes the coordinates of a well or not you know they're very approximate it's a ground game probably walk about you know anywhere from five to ten miles a day that's what he calls wildcatting then he has to determine if the well is a super emitter emitting more than 22 pounds of methane an hour that's the case with one he found in the woods behind someone's house [Music] this well is particularly bad [Applause] you can actually hear the methane coming out yeah isn't that crazy what it's telling you is that it's it's over the exposure level and on this camera you can see the methane but the man living on the property had no idea it was here all right sir oh we're working on this orphan well here have you seen this one before i didn't know that was there here come and check this one out check this out can you hear that oh yeah yeah curtis adopted this well and will plug it just like he did with the one up the road but even after it's been properly closed there's no guarantee a well will stay that way across the country in california earthquakes can reopen plugged wells wells that are drilled through faults are going to be impossible to permanently seal ira leafer runs bubbleology a company that measures air pollution to hunt down the biggest leaks he installed a bunch of air monitoring instruments on his truck sister two it has a greenhouse gas analyzer ozone nitrogen oxides we have one gps directly at this point if you don't know where you are you really don't know anything that's both philosophically true as well as scientifically this gives a picture of the atmosphere above us as we drive ira says his monitors are so sensitive we're able to see really small plumes even miles distant as he drives around he picks up plumes from abandoned wells throughout southern california like under homes in fancy la brea or here in kern river right now we're once again in areas of active oil production on all sides we see elevated methane when his instruments pick up a plume he pulls over and takes an air sample [Music] when we're ready to collect the sample we crack this here just a little bit it's not filling too fast so today on our pass we saw 14 ppm methane that actually is one of the highest values that we've seen on land ira then passes his findings to colleagues at california government agencies so what is the government doing about it all well for the most part it's left to the states to deal with a problem most states launched plugging programs in the 80s and 90s and have since steal thousands of wells but those programs have barely made a dent pennsylvania alone still has an estimated 200 000 unplugged orphan wells states were were woefully underfunded to address this project so in 2021 senator ben ray lujan from new mexico and senator kevin kramer from north dakota introduced the regrow act to address this problem on a federal level it passed with the infrastructure bill signed by president biden the same year an earmarked 4.7 billion dollars for well pluggings you're going to see funding go to the states where we know that there's probably the most oil and gas wells across the country the money will also get distributed to the department of interior to plug wells on federal lands an allocation specific to orphaned and abandoned oil and gas wells on tribal communities in pueblos even if it all goes perfectly though the act will only address documented wells and that's less than a fifth of the orphan wells that might be out there it's a tiny down payment on bringing our infrastructure to where it should have been 10 years ago i'm not saying it's not enough um but it's not enough in the last seven years hundreds of oil and gas producers have declared bankruptcy so as these companies struggle more oil and gas wells will go idle and as we wean off gas and oil for more renewable energy millions of wells are going to be abandoned in the next couple years so this is a serious problem one solution is to get the oil and gas industry to front more of the bill so that the cost doesn't have to be borne by the taxpayer but ira says we can't put all the blame on drillers the reality is we want to live a life where we don't shiver all winter to live in a place where we can move around with cars and airplanes [Music] this all requires petroleum so while we're still dependent on oil curtis and his team will keep plugging away one well at a time we keep getting further and further behind it's time to stop talking it's time to roll up our sleeves and get to work you

one before i didn't know that was there here come and check this one out check this out can you hear that oh yeah yeah curtis adopted this well and will plug it just like he did with the one up the road but even after it's been properly closed there's no guarantee a well will stay that way across the country in california earthquakes can reopen plugged wells wells that are drilled through faults are going to be impossible to permanently seal ira leafer runs bubbleology a company that measures air pollution to hunt down the biggest leaks he installed a bunch of air monitoring instruments on his truck sister two it has a greenhouse gas analyzer ozone nitrogen oxides we have one gps directly at this point if you don't know where you are you really don't know anything that's both philosophically true as well as scientifically this gives a picture of the atmosphere above us as we drive ira says his monitors are so sensitive we're able to see really small plumes even miles distant as he drives around he picks up plumes from abandoned wells throughout southern california like under homes in fancy la brea or here in kern river right now we're once again in areas of active oil production on all sides we see elevated methane when his instruments pick up a plume he pulls over and takes an air sample [Music] when we're ready to collect the sample we crack this here just a little bit it's not filling too fast so today on our pass we saw 14 ppm methane that actually is one of the highest values that we've seen on land ira then passes his findings to colleagues at california government agencies so what is the government doing about it all well for the most part it's left to the states to deal with a problem most states launched plugging programs in the 80s and 90s and have since steal thousands of wells but those programs have barely made a dent pennsylvania alone still has an estimated 200 000 unplugged orphan wells states were were woefully underfunded to address this project so in 2021 senator ben ray lujan from new mexico and senator kevin kramer from north dakota introduced the regrow act to address this problem on a federal level it passed with the infrastructure bill signed by president biden the same year an earmarked 4.7 billion dollars for well pluggings you're going to see funding go to the states where we know that there's probably the most oil and gas wells across the country the money will also get distributed to the department of interior to plug wells on federal lands an allocation specific to orphaned and abandoned oil and gas wells on tribal communities in pueblos even if it all goes perfectly though the act will only address documented wells and that's less than a fifth of the orphan wells that might be out there it's a tiny down payment on bringing our infrastructure to where it should have been 10 years ago i'm not saying it's not enough um but it's not enough in the last seven years hundreds of oil and gas producers have declared bankruptcy so as these companies struggle more oil and gas wells will go idle and as we wean off gas and oil for more renewable energy millions of wells are going to be abandoned in the next couple years so this is a serious problem one solution is to get the oil and gas industry to front more of the bill so that the cost doesn't have to be borne by the taxpayer but ira says we can't put all the blame on drillers the reality is we want to live a life where we don't shiver all winter to live in a place where we can move around with cars and airplanes [Music] this all requires petroleum so while we're still dependent on oil curtis and his team will keep plugging away one well at a time we keep getting further and further behind it's time to stop talking it's time to roll up our sleeves and get to work you

**Transcript**:
[Music] this crew is plugging an old oil well it no longer has an owner and it was never properly sealed so for decades it's been sitting here pumping out environmental toxins unchecked this is what's called an orphan well you can actually smell the methane gas and some of the stuff it leaks out can poison us benzene or xylene we know they're carcinogenic across america there are an estimated 1 million orphan oil and gas wells that's like having an extra two and a half million cars on the road every year plugging them would stop any leaks and could help in our fight against rising methane levels this is some low hanging fruit there's no other ways to abate these emissions other than to plug these wells but the problem is we don't always know where they are we didn't pull whales all over nine times my team we're pulling them in the field surrounded by cows horses they've been discovered under houses and schools and even in people's front yards this has really been everyone's dirty little secret so who's responsible for cleaning up this mess and who's actually doing it [Music] nowadays when companies are done with a well they're required by law to plug it essentially fill it with cement before abandoning it but americans have been drilling for oil for over 150 years before there were any regulations of any kind so many early operators before 1950 would simply fill the holes with sand cannon balls or trash throwing down telephone poles rags trash whatever just to jam it up curtis shuck is a retired oil exec for the last three years he's been plugging wells across the country with his non-profit the well done foundation we joined him on a well hunt in louisiana here he found an orphaned one right next to the bayou if you didn't know what you were looking for it'd be easy to miss look at this crazy beautiful ecosystem that is right next to this you know this legacy well here this water inundates this whole area this goes under water and because the the casing integrity has been compromised it starts to bubble gas up around it today it's harder for a well to become orphaned but it still happens especially when there are downturns in the oil industry usually it's because operators have gone bankrupt so there's no responsible party left to plug the well so they fall to the state they become a ward of the state similar to an orphan child and states often don't have the funds to keep plugging them all i just couldn't believe my eyes that you know in any universe it would be okay to leave something like that behind to walk away to plug these wells curtis hires local guys that work in the oil industry and they use the same gear to plug wells as they do to drill them this truck right here is made for fixed whales next time i tell you you're gonna have to add a water truck a cement truck and a rig his team's plugging 75 wells in louisiana over the next few years like this one in cattle parish it's typically a two-day process beginning with the tubing that runs the depth of the well [Music] we're watching the whale and what that means we got to get out of the pipe shop you get all everything out the well and you put cement and water down in there dining well to kind of freeze it up this well is about 4 000 feet deep [Music] so terrance and his crew will spend most of the day pulling out and stacking pipe usually the pipes won't go to waste some of them will get sold if not they'll get recycled the next day the crew returns to plug the well first they have to flush down high pressure water to clean out the hole then they add cement they stop out of oil and stop from putting another whale there we've got cement to the surface the methane emissions have been stopped they cut the well off three feet below the surface we'll weld the monument cap on the top and then we'll restore the surface area like we were never even here [Music] but plugging is expensive if you don't have the money to plug it on your own you better learn to like looking at it it can start at thirty thousand dollars and go up to as much as a million per well depending on the geology landowner hunter lawler planned to foot the bill himself until curtis adopted this well well done pays for its plugins with donations and carbon credits because you really wouldn't want an orphan well anywhere near where you live they can contaminate groundwater and leak oil and salt which create environmental dead zones there have been wells that have buildings built around them and there have been explosions the methane wells leak out is not only 84 times more potent than co2 it's also flammable two dozen people were injured in 1985 when a ross dress for lestor blew up in la it was sitting on an abandoned well leaking methane smaller explosions have also happened in nearby marina del rey colorado and pennsylvania wells can also leak out carcinogenic or even deadly gases around 9 million people live within a mile of one of these wells in the u.s a well that's properly plugged will stop leaking methane except we don't know where to find all these orphan wells so they could be releasing all this bad stuff and no one would know sometimes all that marks a century-old wellbore is a tiny pipe or well casing which nature can swallow up over time to start trying to locate them all adam and mary use state data to develop this map so far they've recorded 81 000 documented wells and identified hot spots in the south appalachia and california but that just scratches the surface there's probably hundreds of thousands of undocumented orphan wells that we just don't know where they are we don't have records curtis and his team have focused on louisiana since 2021 this has been a huge part of this economy little wells and people's front yards [Music] he first starts in state databases to get a general location of a well oftentimes the coordinates of a well or not you know they're very approximate it's a ground game probably walk about you know anywhere from five to ten miles a day that's what he calls wildcatting then he has to determine if the well is a super emitter emitting more than 22 pounds of methane an hour that's the case with one he found in the woods behind someone's house [Music] this well is particularly bad [Applause] you can actually hear the methane coming out yeah isn't that crazy what it's telling you is that it's it's over the exposure level and on this camera you can see the methane but the man living on the property had no idea it was here all right sir oh we're working on this orphan well here have you seen this

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 6: What is the term for the amount of methane emitted by a well, measured in pounds per hour? Options: A. Methane leakage, B. Methane emission, C. Methane super emitter, D. Methane threshold Correct Option: C**

However, the correct match is not exact, as the question is phrased differently. A more accurate match would be a question that directly asks about the emission rate that classifies a well as a super-emitter.

A more suitable match would be:

**Question: To be considered a super-emitter, an orphan well needs to emit more than ___ pounds of methane per hour.**

Unfortunately, this exact question is not present in the generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose the closest match, I would choose:

**Question 6**

But since it's not an exact match, I will rephrase Question 6 to match the ground truth MCQ:

**Generated Question 6 (rephrased): To be considered a super-emitter, an orphan well needs to emit more than ___ pounds of methane per hour. Options: A. 7, B. 13, C. 22, D. 32 Correct Option: C**

Since this is not among the original generated MCQs, I will not provide an index. However, if you'd like, I can suggest that the original Question 6 be replaced with this rephrased version to provide a more accurate match.

**Transcript**:
[Music] this crew is plugging an old oil well it no longer has an owner and it was never properly sealed so for decades it's been sitting here pumping out environmental toxins unchecked this is what's called an orphan well you can actually smell the methane gas and some of the stuff it leaks out can poison us benzene or xylene we know they're carcinogenic across america there are an estimated 1 million orphan oil and gas wells that's like having an extra two and a half million cars on the road every year plugging them would stop any leaks and could help in our fight against rising methane levels this is some low hanging fruit there's no other ways to abate these emissions other than to plug these wells but the problem is we don't always know where they are we didn't pull whales all over nine times my team we're pulling them in the field surrounded by cows horses they've been discovered under houses and schools and even in people's front yards this has really been everyone's dirty little secret so who's responsible for cleaning up this mess and who's actually doing it [Music] nowadays when companies are done with a well they're required by law to plug it essentially fill it with cement before abandoning it but americans have been drilling for oil for over 150 years before there were any regulations of any kind so many early operators before 1950 would simply fill the holes with sand cannon balls or trash throwing down telephone poles rags trash whatever just to jam it up curtis shuck is a retired oil exec for the last three years he's been plugging wells across the country with his non-profit the well done foundation we joined him on a well hunt in louisiana here he found an orphaned one right next to the bayou if you didn't know what you were looking for it'd be easy to miss look at this crazy beautiful ecosystem that is right next to this you know this legacy well here this water inundates this whole area this goes under water and because the the casing integrity has been compromised it starts to bubble gas up around it today it's harder for a well to become orphaned but it still happens especially when there are downturns in the oil industry usually it's because operators have gone bankrupt so there's no responsible party left to plug the well so they fall to the state they become a ward of the state similar to an orphan child and states often don't have the funds to keep plugging them all i just couldn't believe my eyes that you know in any universe it would be okay to leave something like that behind to walk away to plug these wells curtis hires local guys that work in the oil industry and they use the same gear to plug wells as they do to drill them this truck right here is made for fixed whales next time i tell you you're gonna have to add a water truck a cement truck and a rig his team's plugging 75 wells in louisiana over the next few years like this one in cattle parish it's typically a two-day process beginning with the tubing that runs the depth of the well [Music] we're watching the whale and what that means we got to get out of the pipe shop you get all everything out the well and you put cement and water down in there dining well to kind of freeze it up this well is about 4 000 feet deep [Music] so terrance and his crew will spend most of the day pulling out and stacking pipe usually the pipes won't go to waste some of them will get sold if not they'll get recycled the next day the crew returns to plug the well first they have to flush down high pressure water to clean out the hole then they add cement they stop out of oil and stop from putting another whale there we've got cement to the surface the methane emissions have been stopped they cut the well off three feet below the surface we'll weld the monument cap on the top and then we'll restore the surface area like we were never even here [Music] but plugging is expensive if you don't have the money to plug it on your own you better learn to like looking at it it can start at thirty thousand dollars and go up to as much as a million per well depending on the geology landowner hunter lawler planned to foot the bill himself until curtis adopted this well well done pays for its plugins with donations and carbon credits because you really wouldn't want an orphan well anywhere near where you live they can contaminate groundwater and leak oil and salt which create environmental dead zones there have been wells that have buildings built around them and there have been explosions the methane wells leak out is not only 84 times more potent than co2 it's also flammable two dozen people were injured in 1985 when a ross dress for lestor blew up in la it was sitting on an abandoned well leaking methane smaller explosions have also happened in nearby marina del rey colorado and pennsylvania wells can also leak out carcinogenic or even deadly gases around 9 million people live within a mile of one of these wells in the u.s a well that's properly plugged will stop leaking methane except we don't know where to find all these orphan wells so they could be releasing all this bad stuff and no one would know sometimes all that marks a century-old wellbore is a tiny pipe or well casing which nature can swallow up over time to start trying to locate them all adam and mary use state data to develop this map so far they've recorded 81 000 documented wells and identified hot spots in the south appalachia and california but that just scratches the surface there's probably hundreds of thousands of undocumented orphan wells that we just don't know where they are we don't have records curtis and his team have focused on louisiana since 2021 this has been a huge part of this economy little wells and people's front yards [Music] he first starts in state databases to get a general location of a well oftentimes the coordinates of a well or not you know they're very approximate it's a ground game probably walk about you know anywhere from five to ten miles a day that's what he calls wildcatting then he has to determine if the well is a super emitter emitting more than 22 pounds of methane an hour that's the case with one he found in the woods behind someone's house [Music] this well is particularly bad [Applause] you can actually hear the methane coming out yeah isn't that crazy what it's telling you is that it's it's over the exposure level and on this camera you can see the methane but the man living on the property had no idea it was here all right sir oh we're working on this orphan well here have you seen this one before i didn't know that was there here come and check this one out check this out can you hear that oh yeah yeah curtis adopted this well and will plug it just like he did with the one up the road but even after it's been properly closed there's no guarantee a well will stay that way across the country in california earthquakes can reopen plugged wells wells that are drilled through faults are going to be impossible to permanently seal ira leafer runs bubbleology a company that measures air pollution to hunt down the biggest leaks he installed a bunch of air monitoring instruments on his truck sister two it has a greenhouse gas analyzer ozone nitrogen oxides we have one gps directly at this point if you don't know where you are you really don't know anything that's both philosophically true as well as scientifically this gives a picture of the atmosphere above us as we drive ira says his monitors are so sensitive we're able to see really small plumes even miles distant as he drives around he picks up plumes from abandoned wells throughout southern california like under homes in fancy la brea or here in kern river right now we're once again in areas of active oil production on all sides we see elevated methane when his instruments pick up a plume he pulls over and takes an air sample [Music] when we're ready to collect the sample we crack this here just a little bit it's not filling too fast so today on our pass we saw 14 ppm methane that actually is one of the highest values that we've seen on land ira then passes his findings to colleagues at california government agencies so what is the government doing about it all well for the most part it's left to the states to deal with a problem most states launched plugging programs in the 80s and 90s and have since steal thousands of wells but those programs have barely made a dent pennsylvania alone still has an estimated 200 000 unplugged orphan wells states were were woefully underfunded to address this project so in 2021 senator ben ray lujan from new mexico and senator kevin kramer from north dakota introduced the regrow act to address this problem on a federal level it passed with the infrastructure bill signed by president biden the same year an earmarked 4.7 billion dollars for well pluggings you're going to see funding go to the states where we know that there's probably the most oil and gas wells across the country the money will also get distributed to the department of interior to plug wells on federal lands an allocation specific to orphaned and abandoned oil and gas wells on tribal communities in pueblos even if it all goes perfectly though the act will only address documented wells and that's less than a fifth of the orphan wells that might be out there it's a tiny down payment on bringing our infrastructure to where it should have been 10 years ago i'm not saying it's not enough um but it's not enough in the last seven years hundreds of oil and gas producers have declared bankruptcy so as these companies struggle more oil and gas wells will go idle and as we wean off gas and oil for more renewable energy millions of wells are going to be abandoned in the next couple years so this is a serious problem one solution is to get the oil and gas industry to front more of the bill so that the cost doesn't have to be borne by the taxpayer but ira says we can't put all the blame on drillers the reality is we want to live a life where we don't shiver all winter to live in a place where we can move around with cars and airplanes [Music] this all requires petroleum so while we're still dependent on oil curtis and his team will keep plugging away one well at a time we keep getting further and further behind it's time to stop talking it's time to roll up our sleeves and get to work you

**Transcript**:
[Music] this crew is plugging an old oil well it no longer has an owner and it was never properly sealed so for decades it's been sitting here pumping out environmental toxins unchecked this is what's called an orphan well you can actually smell the methane gas and some of the stuff it leaks out can poison us benzene or xylene we know they're carcinogenic across america there are an estimated 1 million orphan oil and gas wells that's like having an extra two and a half million cars on the road every year plugging them would stop any leaks and could help in our fight against rising methane levels this is some low hanging fruit there's no other ways to abate these emissions other than to plug these wells but the problem is we don't always know where they are we didn't pull whales all over nine times my team we're pulling them in the field surrounded by cows horses they've been discovered under houses and schools and even in people's front yards this has really been everyone's dirty little secret so who's responsible for cleaning up this mess and who's actually doing it [Music] nowadays when companies are done with a well they're required by law to plug it essentially fill it with cement before abandoning it but americans have been drilling for oil for over 150 years before there were any regulations of any kind so many early operators before 1950 would simply fill the holes with sand cannon balls or trash throwing down telephone poles rags trash whatever just to jam it up curtis shuck is a retired oil exec for the last three years he's been plugging wells across the country with his non-profit the well done foundation we joined him on a well hunt in louisiana here he found an orphaned one right next to the bayou if you didn't know what you were looking for it'd be easy to miss look at this crazy beautiful ecosystem that is right next to this you know this legacy well here this water inundates this whole area this goes under water and because the the casing integrity has been compromised it starts to bubble gas up around it today it's harder for a well to become orphaned but it still happens especially when there are downturns in the oil industry usually it's because operators have gone bankrupt so there's no responsible party left to plug the well so they fall to the state they become a ward of the state similar to an orphan child and states often don't have the funds to keep plugging them all i just couldn't believe my eyes that you know in any universe it would be okay to leave something like that behind to walk away to plug these wells curtis hires local guys that work in the oil industry and they use the same gear to plug wells as they do to drill them this truck right here is made for fixed whales next time i tell you you're gonna have to add a water truck a cement truck and a rig his team's plugging 75 wells in louisiana over the next few years like this one in cattle parish it's typically a two-day process beginning with the tubing that runs the depth of the well [Music] we're watching the whale and what that means we got to get out of the pipe shop you get all everything out the well and you put cement and water down in there dining well to kind of freeze it up this well is about 4 000 feet deep [Music] so terrance and his crew will spend most of the day pulling out and stacking pipe usually the pipes won't go to waste some of them will get sold if not they'll get recycled the next day the crew returns to plug the well first they have to flush down high pressure water to clean out the hole then they add cement they stop out of oil and stop from putting another whale there we've got cement to the surface the methane emissions have been stopped they cut the well off three feet below the surface we'll weld the monument cap on the top and then we'll restore the surface area like we were never even here [Music] but plugging is expensive if you don't have the money to plug it on your own you better learn to like looking at it it can start at thirty thousand dollars and go up to as much as a million per well depending on the geology landowner hunter lawler planned to foot the bill himself until curtis adopted this well well done pays for its plugins with donations and carbon credits because you really wouldn't want an orphan well anywhere near where you live they can contaminate groundwater and leak oil and salt which create environmental dead zones there have been wells that have buildings built around them and there have been explosions the methane wells leak out is not only 84 times more potent than co2 it's also flammable two dozen people were injured in 1985 when a ross dress for lestor blew up in la it was sitting on an abandoned well leaking methane smaller explosions have also happened in nearby marina del rey colorado and pennsylvania wells can also leak out carcinogenic or even deadly gases around 9 million people live within a mile of one of these wells in the u.s a well
