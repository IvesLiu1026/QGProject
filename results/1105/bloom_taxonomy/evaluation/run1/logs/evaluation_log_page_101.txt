**Transcript**:
Some superheros can move
faster than the wind. The men in Apollo 10 reached a record-breaking speed of around 25,000 miles per hour when the shuttle re-entered the Earth's atmosphere in 1969. Wouldn't we save a lot of time to be able to move that fast? But what's the catch? Air is not empty. Elements like oxygen and nitrogen, even countless dust particles, make up the air around us. When we move past these things in the air, we're rubbing against them and creating a lot of friction, which results in heat. Just like rubbing your hands
together warms them up or rubbing two sticks together makes fire, the faster objects rub together, the more heat is generated. So, if we're running
at 25,000 miles per hour, the heat from friction
would burn our faces off. Even if we somehow withstood the heat, the sand and dirt in the air would still scrape us up with millions of tiny cuts all happening at the same time. Ever seen the front bumper
or grill of a truck? What do you think all the birds
and bugs would do to your open eyes or exposed skin? Okay, so you'll wear a mask to avoid destroying your face. But what about people in buildings between you and your destination? It takes us approximately
one-fifth of a second to react to what we see. By the time we see what is ahead of us and react to it - time times velocity equals distance equals one-fifth of a second times 25,000 miles per hour equals 1.4 miles - we would have gone past it or through it by over a mile. We're either going to kill ourselves by crashing into the nearest
wall at super speed or, worse, if we're indestructible, we've essentially turned
our bodies into missiles that destroy everything in our path. So, long distance travel
at 25,000 miles per hour would leave us burning up, covered in bugs, and leaves no time to react. What about short bursts to a location we can see with no obstacles in between? Okay, let's say a bullet is about to hit a beautiful
damsel in distress. So, our hero swoops in at super speed, grabs her, and carries her to safety. That sounds very romantic, but, in reality, that girl
will probably suffer more damage from the hero than the bullet if he moved her at super speed. Newton's First Law of Motion
deals with inertia, which is the resistance to a change in its state of motion. So, an object will continue moving or staying at the same place unless something changes it. Acceleration is the rate
the velocity changes over time. When the girl at rest, velocity equals zero miles per hour, begins accelerating to reach
the speed within seconds, velocity increases rapidly to 25,000 miles per hour, her brain would crash
into the side of her skull. And, when she stops suddenly, velocity decreases rapidly
back to zero miles per hour, her brain would crash
into the other side of her skull, turning her brain into mush. The brain is too fragile
to handle the sudden movement. So is every part of her
body, for that matter. Remember, it's not the speed
that causes the damage because the astronauts survived Apollo 10, it's the acceleration or sudden stop that causes our internal organs to crash into the front of our bodies the way we move forward in a bus when the driver slams on the brakes. What the hero did to the girl is mathematically the same
as running her over with a space shuttle at maximum speed. She probably died instantly
at the point of impact. He's going to owe this poor
girl's family an apology and a big fat compensation check. Oh, and possibly face jail time. Doctors have to carry liability insurance just in case they make a mistake
and hurt their patients. I wonder how much superhero
insurance policy would cost. Now, which superpower physics lesson will you explore next? Shifting body size and content, super speed, flight, super strength, immortality, and invisibility.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the components found in the air around us, specifically which one is NOT a common component. The generated MCQs do not directly address this question. However, Question 2 mentions friction generated by air particles, which is related to the components found in the air.

Although not a perfect match, I would suggest Question 2 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it is the only one that mentions air particles, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the options in Question 2 do not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A more relevant generated MCQ that aligns with the intent of the ground truth MCQ is not present among the options.

However, Question 5 has an option that mentions friction, which is related to the ground truth MCQ. But it's not a direct match.

Considering the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which is to identify what friction creates, the closest match would be a question that directly addresses this concept. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the concept of friction, I would choose Question 2, as it mentions friction generated by air particles, which is related to the concept of friction creating heat.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever helped set a table and found yourself wondering where to place the forks? Or sat down to eat a restaurant and wondered which utensils to use? Well, here's some simple,
traditional etiquette tips on how to set a table. What would happen if you
set a table like this? It doesn't look good, and you have to clean up the mess before you can even start. Let's try another way. To start, use a placemat or tablecloth, but not both, so the dishes aren't
directly on the table. This is more about looks than etiquette, but it's rare to see nothing under a plate unless you're eating at a picnic table. Set out any flowers, candlesticks, or other decorations you like. Candles are usually only lit at night. Start with utensils for the main course, putting your dinner fork on the left and your dinner knife
on the right-hand side since these are the hands
we use them with. Here's a helpful tip: You always eat outside-in, so to set for salad, we'll put the salad fork to the outside of the dinner fork and the salad knife
to the outside of the dinner knife. We'll have salad first, then our main course. Notice, too, that the knife blades are both pointed toward the plate. This is an old tradition from a time when dinner
knives were quite sharp, and it was a sign of politeness
and nonaggression to keep them pointed
away from other diners. We might have some soup, and since soup usually comes first, the soup spoon goes outside the knives since we use our right hand to hold it. Here's another tip: Only set the table with what you'll need. If you're not eating soup, don't set a soup spoon. Now, for dessert, we'll have ice cream so we'll place the dessert up top since we don't need it for a little while. Notice that the bowl of the spool is pointing to the left. This way, when it's time to eat, you just slide it down and it's in the right spot. If you were having cake, you'd set a fork and flip it 180 degrees so it would be right side-up
on the left instead. Next we'll anchor
our setting with the plate. You can also serve from the kitchen then bring them to the table. The bread plate goes
up and to the left of the setting, and the butter knife goes
on the plate at an angle, again, with the blade pointing in. There's only one spot left, and that's for the drinks. Set the wine glass to the upper right, and then place the water glass
to the left of it at an angle. If you're like me and can never remember which goes where, think water, wine, w-a, w-i; a, i; they go left to right
in alphabetical order. Another tip: To remember left and right
with the bread and the drinks, think B-M-W like the car. B, your bread plate, is on the left; M, your meal, is in the middle, and W, your water, is on the right. Lastly, the napkin traditionally
goes to the left of the forks, though it's okay to put
it underneath them, too. For a fancier meal like this one that takes up a lot of space, we'll put it in the middle. Now we're ready to eat. Hopefully these tips will be helpful the next time you're asked
to help set the table or sit down at a fancy meal. Enjoy!

Have you ever helped set a table and found yourself wondering where to place the forks? Or sat down to eat a restaurant and wondered which utensils to use? Well, here's some simple,
traditional etiquette tips on how to set a table. What would happen if you
set a table like this? It doesn't look good, and you have to clean up the mess before you can even start. Let's try another way. To start, use a placemat or tablecloth, but not both, so the dishes aren't
directly on the table. This is more about looks than etiquette, but it's rare to see nothing under a plate unless you're eating at a picnic table. Set out any flowers, candlesticks, or other decorations you like. Candles are usually only lit at night. Start with utensils for the main course, putting your dinner fork on the left and your dinner knife
on the right-hand side since these are the hands
we use them with. Here's a helpful tip: You always eat outside-in, so to set for salad, we'll put the salad fork to the outside of the dinner fork and the salad knife
to the outside of the dinner knife. We'll have salad first, then our main course. Notice, too, that the knife blades are both pointed toward the plate. This is an old tradition from a time when dinner
knives were quite sharp, and it was a sign of politeness
and nonaggression to keep them pointed
away from other diners. We might have some soup, and since soup usually comes first, the soup spoon goes outside the knives since we use our right hand to hold it. Here's another tip: Only set the table with what you'll need. If you're not eating soup, don't set a soup spoon.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

This question is about a trick to remember the placement of items on the table, similar to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions mention a mnemonic device to help with table setting (B-M-W in the generated MCQ and the ground truth MCQ). The intent and content of Question 9 align with the ground truth MCQ, making it the most similar generated MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that Question 5 also mentions a trick to remember the placement of glasses, which is similar to the ground truth MCQ. But since the ground truth MCQ specifically asks for another good acronym and Question 9 provides an acronym (B-M-W), it's a better match.

**Transcript**:
Think of all the food made
in the world each year. Hard to picture? Then, imagine that you
are all of humanity, and on a plate in front of you is the one lovely annual
meal you make for yourself. You did all sorts of work putting
that meal on your table. You must be eager to consume
the fruits of your labor. And the vegetables and meats and waffles of your labor, too, right? Well, oddly enough, a third of that meal ends up in the trash. A third of the food we eat globally, an estimated 1.3 billion tons ends up as waste. All the work we put into producing
that food is wasted. And what's worse, it costs us. America alone spends an estimated 165 billion dollars a year managing food waste. We're wasting food, energy, and money. Perhaps worst of all, we're wasting the chance to change, to make the system of food
consumption more efficient. If you want to bring on that change, you should know about a humble yet diligent and ever-so-crucial ally: the worm. Worms convert organic waste and other compostable products
into natural fertilizers. Up to 75% of what we put
in the waste stream can become food and bedding material for vermicomposting. You can create a worm bin in your own home to see the composting process in action. First off, you need worms and not your typical earthworms. You need redworms, eisenia foetida, the species responsible for most vermicomposting in North America. These red wigglers are surface dwellers who don't burrow too deep, they're optimal feeders
around room temperature, and they're well-suited
to converting organic waste into usable fertilizer. Now, your worms might be vermin, but they need a comfortable
space to live and work: some bedding materials, either shredded paper or cardboard, some moisture, and, of course, food, mainly, your leftovers, slightly decomposed table scraps. The worms break down food waste and other organic matter into castings, a fancy synonym for worm poop. Their excrement is absolutely
teeming with microbes, which continue the decomposition process, making all those once-wasted nutrients available again as fertilizer. The timeline for the whole process varies depending on the quantity of worms, the temperature, and how much waste is added to the bin. And there's another timeline to consider. In a healthy worm-bin habitat, worm reproduction will occur when the wigglers become sexually mature, indicated by an elongation of the segments into a bulbous structure. Three-month old wigglers can produce two to three semi-translucent
yellow worm cocoons a week. You thought only moths and butterflies come out of cocoons? Well, we can't all be majestic. It takes around 11 weeks
for new babies to hatch. When your bin seems to be full
of living vermicelli noodles, it's time to share
the bounty with your friends and start a vermicompost club. Or keep those worms to yourself and start a business. Vermicomposting isn't confined only to small worm bins, it's an emerging
entrepreneurial enterprise. Large-scale facilities convert bulk organic waste and even manure into rich, black castings
called black gold. Its value as a soil
additive is unparalleled, and it can help plants
resist harmful pathogens. The lack of available land
in urban environments, coupled with growing interest
in smaller-scale farming means there is a market
for vermicomposting. Many communities use composting as part of zero-waste strategies, and they can sell
their worm-eaten table scraps to local farms, hungry
for rich fertilizer. So, instead of wasting money, dumping wasted food in landfills, we can remake waste into an asset, putting it back into our food system to make it more sustainable, all with the help of the humble worm, the tiny organism that can help us change the way we look
at food's place in our lives and our place in the world, as long as we give the little guy a place at our table. Well, not an actual seat at the table. A bin in the shed is fine.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1: **Knowledge**: What is the estimated amount of food waste produced globally each year? Options: A. 1 billion tons, B. 1.3 billion tons, C. 2 billion tons, D. 3 billion tons Correct Option: B.

Although the ground truth MCQ asks about the ratio of food produced that ends up as waste, and the generated MCQ asks about the estimated amount of food waste produced globally each year, both questions are related to the same topic of food waste. The correct option in the generated MCQ (1.3 billion tons) corresponds to the information provided in the transcript that "a third of the food we eat globally, an estimated 1.3 billion tons ends up as waste." This implies that the ratio of food produced that ends up as waste is 1/3, which is the correct option in the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Think of all the food made
in the world each year. Hard to picture? Then, imagine that you
are all of humanity, and on a plate in front of you is the one lovely annual
meal you make for yourself. You did all sorts of work putting
that meal on your table. You must be eager to consume
the fruits of your labor. And the vegetables and meats and waffles of your labor, too, right? Well, oddly enough, a third of that meal ends up in the trash. A third of the food we eat globally, an estimated 1.3 billion tons ends up as waste. All the work we put into producing
that food is wasted. And what's worse, it costs us. America alone spends an estimated 165 billion dollars a year managing food waste. We're wasting food, energy, and money. Perhaps worst of all, we're wasting the chance to change, to make the system of food
consumption more efficient. If you want to bring on that change, you should know about a humble yet diligent and ever-so-crucial ally: the worm. Worms convert organic waste and other compostable products
into natural fertilizers. Up to 75% of what we put
in the waste stream can become food and bedding material for vermicomposting. You can create a worm bin in your own home to see the composting process in action. First off, you need worms and not your typical earthworms. You need redworms, eisenia foetida, the species responsible for most vermicomposting in North America. These red wigglers are surface dwellers who don't burrow too deep, they're optimal feeders
around room temperature, and they're well-suited
to converting organic waste into usable fertilizer. Now, your worms might be vermin, but they need a comfortable
space to live and work: some bedding materials, either shredded paper or cardboard, some moisture, and, of course, food, mainly, your leftovers, slightly decomposed table scraps. The worms break down food waste and other organic matter into castings, a fancy synonym for worm poop. Their excrement is absolutely
teeming with microbes, which continue the decomposition process, making all those once-wasted nutrients available again as fertilizer. The timeline for the whole process varies depending on the quantity of worms, the temperature, and how much waste is added to the bin. And there's another timeline to consider. In a healthy worm-bin habitat, worm reproduction will occur when the wigglers become sexually mature, indicated by an elongation of the segments into a bulbous structure. Three-month old wigglers can produce two to three semi-translucent
yellow worm cocoons a week. You thought only moths and butterflies come out of cocoons? Well, we can't all be majestic. It takes around 11 weeks
for new babies to hatch. When your bin seems to be full
of living vermicelli noodles, it's time to share
the bounty with your friends and start a vermicompost club. Or keep those worms to yourself and start a business. Vermicomposting isn't confined only to small worm bins, it's an emerging
entrepreneurial enterprise. Large-scale facilities convert bulk organic waste and even manure into rich, black castings
called black gold. Its value as a soil
additive is unparalleled, and it can help plants
resist harmful pathogens. The lack of available land
in urban environments, coupled with growing interest
in smaller-scale farming means there is a market
for vermicomposting. Many communities use composting as part of zero-waste strategies, and they can sell
their worm-eaten table scraps to local farms, hungry
for rich fertilizer. So, instead of wasting money, dumping wasted food in landfills, we can remake waste into an asset, putting it back into our food system to make it more sustainable, all with the help of the humble worm, the tiny organism that can help us change the way we look

**Transcript**:
Think of all the food made
in the world each year. Hard to picture? Then, imagine that you
are all of humanity, and on a plate in front of you is the one lovely annual
meal you make for yourself. You did all sorts of work putting
that meal on your table. You must be eager to consume
the fruits of your labor. And the vegetables and meats and waffles of your labor, too, right? Well, oddly enough, a third of that meal ends up in the trash. A third of the food we eat globally, an estimated 1.3 billion tons ends up as waste. All the work we put into producing
that food is wasted. And what's worse, it costs us. America alone spends an estimated 165 billion dollars a year managing food waste. We're wasting food, energy, and money. Perhaps worst of all, we're wasting the chance to change, to make the system of food
consumption more efficient. If you want to bring on that change, you should know about a humble yet diligent and ever-so-crucial ally: the worm. Worms convert organic waste and other compostable products
into natural fertilizers. Up to 75% of what we put
in the waste stream can become food and bedding material for vermicomposting. You can create a worm bin in your own home to see the composting process in action. First off, you need worms and not your typical earthworms. You need redworms, eisenia foetida, the species responsible for most vermicomposting in North America. These red wigglers are surface dwellers who don't burrow too deep, they're optimal feeders
around room temperature, and they're well-suited
to converting organic waste into usable fertilizer. Now, your worms might be vermin, but they need a comfortable
space to live and work: some bedding materials, either shredded paper or cardboard, some moisture, and, of course, food, mainly, your leftovers, slightly decomposed table scraps. The worms break down food waste and other organic matter into castings, a fancy synonym for worm poop. Their excrement is absolutely
teeming with microbes, which continue the decomposition process, making all those once-wasted nutrients available again as fertilizer. The timeline for the whole process varies depending on the quantity of worms, the temperature, and how much waste is added to the bin. And there's another timeline to consider. In a healthy worm-bin habitat, worm reproduction will occur when the wigglers become sexually mature, indicated by an elongation of the segments into a bulbous structure. Three-month old wigglers can produce two to three semi-translucent
yellow worm cocoons a week. You thought only moths and butterflies come out of cocoons? Well, we can't all be majestic. It takes around 11 weeks
for new babies to hatch. When your bin seems to be full
of living vermicelli noodles, it's time to share
the bounty with your friends and start a vermicompost club. Or keep those worms to yourself and start a business. Vermicomposting isn't confined only to small worm bins, it's an emerging
entrepreneurial enterprise. Large-scale facilities convert bulk organic waste and even manure into rich, black castings
called black gold. Its value as a soil
additive is unparalleled, and it can help plants
resist harmful pathogens. The lack of available land
in urban environments, coupled with growing interest
in smaller-scale farming means there is a market
for vermicomposting. Many communities use composting as part of zero-waste strategies, and they can sell
their worm-eaten table scraps to local farms, hungry
for rich fertilizer. So, instead of wasting money, dumping wasted food in landfills, we can remake waste into an asset, putting it back into our food system to make it more sustainable, all with the help of the humble worm, the tiny organism that can help us change the way we look
at food's place in our lives and our place in the world, as long as we give the little guy a place at our table. Well, not an actual seat at the table. A bin in the shed is fine.

**Transcript**:
What is at the center of the universe? It's an essential question that humans have
been wondering about for centuries. But the journey toward an answer has been a strange one. If you wanted to know
the answer to this question in third century B.C.E. Greece, you might look up at the night sky and trust what you see. That's what Aristotle, THE guy to ask back then, did. He thought that since we're
on Earth, looking up, it must be the center, right? For him, the sphere of the world was made up of four elements: Earth, water, air, and fire. These elements shifted around a nested set of solid crystalline spheres. Each of the wandering stars, the planets, had their own crystal sphere. The rest of the universe
and all of its stars were on the last crystal sphere. If you watch the sky change over time, you could see that this idea worked fine at explaining the motion you saw. For centuries, this
was central to how Europe and the Islamic world saw the universe. But in 1543, a guy named Copernicus proposed a different model. He believed that the sun was at the center of the universe. This radically new idea was hard for a lot of people to accept. After all, Aristotle's ideas made sense with what they could see, and they were pretty flattering to humans. But a series of subsequent discoveries made the sun-centric model hard to ignore. First, Johannes Kepler pointed out that orbits aren't perfect
circles or spheres. Then, Galileo's telescope caught Jupiter's moons orbiting around Jupiter, totally ignoring Earth. And then, Newton proposed the theory
of universal gravitation, demonstrating that all objects
are pulling on each other. Eventually, we had to let go of the idea that we were at the center
of the universe. Shortly after Copernicus, in the 1580s, an Italian friar, Giordano Bruno, suggested the stars were suns that likely had their own planets and that the universe was infinite. This idea didn't go over well. Bruno was burned at the stake
for his radical suggestion. Centuries later,
the philosopher Rene Descartes proposed that the universe
was a series of whirlpools, which he called vortices, and that each star
was at the center of a whirlpool. In time, we realized there
were far more stars than Aristotle ever dreamed. As astronomers like William Herschel got more and more advanced telescopes, it became clear that our sun is actually one of many stars inside the Milky Way. And those smudges we see in the night sky? They're other galaxies, just as vast as our Milky Way home. Maybe we're farther from the center
than we ever realized. In the 1920s, astronomers
studying the nebuli wanted to figure out how they were moving. Based on the Doppler Effect, they expected to see blue shift for objects moving toward us, and red shift for ones moving away. But all they saw was a red shift. Everything was moving away from us, fast. This observation
is one of the pieces of evidence for what we now call the Big Bang Theory. According to this theory, all matter in the universe was once a singular,
infinitely dense particle. In a sense, our piece of the universe was once at the center. But this theory eliminates
the whole idea of a center since there can't be a center
to an infinite universe. The Big Bang wasn't just
an explosion in space; it was an explosion of space. What each new discovery proves is that while our observations
are limited, our ability to speculate and dream of what's out there isn't. What we think we know today
can change tomorrow. As with many of the thinkers we just met, sometimes our wildest guesses lead to wonderful and humbling answers and propel us toward even more
perplexing questions.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

This question is about the observation made by astronomers studying the nebuli in the 1920s that supported the Big Bang Theory, specifically the red shift of objects moving away from us. Although it does not directly ask about the Doppler effect, the content is closely related to the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the Doppler effect. The correct option in Question 4 (B. Red shift for all objects) is also related to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (A. Objects moving toward us shift blue, objects moving away shift red). 

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. But among the given options, Question 4 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
What is at the center of the universe? It's an essential question that humans have
been wondering about for centuries. But the journey toward an answer has been a strange one. If you wanted to know
the answer to this question in third century B.C.E. Greece, you might look up at the night sky and trust what you see. That's what Aristotle, THE guy to ask back then, did. He thought that since we're
on Earth, looking up, it must be the center, right? For him, the sphere of the world was made up of four elements: Earth, water, air, and fire. These elements shifted around a nested set of solid crystalline spheres. Each of the wandering stars, the planets, had their own crystal sphere. The rest of the universe
and all of its stars were on the last crystal sphere. If you watch the sky change over time, you could see that this idea worked fine at explaining the motion you saw. For centuries, this
was central to how Europe and the Islamic world saw the universe. But in 1543, a guy named Copernicus proposed a different model. He believed that the sun was at the center of the universe. This radically new idea was hard for a lot of people to accept. After all, Aristotle's ideas made sense with what they could see, and they were pretty flattering to humans. But a series of subsequent discoveries made the sun-centric model hard to ignore. First, Johannes Kepler pointed out that orbits aren't perfect
circles or spheres. Then, Galileo's telescope caught Jupiter's moons orbiting around Jupiter, totally ignoring Earth. And then, Newton proposed the theory
of universal gravitation, demonstrating that all objects
are pulling on each other. Eventually, we had to let go of the idea that we were at the center
of the universe. Shortly after Copernicus, in the 1580s, an Italian friar, Giordano Bruno, suggested the stars were suns that likely had their own planets and that the universe was infinite. This idea didn't go over well. Bruno was burned at the stake
for his radical suggestion. Centuries later,
the philosopher Rene Descartes proposed that the universe
was a series of whirlpools, which he called vortices, and that each star
was at the center of a whirlpool. In time, we realized there
were far more stars than Aristotle ever dreamed. As astronomers like William Herschel got more and more advanced telescopes, it became clear that our sun is actually one of many stars inside the Milky Way. And those smudges we see in the night sky? They're other galaxies, just as vast as our Milky Way home. Maybe we're farther from the center
than we ever realized. In the 1920s, astronomers
studying the nebuli wanted to figure out how they were moving. Based on the Doppler Effect, they expected to see blue shift for objects moving toward us, and red shift for ones moving away. But all they saw was a red shift. Everything was moving away from us, fast. This observation
is one of the pieces of evidence for what we now call the Big Bang Theory. According to this theory, all matter in the universe was once a singular,
infinitely dense particle. In a sense, our piece of the universe was once at the center. But this theory eliminates
the whole idea of a center since there can't be a center
to an infinite universe. The Big Bang wasn't just
an explosion in space; it was an explosion of space. What each new discovery proves is that while our observations
are limited, our ability to speculate and dream of what's out there isn't. What we think we know today
can change tomorrow. As with many of the thinkers we just met, sometimes our wildest guesses lead to wonderful and humbling answers and propel us toward even more
perplexing questions.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Here's why:

- Question intent: Both the ground truth MCQ and Question 5 are asking about the Aristotelian notion of the universe, specifically what is at the center.
- Options: Although the options are not identical, both questions have options that include the Earth and the Sun, which are the key concepts being tested.
- Content: Both questions are testing the student's understanding of Aristotle's model of the universe, specifically what he believed was at the center.

However, it's worth noting that the ground truth MCQ is asking about a specific feature of the Aristotelian notion of the heavenly spheres (what was NOT a feature), whereas Question 5 is asking about what Aristotle thought was at the center of the universe. 

If I had to choose another question that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, I would choose Question 7, which asks about the main difference between Aristotle's model and the sun-centric model. However, the options and content of Question 7 do not match the ground truth MCQ as closely as Question 5.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 5.

**Transcript**:
Today lots of girls play sports. But, for a long time,
girls were not encouraged to kick, throw, run, jump, shoot, slide, or hit like boys. So, why did things change? And how much have they changed? Are girls and boys treated equally when it comes to sports? To begin to answer these questions, we have to look back. In 1972, Congress passed
a law called Title IX, which protected girls and women from discrimination in schools, colleges, and universities. This included discrimination
in school-sponsored sports. At that time, only 15%
of college athletes were women, and in high schools, only 7% of athletes were girls. Female athletes didn't get
a lot of support either and often had to provide
their own uniforms and equipment. It was Title IX that forced
school administrators to make sports more equal. But what does equal mean in sports? The government developed rules to measure equality
under two general categories: participation and treatment. In the early days of Title IX, the number of girls
playing sports was so low that it would have been very difficult for schools to suddenly provide
exactly the same number of opportunities for girls and boys. Instead, the government wrote rules that gave schools three options, or tests, to demonstrate fairness
in opportunities for girls. The three tests are proportionality, progress, and satisfied interests. A school can pick which test to follow. Proportionality means
that girls should receive the same percentage
of athletic opportunities as the percentage of girls
in the student body. So, if 51% of students are girls, then girls should have approximately 51% of the opportunities to play sports. The second test, progress, requires schools to make up for the days when girls had fewer opportunities by adding new sports for girls
on a regular basis. The third test asks if girls interested in athletics are satisfied. Under this test, a school
must regularly ask female students what sports
they are interested in and also take into consideration
the popularity of certain sports in the area where the school is located. It must, then, add teams according
to the girls' interests. Another important part of Title IX is that it doesn't just look at how many athletic opportunities
are available to each sex but whether those opportunities
are of equal quality. Specifically, Title IX requires equality between boys and girls teams for things like equipment and supplies, publicity, the scheduling of games
and practice times, and the quality and number of coaches. Girls should also have equal access to locker rooms, practice spaces,
and competitive facilities, as well as medical services. So, if the best time to play
basketball is on Friday nights because that's when
most parents and fans can come, then the girls and boys teams should take turns playing on Friday night. If boys teams play
in a stadium with lights, scoreboards, and concession stands, then girls teams must have
the same opportunity, either by sharing those facilities or getting their own of equal quality. But, as we all know, just because a law exists doesn't mean that everybody follows it. School officials are responsible for making sure there
is fairness in sports, but you can help, too, by keeping an eye on your own school. Look around. Are there a lot more boys
than girls who play sports? Is the boys' soccer field
better than the girls'? Are athletic trainers available
to all teams equally? Does the baseball team get
new uniforms every year, while the softball team gets
them every three years? If you think there might be
inequality in your schools, you can approach a school administrator, a parent, or the Office of Civil Rights, a government agency
that makes sure schools comply with Title IX because equality
is important for everyone, both on the field and off.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although Question 4 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks which option is not a measure of equality in the number of athletic opportunities for each sex, while Question 4 asks what the three tests are that a school can follow to demonstrate fairness in opportunities for girls. 

However, by knowing the three tests (progress, proportionality, and satisfied interests), one can infer that any other option not among these three would be the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ. Therefore, Question 4 provides the most relevant information to answer the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Today lots of girls play sports. But, for a long time,
girls were not encouraged to kick, throw, run, jump, shoot, slide, or hit like boys. So, why did things change? And how much have they changed? Are girls and boys treated equally when it comes to sports? To begin to answer these questions, we have to look back. In 1972, Congress passed
a law called Title IX, which protected girls and women from discrimination in schools, colleges, and universities. This included discrimination
in school-sponsored sports. At that time, only 15%
of college athletes were women, and in high schools, only 7% of athletes were girls. Female athletes didn't get
a lot of support either and often had to provide
their own uniforms and equipment. It was Title IX that forced
school administrators to make sports more equal. But what does equal mean in sports? The government developed rules to measure equality
under two general categories: participation and treatment. In the early days of Title IX, the number of girls
playing sports was so low that it would have been very difficult for schools to suddenly provide
exactly the same number of opportunities for girls and boys. Instead, the government wrote rules that gave schools three options, or tests, to demonstrate fairness
in opportunities for girls. The three tests are proportionality, progress, and satisfied interests. A school can pick which test to follow. Proportionality means
that girls should receive the same percentage
of athletic opportunities as the percentage of girls
in the student body. So, if 51% of students are girls, then girls should have approximately 51% of the opportunities to play sports. The second test, progress, requires schools to make up for the days when girls had fewer opportunities by adding new sports for girls
on a regular basis. The third test asks if girls interested in athletics are satisfied. Under this test, a school
must regularly ask female students what sports
they are interested in and also take into consideration
the popularity of certain sports in the area where the school is located. It must, then, add teams according
to the girls' interests. Another important part of Title IX is that it doesn't just look at how many athletic opportunities
are available to each sex but whether those opportunities
are of equal quality. Specifically, Title IX requires equality between boys and girls teams for things like equipment and supplies, publicity, the scheduling of games
and practice times, and the quality and number of coaches. Girls should also have equal access to locker rooms, practice spaces,
and competitive facilities, as well as medical services. So, if the best time to play
basketball is on Friday nights because that's when
most parents and fans can come, then the girls and boys teams should take turns playing on Friday night. If boys teams play
in a stadium with lights, scoreboards, and concession stands, then girls teams must have
the same opportunity, either by sharing those facilities or getting their own of equal quality. But, as we all know, just because a law exists doesn't mean that everybody follows it. School officials are responsible for making sure there
is fairness in sports, but you can help, too, by keeping an eye on your own school. Look around. Are there a lot more boys
than girls who play sports? Is the boys' soccer field
better than the girls'? Are athletic trainers available
to all teams equally? Does the baseball team get
new uniforms every year, while the softball team gets
them every three years? If you think there might be
inequality in your schools, you can approach a school administrator, a parent, or the Office of Civil Rights, a government agency
that makes sure schools comply with Title IX because equality
is important for everyone, both on the field and off.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 7: According to the transcript, what are some examples of equality between boys and girls teams that Title IX requires?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about a situation that might indicate a school is violating Title IX, while Question 7 asks about examples of equality required by Title IX. However, the options in Question 7 provide insight into what is considered equal treatment under Title IX, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about a scenario where a school is not providing equal opportunities or treatment for girls' teams, similar to the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match this intent.

If I had to choose an index, I would say:

**Index: 7**

However, I would like to note that a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about a specific scenario where a school is not providing equal opportunities or treatment for girls' teams, similar to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] when I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old we were playing on top of a bunk bed I was two years older than my sister at the time I'm two years older than her now but at the time that meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do and I wanted to play war so we were up on top of our bunk beds and on one side of the bunk bed I put out all my GI Joe soldiers and weaponry and on the other side were all my sisters Milo's and ponies and ready for a Calvary charge there are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon but since my sister is not here with us today let me tell you the true story which is my sister's a little bit on the clumsy side and somehow without any help or push from her older brother at all suddenly Amy disappeared off the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor and I never sleep eared over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible and seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm just one week before heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet for which I have yet to be thanked I was trying as hard as I could she didn't even see it coming I was trying as hard as I could to be on my best behavior and I saw my sister's faces wail a pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and threatening to wake my parents from the long winters nap for which they had settled so I did the only thing my little frantic seven-year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy if you have children you've seen this hundreds of times before I said Amy Amy wait don't cry don't cry did you see how you landed no human lands on all fours like that Amy I think this means you're a unicorn now that was cheating because there's nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five-year-old little sister but Amy the special unicorn of course this was an option that was open to her brain to no point in the past and you could see on my poor manipulated sister's face conflict as their little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering surprise she just experienced or contemplating her newfound identity as a unicorn and the latter one now instead of crying instead of ceasing our planes of waking my parents with all the negative consequences that would have been sued for me instead of smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn with one broken leg what we stumbled across at this tender age which is five and seven we had no idea at the time was something that was going to be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain what we had stumbled across is something called positive psychology which is the reason that I'm here today and the reason that I wake up every morning when I first started talking about this research outside of academia out with companies in schools the very first thing they said to never do is to start your talk with a graph the very first thing I wanted to do is start my talk with a graph this graph looks boring but this graph is the reason that I get excited and wake up every morning and this graph doesn't even mean anything it's faked out of what we found is if I got this data back studying you here in the room I would be thrilled because there's very clearly a trend that's going on there and that means that I can get published which is all that really matters the fact that there's one weird red dot that's up above the curve there's one weird in the room you know who you are I saw you earlier that's no prom that's no problem as most of you know because I can just delete that dot I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error and we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data so one of the very first things do we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how in a statistically valid way do we eliminate the weirdos how do we eliminate the outliers so that we can find the line of best fit which is fantastic if I'm trying to find out how many advil the average person should be taking too but if I'm interested in potential if I'm interested in your potential or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity what we're doing is we're creating the coal to the average with science if I ask you a question like how fast can the child learn how to read in a classroom scientists change the answer to how fast is the average child learn how to read in that classroom and then we tailor the class right towards the average now if you fall below the average on this curve then psychologists get thrilled because that means you're either depressed or you have a disorder or hopefully both we're hoping for both because our business motto is if you come into a therapy session with one problem we want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10 so you'll keep coming back over and over again we'll go back into your child have necessary but eventually what we want to do is to make you normal again but normal is merely average and what I pause it and what positive psychology posits is if we study what is merely average we will remain merely average then instead of deleting those positive outliers what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and says why why is it the some of you are so high above the curve in terms of your intellectual voting athletic ability musical ability creativity energy levels your resiliency in the face of challenge your sense of humor whatever it is instead of deleting you what I want to do is study you because maybe we can glean information not just how to move people up to the average but how we can move the entire average up that our companies in schools worldwide the reason this graph is important to me is when I turn on the news it seems like the majority of the information is not positive in fact is negative most of us about murder corruption diseases natural disasters and very quickly my brain starts to think that's the accurate ratio of negative positive in the world what that's doing is creating something called the medical school syndrome which if you know people who have been to medical school during the first year of medical training as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases it could happen suddenly you realize you have all of them have a brother-in-law named Bobo which is a whole nother story Bobo married Amy the Unicorn Bobo called me on the phone from Yale Medical School from Yale Medical School I'm bill Bessette Sean I have leprosy which even at Yale is extraordinarily rare but I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause see what we're finding is not necessarily the reality that shapes us but the lens to which your brain views the world that shapes your reality if we can change the lens not only can we change your happiness we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time when I applied to Harvard I applied on it there I didn't expect to get in and my family had no money for college when I got a military scholarship two weeks later that allowed me to go suddenly something wasn't even a possibility became a reality when I went there I assumed everyone else would see it as a privilege as well that they'd be excited to be there even if you're in a classroom full of people smarter than you you'd be happy just to be in that classroom which is what I felt but what I found there is while some people experienced that when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students Harvard asked me to wasn't that guy but what happened I was an officer of Harvard accounts those students through the difficult four years and what I found in my research my teaching is that these students no matter how happy they were with the original SAS success of getting into the school two weeks later the brains were focused not on the privilege of being there nor on their philosophy or their physics the brain was focused on the competition the workload the hassles the stresses the complaints when I first went in there I walked into the freshmen dining hall which is where my friends from Waco Texas which is where I grew up I know some of you've heard of it when I when they come to visit me they look around they say this freshman dining hall looks like something out of Hogwarts some movie Harry Potter which it does because Hogwarts and movie Harry Potter and that's Harvard when they see this they say Shawn why you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard seriously what does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels when in reality if I know everything about your external world I can only predict 10% of your long-term happiness 90% of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world but by it through the way your brain processes the world and if we change it if we change our formula for happiness and success what we can do is change the way that we can then affect reality what we found is that only 25% of job successes are predicted by IQ 75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels your social support and your abilities see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat I talked to a boarding school up in New England probably the most prestigious boarding school and they said we already know that so every year instead of just teaching our students we also have a Wellness Week and we're so excited Monday night we have the world's leading expert coming in to speak about adolescent depression Tuesday night is school violence and bullying Wednesday night Wednesday nights eating disorders Thursday night is illicit drug user Friday night we're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness I said that's most people's Friday nights [Music] which I'm glad you like but they did not like that at all silence on the phone and into the silence I said I'd be happy to speak to your school but just you know that's not a Wellness week that's the sickness week what you've done is you've outlined all the negative things that can happen but not talked about the positive the absence of disease is not health here's how we get to health we need to reverse the formula for happiness and success in the past three years I've traveled to 45 different countries working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn and what I found is the most companies and schools follow a formula for success which is this if I work harder I'll be more successful and if I'm more successful then I'll be happier that undergirds most of our parenting styles are managing style is the way that we motivate our behavior and the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons first every time your brain has a success you just change the goalposts of what success look like you got good grades now you have to get better grades it's gone to good schooling after you get a better school you got a good job now you have to get a better job you hit your sales target we're gonna change your sales target and if happiness is on the opposite side of success your brain never gets there what we've done is we pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society and that's because we think we have to be successful successful then we'll be happier but the real problem is our brains work in the opposite order if you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage which is your brain and positive perform significantly better than does a negative neutral stress your intelligence Rises your creativity Rises your energy levels rise in fact what we found is that every single business outcome improves your brain a positive is 31% more productive than it your brain and negative neutral stress you're 37% better at sales doctors are 19% faster more accurate at coming up with a correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative neutral stress which means we can reverse the formula if we can find a way becoming positive in the present then our brains work even more successfully as we're able to work harder faster and more intelligently what we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of because dopamine which floods into your system when you're positive has two functions not only does it make you happier it turns on all the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way we found that there are ways you can train your brain to be able to come more positive in just a two minute span of time done for 21 days in row we can actually rewire your brain allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully we've done these things in research now and every single company that I've worked with getting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for for 21 days in a row three new things each day and at the end of that their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative but for the positive first journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it exercise teaches your brain your behavior matters we find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand and finally random acts of kindness or conscious acts of kindness we get people when they open up their inbox to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their social support network and by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we trained our bodies what we found is we could reverse the formula for happiness and success and in doing so not only create ripples of positivity but create a real revolution thank you very much [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] when I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old we were playing on top of a bunk bed I was two years older than my sister at the time I'm two years older than her now but at the time that meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do and I wanted to play war so we were up on top of our bunk beds and on one side of the bunk bed I put out all my GI Joe soldiers and weaponry and on the other side were all my sisters Milo's and ponies and ready for a Calvary charge there are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon but since my sister is not here with us today let me tell you the true story which is my sister's a little bit on the clumsy side and somehow without any help or push from her older brother at all suddenly Amy disappeared off the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor and I never sleep eared over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible and seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm just one week before heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet for which I have yet to be thanked I was trying as hard as I could she didn't even see it coming I was trying as hard as I could to be on my best behavior and I saw my sister's faces wail a pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and threatening to wake my parents from the long winters nap for which they had settled so I did the only thing my little frantic seven-year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy if you have children you've seen this hundreds of times before I said Amy Amy wait don't cry don't cry did you see how you landed no human lands on all fours like that Amy I think this means you're a unicorn now that was cheating because there's nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five-year-old little sister but Amy the special unicorn of course this was an option that was open to her brain to no point in the past and you could see on my poor manipulated sister's face conflict as their little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering surprise she just experienced or contemplating her newfound identity as a unicorn and the latter one now instead of crying instead of ceasing our planes of waking my parents with all the negative consequences that would have been sued for me instead of smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn with one broken leg what we stumbled across at this tender age which is five and seven we had no idea at the time was something that was going to be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain what we had stumbled across is something called positive psychology which is the reason that I'm here today and the reason that I wake up every morning when I first started talking about this research outside of academia out with companies in schools the very first thing they said to never do is to start your talk with a graph the very first thing I wanted to do is start my talk with a graph this graph looks boring but this graph is the reason that I get excited and wake up every morning and this graph doesn't even mean anything it's faked out of what we found is if I got this data back studying you here in the room I would be thrilled because there's very clearly a trend that's going on there and that means that I can get published which is all that really matters the fact that there's one weird red dot that's up above the curve there's one weird in the room you know who you are I saw you earlier that's no prom that's no problem as most of you know because I can just delete that dot I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error and we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data so one of the very first things do we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how in a statistically valid way do we eliminate the weirdos how do we eliminate the outliers so that we can find the line of best fit which is fantastic if I'm trying to find out how many advil the average person should be taking too but if I'm interested in potential if I'm interested in your potential or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity what we're doing is we're creating the coal to the average with science if I ask you a question like how fast can the child learn how to read in a classroom scientists change the answer to how fast is the average child learn how to read in that classroom and then we tailor the class right towards the average now if you fall below the average on this curve then psychologists get thrilled because that means you're either depressed or you have a disorder or hopefully both we're hoping for both because our business motto is if you come into a therapy session with one problem we want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10 so you'll keep coming back over and over again we'll go back into your child have necessary but eventually what we want to do is to make you normal again but normal is merely average and what I pause it and what positive psychology posits is if we study what is merely average we will remain merely average then instead of deleting those positive outliers what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and says why why is it the some of you are so high above the curve in terms of your intellectual voting athletic ability musical ability creativity energy levels your resiliency in the face of challenge your sense of humor whatever it is instead of deleting you what I want to do is study you because maybe we can glean information not just how to move people up to the average but how we can move the entire average up that our companies in schools worldwide the reason this graph is important to me is when I turn on the news it seems like the majority of the information is not positive in fact is negative most of us about murder corruption diseases natural disasters and very quickly my brain starts to think that's the accurate ratio of negative positive in the world what that's doing is creating something called the medical school syndrome which if you

have children you've seen this hundreds of times before I said Amy Amy wait don't cry don't cry did you see how you landed no human lands on all fours like that Amy I think this means you're a unicorn now that was cheating because there's nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five-year-old little sister but Amy the special unicorn of course this was an option that was open to her brain to no point in the past and you could see on my poor manipulated sister's face conflict as their little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering surprise she just experienced or contemplating her newfound identity as a unicorn and the latter one now instead of crying instead of ceasing our planes of waking my parents with all the negative consequences that would have been sued for me instead of smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn with one broken leg what we stumbled across at this tender age which is five and seven we had no idea at the time was something that was going to be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain what we had stumbled across is something called positive psychology which is the reason that I'm here today and the reason that I wake up every morning when I first started talking about this research outside of academia out with companies in schools the very first thing they said to never do is to start your talk with a graph the very first thing I wanted to do is start my talk with a graph this graph looks boring but this graph is the reason that I get excited and wake up every morning and this graph doesn't even mean anything it's faked out of what we found is if I got this data back studying you here in the room I would be thrilled because there's very clearly a trend that's going on there and that means that I can get published which is all that really matters the fact that there's one weird red dot that's up above the curve there's one weird in the room you know who you are I saw you earlier that's no prom that's no problem as most of you know because I can just delete that dot I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error and we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data so one of the very first things do we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how in a statistically valid way do we eliminate the weirdos how do we eliminate the outliers so that we can find the line of best fit which is fantastic if I'm trying to find out how many advil the average person should be taking too but if I'm interested in potential if I'm interested in your potential or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity what we're doing is we're creating the coal to the average with science if I ask you a question like how fast can the child learn how to read in a classroom scientists change the answer to how fast is the average child learn how to read in that classroom and then we tailor the class right towards the average now if you fall below the average on this curve then psychologists get thrilled because that means you're either depressed or you have a disorder or hopefully both we're hoping for both because our business motto is if you come into a therapy session with one problem we want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10 so you'll keep coming back over and over again we'll go back into your child have necessary but eventually what we want to do is to make you normal again but normal is merely average and what I pause it and what positive psychology posits is if we study what is merely average we will remain merely average then instead of deleting those positive outliers what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and says why why is it the some of you are so high above the curve in terms of your intellectual voting athletic ability musical ability creativity energy levels your resiliency in the face of challenge your sense of humor whatever it is instead of deleting you what I want to do is study you because maybe we can glean information not just how to move people up to the average but how we can move the entire average up that our companies in schools worldwide the reason this graph is important to me is when I turn on the news it seems like the majority of the information is not positive in fact is negative most of us about murder corruption diseases natural disasters and very quickly my brain starts to think that's the accurate ratio of negative positive in the world what that's doing is creating something called the medical school syndrome which if you know people who have been to medical school during the first year of medical training as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases it could happen suddenly you realize you have all of them have a brother-in-law named Bobo which is a whole nother story Bobo married Amy the Unicorn Bobo called me on the phone from Yale Medical School from Yale Medical School I'm bill Bessette Sean I have leprosy which even at Yale is extraordinarily rare but I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause see what we're finding is not necessarily the reality that shapes us but the lens to which your brain views the world that shapes your reality if we can change the lens not only can we change your happiness we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time when I applied to Harvard I applied on it there I didn't expect to get in and my family had no money for college when I got a military scholarship two weeks later that allowed me to go suddenly something wasn't even a possibility became a reality when I went there I assumed everyone else would see it as a privilege as well that they'd be excited to be there even if you're in a classroom full of people smarter than you you'd be happy just to be in that classroom which is what I felt but what I found there is while some people experienced that when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students Harvard asked me to wasn't that guy but what happened I was an officer of Harvard accounts those students through the difficult four years and what I found in my research my teaching is that these students no matter how happy they were with the original SAS success of getting into the school two weeks later the brains were focused not on the privilege of being there nor on their philosophy or their physics the brain was focused on the competition the workload the hassles the stresses the complaints when I first went in there I walked into the freshmen dining hall which is where my friends from Waco Texas which is where I grew up I know some of you've heard of it when I when they come to visit me they look around they say this freshman dining hall looks like something out of Hogwarts some movie Harry Potter which it does because Hogwarts and movie Harry Potter and that's Harvard when they see this they say Shawn why you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard seriously what does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels when in reality if I know everything about your external world I can only predict 10% of your long-term happiness 90% of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world but by it through the way your brain processes the world and if we change it if we change our formula for happiness and success what we can do is change the way that we can then affect reality what we found is that only 25% of job successes are predicted by IQ 75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels your social support and your abilities see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat I talked to a boarding school up in New England probably the most prestigious boarding school and they said we already know that so every year instead of just teaching our students we also have a Wellness Week and we're so excited Monday night we have the world's leading expert coming in to speak about adolescent depression Tuesday night is school violence and bullying Wednesday night Wednesday nights eating disorders Thursday night is illicit drug user Friday night we're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness I said that's most people's Friday nights [Music] which I'm glad you like but they did not like that at all silence on the phone and into the silence I said I'd be happy to speak to your school but just you know that's not a Wellness week that's the sickness week what you've done is you've outlined all the negative things that can happen but not talked about the positive the absence of disease is not health here's how we get to health we need to reverse the formula for happiness and success in the past three years I've traveled to 45 different countries working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn and what I found is the most companies and schools follow a formula for success which is this if I work harder I'll be more successful and if I'm more successful then I'll be happier that undergirds most of our parenting styles are managing style is the way that we motivate our behavior and the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons first every time your brain has a success you just change the goalposts of what success look like you got good grades now you have to get better grades it's gone to good schooling after you get a better school you got a good job now you have to get a better job you hit your sales target we're gonna change your sales target and if happiness is on the opposite side of success your brain never gets there what we've done is we pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society and that's because we think we have to be successful successful then we'll be happier but the real problem is our brains work in the opposite order if you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage which is your brain and positive perform significantly better than does a negative neutral stress your intelligence Rises your creativity Rises your energy levels rise in fact what we found is that every single business outcome improves your brain a positive is 31% more productive than it your brain and negative neutral stress you're 37% better at sales doctors are 19% faster more accurate at coming up with a correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative neutral stress which means we can reverse the formula if we can find a way becoming positive in the present then our brains work even more successfully as we're able to work harder faster and more intelligently what we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of because dopamine which floods into your system when you're positive has two functions not only does it make you happier it turns on all the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way we found that there are ways you can train your brain to be able to come more positive in just a two minute span of time done for 21 days in row we can actually rewire your brain allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully we've done these things in research now and every single company that I've worked with getting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for for 21 days in a row three new things each day and at the end of that their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative but for the positive first journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it exercise teaches your brain your behavior matters we find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand and finally random acts of kindness or conscious acts of kindness we get people when they open up their inbox to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their social support network and by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we trained our bodies what we found is we could reverse the formula for happiness and success and in doing so not only create ripples of positivity but create a real revolution thank you very much [Applause]

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, I noticed that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about Shawn Achor's discovery in his eight years counseling students at Harvard, whereas the generated MCQs cover different topics.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say it's Question 4, but with a low confidence level. A more accurate approach would be to generate new MCQs that directly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] when I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old we were playing on top of a bunk bed I was two years older than my sister at the time I'm two years older than her now but at the time that meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do and I wanted to play war so we were up on top of our bunk beds and on one side of the bunk bed I put out all my GI Joe soldiers and weaponry and on the other side were all my sisters Milo's and ponies and ready for a Calvary charge there are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon but since my sister is not here with us today let me tell you the true story which is my sister's a little bit on the clumsy side and somehow without any help or push from her older brother at all suddenly Amy disappeared off the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor and I never sleep eared over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible and seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm just one week before heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet for which I have yet to be thanked I was trying as hard as I could she didn't even see it coming I was trying as hard as I could to be on my best behavior and I saw my sister's faces wail a pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and threatening to wake my parents from the long winters nap for which they had settled so I did the only thing my little frantic seven-year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy if you have children you've seen this hundreds of times before I said Amy Amy wait don't cry don't cry did you see how you landed no human lands on all fours like that Amy I think this means you're a unicorn

than her now but at the time that meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do and I wanted to play war so we were up on top of our bunk beds and on one side of the bunk bed I put out all my GI Joe soldiers and weaponry and on the other side were all my sisters Milo's and ponies and ready for a Calvary charge there are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon but since my sister is not here with us today let me tell you the true story which is my sister's a little bit on the clumsy side and somehow without any help or push from her older brother at all suddenly Amy disappeared off the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor and I never sleep eared over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible and seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm just one week before heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet for which I have yet to be thanked I was trying as hard as I could she didn't even see it coming I was trying as hard as I could to be on my best behavior and I saw my sister's faces wail a pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and threatening to wake my parents from the long winters nap for which they had settled so I did the only thing my little frantic seven-year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy if you have children you've seen this hundreds of times before I said Amy Amy wait don't cry don't cry did you see how you landed no human lands on all fours like that Amy I think this means you're a unicorn now that was cheating because there's nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five-year-old little sister but Amy the special unicorn of course this was an option that was open to her brain to no point in the past and you could see on my poor manipulated sister's face conflict as their little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering surprise she just experienced or contemplating her newfound identity as a unicorn and the latter one now instead of crying instead of ceasing our planes of waking my parents with all the negative consequences that would have been sued for me instead of smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn with one broken leg what we stumbled across at this tender age which is five and seven we had no idea at the time was something that was going to be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain what we had stumbled across is something called positive psychology which is the reason that I'm here today and the reason that I wake up every morning when I first started talking about this research outside of academia out with companies in schools the very first thing they said to never do is to start your talk with a graph the very first thing I wanted to do is start my talk with a graph this graph looks boring but this graph is the reason that I get excited and wake up every morning and this graph doesn't even mean anything it's faked out of what we found is if I got this data back studying you here in the room I would be thrilled because there's very clearly a trend that's going on there and that means that I can get published which is all that really matters the fact that there's one weird red dot that's up above the curve there's one weird in the room you know who you are I saw you earlier that's no prom that's no problem as most of you know because I can just delete that dot I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error and we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data so one of the very first things do we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how in a statistically valid way do we eliminate the weirdos how do we eliminate the outliers so that we can find the line of best fit which is fantastic if I'm trying to find out how many advil the average person should be taking too but if I'm interested in potential if I'm interested in your potential or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity what we're doing is we're creating the coal to the average with science if I ask you a question like how fast can the child learn how to read in a classroom scientists change the answer to how fast is the average child learn how to read in that classroom and then we tailor the class right towards the average now if you fall below the average on this curve then psychologists get thrilled because that means you're either depressed or you have a disorder or hopefully both we're hoping for both because our business motto is if you come into a therapy session with one problem we want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10 so you'll keep coming back over and over again we'll go back into your child have necessary but eventually what we want to do is to make you normal again but normal is merely average and what I pause it and what positive psychology posits is if we study what is merely average we will remain merely average then instead of deleting those positive outliers what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and says why why is it the some of you are so high above the curve in terms of your intellectual voting athletic ability musical ability creativity energy levels your resiliency in the face of challenge your sense of humor whatever it is instead of deleting you what I want to do is study you because maybe we can glean information not just how to move people up to the average but how we can move the entire average up that our companies in schools worldwide the reason this graph is important to me is when I turn on the news it seems like the majority of the information is not positive in fact is negative most of us about murder corruption diseases natural disasters and very quickly my brain starts to think that's the accurate ratio of negative positive in the world what that's doing is creating something called the medical school syndrome which if you know people who have been to medical school during the first year of medical training as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases it could happen suddenly you realize you have all of them have a brother-in-law named Bobo which is a whole nother story Bobo married Amy the Unicorn Bobo called me on the phone from Yale Medical School from Yale Medical School I'm bill Bessette Sean I have leprosy which even at Yale is extraordinarily rare but I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause see what we're finding is not necessarily the reality that shapes us but the lens to which your brain views the world that shapes your reality if we can change the lens not only can we change your happiness we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time when I applied to Harvard I applied on it there I didn't expect to get in and my family had no money for college when I got a military scholarship two weeks later that allowed me to go suddenly something wasn't even a possibility became a reality when I went there I assumed everyone else would see it as a privilege as well that they'd be excited to be there even if you're in a classroom full of people smarter than you you'd be happy just to be in that classroom which is what I felt but what I found there is while some people experienced that when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students Harvard asked me to wasn't that guy but what happened I was an officer of Harvard accounts those students through the difficult four years and what I found in my research my teaching is that these students no matter how happy they were with the original SAS success of getting into the school two weeks later the brains were focused not on the privilege of being there nor on their philosophy or their physics the brain was focused on the competition the workload the hassles the stresses the complaints when I first went in there I walked into the freshmen dining hall which is where my friends from Waco Texas which is where I grew up I know some of you've heard of it when I when they come to visit me they look around they say this freshman dining hall looks like something out of Hogwarts some movie Harry Potter which it does because Hogwarts and movie Harry Potter and that's Harvard when they see this they say Shawn why you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard seriously what does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels when in reality if I know everything about your external world I can only predict 10% of your long-term happiness 90% of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world but by it through the way your brain processes the world and if we change it if we change our formula for happiness and success what we can do is change the way that we can then affect reality what we found is that only 25% of job successes are predicted by IQ 75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels your social support and your abilities see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat I talked to a boarding school up in New England probably the most prestigious boarding school and they said we already know that so every year instead of just teaching our students we also have a Wellness Week and we're so excited Monday night we have the world's leading expert coming in to speak about adolescent depression Tuesday night is school violence and bullying Wednesday night Wednesday nights eating disorders Thursday night is illicit drug user Friday night we're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness I said that's most people's Friday nights [Music] which I'm glad you like but they did not like that at all silence on the phone and into the silence I said I'd be happy to speak to your school but just you know that's not a Wellness week that's the sickness week what you've done is you've outlined all the negative things that can happen but not talked about the positive the absence of disease is not health here's how we get to health we need to reverse the formula for happiness and success in the past three years I've traveled to 45 different countries working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn and what I found is the most companies and schools follow a formula for success which is this if I work harder I'll be more successful and if I'm more successful then I'll be happier that undergirds most of our parenting styles are managing style is the way that we motivate our behavior and the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons first every time your brain has a success you just change the goalposts of what success look like you got good grades now you have to get better grades it's gone to good schooling after you get a better school you got a good job now you have to get a better job you hit your sales target we're gonna change your sales target and if happiness is on the opposite side of success your brain never gets there what we've done is we pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society and that's because we think we have to be successful successful then we'll be happier but the real problem is our brains work in the opposite order if you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage which is your brain and positive perform significantly better than does a negative neutral stress your intelligence Rises your creativity Rises your energy levels rise in fact what we found is that every single business outcome improves your brain a positive is 31% more productive than it your brain and negative neutral stress you're 37% better at sales doctors are 19% faster more accurate at coming up with a correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative neutral stress which means we can reverse the formula if we can find a way becoming positive in the present then our brains work even more successfully as we're able to work harder faster and more intelligently what we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of because dopamine which floods into your system when you're positive has two functions not only does it make you happier it turns on all the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way we found that there are ways you can train your brain to be able to come more positive in just a two minute span of time done for 21 days in row we can actually rewire your brain allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully we've done these things in research now and every single company that I've worked with getting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for for 21 days in a row three new things each day and at the end of that their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative but for the positive first journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it exercise teaches your brain your behavior matters we find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand and finally random acts of kindness or conscious acts of kindness we get people when they open up their inbox to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their social support network and by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we trained our bodies what we found is we could reverse the formula for happiness and success and in doing so not only create ripples of positivity but create a real revolution thank you very much [Applause]

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Welcome to the Department of Plagiarism Investigation. The D.P.I. has dealt with numerous complex cases in their effort to bring plagiarists to justice and to rescue purloined texts. The first form of plagiarism that the D.P.I. regularly encounters is known as brain child snatching, in honor of the Latin word, plagiarius, from which plagiarism originates. Brain child snatchers sneak up on innocent papers and copy and paste them without citing any sources, putting quotation marks around direct quotes or changing a word. They've also been known to steal and hold particularly eloquent essays for ransom. When brain child snatchers get together, they form a kidnapping ring, which involves brain child snatching from multiple sources. Some perpetrators have even been known to commit self-plagiarism, one of the laziest crimes in the annals of the D.P.I. Also known as one-sided collaborators, these odd balls snatch up entire texts or small passages that they've written before and present them as brand-new material. Brain child snatchers and kidnapping rings are easy for the D.P.I. to catch. Just paste a few passages into a search engine, and BAM! They're caught red-handed. The more covert forms of plagiarism include the wild goose chase technique, in which plagiarists create fake authors, book titles, page numbers, or other information in order to cover up plagiarism. And the old synonym switcheroo in which plagiarists utilize a thesaurus as their main weapon. By substituting a synonym for nearly every word in the document and leaving the sentence structure and order of the ideas the same, plagiarists give legitimate paraphrasing a very bad name. Shoddy paraphrasing is also a key part of variations on a smokescreen, a technique in which multiple passages are paraphrased, then pasted together into one. The thorniest issue that the D.P.I. deals with is the misconception that you can never be accused of plagiarism if you use quotes and cite your sources. This is most certainly not the case because a paper that is made up of passage upon passage of other people's ideas is known as a wholly quotable document. This is considered plagiarism since there are no original thoughts in the work. Similarly, passage after passage of too closely paraphrased text from multiple cited sources is also plagiarism of the pervasively paraphrased kind because the ideas still aren't one's own. And lastly, the technique of revealing while concealing is plagiarism because it involves selective amnesia regarding one's sources in an attempt to cover up wholly quotable and pervasively paraphrased issues in a text. Some passages are meticulously documented, quoted, or paraphrased, while others are presented entirely as one's own. As you can see, the D.P.I. has its hands full, tackling all sorts of academic mischief and mayhem, ranging from the petty to the outrageous. Given the gravity of these transgressions, you might be wondering why you've never heard of the Department of Plagiarism Investigation's victories. That's because it doesn't technically exist. But people, like you and me, can be our own D.P.I. agents to fight plagiarism and uphold the values of original thinking. We know that the best defense against plagiarism consists of writers who save themselves time, worry, and effort by taking the far easier road of just doing the work themselves.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Welcome to the Department of Plagiarism Investigation. The D.P.I. has dealt with numerous complex cases in their effort to bring plagiarists to justice and to rescue purloined texts. The first form of plagiarism that the D.P.I. regularly encounters is known as brain child snatching, in honor of the Latin word, plagiarius, from which plagiarism originates. Brain child snatchers sneak up on innocent papers and copy and paste them without citing any sources, putting quotation marks around direct quotes or changing a word. They've also been known to steal and hold particularly eloquent essays for ransom. When brain child snatchers get together, they form a kidnapping ring, which involves brain child snatching from multiple sources. Some perpetrators have even been known to commit self-plagiarism, one of the laziest crimes in the annals of the D.P.I. Also known as one-sided collaborators, these odd balls snatch up entire texts or small passages that they've written before and present them as brand-new material. Brain child snatchers and kidnapping rings are easy for the D.P.I. to catch. Just paste a few passages into a search engine, and BAM! They're caught red-handed. The more covert forms of plagiarism include the wild goose chase technique, in which plagiarists create fake authors, book titles, page numbers, or other information in order to cover up plagiarism. And the old synonym switcheroo in which plagiarists utilize a thesaurus as their main weapon. By substituting a synonym for nearly every word in the document and leaving the sentence structure and order of the ideas the same, plagiarists give legitimate paraphrasing a very bad name. Shoddy paraphrasing is also a key part of variations on a smokescreen, a technique in which multiple passages are paraphrased, then pasted together into one. The thorniest issue that the D.P.I. deals with is the misconception that you can never be accused of plagiarism if you use quotes and cite your sources. This is most certainly not the case because a paper that is made up of passage upon passage of other people's ideas is known as a wholly quotable document. This is considered plagiarism since there are no original thoughts in the work. Similarly, passage after passage of too closely paraphrased text from multiple cited sources is also plagiarism of the pervasively paraphrased kind because the ideas still aren't one's own. And lastly, the technique of revealing while concealing is plagiarism because it involves selective amnesia regarding one's sources in an attempt to cover up wholly quotable and pervasively paraphrased issues in a text. Some passages are meticulously documented, quoted, or paraphrased, while others are presented entirely as one's own. As you can see, the D.P.I. has its hands full, tackling all sorts of academic mischief and mayhem, ranging from the petty to the outrageous. Given the gravity of these transgressions, you might be wondering why you've never heard of the Department of Plagiarism Investigation's victories. That's because it doesn't technically exist. But people, like you and me, can be our own D.P.I. agents to fight plagiarism and uphold the values of original thinking. We know that the best defense against plagiarism consists of writers who save themselves time, worry, and effort by taking the far easier road of just doing the work themselves.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

However, Question 5 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as its options and the specific scenario presented are different. 

A more similar generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the issue of whether a document can be considered plagiarized even if it properly cites outside sources. 

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. But among the options, Question 5 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

But there is another question that is more similar to the ground truth MCQ. 

The Question 9 directly addresses the issue of whether a document can be considered plagiarized even if it properly cites outside sources and contains no original thoughts or too closely paraphrased text.

So the most similar generated MCQ is Question 9 or Question 5.

However, if I must choose one, I will choose Question 9, as its content and options more closely match the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is 9.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Nowadays, we take curiosity for granted. We believe that if we put in the hard work, we might one day stand before the pyramids, discover a new species of flower, or even go to the moon. But, in the 18th and 19th century, female eyes gazed out windows at a world they were unlikely to ever explore. Life for women in the time of Queen Victoria was largely relegated to house chores and gossip. And, although they devoured books on exotic travel, most would never would leave the places in which they were born. However, there were a few Victorian women, who, through privilege, endurance, and not taking "no" for an answer, did set sail for wilder shores. In 1860, Marianne North, an amateur gardener and painter, crossed the ocean to America with letters of introduction, an easel, and a love of flowers. She went on to travel to Jamaica, Peru, Japan, India, Australia. In fact, she went to every continent except Antarctica in pursuit of new flowers to paint. "I was overwhelmed with the amount of subjects to be painted," she wrote. "The hills were marvelously blue, piled one over the other beyond them. I never saw such abundance of pure color." With no planes or automobiles and rarely a paved street, North rode donkeys, scaled cliffs, and crossed swamps to reach the plants she wanted. And all this in the customary dress of her day, floor-length gowns. As photography had not yet been perfected, Marianne's paintings gave botanists back in Europe their first glimpses of some of the world's most unusual plants, like the giant pitcher plant of Borneo, the African torch lily, and the many other species named for her as she was the first European to catalog them in the wild. Meanwhile, back in London, Miss Mary Kingsley was the sheltered daughter of a traveling doctor who loved hearing her father's tales of native customs in Africa. Midway through writing a book on the subject, her father fell ill and died. So, Kingsley decided she would finish the book for him. Peers of her father advised her not to go, showing her maps of tropical diseases, but she went anyhow, landing in modern-day Sierra Leone in 1896 with two large suitcases and a phrase book. Traveling into the jungle, she was able to confirm the existence of a then-mythical creature, the gorilla. She recalls fighting with crocodiles, being caught in a tornado, and tickling a hippopotamus with her umbrella so that he'd leave the side of her canoe. Falling into a spiky pit, she was saved from harm by her thick petticoat. "A good snake properly cooked is one of the best meals one gets out here," she wrote. Think Indiana Jones was resourceful? Kingsley could out-survive him any day! But when it comes to breaking rules, perhaps no female traveler was as daring as Alexandra David-Neel. Alexandra, who had studied Eastern religions at home in France, wanted desperately to prove herself to Parisian scholars of the day, all of whom were men. She decided the only way to be taken seriously was to visit the fabled city of Lhasa in the mountains of Tibet. "People will have to say, 'This woman lived among the things she's talking about. She touched them and she saw them alive,'" she wrote. When she arrived at the border from India, she was forbidden to cross. So, she disguised herself as a Tibetan man. Dressed in a yak fur coat and a necklace of carved skulls, she hiked through the barren Himilayas all the way to Lhasa, where she was subsequently arrested. She learned that the harder the journey, the better the story, and went on to write many books on Tibetan religion, which not only made a splash back in Paris but remain important today. These brave women, and others like them, went all over the world to prove that the desire to see for oneself not only changes the course of human knowledge, it changes the very idea of what is possible. They used the power of curiosity to try and understand the viewpoints and peculiarities of other places, perhaps because they, themselves, were seen as so unusual in their own societies. But their journeys revealed to them something more than the ways of foreign lands, they revealed something only they, themselves, could find: a sense of their own self.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Aside from their beauty, why were Marianne North’s paintings so useful to scientists back in Europe?
Options: A. The painted landscapes helped scientists make maps of foreign lands, B. The skies she painted helped scientists understand tropical meteorology, C. Their botanical accuracy showed scientists new species of plants which they hadn’t seen before, D. Their use of color helped scientists understand how the eye works
Correct Option: C

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Nowadays, we take curiosity for granted. We believe that if we put in the hard work, we might one day stand before the pyramids, discover a new species of flower, or even go to the moon. But, in the 18th and 19th century, female eyes gazed out windows at a world they were unlikely to ever explore. Life for women in the time of Queen Victoria was largely relegated to house chores and gossip. And, although they devoured books on exotic travel, most would never would leave the places in which they were born. However, there were a few Victorian women, who, through privilege, endurance, and not taking "no" for an answer, did set sail for wilder shores. In 1860, Marianne North, an amateur gardener and painter, crossed the ocean to America with letters of introduction, an easel, and a love of flowers. She went on to travel to Jamaica, Peru, Japan, India, Australia. In fact, she went to every continent except Antarctica in pursuit of new flowers to paint. "I was overwhelmed with the amount of subjects to be painted," she wrote. "The hills were marvelously blue, piled one over the other beyond them. I never saw such abundance of pure color." With no planes or automobiles and rarely a paved street, North rode donkeys, scaled cliffs, and crossed swamps to reach the plants she wanted. And all this in the customary dress of her day, floor-length gowns. As photography had not yet been perfected, Marianne's paintings gave botanists back in Europe their first glimpses of some of the world's most unusual plants, like the giant pitcher plant of Borneo, the African torch lily, and the many other species named for her as she was the first European to catalog them in the wild. Meanwhile, back in London, Miss Mary Kingsley was the sheltered daughter of a traveling doctor who loved hearing her father's tales of native customs in Africa. Midway through writing a book on the subject, her father fell ill and died. So, Kingsley decided she would finish the book for him. Peers of her father advised her not to go, showing her maps of tropical diseases, but she went anyhow, landing in modern-day Sierra Leone in 1896 with two large suitcases and a phrase book. Traveling into the jungle, she was able to confirm the existence of a then-mythical creature, the gorilla. She recalls fighting with crocodiles, being caught in a tornado, and tickling a hippopotamus with her umbrella so that he'd leave the side of her canoe. Falling into a spiky pit, she was saved from harm by her thick petticoat. "A good snake properly cooked is one of the best meals one gets out here," she wrote. Think Indiana Jones was resourceful? Kingsley could out-survive him any day! But when it comes to breaking rules, perhaps no female traveler was as daring as Alexandra David-Neel. Alexandra, who had studied Eastern religions at home in France, wanted desperately to prove herself to Parisian scholars of the day, all of whom were men. She decided the only way to be taken seriously was to visit the fabled city of Lhasa in the mountains of Tibet. "People will have to say, 'This woman lived among the things she's talking about. She touched them and she saw them alive,'" she wrote. When she arrived at the border from India, she was forbidden to cross. So, she disguised herself as a Tibetan man. Dressed in a yak fur coat and a necklace of carved skulls, she hiked through the barren Himilayas all the way to Lhasa, where she was subsequently arrested. She learned that the harder the journey, the better the story, and went on to write many books on Tibetan religion, which not only made a splash back in Paris but remain important today. These brave women, and others like them, went all over the world to prove that the desire to see for oneself not only changes the course of human knowledge, it changes the very idea of what is possible. They used the power of curiosity to try and understand the viewpoints and peculiarities of other places, perhaps because they, themselves, were seen as so unusual in their own societies. But their journeys revealed to them something more than the ways of foreign lands, they revealed something only they, themselves, could find: a sense of their own self.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Hello, humans. My name is Matt and for the next several moments, you are going to listen to me. Mwah, ha, ha, ha, ha. Sorry. I'm just joking. This is my normal voice. Have you ever taken direction from a mysterious voice on the computer before? No? Perfect! I want to try an experiment with you, but I can't tell you what that experiment entails because if I do, it won't work. You'll just have to trust me. This will all make sense soon, hopefully. If you're sitting down, stand up from your chair and take a step back. In a moment, I'm going to have you twirl around, so give yourself a bit of space. Need to move some furniture around? Take your time. I'll wait. On the count of three, you're going to start hopping on one foot. Are you ready? One, two, three! Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop. Nice work! OK, while you're still hopping, I now want you to begin barking like a dog. Ruff, ruff; ruff, ruff; ruff, ruff. Wow, that's quite a bark! And a few more. Ruff, ruff, ruff. And three, two, one, stop! Feel free to relax and sit back down. Now, I want you think about how much time passed between the moment I said, "Go!" and you began hopping on one foot to the moment I said, "Stop!" Take a guess. I'm looking for an exact number of seconds or minutes. Now, with a pen and paper, write that number down. All done? The exact time was actually 26 seconds. Did you overestimate? Chances are that you did. So, what was the culprit? The culprit was time perception. Although we can make shockingly precise time estimates, when we experience something new, unusual, or dynamic, like hopping on one foot while taking instructions from a voice on the computer, or, say, jumping out of an airplane, we often miscalculate how much time has passed. Meaning, if you bungee jump for the first time, your fall to the bottom may seem like it lasted for 10 seconds while the recorded time may actually show that the jump only lasted for 5. The reason for this difference is unlike your body's physical drop to the bottom, your brain's perception of time does not follow a straight line between two points. Some scientists even believe your brain follows more of a curved path that is dependent on the amount of information you take in as you fall downwards. For example, David Eagleman, a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine, believes time perception is heavily influenced by the number of memories and data you record onto your brain. When you have a new experience, like jumping off a high dive for the first time, your senses are heightened. You're taking in more details about sights, sounds, and smells than you normally would. And you store more data onto your brain in the form of memories. So, the more data you store in your brain, like the smell of chlorine as you leapt from the high dive or the color of the water, the longer your perception of that experience. Meaning, the number of memories and data you record on your brain has a direct impact on how long you believe that experience to have lasted. Have you ever heard a person recount what it's like to be in a car accident? Although automotive accidents typically last seconds, those involved often say they felt the accident lasted far longer. Time perception can also account for why your childhood may have seem to have lasted forever. By adulthood, a year can slip by in a heartbeat, but children record more data onto their brains. This occurs because many of the experiences we have as children are new and unfamiliar to us. The stack of encoded memories on your brain is so dense that reading them back makes you believe your experiences must have taken forever. Additionally, when you're 5 years old, one year is 1/5 of your life. But, when you're 25, one year makes up 1/25, further altering your perception of time. And, if you're an adult, think about a trip that you may have taken to a far-away land for the first time. Didn't those two weeks you spent exploring your surroundings seem to have lasted far longer than 14 days? Though time perception is rooted in both hard science and theory, it provides a great lesson for us on how to live our lives. I'm sure you have all heard that a person shouldn't sit on a couch and let life pass them by. Well, time perception tells us why that is. If you get up and engage with the world and have new experiences, and maybe even hop around on one foot and bark like a dog, you will literally perceive your own life to have lasted for a longer period of time.

When you have a new experience, like jumping off a high dive for the first time, your senses are heightened. You're taking in more details about sights, sounds, and smells than you normally would. And you store more data onto your brain in the form of memories. So, the more data you store in your brain, like the smell of chlorine as you leapt from the high dive or the color of the water, the longer your perception of that experience. Meaning, the number of memories and data you record on your brain has a direct impact on how long you believe that experience to have lasted. Have you ever heard a person recount what it's like to be in a car accident? Although automotive accidents typically last seconds, those involved often say they felt the accident lasted far longer. Time perception can also account for why your childhood may have seem to have lasted forever. By adulthood, a year can slip by in a heartbeat, but children record more data onto their brains. This occurs because many of the experiences we have as children are new and unfamiliar to us. The stack of encoded memories on your brain is so dense that reading them back makes you believe your experiences must have taken forever. Additionally, when you're 5 years old, one year is 1/5 of your life. But, when you're 25, one year makes up 1/25, further altering your perception of time. And, if you're an adult, think about a trip that you may have taken to a far-away land for the first time. Didn't those two weeks you spent exploring your surroundings seem to have lasted far longer than 14 days? Though time perception is rooted in both hard science and theory, it provides a great lesson for us on how to live our lives. I'm sure you have all heard that a person shouldn't sit on a couch and let life pass them by. Well, time perception tells us why that is. If you get up and engage with the world and have new experiences, and maybe even hop around on one foot and bark like a dog, you will literally perceive your own life to have lasted for a longer period of time.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Hello, humans. My name is Matt and for the next several moments, you are going to listen to me. Mwah, ha, ha, ha, ha. Sorry. I'm just joking. This is my normal voice. Have you ever taken direction from a mysterious voice on the computer before? No? Perfect! I want to try an experiment with you, but I can't tell you what that experiment entails because if I do, it won't work. You'll just have to trust me. This will all make sense soon, hopefully. If you're sitting down, stand up from your chair and take a step back. In a moment, I'm going to have you twirl around, so give yourself a bit of space. Need to move some furniture around? Take your time. I'll wait. On the count of three, you're going to start hopping on one foot. Are you ready? One, two, three! Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop. Nice work! OK, while you're still hopping, I now want you to begin barking like a dog. Ruff, ruff; ruff, ruff; ruff, ruff. Wow, that's quite a bark! And a few more. Ruff, ruff, ruff. And three, two, one, stop! Feel free to relax and sit back down. Now, I want you think about how much time passed between the moment I said, "Go!" and you began hopping on one foot to the moment I said, "Stop!" Take a guess. I'm looking for an exact number of seconds or minutes. Now, with a pen and paper, write that number down. All done? The exact time was actually 26 seconds. Did you overestimate? Chances are that you did. So, what was the culprit? The culprit was time perception. Although we can make shockingly precise time estimates, when we experience something new, unusual, or dynamic, like hopping on one foot while taking instructions from a voice on the computer, or, say, jumping out of an airplane, we often miscalculate how much time has passed. Meaning, if you bungee jump for the first time, your fall to the bottom may seem like it lasted for 10 seconds while the recorded time may actually show that the jump only lasted for 5. The reason for this difference is unlike your body's physical drop to the bottom, your brain's perception of time does not follow a straight line between two points. Some scientists even believe your brain follows more of a curved path that is dependent on the amount of information you take in as you fall downwards. For example, David Eagleman, a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine, believes time perception is heavily influenced by the number of memories and data you record onto your brain.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 2: According to the speaker, why do people often miscalculate the time it takes for an experience to pass?**

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that this question doesn't exactly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that relates to the importance or significance of time perception.

A better match is:

**Question 7: What is the lesson that the speaker draws from the concept of time perception?**

Although this question doesn't directly ask about the importance of time perception, it does relate to the significance of time perception in our lives.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more directly related to the importance of time perception, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say:

**Question 6: According to the speaker, what is the relationship between the amount of time that has passed and our perception of that time?**

This question is not a perfect match, but it does relate to the concept of time perception and its significance.

That being said, I must admit that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 6** is the most similar.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: **6**

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

However, the options provided in Question 2 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that explicitly asks about the path between two points in time.

A closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that Question 6 discusses the relationship between time and perception but does not explicitly mention the path between two points in time.

Considering the available options, Question 2 remains the closest match, but it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ. 

Therefore, I recommend Question 2 as the most similar generated MCQ, but with the caveat that it is not an exact match.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Imagine a world in which you see numbers and letters as colored even though they're printed in black, in which music or voices trigger a swirl of moving, colored shapes, in which words and names fill your mouth with unusual flavors. Jail tastes like cold, hard bacon while Derek tastes like earwax. Welcome to synesthesia, the neurological phenomenon that couples two or more senses in 4% of the population. A synesthete might not only hear my voice, but also see it, taste it, or feel it as a physical touch. Sharing the same root with anesthesia, meaning no sensation, synesthesia means joined sensation. Having one type, such as colored hearing, gives you a 50% chance of having a second, third, or fourth type. One in 90 among us experience graphemes, the written elements of language, like letters, numerals, and punctuation marks, as saturated with color. Some even have gender or personality. For Gail, 3 is athletic and sporty, 9 is a vain, elitist girl. By contrast, the sound units of language, or phonemes, trigger synestetic tastes. For James, college tastes like sausage, as does message and similar words with the -age ending. Synesthesia is a trait, like having blue eyes, rather than a disorder because there's nothing wrong. In fact, all the extra hooks endow synesthetes with superior memories. For example, a girl runs into someone she met long ago. "Let's see, she had a green name. D's are green: Debra, Darby, Dorothy, Denise. Yes! Her name is Denise!" Once established in childhood, pairings remain fixed for life. Synesthetes inherit a biological propensity for hyperconnecting brain neurons, but then must be exposed to cultural artifacts, such as calendars, food names, and alphabets. The amazing thing is that a single nucleotide change in the sequence of one's DNA alters perception. In this way, synesthesia provides a path to understanding subjective differences, how two people can see the same thing differently. Take Sean, who prefers blue tasting food, such as milk, oranges, and spinach. The gene heightens normally occurring connections between the taste area in his frontal lobe and the color area further back. But suppose in someone else that the gene acted in non-sensory areas. You would then have the ability to link seemingly unrelated things, which is the definition of metaphor, seeing the similar in the dissimilar. Not surprisingly, synesthesia is more common in artists who excel at making metaphors, like novelist Vladimir Nabokov, painter David Hockney, and composers Billy Joel and Lady Gaga. But why do the rest of us non-synesthetes understand metaphors like "sharp cheese" or "sweet person"? It so happens that sight, sound, and movement already map to one another so closely, that even bad ventriloquists convince us that the dummy is talking. Movies, likewise, can convince us that the sound is coming from the actors' mouths rather than surrounding speakers. So, inwardly, we're all synesthetes, outwardly unaware of the perceptual couplings happening all the time. Cross-talk in the brain is the rule, not the exception. And that sounds like a sweet deal to me!

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. However, the question content is not an exact match. A more similar question would be one that asks about the percentage of the population that experiences synesthesia.

A more suitable match would be Question 2, as it also deals with a percentage of the population experiencing a specific aspect of synesthesia. However, the content is still not an exact match.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 2's analog - a question about the percentage of the population that experiences synesthesia. However, such a question does not exist among the generated MCQs.

Among the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar in terms of intent and content, but it's still not a perfect match.

However, I noticed that Question 8 has an option that mentions the percentage of the population that experiences synesthesia. 

But the best match is actually none of the above questions but rather an analog of question 2. Since the analog does not exist I will select question 2's index as the best match.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Imagine a world in which you see numbers and letters as colored even though they're printed in black, in which music or voices trigger a swirl of moving, colored shapes, in which words and names fill your mouth with unusual flavors. Jail tastes like cold, hard bacon while Derek tastes like earwax. Welcome to synesthesia, the neurological phenomenon that couples two or more senses in 4% of the population. A synesthete might not only hear my voice, but also see it, taste it, or feel it as a physical touch. Sharing the same root with anesthesia, meaning no sensation, synesthesia means joined sensation. Having one type, such as colored hearing, gives you a 50% chance of having a second, third, or fourth type. One in 90 among us experience graphemes, the written elements of language, like letters, numerals, and punctuation marks, as saturated with color. Some even have gender or personality. For Gail, 3 is athletic and sporty, 9 is a vain, elitist girl. By contrast, the sound units of language, or phonemes, trigger synestetic tastes. For James, college tastes like sausage, as does message and similar words with the -age ending. Synesthesia is a trait, like having blue eyes, rather than a disorder because there's nothing wrong. In fact, all the extra hooks endow synesthetes with superior memories. For example, a girl runs into someone she met long ago. "Let's see, she had a green name. D's are green: Debra, Darby, Dorothy, Denise. Yes! Her name is Denise!" Once established in childhood, pairings remain fixed for life. Synesthetes inherit a biological propensity for hyperconnecting brain neurons, but then must be exposed to cultural artifacts, such as calendars, food names, and alphabets. The amazing thing is that a single nucleotide change in the sequence of one's DNA alters perception. In this way, synesthesia provides a path to understanding subjective differences, how two people can see the same thing differently. Take Sean, who prefers blue tasting food, such as milk, oranges, and spinach. The gene heightens normally occurring connections between the taste area in his frontal lobe and the color area further back. But suppose in someone else that the gene acted in non-sensory areas. You would then have the ability to link seemingly unrelated things, which is the definition of metaphor, seeing the similar in the dissimilar. Not surprisingly, synesthesia is more common in artists who excel at making metaphors, like novelist Vladimir Nabokov, painter David Hockney, and composers Billy Joel and Lady Gaga. But why do the rest of us non-synesthetes understand metaphors like "sharp cheese" or "sweet person"? It so happens that sight, sound, and movement already map to one another so closely, that even bad ventriloquists convince us that the dummy is talking. Movies, likewise, can convince us that the sound is coming from the actors' mouths rather than surrounding speakers. So, inwardly, we're all synesthetes, outwardly unaware of the perceptual couplings happening all the time. Cross-talk in the brain is the rule, not the exception. And that sounds like a sweet deal to me!

[Music] [Music] [Applause] so i want to start by um offering you a free no tech life hack um and all it requires of you is this that you change your posture for two minutes but before i give it away i want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body so how many of you are sort of making yourself smaller maybe you're hunching um crossing your legs maybe wrapping your ankles sometimes we hold on to our arms like this sometimes we spread out i see you so i want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now we're going to come back to that in a few minutes and i'm hoping that if you sort of learn to tweak this a little bit it could significantly change the way your life unfolds um so we're really fascinated with body language and we're particularly interested in other people's body language you know we're interested in like you know um a uh uh an awkward interaction or a smile or a contemptuous glance or maybe a very awkward wink or maybe even something like a handshake here they are arriving at number 10 and uh look at this lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the president of the united states on here comes the prime minister of it now so um a handshake or the lack of a handshake can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks even the bbc in the new york times so so obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior or body language but we call it nonverbals as social scientists it's language so we think about communication when we think about communication we think about interactions so what is your body language communicating to me what's mine communicating to you and there's a lot of reason to be to believe that this is this is a valid way to look at this so social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of of our body language or other people's body language on judgments and we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language and those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote um who we ask out on the date for example uh nalani ambadi a researcher at tufts university shows that when people watch 30 minute a 30 second soundless clips of real physician patient interactions their judgments of the physician's niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued so it doesn't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent but do we like that person and how they interacted um even more dramatic alex todorov at princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates faces in just one second predict 70 percent of u.s senate and gubernatorial race outcomes and even let's go digital emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead you to claim more value from that negotiation if you use them poorly bad idea right so so when we think of nonverbals we think of how we judge others how they judge us and what the outcomes are we tend to forget though the other audience that's influenced by our nonverbals and that's ourselves we are also influenced by our non-verbals our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology so what nonverbals am i talking about i'm a social psychologist i study prejudice and i teach at a competitive business school so it was inevitable that i would become interested in power dynamics i became especially interested in non-verbal expressions of power and dominance and what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance well this is what they are so in the animal kingdom they are about expanding so you make yourself big you stretch out you take up space you're basically opening up it's about opening up and this is true across the animal kingdom it's not just limited to primates and humans do the same thing so they do this both when they when they have power sort of chronically and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment and this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are this expression which is known as pride jessica tracy has studied she shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition so when they cross the finish line and they've won it doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it they do this so the arms up in the v the chin is slightly lifted what do we do when we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite we close up we wrap ourselves up we make ourselves small we don't want to bump into the person next to us so again both animals and humans do the same thing and this is what happens when you put together high and low power so what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the others non-verbals so if someone's being really powerful with us we tend to make ourselves smaller we don't mirror them we do the opposite of them so i'm watching this behavior in the classroom and what do i notice i notice that mba students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbal so you have people who are like caricatures of alphas like really come into the room they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts like they really want to occupy space when they sit down they're sort of spread out they raise their hands like this you have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in as soon as they come in you see it you see it on their faces and their bodies and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny and they go like this when they raise their hand i notice a couple things about this one you're not going to be surprised it seems to be related to gender so women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men women feel chronically less powerful than men so this is not surprising but the other thing i noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating and how well they were participating and this is really important in the mba classroom because participation counts for half a grade so business schools have been struggling with its gender grade gap you get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences and grades and it seems to be partly attributable to participation so i started to wonder you know okay so you have these people coming in like this and they're participating is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more so my main collaborator dana carney who's at berkeley and i really wanted to know can you fake it till you make it like can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful so we know that our non-verbals govern how other people think and feel about us there's a lot of evidence but our question really was do our non-verbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves there's some evidence that they do so for example um when we we smile when we feel happy but also when we're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this it makes us feel happy so it goes both ways when it comes to power um it also goes both ways so when you when you uh feel powerful you're more likely to do this but it's also possible that um when you when you pretend to be powerful you are more likely to actually feel powerful so the second question really was you know so we know that our minds change our bodies but is it also true that that our bodies change our minds and when i say minds in the case of the powerful what am i talking about so i'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings and in my case that's hormones i look at hormones so what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like so powerful people tend to be not surprisingly more assertive and more confident more more optimistic they actually feel that they're going to win even at games of chance they also tend to be able to think more abstractly so there are a lot of differences they take more risks there are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people physiologically there also our differences on two key hormones testosterone which is the dominance hormone and cortisol which is the stress hormone so what we find is that um a high power alpha males and primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol so what does that mean when you think about power 10 people tended to think only about testosterone because that was about dominance but really power is also about how you react to stress so do you want the high power leader that's dominant high on testosterone but really stress reactive probably not right you want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant but not very stress reactive the person who's laid back so we know that in in private hierarchies if an alpha needs to take over uh if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly within a few days that individual's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly so we have this evidence both that the body can shape the mind at least at the facial level and also that role changes can shape the mind so what happens okay you take a role change what happens if you do that at a really minimal level like this tiny manipulation this tiny intervention for two minutes you say i want you to stand like this and it's going to make you feel more powerful so this is what we did we decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment and these people adopted for two minutes either high power poses or low power poses and i'm just going to show you five of the poses although they took on on two so here's one a couple more this one has been dubbed the wonder woman by the media here a couple more so you can be standing or you can be sitting and here are the low power poses so you're folding up you're making yourself small this one is very low power when you're touching your neck you're really kind of protecting yourself so this is what happens they come in they spit into a vial we for two minutes say you need to do this or this they don't look at pictures of the poses we don't want to prime them with a concept of power we want them to be feeling power right so two minutes they do this we then ask them how powerful do you feel on a series of items and then we give them an opportunity to gamble and then we take another saliva sample that's it that's the whole experiment so this is what we find risk tolerance which is the gambling what we find is that when you're not when the when you're in the high power pose condition 86 of you will gamble when you're in the low power post condition only 60 and that's a pretty whopping significant difference here's what we find on testosterone from their baseline when they come in high-powered people experience about a 20 increase and low power people experience about a 10 decrease so again two minutes and you get these changes here's what you get on cortisol high power people experience about a 25 decrease and the low power people experience about a 15 increase so two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive confident and comfortable or really stress reactive and you know feeling sort of shut down and we've all had that feeling right so it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves so it's not just others but it's also ourselves also our bodies change our minds but the next question of course is can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways so this is in the lab it's this little task you know it's just a couple of minutes you know where can you actually apply this which we cared about of course and so we think it's really what what what matters i mean where you want to use this is evaluative situations like social threat situations where are you being evaluated either by your friends like for teenagers at the lunchroom table it could be you know for some people speaking at a school board meeting it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview we decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through was the job interview so um we published these these findings and the media are all over and they say um okay so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview right you know so we were of course horrified and said oh my god no no no that's not what we meant at all for numerous reasons no no no don't do that again this is not about you talking to other people it's you talking to yourself what do you do before you go into a job interview you do this right you're sitting down you're looking at your iphone or your android not trying to leave anyone out um you are you know you're looking at your notes you're hunting up making yourself small when really what you should be doing maybe is this like in the bathroom right do that find two minutes so that's what we want to test okay so we bring people into a lab and they do a cup they do either higher low power poses again they go through a very stressful job interview it's five minutes long they are being recorded they're being judged also and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback so they look like this like imagine this is the person interviewing you so for five minutes nothing and this is worse than being heckled people hate this it's it's what marianne lafrance calls standing in social quicksand so this really spikes your cortisol so this is the job interview we put them through because we really wanted to see what happened we then have these coders look at these tapes four of them they're blind to the hypothesis they're blind to the conditions they have no idea who's been posing in what pose and they they end up looking at these sets of tapes and they say oh we want to hire these people all the high power posers we don't want to hire these people we also evaluate these people much more positively overall but what's driving it it's not about the content of the speech it's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech we also because we rate them on all these variables related to sort of competence like how well structured is the speech how good is it what are their qualifications no effect on those things this is what's affected these kinds of things people are bringing their true selves basically they're bringing themselves they bring their ideas but as themselves with no you know residue over them so this is what's driving the effect or media mediating the effect so um when i tell people about this that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior and our behavior can change our outcomes they say to me i don't it feels fake right so i said fake it till you make it like i don't it's not me like i don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud i don't want to feel like an imposter i don't want to get there only to feel like i'm not supposed to be here and that really resonated with me because i want to tell you a little story about being an imposter and feeling like i'm not supposed to be here when i was 19 i was in a really bad car accident i was thrown out of a car rolled several times i was thrown from the car and i woke up in a head injury rehab ward and i had been withdrawn from college and i learned that my iq had dropped by two standard deviations which was um very traumatic i knew my iq because i had identified with being smart and i had been called gifted as a child so i'm taken out of college i keep trying to go back they say you're not gonna finish college like just you know there's there are other things for you to do but that's not gonna work out for you so i really struggled with this and i have to say having your identity taken from you your core identity and if for me it was being smart having that taken from you there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that so i felt entirely powerless i worked and worked and worked and i got lucky and worked and got lucky and worked eventually i graduated from college took me four years longer than my peers and i convinced someone my my angel advisor susan fisk to take me on and so i ended up at princeton and i was like i am not supposed to be here i am an imposter and the night before my first year talking the first year talk at princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people that's it i was so afraid of being found out the next day that i called her and said i'm quitting she was like you are not quitting because i took a gamble on you and you're staying you're going to stay and this is what you're going to do you're going to fake it you're going to take you're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do you're just gonna do it and do it and do it even if you're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience until you have this moment where you say oh my gosh i'm doing it like i have become this i am actually doing this so that's what i did five years in grad school a few years you know i'm at northwestern i moved to harvard i'm at harvard i'm not really thinking about it anymore but for a long time i had been thinking not supposed to be here not supposed to be here so at the end of my first year at harvard a student who had not talked in class the entire semester who had said look you've got to participate or else you're going to fail came into my office i really didn't know her at all and she said she came in totally defeated and she said i'm not supposed to be here and that was the moment for me because two things happened one was that i realized oh my gosh i don't feel like that anymore you know i don't feel that anymore but she does and i get that feeling and the second was she is supposed to be here like she can fake it she can become it so he's like yes you are you are supposed to be here and tomorrow you're gonna fake it you're gonna make yourself powerful and you know you're gonna and you're gonna go you're gonna go into the classroom and you are gonna give the best comment ever you know and she gave the best comment ever and people turned around they were like oh my god i didn't even notice her sitting there you know she comes back to me months later and i realized that she had not just faked it till she made it she had actually faked it till she became it so she had changed um and so i i i want to say to you don't fake it till you make it fake it till you become it you know it's not do it enough until you actually become it and internalize the last thing i want to leave you with is this tiny tweaks can lead to big changes so this is two minutes two minutes two minutes two minutes before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation for two minutes try doing this in the elevator in a bathroom stall at your desk behind closed doors that's what you want to do get configure your brain to cope the best in that situation get your testosterone up get your quarters all down don't leave that situation feeling like oh i didn't show them who i am leave that situation feeling like i really feel like i got to say who i am and show who i am so i want to ask you first you know both to try power posing and also i want to ask you to share this science because this is simple i don't have ego involved in this give it away like share it with people because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power give it to them because they can do it in private they need their bodies privacy and two minutes and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life thank you [Music] you

expressions of power and dominance and what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance well this is what they are so in the animal kingdom they are about expanding so you make yourself big you stretch out you take up space you're basically opening up it's about opening up and this is true across the animal kingdom it's not just limited to primates and humans do the same thing so they do this both when they when they have power sort of chronically and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment and this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are this expression which is known as pride jessica tracy has studied she shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition so when they cross the finish line and they've won it doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it they do this so the arms up in the v the chin is slightly lifted what do we do when we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite we close up we wrap ourselves up we make ourselves small we don't want to bump into the person next to us so again both animals and humans do the same thing and this is what happens when you put together high and low power so what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the others non-verbals so if someone's being really powerful with us we tend to make ourselves smaller we don't mirror them we do the opposite of them so i'm watching this behavior in the classroom and what do i notice i notice that mba students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbal so you have people who are like caricatures of alphas like really come into the room they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts like they really want to occupy space when they sit down they're sort of spread out they raise their hands like this you have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in as soon as they come in you see it you see it on their faces and their bodies and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny and they go like this when they raise their hand i notice a couple things about this one you're not going to be surprised it seems to be related to gender so women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men women feel chronically less powerful than men so this is not surprising but the other thing i noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating and how well they were participating and this is really important in the mba classroom because participation counts for half a grade so business schools have been struggling with its gender grade gap you get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences and grades and it seems to be partly attributable to participation so i started to wonder you know okay so you have these people coming in like this and they're participating is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more so my main collaborator dana carney who's at berkeley and i really wanted to know can you fake it till you make it like can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful so we know that our non-verbals govern how other people think and feel about us there's a lot of evidence but our question really was do our non-verbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves there's some evidence that they do so for example um when we we smile when we feel happy but also when we're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this it makes us feel happy so it goes both ways when it comes to power um it also goes both ways so when you when you uh feel powerful you're more likely to do this but it's also possible that um when you when you pretend to be powerful you are more likely to actually feel powerful so the second question really was you know so we know that our minds change our bodies but is it also true that that our bodies change our minds and when i say minds in the case of the powerful what am i talking about so i'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings and in my case that's hormones i look at hormones so what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like so powerful people tend to be not surprisingly more assertive and more confident more more optimistic they actually feel that they're going to win even at games of chance they also tend to be able to think more abstractly so there are a lot of differences they take more risks there are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people physiologically there also our differences on two key hormones testosterone which is the dominance hormone and cortisol which is the stress hormone so what we find is that um a high power alpha males and primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol so what does that mean when you think about power 10 people tended to think only about testosterone because that was about dominance but really power is also about how you react to stress so do you want the high power leader that's dominant high on testosterone but really stress reactive probably not right you want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant but not very stress reactive the person who's laid back so we know that in in private hierarchies if an alpha needs to take over uh if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly within a few days that individual's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly so we have this evidence both that the body can shape the mind at least at the facial level and also that role changes can shape the mind so what happens okay you take a role change what happens if you do that at a really minimal level like this tiny manipulation this tiny intervention for two minutes you say i want you to stand like this and it's going to make you feel more powerful so this is what we did we decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment and these people adopted for two minutes either high power poses or low power poses and i'm just going to show you five of the poses although they took on on two so here's one a couple more this one has been dubbed the wonder woman by the media here a couple more so you can be standing or you can be sitting and here are the low power poses so you're folding up you're making yourself small this one is very low power when you're touching your neck you're really kind of protecting yourself so this is what happens they come in they spit into a vial we for two minutes say you need to do this or this they don't look at pictures of the poses we don't want to prime them with a concept of power we want them to be feeling power right so two minutes they do this we then ask them how powerful do you feel on a series of items and then we give them an opportunity to gamble and then we take another saliva sample that's it that's the whole experiment so this is what we find risk tolerance which is the gambling what we find is that when you're not when the when you're in the high power pose condition 86 of you will gamble when you're in the low power post condition only 60 and that's a pretty whopping significant difference here's what we find on testosterone from their baseline when they come in high-powered people experience about a 20 increase and low power people experience about a 10 decrease so again two minutes and you get these changes here's what you get on cortisol high power people experience about a 25 decrease and the low power people experience about a 15 increase so two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive confident and comfortable or really stress reactive and you know feeling sort of shut down and we've all had that feeling right so it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves so it's not just others but it's also ourselves also our bodies change our minds but the next question of course is can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways so this is in the lab it's this little task you know it's just a couple of minutes you know where can you actually apply this which we cared about of course and so we think it's really what what what matters i mean where you want to use this is evaluative situations like social threat situations where are you being evaluated either by your friends like for teenagers at the lunchroom table it could be you know for some people speaking at a school board meeting it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview we decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through was the job interview so um we published these these findings and the media are all over and they say um okay so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview right you know so we were of course horrified and said oh my god no no no that's not what we meant at all for numerous reasons no no no don't do that again this is not about you talking to other people it's you talking to yourself what do you do before you go into a job interview you do this right you're sitting down you're looking at your iphone or your android not trying to leave anyone out um you are you know you're looking at your notes you're hunting up making yourself small when really what you should be doing maybe is this like in the bathroom right do that find two minutes so that's what we want to test okay so we bring people into a lab and they do a cup they do either higher low power poses again they go through a very stressful job interview it's five minutes long they are being recorded they're being judged also and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback so they look like this like imagine this is the person interviewing you so for five minutes nothing and this is worse than being heckled people hate this it's it's what marianne lafrance calls standing in social quicksand so this really spikes your cortisol so this is the job interview we put them through because we really wanted to see what happened we then have these coders look at these tapes four of them they're blind to the hypothesis they're blind to the conditions they have no idea who's been posing in what pose and they they end up looking at these sets of tapes and they say oh we want to hire these people all the high power posers we don't want to hire these people we also evaluate these people much more positively overall but what's driving it it's not about the content of the speech it's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech we also because we rate them on all these variables related to sort of competence like how well structured is the speech how good is it what are their qualifications no effect on those things this is what's affected these kinds of things people are bringing their true selves basically they're bringing themselves they bring their ideas but as themselves with no you know residue over them so this is what's driving the effect or media mediating the effect so um when i tell people about this that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior and our behavior can change our outcomes they say to me i don't it feels fake right so i said fake it till you make it like i don't it's not me like i don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud i don't want to feel like an imposter i don't want to get there only to feel like i'm not supposed to be here and that really resonated with me because i want to tell you a little story about being an imposter and feeling like i'm not supposed to be here when i was 19 i was in a really bad car accident i was thrown out of a car rolled several times i was thrown from the car and i woke up in a head injury rehab ward and i had been withdrawn from college and i learned that my iq had dropped by two standard deviations which was um very traumatic i knew my iq because i had identified with being smart and i had been called gifted as a child so i'm taken out of college i keep trying to go back they say you're not gonna finish college like just you know there's there are other things for you to do but that's not gonna work out for you so i really struggled with this and i have to say having your identity taken from you your core identity and if for me it was being smart having that taken from you there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that so i felt entirely powerless i worked and worked and worked and i got lucky and worked and got lucky and worked eventually i graduated from college took me four years longer than my peers and i convinced someone my my angel advisor susan fisk to take me on and so i ended up at princeton and i was like i am not supposed to be here i am an imposter and the night before my first year talking the first year talk at princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people that's it i was so afraid of being found out the next day that i called her and said i'm quitting she was like you are not quitting because i took a gamble on you and you're staying you're going to stay and this is what you're going to do you're going to fake it you're going to take you're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do you're just gonna do it and do it and do it even if you're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience until you have this moment where you say oh my gosh i'm doing it like i have become this i am actually doing this so that's what i did five years in grad school a few years you know i'm at northwestern i moved to harvard i'm at harvard i'm not really thinking about it anymore but for a long time i had been thinking not supposed to be here not supposed to be here so at the end of my first year at harvard a student who had not talked in class the entire semester who had said look you've got to participate or else you're going to fail came into my office i really didn't know her at all and she said she came in totally defeated and she said i'm not supposed to be here and that was the moment for me because two things happened one was that i realized oh my gosh i don't feel like that anymore you know i don't feel that anymore but she does and i get that feeling and the second was she is supposed to be here like she can fake it she can become it so he's like yes you are you are supposed to be here and tomorrow you're gonna fake it you're gonna make yourself powerful and you know you're gonna and you're gonna go you're gonna go into the classroom and you are gonna give the best comment ever you know and she gave the best comment ever and people turned around they were like oh my god i didn't even notice her sitting there you know she comes back to me months later and i realized that she had not just faked it till she made it she had actually faked it till she became it so she had changed um and so i i i want to say to you don't fake it till you make it fake it till you become it you know it's not do it enough until you actually become it and internalize the last thing i want to leave you with is this tiny tweaks can lead to big changes so this is two minutes two minutes two minutes two minutes before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation for two minutes try doing this in the elevator in a bathroom stall at your desk behind closed doors that's what you want to do get configure your brain to cope the best in that situation get your testosterone up get your quarters all down don't leave that situation feeling like oh i didn't show them who i am leave that situation feeling like i really feel like i got to say who i am and show who i am so i want to ask you first you know both to try power posing and also i want to ask you to share this science because this is simple i don't have ego involved in this give it away like share it with people because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power give it to them because they can do it in private they need their bodies privacy and two minutes and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life thank you [Music] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] so i want to start by um offering you a free no tech life hack um and all it requires of you is this that you change your posture for two minutes but before i give it away i want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body so how many of you are sort of making yourself smaller maybe you're hunching um crossing your legs maybe wrapping your ankles sometimes we hold on to our arms like this sometimes we spread out i see you so i want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now we're going to come back to that in a few minutes and i'm hoping that if you sort of learn to tweak this a little bit it could significantly change the way your life unfolds um so we're really fascinated with body language and we're particularly interested in other people's body language you know we're interested in like you know um a uh uh an awkward interaction or a smile or a contemptuous glance or maybe a very awkward wink or maybe even something like a handshake here they are arriving at number 10 and uh look at this lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the president of the united states on here comes the prime minister of it now so um a handshake or the lack of a handshake can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks even the bbc in the new york times so so obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior or body language but we call it nonverbals as social scientists it's language so we think about communication when we think about communication we think about interactions so what is your body language communicating to me what's mine communicating to you and there's a lot of reason to be to believe that this is this is a valid way to look at this so social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of of our body language or other people's body language on judgments and we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language and those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote um who we ask out on the date for example uh nalani ambadi a researcher at tufts university shows that when people watch 30 minute a 30 second soundless clips of real physician patient interactions their judgments of the physician's niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued so it doesn't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent but do we like that person and how they interacted um even more dramatic alex todorov at princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates faces in just one second predict 70 percent of u.s senate and gubernatorial race outcomes and even let's go digital emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead you to claim more value from that negotiation if you use them poorly bad idea right so so when we think of nonverbals we think of how we judge others how they judge us and what the outcomes are we tend to forget though the other audience that's influenced by our nonverbals and that's ourselves we are also influenced by our non-verbals our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology so what nonverbals am i talking about i'm a social psychologist i study prejudice and i teach at a competitive business school so it was inevitable that i would become interested in power dynamics i became especially interested in non-verbal expressions of power and dominance and what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance well this is what they are so in the animal kingdom they are about expanding so you make yourself big you stretch out you take up space you're basically opening up it's about opening up and this is true across the animal kingdom it's not just limited to primates and humans do the same thing so they do

they win at a physical competition so when they cross the finish line and they've won it doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it they do this so the arms up in the v the chin is slightly lifted what do we do when we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite we close up we wrap ourselves up we make ourselves small we don't want to bump into the person next to us so again both animals and humans do the same thing and this is what happens when you put together high and low power so what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the others non-verbals so if someone's

smart and i had been called gifted as a child so i'm taken out of college i keep trying to go back they say you're not gonna finish college like just you know there's there are other things for you to do but that's not gonna work out for you so i really struggled with this and i have to say having your identity taken from you your core identity and if for me it was being smart having that taken from you there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that so i felt entirely powerless i worked and worked and worked and i got lucky and worked and got lucky and worked eventually i graduated from college took me four years longer than my peers and i convinced someone my my angel advisor susan fisk to take me on and so i ended up at princeton and i was like i am not supposed to be here i am an imposter and the night before my first year talking the first year talk at princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people that's it i was so afraid of being found out the next day that i called her and said i'm quitting she was like you are not quitting because i took a gamble on you and you're staying you're going to stay and this is what you're going to do you're going to fake it you're going to take you're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do you're just gonna do it and do it and do it even if you're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience until you have this moment where you say oh my gosh i'm doing it like i have become this i am actually doing this so that's what i did five years in grad school a few years you know i'm at northwestern i moved to harvard i'm at harvard i'm not really thinking about it anymore but for a long time i had been thinking not supposed to be here not supposed to be here so at the end of my first year at harvard a student who had not talked in class the entire semester who had said look you've got to participate or else you're going to fail came into my office i really didn't know her at all and she said she came in totally defeated and she said i'm not supposed to be here and that was the moment for me because two things happened one was that i realized oh my gosh i don't feel like that anymore you know i don't feel that anymore but she does and i get that feeling and the second was she is supposed to be here like she can fake it she can become it so he's like yes you are you are supposed to be here and tomorrow you're gonna fake it you're gonna make yourself powerful and you know you're gonna and you're gonna go you're gonna go into the classroom and you are gonna give the best comment ever you know and she gave the best comment ever and people turned around they were like oh my god i didn't even notice her sitting there you know she comes back to me months later and i realized that she had not just faked it till she made it she had actually faked it till she became it so she had changed um and so i i i want to say to you don't fake it till you make it fake it till you become it you know it's not do it enough until you actually become it and internalize the last thing i want to leave you with is this tiny tweaks can lead to big changes so this is two minutes two minutes two minutes two minutes before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation for two minutes try doing this in the elevator in a bathroom stall at your desk behind closed doors that's what you want to do get configure your brain to cope the best in that situation get your testosterone up get your quarters all down don't leave that situation feeling like oh i didn't show them who i am leave that situation feeling like i really feel like i got to say who i am and show who i am so i want to ask you first you know both to try power posing and also i want to ask you to share this science because this is simple i don't have ego involved in this give it away like share it with people because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power give it to them because they can do it in private they need their bodies privacy and two minutes and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life thank

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] so i want to start by um offering you a free no tech life hack um and all it requires of you is this that you change your posture for two minutes but before i give it away i want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body so how many of you are sort of making yourself smaller maybe you're hunching um crossing your legs maybe wrapping your ankles sometimes we hold on to our arms like this sometimes we spread out i see you so i want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now we're going to come back to that in a few minutes and i'm hoping that if you sort of learn to tweak this a little bit it could significantly change the way your life unfolds um so we're really fascinated with body language and we're particularly interested in other people's body language you know we're interested in like you know um a uh uh an awkward interaction or a smile or a contemptuous glance or maybe a very awkward wink or maybe even something like a handshake here they are arriving at number 10 and uh look at this lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the president of the united states on here comes the prime minister of it now so um a handshake or the lack of a handshake can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks even the bbc in the new york times so so obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior or body language but we call it nonverbals as social scientists it's language so we think about communication when we think about communication we think about interactions so what is your body language communicating to me what's mine communicating to you and there's a lot of reason to be to believe that this is this is a valid way to look at this so social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of of our body language or other people's body language on judgments and we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language and those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote um who we ask out on the date for example uh nalani ambadi a researcher at tufts university shows that when people watch 30 minute a 30 second soundless clips of real physician patient interactions their judgments of the physician's niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued so it doesn't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent but do we like that person and how they interacted um even more dramatic alex todorov at princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates faces in just one second predict 70 percent of u.s senate and gubernatorial race outcomes and even let's go digital emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead you to claim more value from that negotiation if you use them poorly bad idea right so so when we think of nonverbals we think of how we judge others how they judge us and what the outcomes are we tend to forget though the other audience that's influenced by our nonverbals and that's ourselves we are also influenced by our non-verbals our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology so what nonverbals am i talking about i'm a social psychologist i study prejudice and i teach at a competitive business school so it was inevitable that i would become interested in power dynamics i became especially interested in non-verbal expressions of power and dominance and what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance well this is what they are so in the animal kingdom they are about expanding so you make yourself big you stretch out you take up space you're basically opening up it's about opening up and this is true across the animal kingdom it's not just limited to primates and humans do the same thing so they do this both when they when they have power sort of chronically and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment and this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are this expression which is known as pride jessica tracy has studied she shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition so when they cross the finish line and they've won it doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it they do this so the arms up in the v the chin is slightly lifted what do we do when we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite we close up we wrap ourselves up we make ourselves small we don't want to bump into the person next to us so again both animals and humans do the same thing and this is what happens when you put together high and low power so what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the others non-verbals so if someone's being really powerful with us we tend to make ourselves smaller we don't mirror them we do the opposite of them so i'm watching this behavior in the classroom and what do i notice i notice that mba students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbal so you have people who are like caricatures of alphas like really come into the room they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts like they really want to occupy space when they sit down they're sort of spread out they raise their hands like this you have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in as soon as they come in you see it you see it on their faces and their bodies and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny and they go like this when they raise their hand i notice a couple things about this one you're not going to be surprised it seems to be related to gender so women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men women feel chronically less powerful than men so this is not surprising but the other thing i noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating and how well they were participating and this is really important in the mba classroom because participation counts for half a grade so business schools have been struggling with its gender grade gap you get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences and grades and it seems to be partly attributable to participation so i started to wonder you know okay so you have these people coming in like this and they're participating is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more so my main collaborator dana carney who's at berkeley and i really wanted to know can you fake it till you make it like can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful so we know that our non-verbals govern how other people think and feel about us there's a lot of evidence but our question really was do our non-verbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves there's some evidence that they do so for example um when we we smile when we feel happy but also when we're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this it makes us feel happy so it goes both ways when it comes to power um it also goes both ways so when you when you uh feel powerful you're more likely to do this but it's also possible that um when you when you pretend to be powerful you are more likely to actually feel powerful so the second question really was you know so we know that our minds change our bodies but is it also true that that our bodies change our minds and when i say minds in the case of the powerful what am i talking about so i'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings and in my case that's hormones i look at hormones so what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like so powerful people tend to be not surprisingly more assertive and more confident more more optimistic they actually feel that they're going to win even at games of chance they also tend to be able to think more abstractly so there are a lot of differences they take more risks there are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people physiologically there also our differences on two key hormones testosterone which is the dominance hormone and cortisol which is the stress hormone so what we find is that um a high power alpha males and primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol so what does that mean when you think about power 10 people tended to think only about testosterone because that was about dominance but really power is also about how you react to stress so do you want the high power leader that's dominant high on testosterone but really stress reactive probably not right you want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant but not very stress reactive the person who's laid back so we know that in in private hierarchies if an alpha needs to take over uh if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly within a few days that individual's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly so we have this evidence both that the body can shape the mind at least at the facial level and also that role changes can shape the mind so what happens okay you take a role change what happens if you do that at a really minimal level like this tiny manipulation this tiny intervention for two minutes you say i want you to stand like this and it's going to make you feel more powerful so this is what we did we decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment and these people adopted for two minutes either high power poses or low power poses and i'm just going to show you five of the poses although they took on on two so here's one a couple more this one has been dubbed the wonder woman by the media here a couple more so you can be standing or you can be sitting and here are the low power poses so you're folding up you're making yourself small this one is very low power when you're touching your neck you're really kind of protecting yourself so this is what happens they come in they spit into a vial we for two minutes say you need to do this or this they don't look at pictures of the poses we don't want to prime them with a concept of power we want them to be feeling power right so two minutes they do this we then ask them how powerful do you feel on a series of items and then we give them an opportunity to gamble and then we take another saliva sample that's it that's the whole experiment so this is what we find risk tolerance which is the gambling what we find is that when you're not when the when you're in the high power pose condition 86 of you will gamble when you're in the low power post condition only 60 and that's a pretty whopping significant difference here's what we find on testosterone from their baseline when they come in high-powered people experience about a 20 increase and low power people experience about a 10 decrease so again two minutes and you get these changes here's what you get on cortisol high power people experience about a 25 decrease and the low power people experience about a 15 increase so two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive confident and comfortable or really stress reactive and you know feeling sort of shut down and we've all had that feeling right so it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves so it's not just others but it's also ourselves also our bodies change our minds but the next question of course is can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways so this is in the lab it's this little task you know it's just a couple of minutes you know where can you actually apply this which we cared about of course and so we think it's really what what what matters i mean where you want to use this is evaluative situations like social threat situations where are you being evaluated either by your friends like for teenagers at the lunchroom table it could be you know for some people speaking at a school board meeting it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview we decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through was the job interview so um we published these these findings and the media are all over and they say um okay so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview right you know so we were of course horrified and said oh my god no no no that's not what we meant at all for numerous reasons no no no don't do that again this is not about you talking to other people it's you talking to yourself what do you do before you go into a job interview you do this right you're sitting down you're looking at your iphone or your android not trying to leave anyone out um you are you know you're looking at your notes you're hunting up making yourself small when really what you should be doing maybe is this like in the bathroom right do that find two minutes so that's what we want to test okay so we bring people into a lab and they do a cup they do either higher low power poses again they go through a very stressful job interview it's five minutes long they are being recorded they're being judged also and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback so they look like this like imagine this is the person interviewing you so for five minutes nothing and this is worse than being heckled people hate this it's it's what marianne lafrance calls standing in social quicksand so this really spikes your cortisol so this is the job interview we put them through because we really wanted to see what happened we then have these coders look at these tapes four of them they're blind to the hypothesis they're blind to the conditions they have no idea who's been posing in what pose and they they end up looking at these sets of tapes and they say oh we want to hire these people all the high power posers we don't want to hire these people we also evaluate these people much more positively overall but what's driving it it's not about the content of the speech it's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech we also because we rate them on all these variables related to sort of competence like how well structured is the speech how good is it what are their qualifications no effect on those things this is what's affected these kinds of things people are bringing their true selves basically they're bringing themselves they bring their ideas but as themselves with no you know residue over them so this is what's driving the effect or media mediating the effect so um when i tell people about this that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior and our behavior can change our outcomes they say to me i don't it feels fake right so i said fake it till you make it like i don't it's not me like i don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud i don't want to feel like an imposter i don't want to get there only to feel like i'm not supposed to be here and that really resonated with me because i want to tell you a little story about being an imposter and feeling like i'm not supposed to be here when i was 19 i was in a really bad car accident i was thrown out of a car rolled several times i was thrown from the car and i woke up in a head injury rehab ward and i had been withdrawn from college and i learned that my iq had dropped by two standard deviations which was um very traumatic i knew my iq because i had identified with being smart and i had been called gifted as a child so i'm taken out of college i keep trying to go back they say you're not gonna finish college like just you know there's there are other things for you to do but that's not gonna work out for you so i really struggled with this and i have to say having your identity taken from you your core identity and if for me it was being smart having that taken from you there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that so i felt entirely powerless i worked and worked and worked and i got lucky and worked and got lucky and worked eventually i graduated from college took me four years longer than my peers and i convinced someone my my angel advisor susan fisk to take me on and so i ended up at princeton and i was like i am not supposed to be here i am an imposter and the night before my first year talking the first year talk at princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people that's it i was so afraid of being found out the next day that i called her and said i'm quitting she was like you are not quitting because i took a gamble on you and you're staying you're going to stay and this is what you're going to do you're going to fake it you're going to take you're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do you're just gonna do it and do it and do it even if you're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience until you have this moment where you say oh my gosh i'm doing it like i have become this i am actually doing this so that's what i did five years in grad school a few years you know i'm at northwestern i moved to harvard i'm at harvard i'm not really thinking about it anymore but for a long time i had been thinking not supposed to be here not supposed to be here so at the end of my first year at harvard a student who had not talked in class the entire semester who had said look you've got to participate or else you're going to fail came into my office i really didn't know her at

the best comment ever you know and she gave the best comment ever and people turned around they were like oh my god i didn't even notice her sitting there you know she comes back to me months later and i realized that she had not just faked it till she made it she had actually faked it till she became it so she had changed um and so i i i want to say to you don't fake it till you make it fake it till you become it you know it's not do it enough until you actually become it and internalize the last thing i want to leave you with is this tiny tweaks can lead to big changes so this is two minutes two minutes two minutes two minutes before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation for two minutes try doing this in the elevator in a bathroom stall at your desk behind closed doors that's what you want to do get configure your brain to cope the best in that situation get your testosterone up get your quarters all down don't leave that situation feeling like oh i didn't show them who i am leave that situation feeling like i really feel like i got to say who i am and show who i am so i want to ask you first you know both to try power posing and also i want to ask you to share this science because this is simple i don't have ego involved in this give it away like share it with people because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power give it to them because they can do it in private they need their bodies privacy and two minutes and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life thank

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Venom, the poisonous fluid secreted by animals, like snakes and scorpions, typically transmitted by bite or sting. As vile as the word is now, the history of venom begins with the pleasant Indo-European root wen, which meant to desire or strive for. Perhaps, not surprisingly, wen also generated a number of amiable modern words, like win or wish. Wenes, a form of the original root, was tailored to the mythology of the time, and applied to the Roman goddess of love, Venus, known to the Greeks as Aphrodite and to the Egyptians as Hathor. From this milieu of amore, the word wenesom emerged, meaning love potion. Over time, wenesom became venenum, a word that specifically described potions or medicines that evoked intense physical reactions from the patient. The definition of venenum eventually narrowed to refer solely to poisonous concoctions, a shift that puts us within striking distance of the word under investigation. A bit of shortening and a slight distinction in source brings us to venom, a deadly fluid that comes from a snake rather than a pharmacist.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. How will you survive? You might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography, I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apocalypse is movement. So, first, what moves? People move, animals move, and, while sometimes slowly, zombies move as well. But that's not all. Goods move, too. Goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. People or zombies tend to move these. So, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where there wasn't one before, you're probably on the trail. Ideas also move. Ideas can include entertainment, zombie movies, news and information about zombie attacks, and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. And, second, why do people or zombies move? When people, animals, or zombies move, it's called migration. Two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. Push factors will make you want to leave somewhere. Pull factors make you want to go to a place. A lack of resources, unstable economy, or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. Nice weather, a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people, enticing them to move. While zombies are definitely a push factor for humans, a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. There are some things that make movement easier for people or zombies. Waterways and highways can make traveling faster. Moving across clear, open space is easier than a tough terrain. And just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries, like a border gate, for example. So, how can you analyze these movement factors to help your chance of survival? There are three basic steps. One - identify the points or locations to analyze. What are your options? Two - find what connects them. Are there highways, waterways, or open land? And three - find the patterns of movement that happen over that connection. Do people or goods move across it? By comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. For example, pick two cities. Look at the highway connecting them. If people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. But this other city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. There's even a river in the way. It doesn't have as strong of a relationship. If a zombie outbreak started here, which city would you rather start out in? Where would you flee to? So, how do you decide where to go in a zombie apocalypse? Do you just run in a random direction? Or do you use your geographic skills to lead your camp of survivors to safety? If you want to stay alive, it helps to understand how and why we move.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking about the definition of geography. The most similar generated MCQ is not directly asking about the definition of geography, but Question 1 is asking about a geographic concept that can help in a zombie apocalypse, which is related to the idea of analyzing the world around you.

However, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the closest, as it mentions a geographic concept, and the transcript defines geography as "analyzing the world around you."

But a more accurate answer would be "None of the above," as the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose an index, I would say:

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

However, Question 3 is asking about push factors, whereas the ground truth MCQ is asking about what is NOT typically a pull factor. 

A more similar generated MCQ would be Question 6, which asks about examples of pull factors. If we consider the inverse relationship between push and pull factors, and the fact that Question 6 provides the correct information about pull factors, we can conclude that the correct answer (what is NOT typically a pull factor) would be something that is actually a push factor.

Therefore, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 6.

However, an even more similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present. But if we had to choose one, it would be Question 6.

By comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. For example, pick two cities. Look at the highway connecting them. If people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. But this other city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. There's even a river in the way. It doesn't have as strong of a relationship. If a zombie outbreak started here, which city would you rather start out in? Where would you flee to? So, how do you decide where to go in a zombie apocalypse? Do you just run in a random direction? Or do you use your geographic skills to lead your camp of survivors to safety? If you want to stay alive, it helps to understand how and why we move.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby There are still lots of things about space that we may never be able to answer, like is time travel possible? Or are aliens living somewhere else in the Milky Way? But there is one thing I believe about space: Space is trying to kill me. Space isn't out to get me personally. It's also trying to kill you and everybody else. Think about it. Space doesn't naturally have what we need to survive when we travel there: no air, it's too hot or too cold, no ozone to protect us from those nasty UV rays, either. This all sounds bad, but what can space really do to me if I stay on Earth? What we need to understand is that objects in space can cause people to think their days are numbered, even when there are events on Earth that can hurt or kill us before something from space does. So, what are the odds that one of these objects will really affect Earth and you and me in our lifetime? Well, we can take what we know about the universe to try and figure that out. You might have heard stories about asteroids hitting the Earth. That would be pretty bad. Scientists think asteroids might have killed off most of the dinosaurs. Sounds like something we should worry about, right? Well, astronomers can now watch asteroids in space and see them coming using complex computer models to predict the deadly rock's path. For a while, the reported odds that asteroid Apophis would strike Earth in 2036 were once 1 in 625. But, after updating their data, astronomers now say the chances are extremely low. Okay, what about the sun? Hollywood movies like to pick on our sun by showing Earth destroyed by solar flares or the sun dying out, which would cause Earth to freeze. Astronomers predict our sun contains enough gas to make energy for another 3 to 5 billion years. So, in 3 to 5 billion years, if people still exist on Earth, they'll have to deal with that. But today, well, we're safe. Sometimes the sun does shoot flares at Earth, but the magnetic fields surrounding our planet blocks most of that radiation. The radiation that does get through creates things like the Aurora Borealis. Gigantic solar flares can mess with our satellites and electrical equipment, but the chances of it killing you are pretty slim. Okay, what about that supermassive black hole in the middle of our galaxy? What happens to Earth, and us, when it pulls us in? After all, it is supermassive. Nope, not going to happen. That's one big object that can't bother us. How can we be so sure? Our solar system is on the edge of the Milky Way while the nearest supermassive black hole is about 26,000 light years from Earth. That means we aren't on that black hole's menu. So, you still think space objects are trying to kill you even after what I've told you so far? I think I've even convinced myself that odds are really good that space and the objects up there won't kill me after all. But I'll probably keep looking up just to make sure nothing is headed my way.

So, what are the odds that one of these objects will really affect Earth and you and me in our lifetime? Well, we can take what we know about the universe to try and figure that out. You might have heard stories about asteroids hitting the Earth. That would be pretty bad. Scientists think asteroids might have killed off most of the dinosaurs. Sounds like something we should worry about, right? Well, astronomers can now watch asteroids in space and see them coming using complex computer models to predict the deadly rock's path. For a while, the reported odds that asteroid Apophis would strike Earth in 2036 were once 1 in 625. But, after updating their data, astronomers now say the chances are extremely low. Okay, what about the sun? Hollywood movies like to pick on our sun by showing Earth destroyed by solar flares or the sun dying out, which would cause Earth to freeze. Astronomers predict our sun contains enough gas to make energy for another 3 to 5 billion years. So, in 3 to 5 billion years, if people still exist on Earth, they'll have to deal with that. But today, well, we're safe. Sometimes the sun does shoot flares at Earth, but the magnetic fields surrounding our planet blocks most of that radiation. The radiation that does get through creates things like the Aurora Borealis. Gigantic solar flares can mess with our satellites and electrical equipment, but the chances of it killing you are pretty slim. Okay, what about that supermassive black hole in the middle of our galaxy? What happens to Earth, and us, when it pulls us in? After all, it is supermassive. Nope, not going to happen. That's one big object that can't bother us. How can we be so sure? Our solar system is on the edge of the Milky Way while the nearest supermassive black hole is about 26,000 light years from Earth. That means we aren't on that black hole's menu. So, you still think space objects are trying to kill you even after what I've told you so far? I think I've even convinced myself that odds are really good that space and the objects up there won't kill me after all. But I'll probably keep looking up just to make sure nothing is headed my way.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby When I was a kid, my understanding of the seasons was that December and January were cold and covered with snow, April and May were bursting with flowers, July and August were hot and sunshiny, and September and October were a kaleidoscope of colorful leaves. It was just the way the world worked, and it was magical. If you had told me back then that one-third of Earth's population had never seen snow or that July 4th was most definitely not a beach day, I would have thought you were crazy. But in reality, seasonal change with four distinct seasons only happens in two regions on the planet. And, even in those two, the seasons are reversed. But why? A lot of people have heard of an astronomer called Johannes Kepler and how he proved that planetary orbits are elliptical and that the sun is not at the center of the orbit. It was a big deal when he figured this out several hundred years ago. His discovery solved a lot of mathematical problems that astronomers were having with planetary orbit measurements. While it's true that our orbit's not perfectly circular, those pictures in our science books, on TV, and in the movies give an exaggerated impression of how elongated our orbit is. In fact, Earth's orbit is very nearly a perfect circle. However, because Earth's orbit is technically an ellipse, even though it doesn't look like one, and the sun isn't quite exactly at the center, it means that our distance from the sun does change through the year. Ah-ha! So, winter happens when the Earth is further away from the sun! Well, no, not so fast. The Earth is actually closer to the sun in January than we are in July by 5 million kilometers. January is smack-dab in the middle of the coldest season of the year for those of us up north. Still not convinced? How about this: Summer and winter occur simultaneously on the surface of our planet. When it's winter in Connecticut, it's summer in New Zealand. So, if it's not the distance from the sun, what else could it be? Well, we need to also need to know that the Earth doesn't sit straight up. It actually tilts. And that axial tilt of the Earth is one of the main reasons for the seasons. The Earth spins on an axis that's tilted 23.5 degrees from vertical. At the same time, the Earth revolves around the sun with the axis always pointing in the same direction in space. Together with the tilt, the spinning and revolving causes the number of hours of daylight in a region to change as the year goes by, with more hours in summer and fewer in winter. So, when the sun is shining on the Earth, it warms up. After the sun sets, it has time to cool down. So, in the summer, any location that's about 40 degrees north of the equator, like Hartford, Connecticut, will get 15 hours of daylight each day and 9 hours of darkness. It warms up for longer than it cools. This happens day after day, so there is an overall warming effect. Remember this fact for later! In the winter, the opposite happens. There are many more hours of cooling time than warming time, and day after day, this results in a cooling effect. The interesting thing is, as you move north, the number of daylight hours in summer increases. So, Juneau, Alaska would get about 19 hours of daylight on the same summer day that Tallahassee, Florida gets about 14. In fact, in the summertime at the North Pole, the sun never sets. OK, then, it's all about daylight hours, I've got it! Well, no, there's another important piece to this puzzle. If daylight hours were the only thing that determined average temperature, wouldn't the North Pole be the hottest place on Earth in northern summer because it receives 24 hours of daylight in the months surrounding the summer solstice? But it's the North Pole. There's still icebergs in the water and snow on the ground. So, what's going on? The Earth is a sphere and so the amount of solar energy an area receives changes based on how high the sun is in the sky, which, as you know, changes during the day between sunrise and sunset. But, the maximum height also changes during the year, with the greatest solar height during the summer months and highest of all at noon on the summer solstice, which is June 21st in the northern hemisphere and December 21st in the southern hemisphere. This is because as the Earth revolves, the northern hemisphere ends up tilted away from the sun in the winter and toward the sun in summer, which puts the sun more directly overhead for longer amounts of time. Remember those increased summer time daylight hours? And solar energy per square kilometer increases as the sun gets higher in the sky. So, when the sun's at an angle, the amount of energy delivered to each square of the sunlit area is less. Therefore, even though the North Pole is getting 24 hours of daylight to warm up, the sunlight it receives is very spread out and delivers less energy than a place further south, where the sun is higher in the sky because it's more tilted toward the sun. Besides, the North Pole has a lot to make up for. It was cooling down without any sunlight at all for 6 months straight. So, as the seasons change, wherever you are, you can now appreciate not just the beauty of each new season but the astronomical complexity that brings them to you.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby When I was a kid, my understanding of the seasons was that December and January were cold and covered with snow, April and May were bursting with flowers, July and August were hot and sunshiny, and September and October were a kaleidoscope of colorful leaves. It was just the way the world worked, and it was magical. If you had told me back then that one-third of Earth's population had never seen snow or that July 4th was most definitely not a beach day, I would have thought you were crazy. But in reality, seasonal change with four distinct seasons only happens in two regions on the planet. And, even in those two, the seasons are reversed. But why? A lot of people have heard of an astronomer called Johannes Kepler and how he proved that planetary orbits are elliptical and that the sun is not at the center of the orbit. It was a big deal when he figured this out several hundred years ago. His discovery solved a lot of mathematical problems that astronomers were having with planetary orbit measurements. While it's true that our orbit's not perfectly circular, those pictures in our science books, on TV, and in the movies give an exaggerated impression of how elongated our orbit is. In fact, Earth's orbit is very nearly a perfect circle. However, because Earth's orbit is technically an ellipse, even though it doesn't look like one, and the sun isn't quite exactly at the center, it means that our distance from the sun does change through the year. Ah-ha! So, winter happens when the Earth is further away from the sun! Well, no, not so fast. The Earth is actually closer to the sun in January than we are in July by 5 million kilometers. January is smack-dab in the middle of the coldest season of the year for those of us up north. Still not convinced? How about this: Summer and winter occur simultaneously on the surface of our planet. When it's winter in Connecticut, it's summer in New Zealand. So, if it's not the distance from the sun, what else could it be? Well, we need to also need to know that the Earth doesn't sit straight up. It actually tilts. And that axial tilt of the Earth is one of the main reasons for the seasons. The Earth spins on an axis that's tilted 23.5 degrees from vertical. At the same time, the Earth revolves around the sun with the axis always pointing in the same direction in space. Together with the tilt, the spinning and revolving causes the number of hours of daylight in a region to change as the year goes by, with more hours in summer and fewer in winter. So, when the sun is shining on the Earth, it warms up. After the sun sets, it has time to cool down. So, in the summer, any location that's about 40 degrees north of the equator, like Hartford, Connecticut, will get 15 hours of daylight each day and 9 hours of darkness. It warms up for longer than it cools. This happens day after day, so there is an overall warming effect. Remember this fact for later! In the winter, the opposite happens. There are many more hours of cooling time than warming time, and day after day, this results in a cooling effect. The interesting thing is, as you move north, the number of daylight hours in summer increases. So, Juneau, Alaska would get about 19 hours of daylight on the same summer day that Tallahassee, Florida gets about 14. In fact, in the summertime at the North Pole, the sun never sets. OK, then, it's all about daylight hours, I've got it! Well, no, there's another important piece to this puzzle. If daylight hours were the only thing that determined average temperature, wouldn't the North Pole be the hottest place on Earth in northern summer because it receives 24 hours of daylight in the months surrounding the summer solstice? But it's the North Pole. There's still icebergs in the water and snow on the ground. So, what's going on? The Earth is a sphere and so the amount of solar energy an area receives changes based on how high the sun is in the sky, which, as you know, changes during the day between sunrise and sunset. But, the maximum height also changes during the year, with the greatest solar height during the summer months and highest of all at noon on the summer solstice, which is June 21st in the northern hemisphere and December 21st in the southern hemisphere. This is because as the Earth revolves, the northern hemisphere ends up tilted away from the sun in the winter and toward the sun in summer, which puts the sun more directly overhead for longer amounts of time. Remember those increased summer time daylight hours? And solar energy per square kilometer increases as the sun gets higher in the sky. So, when the sun's at an angle, the amount of energy delivered to each square of the sunlit area is less. Therefore, even though the North Pole is getting 24 hours of daylight to warm up, the sunlight it receives is very spread out and delivers less energy than a place further south, where the sun is higher in the sky because it's more tilted toward the sun. Besides, the North Pole has a lot to make up for. It was cooling down without any sunlight at all for 6 months straight. So, as the seasons change, wherever you are, you can now appreciate not just the beauty of each new season but the astronomical complexity that brings them to you.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the intent of the question, which is related to the Earth's distance from the Sun, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match.

However, since Question 1 does not specifically ask about the month when the Earth is closest to the Sun, it's not a perfect match.

If I had to choose one, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: None of the above (but if I really had to choose one, I would say Question 1).

However, I would like to note that the generated MCQs do not cover the specific topic of the ground truth MCQ, which is the month when the Earth is closest to the Sun. Therefore, it would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that directly addresses this topic.

Here is an example of a new generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ:

Question: During which month is the Earth closest to the Sun?
Options: A. July, B. January, C. March, D. September
Correct Option: B

This new generated MCQ directly matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby What's an algorithm? In computer science, an algorithm is a set of instructions for solving some problem, step-by-step. Typically, algorithms are executed by computers, but we humans have algorithms as well. For instance, how would you go about counting the number of people in a room? Well, if you're like me, you probably point at each person, one at a time, and count up from 0: 1, 2, 3, 4 and so forth. Well, that's an algorithm. In fact, let's try to express it a bit more formally in pseudocode, English-like syntax that resembles a programming language. Let n equal 0. For each person in room, set n = n + 1. How to interpret this pseudocode? Well, line 1 declares, so to speak, a variable called n and initializes its value to zero. This just means that at the beginning of our algorithm, the thing with which we're counting has a value of zero. After all, before we start counting, we haven't counted anything yet. Calling this variable n is just a convention. I could have called it almost anything. Now, line 2 demarks the start of loop, a sequence of steps that will repeat some number of times. So, in our example, the step we're taking is counting people in the room. Beneath line 2 is line 3, which describes exactly how we'll go about counting. The indentation implies that it's line 3 that will repeat. So, what the pseudocode is saying is that after starting at zero, for each person in the room, we'll increase n by 1. Now, is this algorithm correct? Well, let's bang on it a bit. Does it work if there are 2 people in the room? Let's see. In line 1, we initialize n to zero. For each of these two people, we then increment n by 1. So, in the first trip through the loop, we update n from zero to 1, on the second trip through that same loop, we update n from 1 to 2. And so, by this algorithm's end, n is 2, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. So far, so good. How about a corner case, though? Suppose that there are zero people in the room, besides me, who's doing the counting. In line 1, we again initialize n to zero. This time, though, line 3 doesn't execute at all since there isn't a person in the room, and so, n remains zero, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. Pretty simple, right? But counting people one a time is pretty inefficient, too, no? Surely, we can do better! Why not count two people at a time? Instead of counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and so forth, why not count 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on? It even sounds faster, and it surely is. Let's express this optimization in pseudocode. Let n equal zero. For each pair of people in room, set n = n + 2. Pretty simple change, right? Rather than count people one at a time, we instead count them two at a time. This algorithm's thus twice as fast as the last. But is it correct? Let's see. Does it work if there are 2 people in the room? In line 1, we initialize n to zero. For that one pair of people, we then increment n by 2. And so, by this algorithm's end, n is 2, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. Suppose next that there are zero people in the room. In line 1, we initialize n to zero. As before, line 3 doesn't execute at all since there aren't any pairs of people in the room, and so, n remains zero, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. But what if there are 3 people in the room? How does this algorithm fair? Let's see. In line 1, we initialize n to zero. For a pair of those people, we then increment n by 2, but then what? There isn't another full pair of people in the room, so line 2 no longer applies. And so, by this algorithm's end, n is still 2, which isn't correct. Indeed this algorithm is said to be buggy because it has a mistake. Let's redress with some new pseudocode. Let n equal zero. For each pair of people in room, set n = n + 2. If 1 person remains unpaired, set n = n + 1. To solve this particular problem, we've introduced in line 4 a condition, otherwise known as a branch, that only executes if there is one person we could not pair with another. So now, whether there's 1 or 3 or any odd number of people in the room, this algorithm will now count them. Can we do even better? Well, we could count in 3's or 4's or even 5's and 10's, but beyond that it's going to get a little bit difficult to point. At the end of the day, whether executed by computers or humans, algorithms are just a set of instructions with which to solve problems. These were just three. What problem would you solve with an algorithm?

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 5: How does the pseudocode count people in the room? Options: A. By incrementing n by 1 for each person., B. By incrementing n by 2 for each pair of people., C. By incrementing n by 3 for each group of 3 people., D. By incrementing n by 4 for each group of 4 people. Correct Option: A**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the execution of the algorithm for a specific number of people in the room.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the closest in terms of intent and content.

**Question 6: What is the problem with the second algorithm when there are 3 people in the room? Options: A. It counts them correctly., B. It counts them too slowly., C. It counts them incorrectly., D. It does not count them at all. Correct Option: C**

However, this question still does not match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Index: 6**

Please note that this is not an exact match, and a more similar question would be one that asks about the execution of the algorithm for a specific number of people in the room, such as "If there are 3 people in the room, how many times does line 3 of our first algorithm execute?"

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby What's an algorithm? In computer science, an algorithm is a set of instructions for solving some problem, step-by-step. Typically, algorithms are executed by computers, but we humans have algorithms as well. For instance, how would you go about counting the number of people in a room? Well, if you're like me, you probably point at each person, one at a time, and count up from 0: 1, 2, 3, 4 and so forth. Well, that's an algorithm. In fact, let's try to express it a bit more formally in pseudocode, English-like syntax that resembles a programming language. Let n equal 0. For each person in room, set n = n + 1. How to interpret this pseudocode? Well, line 1 declares, so to speak, a variable called n and initializes its value to zero. This just means that at the beginning of our algorithm, the thing with which we're counting has a value of zero. After all, before we start counting, we haven't counted anything yet. Calling this variable n is just a convention. I could have called it almost anything. Now, line 2 demarks the start of loop, a sequence of steps that will repeat some number of times. So, in our example, the step we're taking is counting people in the room. Beneath line 2 is line 3, which describes exactly how we'll go about counting. The indentation implies that it's line 3 that will repeat. So, what the pseudocode is saying is that after starting at zero, for each person in the room, we'll increase n by 1. Now, is this algorithm correct? Well, let's bang on it a bit. Does it work if there are 2 people in the room? Let's see. In line 1, we initialize n to zero. For each of these two people, we then increment n by 1. So, in the first trip through the loop, we update n from zero to 1, on the second trip through that same loop, we update n from 1 to 2. And so, by this algorithm's end, n is 2, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. So far, so good. How about a corner case, though? Suppose that there are zero people in the room, besides me, who's doing the counting. In line 1, we again initialize n to zero. This time, though, line 3 doesn't execute at all since there isn't a person in the room, and so, n remains zero, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. Pretty simple, right? But counting people one a time is pretty inefficient, too, no? Surely, we can do better! Why not count two people at a time? Instead of counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and so forth, why not count 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on? It even sounds faster, and it surely is. Let's express this optimization in pseudocode. Let n equal zero. For each pair of people in room, set n = n + 2. Pretty simple change, right? Rather than count people one at a time, we instead count them two at a time. This algorithm's thus twice as fast as the last. But is it correct? Let's see. Does it work if there are 2 people in the room? In line 1, we initialize n to zero. For that one pair of people, we then increment n by 2. And so, by this algorithm's end, n is 2, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. Suppose next that there are zero people in the room. In line 1, we initialize n to zero. As before, line 3 doesn't execute at all since there aren't any pairs of people in the room, and so, n remains zero, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. But what if there are 3 people in the room? How does this algorithm fair? Let's see. In line 1, we initialize n to zero. For a pair of those people, we then increment n by 2, but then what? There isn't another full pair of people in the room, so line 2 no longer applies. And so, by this algorithm's end, n is still 2, which isn't correct. Indeed this algorithm is said to be buggy because it has a mistake. Let's redress with some new pseudocode. Let n equal zero. For each pair of people in room, set n = n + 2. If 1 person remains unpaired, set n = n + 1. To solve this particular problem, we've introduced in line 4 a condition, otherwise known as a branch, that only executes if there is one person we could not pair with another. So now, whether there's 1 or 3 or any odd number of people in the room, this algorithm will now count them. Can we do even better? Well, we could count in 3's or 4's or even 5's and 10's, but beyond that it's going to get a little bit difficult to point. At the end of the day, whether executed by computers or humans, algorithms are just a set of instructions with which to solve problems. These were just three. What problem would you solve with an algorithm?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I identified the most similar generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of times line 3 of the final algorithm executes when there are 6 people in the room. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 5, which asks how the pseudocode counts people in the room. Although it does not specifically ask about the number of times line 3 executes, it is related to the counting process in the algorithm.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that Question 6 is more relevant to the ground truth MCQ. It asks about the problem with the second algorithm when there are 3 people in the room, which is related to the counting process and the execution of the algorithm.

But, since the question asks for the most similar MCQ, and none of the questions ask about the execution of line 3 of the final algorithm, the best choice would be a question that asks about the counting process in the algorithm.

A more relevant question would be one that asks about the execution of the algorithm, but since that question does not exist, I will choose a question that is more related to the counting process.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 5

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a specific line in the final algorithm that never executes when there are 50 people in the room. The closest generated MCQ that relates to this topic is Question 7, which asks about the purpose of the condition in the fourth line of the new pseudocode.

Although Question 7 does not directly ask about a line that never executes, it does relate to the same algorithm and the handling of edge cases. Therefore, I would suggest Question 7 as the most similar generated MCQ.

and I have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life what happens I think and then it was no vote it's my fault I'm not blaming anybody else reading as you've requested the whole pie bit let me just stop right there I want to say right here now I said things that were not proof I try and rob a bank and fail that's no defense I still tried to rubberband I did not hear they called him and tell you during the 18 and a half minute there was no cover-up of any criminal active that is obstruction of justice jester ma here's your conclusion not commitment in my view an impeachable I was concerned about whether or not the other side was bugging us I cut off one arm and cut off the other no I don't interpret that right off all that I said things were not I thought myself why didn't you stop it I gave him a sword and they stuck it in the break in the political scandal began on June 17th 1972 when a security guard at the Watergate complex noticed that a few doors were taped so that they were left unlocked he removed the tape and did not think twice about it but it was only when he returned to find the doors retake 20 got suspicious and called the cops that night five men were arrested on account of attempted burglary and attempted interception of telephone and other communications these men were Virgilio gonzales bernard barker James W McCord jr. Eugene o Martinez and Frank Sturgis the grand jury charged all five men plus E Howard hunt and G gordon Liddy in September for conspiracy burglary and violation of federal wiretapping laws after being tried and convicted in late January it was found that all five men were directly tied to the 1972 community to reelect the president it was suspected that high-ranked government involved as well the investigation the breaking out Watergate was revealed to have been a part of a huge campaign of political spine and sabotage headed by the people running the nixon reelection campaign however on November 7th the president was reelected in the biggest landslide in American history reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of the post uncovered information which linked to breakin and cover up a tons back to the CIA FBI White House and Justice Department they're most knowledgeable anonymous source deep throat who told them of Howard hunts involvement in the break-in and warned them that the FBI was trying to find out who is leaking information of an entire collection of crimes greater than Watergate the child did not end with five burglars but White House staff members were issued subpoenas Senate committee chaired by Senator Ervin was said to examine them April 30th 1973 Nixon was forced to ask for resignation of his two most powerful aides HR Haldeman and John L Richmond and he also fired white house counsel John Dean the tapes Alexandra Butterfield was asked if there was any taping system in the White House and even though reluctant he answered yes there was a recording system which automatically taped what went on in every room including the Oval Office and Nixon's private office the tapes were sub subpoena by a special prosecutor Archibald Cox and later by the Senate Nixon refused to release them but Cox refused to job his subpoena a conversation vital in the case against Nixon took place March 21st 1973 between Nixon and John Dee and where they talked about the Watergate case and the cover-up he spoke about the hush money that the team was being paid for their silence Dean states that hunt is black man in the White House for the money and Nixon says that the blackmail money should during the congregational debate on impeachment those who believed impeachment required a criminal indictable offense focus their attention on ik's ins agreement to blackmail payments making him a part of the cover-up of a conspiracy the audio tapes caused an increasing amount of controversy and when it was found that 18 minutes had been erased from one tape people were suspicious Nixon's personal secretary had said that she erased it by accident but it was found later that many segments from the tapes were found missing issue of the audio tapes went to the Supreme Court on July 24th 1974 in the United States versus Nixon was forced to hand over subpoena tapes to the special prosecutor resignation Halderman L Richmond Mitchell Charles Colson Gordon C Strachan Robert ardian and Kenneth Parkinson's known as the Watergate 7 were inducted for conspiring to hinder the investigation John Dean and Jed Stuart Magruder had already pleaded guilty like others secretary Dwight Chapman was convicted and so was a dry night Republican Lieutenant Governor of California the smoking gun tape was the unknown audio tape that was found release recorded days after the break-in it was a conversation between Nixon and Halderman Haldeman discussed the cover-up plan Nixon approved it and has given a lot of information about the break-ins involvement with his campaign after the release of the tapes Nixon's own lawyers were able to say that Nixon had the line to the nation for two years still Nixon denied any involvement in the situation but after being told that enough votes existed to remove iron pages Nixon decided to resign impact prior to the Watergate scandal everyone in America believed that politicians truly have with the people's best interest in mind there were never any questions as to why politicians do what they do or how they do it basically everyone trusted the government after Watergate Americans began to realize that politicians could be corrupt this realization leads to higher demand from the public to know more of what politicians are doing behind closed doors politically the Watergate scandal showed the darker side of the government and gave the Democrats a chance to rise up the image of the legal system was also severely by Watergate to try and fix this the American Bar Association launched two major reforms also they led a campaign finance reform for legislation culturally Watergate appeared in every aspect of entertainment during that time many journalists started being more aggressive about reporting on politics and also harsher and more cynical media had the power to bring down a government as proved by Woodward and Bernstein additionally it gave new meaning to the First Amendment protection of the freedom of the press nothing is off-limits to the journalists there used to be boundaries that journalists felt had to be kept between the government and the media but after the Watergate scandal these boundaries faded ideals as a part of the Watergate scandal Nixon violated the American ideal Justice Nixon lied to the American people and broke a number of laws he promised to follow as an American citizen and the president of the United States he was an unjust leader as he allowed people who work directly under him to violate laws as well Nixon lost the trust of the people he swore to protect and the discussions I have with congressional and other leaders I have concluded but because of the lot of gate matter I might not have the support of the Congress that I will consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office and the way the interests of the nation will require I have never been a quitter to leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body as president I must book the interests of America first America needs a full-time president and a full-time Congress particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad to continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication but I almost totally absorbed the time and attention of both the president and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home therefore I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby So two guys walk into a bar. Really? No, seriously. Two guys walk into a bar, an ice cream bar: Dave, a physicist working on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, and Steve, a blues singer. "Dave, how's it going?" "Steve, good to see you!" "Two scoops of chocolate almond for me." "Vanilla shake." "Hey, I just saw something about the LHC on TV. You guys found bozo in your detector?" "Well, not exactly. We found a boson, probably the Higgs boson." "What's that?" "It's a particle." "Don't you find particles all the time?" "Yes, but this one means that the Higgs field might really exist." "Field? What field?" "The Higgs field. It's named after Peter Higgs, although many others contributed to the idea. It isn't a field, like where you grow corn, but a hypothetical, invisible kind of force field that pervades the whole universe." "Hmmmm, okay. If it pervades the whole universe, how come I've never seen it? That's a bit strange." "Well, actually, it's not that strange. Think of the air around us. We can't see it or smell it. Well, perhaps in some places we can. But we can detect its presence with sophisticated equipment, like our own bodies. So the fact that we can't see something just makes it a bit harder to determine whether its really there or not." "Alright, go on." "So, we believe this Higgs field is all around us, everywhere in the universe. And what it does is rather special - it gives mass to elementary particles." "What's an elementary particle?" "An elementary particle is what we call particles that have no structure, they can't be divided, they're the basic building blocks of the universe." "I thought those were atoms." "Well, atoms are actually made of smaller components, protons, neutrons, and electrons. While electrons are fundamental particles, neutrons and protons are not. They are made up of other fundamental particles called quarks." "Sounds like Russian dolls. Does it ever end?" "Actually, we don't really know. But our current understanding is called the Standard Model. In it, there are two types of fundamental particles: the fermions, that make up matter, and the bosons, that carry forces. We often order these particles according to their properties, such as mass. We can measure the masses of the particles, but we never really knew where this mass came from or why they have the masses they do." "So how does this Higgs field thing explain mass?" "Well, when a particle passes through the Higgs field, it interacts and gets mass. The more it interacts, the more mass it has." "OK, I kind of get that, but is it really that important? I mean, what if there were no Higgs field?" "If there were no Higgs field, the world wouldn't exist at all. There would be no stars, no planets, no air, no anything, not even that spoon or the ice cream you're eating." "Oh, that would be bad. Okay, but where does this Higgs boson fit into things?" "Alright, now, you see the cherry in my shake?" "Can I have it?" "No, not yet. We have to use it as an analogy first." "Oh, right, the cherry's the Higgs boson." "No, not quite. The cherry is a particle moving through the Higgs field, the shake. The shake gives the cherry its mass." "I get it. Okay, so the molecules of the shake are the Higgs bosons!" "Well, you're getting closer. It takes an excitation of the Higgs field to produce the Higgs boson. So, for example, if I were to add energy by, say, dropping this cherry in the shake," "Ah, then the drops that spill on the bar are the Higgs bosons." "Almost! The splash itself is the Higgs boson." "Are you serious?" "Well, that's what quantum mechanics teaches us. In fact, all particles are excitations of fields." "Okay, right. Well, I kind of see why you like particle physics, it's quite cool, strange, but cool." "Yeah, you could call it a bit strange, it's not like everyday life. The Higgs boson is an excitation of the Higgs field. By finding the Higgs boson, we know that the Higgs field exists." "Right. So now you found it, we know this Higgs field exists. You must be done. Is there anything left of particle physics?" "Actually, we've just begun. It's a bit like, you know, when Columbus thought he had found a new route to India. He'd, indeed, found something new, but not quite what he was expecting. So, first, we need to make sure that the boson we found is actually the Higgs boson. It seems to fit, but we need to measure its properties to be sure." "How'd you do that?" "Take a lot more data. This new boson lives for only a very short time before it breaks down or decays into lighter, more stable particles. By measuring these particles, you learn about the properties of the boson." "And what exactly are you looking for?" "Well, the Standard Model predicts how often and in what ways the Higgs boson would decay to the various, lighter particles. So we want to see if the particle we have found is the one predicted by the Standard Model or if it fits into other possible theoretical models." "And if it fits a different model?" "That would be even more exciting! In fact, that's how science advances. We replace old models with new ones if they better explain our observations." "Right, so it seems like finding this Higgs boson gives a direction for exploration, a bit like that Columbus guy heading west." "Exactly! And this is really just the beginning."

"Well, you're getting closer. It takes an excitation of the Higgs field to produce the Higgs boson. So, for example, if I were to add energy by, say, dropping this cherry in the shake," "Ah, then the drops that spill on the bar are the Higgs bosons." "Almost! The splash itself is the Higgs boson." "Are you serious?" "Well, that's what quantum mechanics teaches us. In fact, all particles are excitations of fields." "Okay, right. Well, I kind of see why you like particle physics, it's quite cool, strange, but cool." "Yeah, you could call it a bit strange, it's not like everyday life. The Higgs boson is an excitation of the Higgs field. By finding the Higgs boson, we know that the Higgs field exists." "Right. So now you found it, we know this Higgs field exists. You must be done. Is there anything left of particle physics?" "Actually, we've just begun. It's a bit like, you know, when Columbus thought he had found a new route to India. He'd, indeed, found something new, but not quite what he was expecting. So, first, we need to make sure that the boson we found is actually the Higgs boson. It seems to fit, but we need to measure its properties to be sure." "How'd you do that?" "Take a lot more data. This new boson lives for only a very short time before it breaks down or decays into lighter, more stable particles. By measuring these particles, you learn about the properties of the boson." "And what exactly are you looking for?" "Well, the Standard Model predicts how often and in what ways the Higgs boson would decay to the various, lighter particles. So we want to see if the particle we have found is the one predicted by the Standard Model or if it fits into other possible theoretical models." "And if it fits a different model?" "That would be even more exciting! In fact, that's how science advances. We replace old models with new ones if they better explain our observations." "Right, so it seems like finding this Higgs boson gives a direction for exploration, a bit like that Columbus guy heading west." "Exactly! And this is really just the beginning."

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby So two guys walk into a bar. Really? No, seriously. Two guys walk into a bar, an ice cream bar: Dave, a physicist working on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, and Steve, a blues singer. "Dave, how's it going?" "Steve, good to see you!" "Two scoops of chocolate almond for me." "Vanilla shake." "Hey, I just saw something about the LHC on TV. You guys found bozo in your detector?" "Well, not exactly. We found a boson, probably the Higgs boson." "What's that?" "It's a particle." "Don't you find particles all the time?" "Yes, but this one means that the Higgs field might really exist." "Field? What field?" "The Higgs field. It's named after Peter Higgs, although many others contributed to the idea. It isn't a field, like where you grow corn, but a hypothetical, invisible kind of force field that pervades the whole universe." "Hmmmm, okay. If it pervades the whole universe, how come I've never seen it? That's a bit strange." "Well, actually, it's not that strange. Think of the air around us. We can't see it or smell it. Well, perhaps in some places we can. But we can detect its presence with sophisticated equipment, like our own bodies. So the fact that we can't see something just makes it a bit harder to determine whether its really there or not." "Alright, go on." "So, we believe this Higgs field is all around us, everywhere in the universe. And what it does is rather special - it gives mass to elementary particles." "What's an elementary particle?" "An elementary particle is what we call particles that have no structure, they can't be divided, they're the basic building blocks of the universe." "I thought those were atoms." "Well, atoms are actually made of smaller components, protons, neutrons, and electrons. While electrons are fundamental particles, neutrons and protons are not. They are made up of other fundamental particles called quarks." "Sounds like Russian dolls. Does it ever end?" "Actually, we don't really know. But our current understanding is called the Standard Model. In it, there are two types of fundamental particles: the fermions, that make up matter, and the bosons, that carry forces. We often order these particles according to their properties, such as mass. We can measure the masses of the particles, but we never really knew where this mass came from or why they have the masses they do." "So how does this Higgs field thing explain mass?" "Well, when a particle passes through the Higgs field, it interacts and gets mass. The more it interacts, the more mass it has." "OK, I kind of get that, but is it really that important? I mean, what if there were no Higgs field?" "If there were no Higgs field, the world wouldn't exist at all. There would be no stars, no planets, no air, no anything, not even that spoon or the ice cream you're eating." "Oh, that would be bad. Okay, but where does this Higgs boson fit into things?" "Alright, now, you see the cherry in my shake?" "Can I have it?" "No, not yet. We have to use it as an analogy first." "Oh, right, the cherry's the Higgs boson." "No, not quite.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6, but it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 6 is the closest match because it is related to the Higgs boson, which is a type of boson.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about bosons and their role in the universe. Unfortunately, there isn't a perfect match among the provided generated MCQs.

However, if I had to choose the closest match, I would say Question 6 is the closest.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar "I need a hero!" So many people in distress have said this, but why? What kind of hero do we need and do we even really even need a hero at all? Well, if you look at any piece of literature written for page, script, or stage, the answer is yes! But, heroes come in all shapes and sizes, depending on what needs to be dealt with. First, you have your epic heroes. Epic heroes usually come from a famous family, have super-human strength, are unusually good-looking. They take on challenges that no one else will and succeed. They have great journeys and adventures, some supernatural and some, right here on Earth. Beowulf does all of this. He travels across the sea with his band of warriors to help another king defeat a supernatural monster that has been terrorizing his kingdom. He defeats the monster and the monster's mother in an epic battle, and then goes back home and becomes king himself. In his old age, he has one more monster to face, one more threat that he must keep from his people, a dragon. Now, being an epic hero, of course he wins, but he is also human, and so he also dies. But he leaves behind stories to inspire others even today. Next, we have our tragic heroes. Tragic heroes are usually leaders or powerful characters, but the tragic hero is also majorly flawed and that flaw usually leads him down the path to a horrible and tragic death. Take the story of Oedipus the King, for example. One day, a young man travels to a town called Thebes. On the way, he kills a man for not yielding to him on the road in the first documented case of road rage. He also defeats a magical creature and is rewarded by becoming the King of Thebes, and thus, marrying their queen. Well, that's not so tragic, right? Wrong! The queen he just married is actually his birth mother! Oedipus was supposed to have been killed as a child by a servant, but instead he was given to another family. Oh, and the man he killed on the road, the previous King of Thebes and his dad. So he killed his father and married his mother. Now that is quite tragic. Not tragic enough for you? Try this one. Romeo Montague is a guy born into a wealthy family and finds the love of his life at a party, Juliet. But, Juliet is from a different family that just so happens to hate his family. Instead of being patient and working through the family feud, Romeo decides he must have his love now, and his impatience leads to bloodshed and death, including his own and Juliet's. Moving on to romantic heroes. Now these guys might sound like they might have a better love life and chance at happiness, but that's not always the case. These heroes are emotional and very human. But there is something magical about them. Some have a miraculous birth and then are separated from their family. Others use enchanted swords or get help from magical beans. They could also reject the expectations of society and adhere to their own code of morality. And in the end, the hero triumphs over evil in an idyllic way, but at great personal, emotional sacrifice. King Arthur is a good example of a romantic hero. Sure, he became king and married the love of his life, but he was also killed by his son, who was born out of wedlock, and had his wife cheat on him with his best friend. So, although he, too, like Beowulf, was a great king, he suffered much more for the greater purpose of society, which makes him more human and relatable to us all. There are different heroes for different situations. Sometimes we need the strong warrior to slay the evils of the world. At other times, we need a common person who becomes great so that they can inspire us all to be better. So do we need heroes? Absolutely! No matter what the time or place, we still need something to believe in. They remind us of the good in each of us, and the need for hope and the importance of knowledge.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar "I need a hero!" So many people in distress have said this, but why? What kind of hero do we need and do we even really even need a hero at all? Well, if you look at any piece of literature written for page, script, or stage, the answer is yes! But, heroes come in all shapes and sizes, depending on what needs to be dealt with. First, you have your epic heroes. Epic heroes usually come from a famous family, have super-human strength, are unusually good-looking. They take on challenges that no one else will and succeed. They have great journeys and adventures, some supernatural and some, right here on Earth. Beowulf does all of this. He travels across the sea with his band of warriors to help another king defeat a supernatural monster that has been terrorizing his kingdom. He defeats the monster and the monster's mother in an epic battle, and then goes back home and becomes king himself. In his old age, he has one more monster to face, one more threat that he must keep from his people, a dragon. Now, being an epic hero, of course he wins, but he is also human, and so he also dies. But he leaves behind stories to inspire others even today. Next, we have our tragic heroes. Tragic heroes are usually leaders or powerful characters, but the tragic hero is also majorly flawed and that flaw usually leads him down the path to a horrible and tragic death. Take the story of Oedipus the King, for example. One day, a young man travels to a town called Thebes. On the way, he kills a man for not yielding to him on the road in the first documented case of road rage. He also defeats a magical creature and is rewarded by becoming the King of Thebes, and thus, marrying their queen. Well, that's not so tragic, right? Wrong! The queen he just married is actually his birth mother! Oedipus was supposed to have been killed as a child by a servant, but instead he was given to another family. Oh, and the man he killed on the road, the previous King of Thebes and his dad. So he killed his father and married his mother. Now that is quite tragic. Not tragic enough for you? Try this one. Romeo Montague is a guy born into a wealthy family and finds the love of his life at a party, Juliet. But, Juliet is from a different family that just so happens to hate his family. Instead of being patient and working through the family feud, Romeo decides he must have his love now, and his impatience leads to bloodshed and death, including his own and Juliet's. Moving on to romantic heroes. Now these guys might sound like they might have a better love life and chance at happiness, but that's not always the case. These heroes are emotional and very human. But there is something magical about them. Some have a miraculous birth and then are separated from their family. Others use enchanted swords or get help from magical beans. They could also reject the expectations of society and adhere to their own code of morality. And in the end, the hero triumphs over evil in an idyllic way, but at great personal, emotional sacrifice. King Arthur is a good example of a romantic hero. Sure, he became king and married the love of his life, but he was also killed by his son, who was born out of wedlock, and had his wife cheat on him with his best friend. So, although he, too, like Beowulf, was a great king, he suffered much more for the greater purpose of society, which makes him more human and relatable to us all. There are different heroes for different situations. Sometimes we need the strong warrior to slay the evils of the world. At other times, we need a common person who becomes great so that they can inspire us all to be better. So do we need heroes? Absolutely! No matter what the time or place, we still need something to believe in. They remind us of the good in each of us, and the need for hope and the importance of knowledge.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I like to think of life science as one big pyramid. Let's call the pyramid, "biological organization". Let's work our way from very small and specific concepts to very large and complex topics. So let's start at the tip of the pyramid, with something so small, it can't be seen by the human eye, a single cell. A cell by itself is the most basic component of life. A single cell, which is capable of living on its own, is called a unicellular organism, organisms like bacteria or protists. These organisms are everywhere you look, you just can't see them. But, when cells join together, with more than one cell like itself to perform a similar function, it's no longer a unicellular organism. It's then called a tissue. No, not that kind of tissue. There are four types of tissues found in the human body: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial. Bone tissue is a type of connective tissue and it's not flimsy like a Kleenex at all. Blood is also an example of the same cells working together to perform the same job, but it's a liquid, again, not like a Kleenex at all. No matter what the consistency is, a tissue is a group of the same cells, working together to perform a similar function. Any time there are different tissues working together, we then call it an organ. That's the next level of the pyramid. Animals aren't the only ones with organs; plants have organs too. When we find multiple different organs working together to perform the same job, we then call it an organ system. Take the digestive system, for example. It's made up of a mouth, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, gall bladder, small intestine, and large intestine, also known as your colon. Although each individual organ in this organ system does a very different job, together, these organs work to achieve the one goal of taking all the nutrients out of the food we eat and getting rid of what we don't need. An organ system, by definition, can only do one job, like get the nutrients from our food, send and receive electrical signals, or exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide. Regardless of their individual function, all organ systems rely on one another to do the vital jobs which they can't do themselves. If one organ system doesn't work, the others will shut down, too. An organism is a complicated, living thing, which requires the proper functioning of multiple organ systems to maintain stability. This stability is called homeostasis. When all organ systems are working together and maintaining homeostasis, then it results in a happy, living organism. Organisms are incredibly diverse and can be as simple as a bacteria or as complex as you. When a group of the same organisms, also known as a species, live together in the same environment, we then call it a population. Often there are several populations all living in one environment. That is what we call a community. Each time you look out the window, you're seeing a community. When we look at multiple communities, along with how all of the organisms interact with the physical environment, then we refer to it as an ecosystem. When you look at all the ecosystems of Earth together, you're looking at the Earth. The Earth is a big, round circle of life. That's why we call it a biosphere - bio, meaning life and sphere, meaning circle. And there you go! When you break it down to each level, a very complex concept and phrase becomes easy to understand. All life starts with a single cell. When cells join together, they are called a tissue. A group of different tissues are called an organ, and a group of different organs are an organ system. A group of organ systems working together make up an organism, and a group of the same organisms are a population. Combining several different populations together give us a community. And several different communities in a large area is an ecosystem. And every ecosystem together makes up our biosphere. And that, my friends, is biological organization, the pyramid of life.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I like to think of life science as one big pyramid. Let's call the pyramid, "biological organization". Let's work our way from very small and specific concepts to very large and complex topics. So let's start at the tip of the pyramid, with something so small, it can't be seen by the human eye, a single cell. A cell by itself is the most basic component of life. A single cell, which is capable of living on its own, is called a unicellular organism, organisms like bacteria or protists. These organisms are everywhere you look, you just can't see them. But, when cells join together, with more than one cell like itself to perform a similar function, it's no longer a unicellular organism. It's then called a tissue. No, not that kind of tissue. There are four types of tissues found in the human body: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial. Bone tissue is a type of connective tissue and it's not flimsy like a Kleenex at all. Blood is also an example of the same cells working together to perform the same job, but it's a liquid, again, not like a Kleenex at all. No matter what the consistency is, a tissue is a group of the same cells, working together to perform a similar function. Any time there are different tissues working together, we then call it an organ. That's the next level of the pyramid. Animals aren't the only ones with organs; plants have organs too. When we find multiple different organs working together to perform the same job, we then call it an organ system. Take the digestive system, for example. It's made up of a mouth, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, gall bladder, small intestine, and large intestine, also known as your colon. Although each individual organ in this organ system does a very different job, together, these organs work to achieve the one goal of taking all the nutrients out of the food we eat and getting rid of what we don't need. An organ system, by definition, can only do one job, like get the nutrients from our food, send and receive electrical signals, or exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide. Regardless of their individual function, all organ systems rely on one another to do the vital jobs which they can't do themselves. If one organ system doesn't work, the others will shut down, too. An organism is a complicated, living thing, which requires the proper functioning of multiple organ systems to maintain stability. This stability is called homeostasis. When all organ systems are working together and maintaining homeostasis, then it results in a happy, living organism. Organisms are incredibly diverse and can be as simple as a bacteria or as complex as you. When a group of the same organisms, also known as a species, live together in the same environment, we then call it a population. Often there are several populations all living in one environment. That is what we call a community. Each time you look out the window, you're seeing a community. When we look at multiple communities, along with how all of the organisms interact with the physical environment, then we refer to it as an ecosystem. When you look at all the ecosystems of Earth together, you're looking at the Earth. The Earth is a big, round circle of life. That's why we call it a biosphere - bio, meaning life and sphere, meaning circle. And there you go! When you break it down to each level, a very complex concept and phrase becomes easy to understand. All life starts with a single cell. When cells join together, they are called a tissue. A group of different tissues are called an organ, and a group of different organs are an organ system. A group of organ systems working together make up an organism, and a group of the same organisms are a population. Combining several different populations together give us a community. And several different communities in a large area is an ecosystem. And every ecosystem together makes up our biosphere. And that, my friends, is biological organization, the pyramid of life.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered who has the authority to make laws or punish people who break them? When we think of power in the United States, we usually think of the President, but he does not act alone. In fact, he is only one piece of the power puzzle and for very good reason. When the American Revolution ended in 1783, the United States government was in a state of change. The founding fathers knew that they did not want to establish another country that was ruled by a king, so the discussions were centered on having a strong and fair national government that protected individual freedoms and did not abuse its power. When the new constitution was adopted in 1787, the structure of the infant government of the United States called for three separate branches, each with their own powers, and a system of checks and balances. This would ensure that no one branch would ever become too powerful because the other branches would always be able to check the power of the other two. These branches work together to run the country and set guidelines for us all to live by. The legislative branch is described in Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution. Many people feel that the founding fathers put this branch in the document first because they thought it was the most important. The legislative branch is comprised of 100 U.S. Senators and 435 members in the U.S. House of Representatives. This is better known as the U.S. Congress. Making laws is the primary function of the legislative branch, but it is also responsible for approving federal judges and justices, passing the national budget, and declaring war. Each state gets two Senators and some number of Representatives, depending on how many people live in that state. The executive branch is described in Article 2 of the Constitution. The leaders of this branch of government are the President and Vice President, who are responsible for enforcing the laws that Congress sets forth. The President works closely with a group of advisors, known as the Cabinet. These appointed helpers assist the President in making important decisions within their area of expertise, such as defense, the treasury, and homeland security. The executive branch also appoints government officials, commands the armed forces, and meets with leaders of other nations. All that combined is a lot of work for a lot of people. In fact, the executive branch employs over 4 million people to get everything done. The third brand of the U.S. government is the judicial branch and is detailed in Article 3. This branch is comprised of all the courts in the land, from the federal district courts to the U.S. Supreme Court. These courts interpret our nation's laws and punish those who break them. The highest court, the Supreme Court, settles disputes among states, hears appeals from state and federal courts, and determines if federal laws are constitutional. There are nine justices on the Supreme Court, and, unlike any other job in our government, Supreme Court justices are appointed for life, or for as long as they want to stay. Our democracy depends on an informed citizenry, so it is our duty to know how it works and what authority each branch of government has over its citizens. Besides voting, chances are that some time in your life you'll be called upon to participate in your government, whether it is to serve on a jury, testify in court, or petition your Congress person to pass or defeat an idea for a law. By knowning the branches, who runs them, and how they work together, you can be involved, informed, and intelligent.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

Although the wording of the questions is different, the intent and content of Question 1 align with the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks who the Founding Fathers did not want ruling the United States, and the correct answer is "A king." Question 1 asks about the primary concern of the founding fathers when establishing the United States government, and the correct answer is "To establish a strong and fair national government that protected individual freedoms." This implies that the founding fathers did not want a government ruled by a king, which is the same intent as the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that the options in Question 1 do not directly match the options in the ground truth MCQ. If there was a generated MCQ that more directly asked about the type of ruler the Founding Fathers did not want, it would be a more exact match.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered who has the authority to make laws or punish people who break them? When we think of power in the United States, we usually think of the President, but he does not act alone. In fact, he is only one piece of the power puzzle and for very good reason. When the American Revolution ended in 1783, the United States government was in a state of change. The founding fathers knew that they did not want to establish another country that was ruled by a king, so the discussions were centered on having a strong and fair national government that protected individual freedoms and did not abuse its power. When the new constitution was adopted in 1787, the structure of the infant government of the United States called for three separate branches, each with their own powers, and a system of checks and balances. This would ensure that no one branch would ever become too powerful because the other branches would always be able to check the power of the other two. These branches work together to run the country and set guidelines for us all to live by. The legislative branch is described in Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution. Many people feel that the founding fathers put this branch in the document first because they thought it was the most important. The legislative branch is comprised of 100 U.S. Senators and 435 members in the U.S. House of Representatives. This is better known as the U.S. Congress. Making laws is the primary function of the legislative branch, but it is also responsible for approving federal judges and justices, passing the national budget, and declaring war. Each state gets two Senators and some number of Representatives, depending on how many people live in that state. The executive branch is described in Article 2 of the Constitution. The leaders of this branch of government are the President and Vice President, who are responsible for enforcing the laws that Congress sets forth. The President works closely with a group of advisors, known as the Cabinet. These appointed helpers assist the President in making important decisions within their area of expertise, such as defense, the treasury, and homeland security. The executive branch also appoints government officials, commands the armed forces, and meets with leaders of other nations. All that combined is a lot of work for a lot of people. In fact, the executive branch employs over 4 million people to get everything done. The third brand of the U.S. government is the judicial branch and is detailed in Article 3. This branch is comprised of all the courts in the land, from the federal district courts to the U.S. Supreme Court. These courts interpret our nation's laws and punish those who break them. The highest court, the Supreme Court, settles disputes among states, hears appeals from state and federal courts, and determines if federal laws are constitutional. There are nine justices on the Supreme Court, and, unlike any other job in our government, Supreme Court justices are appointed for life, or for as long as they want to stay. Our democracy depends on an informed citizenry, so it is our duty to know how it works and what authority each branch of government has over its citizens. Besides voting, chances are that some time in your life you'll be called upon to participate in your government, whether it is to serve on a jury, testify in court, or petition your Congress person to pass or defeat an idea for a law. By knowning the branches, who runs them, and how they work together, you can be involved, informed, and intelligent.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 3: What is the primary function of the legislative branch?** is not the most similar, because the ground truth question is about commanding the US military.

**Question 5: What is the role of the Cabinet in the executive branch?** is not the most similar, because the ground truth question is about commanding the US military.

However, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about commanding the US military. 

But, **Question 3** has an option that says: "D. To command the armed forces", which is the closest match to the ground truth question.

However, a more careful analysis reveals that **Question 5** has an option that says: "D. To command the armed forces",  this option directly matches the content of the ground truth question, even though the question itself does not directly match.

Considering that the ground truth question specifically asks about commanding the US military, which is an option in question 5 and that question 5 is about the executive branch, which is the branch that commands the US military according to the ground truth question.

The most similar generated MCQ is **Question 5**

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: Which branch of government has the power to settle disputes among states? Options: A. Executive branch, B. Judicial branch, C. Legislative branch, D. Both A and C Correct Option: B.

However, an even more similar question would be one that directly asks about determining the constitutionality of federal laws. Since that is not available, the next closest match would be a question related to the Supreme Court's role.

But there is another question that is more similar. Question 7 is about the Supreme Court, but it's about the number of justices. Question 6 is about the judicial branch, and while it's not a direct match, it does mention the Supreme Court's role in the transcript.

Upon closer inspection, Question 6 is still not the best match because it does not directly address the constitutionality of federal laws.

A better match would be a question that directly involves the Supreme Court. The ground truth MCQ directly asks about determining the constitutionality of federal laws, which is a specific function of the Supreme Court.

Since there isn't a question that directly asks about the Supreme Court determining the constitutionality of federal laws, the next best match is a question that involves the Supreme Court.

In this case, the best match would be a question that is specifically about the Supreme Court. Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is about the Supreme Court, but it's about the number of justices, not its role in determining the constitutionality of federal laws.

However, Question 6 does mention the judicial branch and implies the Supreme Court's role in settling disputes, which could include determining the constitutionality of federal laws.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, Question 6 is still the closest match because it's about the judicial branch, which includes the Supreme Court.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs directly ask about determining the constitutionality of federal laws.

The best match is Question 6, but since the options and the question do not directly address the issue of constitutionality, it is not a perfect match.

Considering all the options, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 6, but with the understanding that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar It's that time again. You need another internship to bolster your college applications. Last year you worked at a local art museum, helping organize their collection and giving tours to visitors. This year, it's going to be much more difficult. You want to work on an organic farm across the country in California. That's your real passion. Unfortunately, your friends' list of contacts doesn't include organic farmers. The same for your parents' group of friends. They want to help you, but they simply don't know of any internships in agriculture. The school counselor, she just laughed. To make your farming dreams come true, you're going to have to press beyond your strong ties, people like your family and closest friends, and try tapping into your weaker ties. Weak ties are a broader network, your friends of friends of friends. They're important because they have access to resources that your strong ties don't have. This works in both directions, by the way - you have access to resources that they don't have. Let's say most people speak to three close friends on a regular basis. Each time you reach beyond the next degree of contacts, you have access to three more people, like a tree that branches out three times per node, so you can look beyond your closest circles. During the last family get-together, didn't you hear that your aunt's friend studied lighting with a nature photographer on the West Coast? In fact, you recall this because you saw a recent image by said photographer on the front cover of The New York Times. So, you email him and learn that the photographer's wife's cousin publishes a sustainability magazine, which employs a staff writer who pitches on a local baseball team with an umpire who, wait for it, is an organic farmer. Bingo! Get ready to trade in those cuff links for some apple seeds, all because you reached out to your weak ties. That's your key, remember? Every conversation is an opportunity. Moreover, don't wait for opportunity, make it happen. Take Kathryn Minshew for example. She went from not knowing anyone at Yahoo to three warm introductions to major executives in 30 days. Here are her suggestions for three steps to networking. 1 - Always say yes to invitations, even if it's not clear what you'll get out of the meeting. Many of Kathryn's most productive relationships resulted from a meeting or call without a clear agenda. 2 - When you want something, broadcast it to everyone you meet. That doesn't mean you beg everyone for help as soon as you meet them, but talk about what you're trying to do. Be excited, ask for feedback, and try to get them excited too. 3 - Show up and often. Be at the forefront of other's minds when opportunities arise. You don't want to be that person who only shows up when he needs something. Be the one that people think of and want to reach out to when a new opportunity presents itself. So while networking may not be the most intuitive, or even for some of you introverts, the most comfortable skill, it's a helpful tool to have as you think about getting a job, going to school, or most importantly, learning from others. Good luck!

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar It's that time again. You need another internship to bolster your college applications. Last year you worked at a local art museum, helping organize their collection and giving tours to visitors. This year, it's going to be much more difficult. You want to work on an organic farm across the country in California. That's your real passion. Unfortunately, your friends' list of contacts doesn't include organic farmers. The same for your parents' group of friends. They want to help you, but they simply don't know of any internships in agriculture. The school counselor, she just laughed. To make your farming dreams come true, you're going to have to press beyond your strong ties, people like your family and closest friends, and try tapping into your weaker ties. Weak ties are a broader network, your friends of friends of friends. They're important because they have access to resources that your strong ties don't have. This works in both directions, by the way - you have access to resources that they don't have. Let's say most people speak to three close friends on a regular basis. Each time you reach beyond the next degree of contacts, you have access to three more people, like a tree that branches out three times per node, so you can look beyond your closest circles. During the last family get-together, didn't you hear that your aunt's friend studied lighting with a nature photographer on the West Coast? In fact, you recall this because you saw a recent image by said photographer on the front cover of The New York Times. So, you email him and learn that the photographer's wife's cousin publishes a sustainability magazine, which employs a staff writer who pitches on a local baseball team with an umpire who, wait for it, is an organic farmer. Bingo! Get ready to trade in those cuff links for some apple seeds, all because you reached out to your weak ties. That's your key, remember? Every conversation is an opportunity. Moreover, don't wait for opportunity, make it happen. Take Kathryn Minshew for example. She went from not knowing anyone at Yahoo to three warm introductions to major executives in 30 days. Here are her suggestions for three steps to networking. 1 - Always say yes to invitations, even if it's not clear what you'll get out of the meeting. Many of Kathryn's most productive relationships resulted from a meeting or call without a clear agenda. 2 - When you want something, broadcast it to everyone you meet. That doesn't mean you beg everyone for help as soon as you meet them, but talk about what you're trying to do. Be excited, ask for feedback, and try to get them excited too. 3 - Show up and often. Be at the forefront of other's minds when opportunities arise. You don't want to be that person who only shows up when he needs something. Be the one that people think of and want to reach out to when a new opportunity presents itself. So while networking may not be the most intuitive, or even for some of you introverts, the most comfortable skill, it's a helpful tool to have as you think about getting a job, going to school, or most importantly, learning from others. Good luck!

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so people want a lot of things out of life but I think more than anything else they want happiness Aristotle called happiness the chief good the end towards which all other things aim according to this view the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable it's that we expect them to bring us happiness now in the last 50 years we Americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want we're richer we live longer we have access to technology that would have seems like science fiction just a few years ago the paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically we haven't actually gotten any happier maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness there's been an increased interest in recent years and happiness itself people have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time in fact for thousands of years but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved why is with many other domains in life I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question in fact in the last few years there's been an explosion in research on happiness for example we've learned a lot about its demographics how things like income and education gender and marriage relate to it but one of the puzzles this is revealed is that factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect yes it's better to make more money rather than less or to graduate from college instead of dropping out but the differences in happiness tend to be small which leaves the question what are the big causes of happiness I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet but I think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences it certainly seems that we're going about our lives that what we're doing who were with what we're thinking about have a big influence on our happiness and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult in fact almost impossible for scientists to study a few years ago I came up with a way to study people's happiness moment-to-moment is they're going about their daily lives on the massive scale all over the world something we've never been able to do before called track your happiness org it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real-time how does this work basically I send people signals at random points throughout the day and then I ask them a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience at the instant just before the signal the idea is that if we can watch how people's happiness goes up and down over the course of the day minute to minute in some cases and try to understand how what people are doing who they're with what they're thinking about and all the other factors that describe our day how those might relate to those changes in happiness we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness we've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data a lot more data of this kind than I think has ever been collected before over 650,000 real-time reports from over 15,000 people and it's not just a lot of people it's a really diverse group people from wide range of Ages from eighteen to late 80s a wide range of incomes education levels people who are married divorced widowed etc they collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries what I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been investigating and that's mind wandering as human beings we have this unique ability to have our mind stray away from the present this guy is sitting here working on his computer and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month wondering was gonna have for dinner maybe he's worried that he's going bald this ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing it allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can and yet it's not clear what the relationship is between our use of disability and our happiness you've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present be here now you've probably heard a hundred times maybe to really be happy we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment maybe these people right maybe wandering is a bad thing on the other hand when our minds wander their unconstrained we can't change the physical reality in front of us but we can go anywhere in our minds since we know people want to be happy maybe when our minds wander they're going to someplace happier than the place that they're leaving it would make a lot of sense in other words maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind wandering well since I'm a scientist I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I asked with track your happiness remember this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives there's three questions the first one is a happiness question how do you feel on a scale ranging from very bad to very good second an activity question what are you doing on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV and finally a mind wandering question are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing people could say no in other words I'm focused only on my task or yes I am thinking about something else and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant neutral or unpleasant any of those yes responses are what we called mind wandering so what did we find this graph shows happiness on the vertical axis and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they're focused on the present when they're not mind wandering as it turns out people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they're not now you might look at this result and say okay sure on average people are less happy when their mind wandering but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with at least then mind wandering should be doing something good for us nope as it turns out people are less happy when their mind wandering no matter what they're doing for example people don't really like commuting to work very much it's one of their least enjoyable activities and yet they are substantially happier when they're focused only on their commute then when their mind is going off to something else it's amazing so how could this be happening I think part of the reason a big part of the is that when our minds wander we often think about unpleasant things and they are enormous ly less happy when they do that our worries our anxieties our regrets and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral they're still considerably less happy than when they're not mind wandering at all even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant they're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren't mind wandering if mind wandering we're a slot-machine would be like having the chance to lose $50 $20 or $1 right you'd never want to play so I've been talking about this suggesting perhaps that mind wandering causes unhappiness but all I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated it's possible that's the case but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy then they mind wonder maybe that's what's really going on how could we ever disentangle these two possibilities well one in fact that we can take advantage of I think a fact you'll all agree is true is that time goes forward not backward right the cause has to come before the effect we're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person and so we can look and see does mind-wandering tend to precede unhappiness or does unhappiness tend to precede mind-wandering to get some insight into the causal direction as it turns out there is a strong relationship between mind wandering now and being unhappy a short time later consistent with the idea that mind wandering is causing people to be unhappy in contrast there's no relationship between being unhappy now and mind wandering a short time later in other words mind wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause and not merely a consequence of unhappiness a few minutes ago I likened mind-wandering to a slot machine you'd never want to play well how often do people's minds wander turns out they wonder a lot in fact really a lot forty-seven percent of the time people were thinking about something other than what they're currently doing how does that depend on what people are doing this shows the rate of mind wandering across 22 activities ranging from a high of 65 percent when people are taking a shower brushing their teeth to 50% when they're working to 40% when they're exercising all the way down to this one and short bar on the right that I think some of you were probably laughing at 10% of the time people's minds are wandering when they're having sex but there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph and that is basically with one exception no matter what people are doing their mind wandering at least thirty percent of the time which suggests I think that mind wandering isn't just frequent it's ubiquitous it pervades basically everything that we do in my talk today I've told you a little bit about mind wandering a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness my hope is that over time by tracking people's moments moment happiness and their experiences in daily life will be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness and then in the end a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that's not only richer and healthier but happier as well thank you [Applause] [Music]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so people want a lot of things out of life but I think more than anything else they want happiness Aristotle called happiness the chief good the end towards which all other things aim according to this view the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable it's that we expect them to bring us happiness now in the last 50 years we Americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want we're richer we live longer we have access to technology that would have seems like science fiction just a few years ago the paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically we haven't actually gotten any happier maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness there's been an increased interest in recent years and happiness itself people have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time in fact for thousands of years but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved why is with many other domains in life I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question in fact in the last few years there's been an explosion in research on happiness for example we've learned a lot about its demographics how things like income and education gender and marriage relate to it but one of the puzzles this is revealed is that factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect yes it's better to make more money rather than less or to graduate from college instead of dropping out but the differences in happiness tend to be small which leaves the question what are the big causes of happiness I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet but I think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences it certainly seems that we're going about our lives that what we're doing who were with what we're thinking about have a big influence on our happiness and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult in fact almost impossible for scientists to study a few years ago I came up with a way to study people's happiness moment-to-moment is they're going about their daily lives on the massive scale all over the world something we've never been able to do before called track your happiness org it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real-time how does this work basically I send people signals at random points throughout the day and then I ask them a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience at the instant just before the signal the idea is that if we can watch how people's happiness goes up and down over the course of the day minute to minute in some cases and try to understand how what people are doing who they're with what they're thinking about and all the other factors that describe our day how those might relate to those changes in happiness we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness we've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data a lot more data of this kind than I think has ever been collected before over 650,000 real-time reports from over 15,000 people and it's not just a lot of people it's a really diverse group people from wide range of Ages from eighteen to late 80s a wide range of incomes education levels people who are married divorced widowed etc they collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries what I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been investigating and that's mind wandering as human beings we have this unique ability to have our mind stray away from the present this guy is sitting here working on his computer and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month wondering was gonna have for dinner maybe he's worried that he's going bald this ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing it allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can and yet it's not clear what the relationship is between our use of disability and our happiness you've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present be here now you've probably heard a hundred times maybe to really be happy we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment maybe these people right maybe wandering is a bad thing on the other hand when our minds wander their unconstrained we can't change the physical reality in front of us but we can go anywhere in our minds since we know people want to be happy maybe when our minds wander they're going to someplace happier than the place that they're leaving it would make a lot of sense in other words maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind wandering well since I'm a scientist I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I asked with track your happiness remember this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives there's three questions the first one is a happiness question how do you feel on a scale ranging from very bad to very good second an activity question what are you doing on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV and finally a mind wandering question are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing people could say no in other words I'm focused only on my task or yes I am thinking about something else and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant neutral or unpleasant any of those yes responses are what we called mind wandering so what did we find this graph shows happiness on the vertical axis and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they're focused on the present when they're not mind wandering as it turns out people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they're not now you might look at this result and say okay sure on average people are less happy when their mind wandering but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with at least then mind wandering should be doing something good for us nope as it turns out people are less happy when their mind wandering no matter what they're doing for example people don't really like commuting to work very much it's one of their least enjoyable activities and yet they are substantially happier when they're focused only on their commute then when their mind is going off to something else it's amazing so how could this be happening I think part of the reason a big part of the is that when our minds wander we often think about unpleasant things and they are enormous ly less happy when they do that our worries our anxieties our regrets and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral they're still considerably less happy than when they're not mind wandering at all even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant they're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren't mind wandering if mind wandering we're a slot-machine would be like having the chance to lose $50 $20 or $1 right you'd never want to play so I've been talking about this suggesting perhaps that mind wandering causes unhappiness but all I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated it's possible that's the case but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy then they mind wonder maybe that's what's really going on how could we ever disentangle these two possibilities well one in fact that we can take advantage of I think a fact you'll all agree is true is that time goes forward not backward right the cause has to come before the effect we're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person and so we can look and see does mind-wandering tend to precede unhappiness or does unhappiness tend to precede mind-wandering to get some insight into the causal direction as it turns out there is a strong relationship between mind wandering now and being unhappy a short time later consistent with the idea that mind wandering is causing people to be unhappy in contrast there's no relationship between being unhappy now and mind wandering a short time later in other words mind wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause and not merely a consequence of unhappiness a few minutes ago I likened mind-wandering to a slot machine you'd never want to play well how often do people's minds wander turns out they wonder a lot in fact really a lot forty-seven percent of the time people were thinking about something other than what they're currently doing how does that depend on what people are doing this shows the rate of mind wandering across 22 activities ranging from a high of 65 percent when people are taking a shower brushing their teeth to 50% when they're working to 40% when they're exercising all the way down to this one and short bar on the right that I think some of you were probably laughing at 10% of the time people's minds are wandering when they're having sex but there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph and that is basically with one exception no matter what people are doing their mind wandering at least thirty percent of the time which suggests I think that mind wandering isn't just frequent it's ubiquitous it pervades basically everything that we do in my talk today I've told you a little bit about mind wandering a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness my hope is that over time by tracking people's moments moment happiness and their experiences in daily life will be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness and then in the end a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that's not only richer and healthier but happier as well thank you [Applause] [Music]

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 2: What is the purpose of the Track Your Happiness project?**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the potential causes of happiness. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 3: What is the main finding from the study on mind wandering and happiness?** is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, as it discusses a potential cause of happiness (or unhappiness). However, it is not a direct match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is **Question 2**, but with the caveat that it's not a direct match.

but one of the puzzles this is revealed is that factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect yes it's better to make more money rather than less or to graduate from college instead of dropping out but the differences in happiness tend to be small which leaves the question what are the big causes of happiness I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet but I think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences it certainly seems that we're going about our lives that what we're doing who were with what we're thinking about have a big influence on our happiness and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult in fact almost impossible for scientists to study a few years ago I came up with a way to study people's happiness moment-to-moment is they're going about their daily lives on the massive scale all over the world something we've never been able to do before called track your happiness org it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real-time how does this work basically I send people signals at random points throughout the day and then I ask them a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience at the instant just before the signal the idea is that if we can watch how people's happiness goes up and down over the course of the day minute to minute in some cases and try to understand how what people are doing who they're with what they're thinking about and all the other factors that describe our day how those might relate to those changes in happiness we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness we've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data a lot more data of this kind than I think has ever been collected before over 650,000 real-time reports from over 15,000 people and it's not just a lot of people it's a really diverse group people from wide range of Ages from eighteen to late 80s a wide range of incomes education levels people who are married divorced widowed etc they collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries what I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been investigating and that's mind wandering as human beings we have this unique ability to have our mind stray away from the present this guy is sitting here working on his computer and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month wondering was gonna have for dinner maybe he's worried that he's going bald this ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing it allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can and yet it's not clear what the relationship is between our use of disability and our happiness you've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present be here now you've probably heard a hundred times maybe to really be happy we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment maybe these people right maybe wandering is a bad thing on the other hand when our minds wander their unconstrained we can't change the physical reality in front of us but we can go anywhere in our minds since we know people want to be happy maybe when our minds wander they're going to someplace happier than the place that they're leaving it would make a lot of sense in other words maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind wandering well since I'm a scientist I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I asked with track your happiness remember this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives there's three questions the first one is a happiness question how do you feel on a scale ranging from very bad to very good second an activity question what are you doing on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV and finally a mind wandering question are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing people could say no in other words I'm focused only on my task or yes I am thinking about something else and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant neutral or unpleasant any of those yes responses are what we called mind wandering so what did we find this graph shows happiness on the vertical axis and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they're focused on the present when they're not mind wandering as it turns out people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they're not now you might look at this result and say okay sure on average people are less happy when their mind wandering but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with at least then mind wandering should be doing something good for us nope as it turns out people are less happy when their mind wandering no matter what they're doing for example people don't really like commuting to work very much it's one of their least enjoyable activities and yet they are substantially happier when they're focused only on their commute then when their mind is going off to something else it's amazing so how could this be happening I think part of the reason a big part of the is that when our minds wander we often think about unpleasant things and they are enormous ly less happy when they do that our worries our anxieties our regrets and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral they're still considerably less happy than when they're not mind wandering at all even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant they're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren't mind wandering if mind wandering we're a slot-machine would be like having the chance to lose $50 $20 or $1 right you'd never want to play so I've been talking about this suggesting perhaps that mind wandering causes unhappiness but all I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated it's possible that's the case but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy then they mind wonder maybe that's what's really going on how could we ever disentangle these two possibilities well one in fact that we can take advantage of I think a fact you'll all agree is true is that time goes forward not backward right the cause has to come before the effect we're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person and so we can look and see does mind-wandering tend to precede unhappiness or does unhappiness tend to precede mind-wandering to get some insight into the causal direction as it turns out there is a strong relationship between mind wandering now and being unhappy a short time later consistent with the idea that mind wandering is causing people to be unhappy in contrast there's no relationship between being unhappy now and mind wandering a short time later in other words mind wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause and not merely a consequence of unhappiness a few minutes ago I likened mind-wandering to a slot machine you'd never want to play well how often do people's minds wander turns out they wonder a lot in fact really a lot forty-seven percent of the time people were thinking about something other than what they're currently doing how does that depend on what people are doing this shows the rate of mind wandering across 22 activities ranging from a high of 65 percent when people are taking a shower brushing their teeth to 50% when they're working to 40% when they're exercising all the way down to this one and short bar on the right that I think some of you were probably laughing at 10% of the time people's minds are wandering when they're having sex but there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph and that is basically with one exception no matter what people are doing their mind wandering at least thirty percent of the time which suggests I think that mind wandering isn't just frequent it's ubiquitous it pervades basically everything that we do in my talk today I've told you a little bit about mind wandering a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness my hope is that over time by tracking people's moments moment happiness and their experiences in daily life will be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness and then in the end a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that's not only richer and healthier but happier as well thank you [Applause] [Music]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so people want a lot of things out of life but I think more than anything else they want happiness Aristotle called happiness the chief good the end towards which all other things aim according to this view the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable it's that we expect them to bring us happiness now in the last 50 years we Americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want we're richer we live longer we have access to technology that would have seems like science fiction just a few years ago the paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically we haven't actually gotten any happier maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness there's been an increased interest in recent years and happiness itself people have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time in fact for thousands of years but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved why is with many other domains in life I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question in fact in the last few years there's been an explosion in research on happiness for example we've learned a lot about its demographics how things like income and education gender and marriage relate to it but one of the puzzles this is revealed is that factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect yes it's better to make more money rather than less or to graduate from college

**Transcript**:
Some superheros can move
faster than the wind. The men in Apollo 10 reached a record-breaking speed of around 25,000 miles per hour when the shuttle re-entered the Earth's atmosphere in 1969. Wouldn't we save a lot of time to be able to move that fast? But what's the catch? Air is not empty. Elements like oxygen and nitrogen, even countless dust particles, make up the air around us. When we move past these things in the air, we're rubbing against them and creating a lot of friction, which results in heat. Just like rubbing your hands
together warms them up or rubbing two sticks together makes fire, the faster objects rub together, the more heat is generated. So, if we're running
at 25,000 miles per hour, the heat from friction
would burn our faces off. Even if we somehow withstood the heat, the sand and dirt in the air would still scrape us up with millions of tiny cuts all happening at the same time. Ever seen the front bumper
or grill of a truck? What do you think all the birds
and bugs would do to your open eyes or exposed skin? Okay, so you'll wear a mask to avoid destroying your face. But what about people in buildings between you and your destination? It takes us approximately
one-fifth of a second to react to what we see. By the time we see what is ahead of us and react to it - time times velocity equals distance equals one-fifth of a second times 25,000 miles per hour equals 1.4 miles - we would have gone past it or through it by over a mile. We're either going to kill ourselves by crashing into the nearest
wall at super speed or, worse, if we're indestructible, we've essentially turned
our bodies into missiles that destroy everything in our path. So, long distance travel
at 25,000 miles per hour would leave us burning up, covered in bugs, and leaves no time to react. What about short bursts to a location we can see with no obstacles in between? Okay, let's say a bullet is about to hit a beautiful
damsel in distress. So, our hero swoops in at super speed, grabs her, and carries her to safety. That sounds very romantic, but, in reality, that girl
will probably suffer more damage from the hero than the bullet if he moved her at super speed. Newton's First Law of Motion
deals with inertia, which is the resistance to a change in its state of motion. So, an object will continue moving or staying at the same place unless something changes it. Acceleration is the rate
the velocity changes over time. When the girl at rest, velocity equals zero miles per hour, begins accelerating to reach
the speed within seconds, velocity increases rapidly to 25,000 miles per hour, her brain would crash
into the side of her skull. And, when she stops suddenly, velocity decreases rapidly
back to zero miles per hour, her brain would crash
into the other side of her skull, turning her brain into mush. The brain is too fragile
to handle the sudden movement. So is every part of her
body, for that matter. Remember, it's not the speed
that causes the damage because the astronauts survived Apollo 10, it's the acceleration or sudden stop that causes our internal organs to crash into the front of our bodies the way we move forward in a bus when the driver slams on the brakes. What the hero did to the girl is mathematically the same
as running her over with a space shuttle at maximum speed. She probably died instantly
at the point of impact. He's going to owe this poor
girl's family an apology and a big fat compensation check. Oh, and possibly face jail time. Doctors have to carry liability insurance just in case they make a mistake
and hurt their patients. I wonder how much superhero
insurance policy would cost. Now, which superpower physics lesson will you explore next? Shifting body size and content, super speed, flight, super strength, immortality, and invisibility.

Some superheros can move
faster than the wind. The men in Apollo 10 reached a record-breaking speed of around 25,000 miles per hour when the shuttle re-entered the Earth's atmosphere in 1969. Wouldn't we save a lot of time to be able to move that fast? But what's the catch? Air is not empty. Elements like oxygen and nitrogen, even countless dust particles, make up the air around us. When we move past these things in the air, we're rubbing against them and creating a lot of friction, which results in heat. Just like rubbing your hands
together warms them up or rubbing two sticks together makes fire, the faster objects rub together, the more heat is generated. So, if we're running
at 25,000 miles per hour, the heat from friction
would burn our faces off. Even if we somehow withstood the heat, the sand and dirt in the air would still scrape us up with millions of tiny cuts all happening at the same time. Ever seen the front bumper
or grill of a truck? What do you think all the birds
and bugs would do to your open eyes or exposed skin? Okay, so you'll wear a mask to avoid destroying your face. But what about people in buildings between you and your destination? It takes us approximately
one-fifth of a second to react to what we see. By the time we see what is ahead of us and react to it - time times velocity equals distance equals one-fifth of a second times 25,000 miles per hour equals 1.4 miles - we would have gone past it or through it by over a mile. We're either going to kill ourselves by crashing into the nearest
wall at super speed or, worse, if we're indestructible, we've essentially turned
our bodies into missiles that destroy everything in our path. So, long distance travel
at 25,000 miles per hour would leave us burning up, covered in bugs, and leaves no time to react. What about short bursts to a location we can see with no obstacles in between? Okay, let's say a bullet is about to hit a beautiful
damsel in distress. So, our hero swoops in at super speed, grabs her, and carries her to safety. That sounds very romantic, but, in reality, that girl
will probably suffer more damage from the hero than the bullet if he moved her at super speed. Newton's First Law of Motion
deals with inertia, which is the resistance to a change in its state of motion. So, an object will continue moving or staying at the same place unless something changes it. Acceleration is the rate
the velocity changes over time. When the girl at rest, velocity equals zero miles per hour, begins accelerating to reach
the speed within seconds, velocity increases rapidly to 25,000 miles per hour, her brain would crash
into the side of her skull. And, when she stops suddenly, velocity decreases rapidly
back to zero miles per hour, her brain would crash
into the other side of her skull, turning her brain into mush. The brain is too fragile
to handle the sudden movement. So is every part of her
body, for that matter. Remember, it's not the speed
that causes the damage because the astronauts survived Apollo 10, it's the acceleration or sudden stop that causes our internal organs to crash into the front of our bodies the way we move forward in a bus when the driver slams on the brakes. What the hero did to the girl is mathematically the same
as running her over with a space shuttle at maximum speed. She probably died instantly
at the point of impact. He's going to owe this poor
girl's family an apology and a big fat compensation check. Oh, and possibly face jail time. Doctors have to carry liability insurance just in case they make a mistake
and hurt their patients. I wonder how much superhero
insurance policy would cost. Now, which superpower physics lesson will you explore next? Shifting body size and content, super speed, flight, super strength, immortality, and invisibility.

Have you ever helped set a table and found yourself wondering where to place the forks? Or sat down to eat a restaurant and wondered which utensils to use? Well, here's some simple,
traditional etiquette tips on how to set a table. What would happen if you
set a table like this? It doesn't look good, and you have to clean up the mess before you can even start. Let's try another way. To start, use a placemat or tablecloth, but not both, so the dishes aren't
directly on the table. This is more about looks than etiquette, but it's rare to see nothing under a plate unless you're eating at a picnic table. Set out any flowers, candlesticks, or other decorations you like. Candles are usually only lit at night. Start with utensils for the main course, putting your dinner fork on the left and your dinner knife
on the right-hand side since these are the hands
we use them with. Here's a helpful tip: You always eat outside-in, so to set for salad, we'll put the salad fork to the outside of the dinner fork and the salad knife
to the outside of the dinner knife. We'll have salad first, then our main course. Notice, too, that the knife blades are both pointed toward the plate. This is an old tradition from a time when dinner
knives were quite sharp, and it was a sign of politeness
and nonaggression to keep them pointed
away from other diners. We might have some soup, and since soup usually comes first, the soup spoon goes outside the knives since we use our right hand to hold it. Here's another tip: Only set the table with what you'll need. If you're not eating soup, don't set a soup spoon. Now, for dessert, we'll have ice cream so we'll place the dessert up top since we don't need it for a little while. Notice that the bowl of the spool is pointing to the left. This way, when it's time to eat, you just slide it down and it's in the right spot. If you were having cake, you'd set a fork and flip it 180 degrees so it would be right side-up
on the left instead. Next we'll anchor
our setting with the plate. You can also serve from the kitchen then bring them to the table. The bread plate goes
up and to the left of the setting, and the butter knife goes
on the plate at an angle, again, with the blade pointing in. There's only one spot left, and that's for the drinks. Set the wine glass to the upper right, and then place the water glass
to the left of it at an angle. If you're like me and can never remember which goes where, think water, wine, w-a, w-i; a, i; they go left to right
in alphabetical order. Another tip: To remember left and right
with the bread and the drinks, think B-M-W like the car. B, your bread plate, is on the left; M, your meal, is in the middle, and W, your water, is on the right. Lastly, the napkin traditionally
goes to the left of the forks, though it's okay to put
it underneath them, too. For a fancier meal like this one that takes up a lot of space, we'll put it in the middle. Now we're ready to eat. Hopefully these tips will be helpful the next time you're asked
to help set the table or sit down at a fancy meal. Enjoy!

**Transcript**:
Have you ever helped set a table and found yourself wondering where to place the forks? Or sat down to eat a restaurant and wondered which utensils to use? Well, here's some simple,
traditional etiquette tips on how to set a table. What would happen if you
set a table like this? It doesn't look good, and you have to clean up the mess before you can even start. Let's try another way. To start, use a placemat or tablecloth, but not both, so the dishes aren't
directly on the table. This is more about looks than etiquette, but it's rare to see nothing under a plate unless you're eating at a picnic table. Set out any flowers, candlesticks, or other decorations you like. Candles are usually only lit at night. Start with utensils for the main course, putting your dinner fork on the left and your dinner knife
on the right-hand side since these are the hands
we use them with. Here's a helpful tip: You always eat outside-in, so to set for salad, we'll put the salad fork to the outside of the dinner fork and the salad knife
to the outside of the dinner knife. We'll have salad first, then our main course. Notice, too, that the knife blades are both pointed toward the plate. This is an old tradition from a time when dinner
knives were quite sharp, and it was a sign of politeness
and nonaggression to keep them pointed
away from other diners. We might have some soup, and since soup usually comes first, the soup spoon goes outside the knives since we use our right hand to hold it. Here's another tip: Only set the table with what you'll need. If you're not eating soup, don't set a soup spoon. Now, for dessert, we'll have ice cream so we'll place the dessert up top since we don't need it for a little while. Notice that the bowl of the spool is pointing to the left. This way, when it's time to eat, you just slide it down and it's in the right spot. If you were having cake, you'd set a fork and flip it 180 degrees so it would be right side-up
on the left instead. Next we'll anchor
our setting with the plate. You can also serve from the kitchen then bring them to the table. The bread plate goes
up and to the left of the setting, and the butter knife goes
on the plate at an angle, again, with the blade pointing in. There's only one spot left, and that's for the drinks. Set the wine glass to the upper right, and then place the water glass
to the left of it at an angle. If you're like me and can never remember which goes where, think water, wine, w-a, w-i; a, i; they go left to right
in alphabetical order. Another tip: To remember left and right
with the bread and the drinks, think B-M-W like the car. B, your bread plate, is on the left; M, your meal, is in the middle, and W, your water, is on the right. Lastly, the napkin traditionally
goes to the left of the forks, though it's okay to put
it underneath them, too. For a fancier meal like this one that takes up a lot of space, we'll put it in the middle. Now we're ready to eat. Hopefully these tips will be helpful the next time you're asked
to help set the table or sit down at a fancy meal. Enjoy!

**Transcript**:
Think of all the food made
in the world each year. Hard to picture? Then, imagine that you
are all of humanity, and on a plate in front of you is the one lovely annual
meal you make for yourself. You did all sorts of work putting
that meal on your table. You must be eager to consume
the fruits of your labor. And the vegetables and meats and waffles of your labor, too, right? Well, oddly enough, a third of that meal ends up in the trash. A third of the food we eat globally, an estimated 1.3 billion tons ends up as waste. All the work we put into producing
that food is wasted. And what's worse, it costs us. America alone spends an estimated 165 billion dollars a year managing food waste. We're wasting food, energy, and money. Perhaps worst of all, we're wasting the chance to change, to make the system of food
consumption more efficient. If you want to bring on that change, you should know about a humble yet diligent and ever-so-crucial ally: the worm. Worms convert organic waste and other compostable products
into natural fertilizers. Up to 75% of what we put
in the waste stream can become food and bedding material for vermicomposting. You can create a worm bin in your own home to see the composting process in action. First off, you need worms and not your typical earthworms. You need redworms, eisenia foetida, the species responsible for most vermicomposting in North America. These red wigglers are surface dwellers who don't burrow too deep, they're optimal feeders
around room temperature, and they're well-suited
to converting organic waste into usable fertilizer. Now, your worms might be vermin, but they need a comfortable
space to live and work: some bedding materials, either shredded paper or cardboard, some moisture, and, of course, food, mainly, your leftovers, slightly decomposed table scraps. The worms break down food waste and other organic matter into castings, a fancy synonym for worm poop. Their excrement is absolutely
teeming with microbes, which continue the decomposition process, making all those once-wasted nutrients available again as fertilizer. The timeline for the whole process varies depending on the quantity of worms, the temperature, and how much waste is added to the bin. And there's another timeline to consider. In a healthy worm-bin habitat, worm reproduction will occur when the wigglers become sexually mature, indicated by an elongation of the segments into a bulbous structure. Three-month old wigglers can produce two to three semi-translucent
yellow worm cocoons a week. You thought only moths and butterflies come out of cocoons? Well, we can't all be majestic. It takes around 11 weeks
for new babies to hatch. When your bin seems to be full
of living vermicelli noodles, it's time to share
the bounty with your friends and start a vermicompost club. Or keep those worms to yourself and start a business. Vermicomposting isn't confined only to small worm bins, it's an emerging
entrepreneurial enterprise. Large-scale facilities convert bulk organic waste and even manure into rich, black castings
called black gold. Its value as a soil
additive is unparalleled, and it can help plants
resist harmful pathogens. The lack of available land
in urban environments, coupled with growing interest
in smaller-scale farming means there is a market
for vermicomposting. Many communities use composting as part of zero-waste strategies, and they can sell
their worm-eaten table scraps to local farms, hungry
for rich fertilizer. So, instead of wasting money, dumping wasted food in landfills, we can remake waste into an asset, putting it back into our food system to make it more sustainable, all with the help of the humble worm, the tiny organism that can help us change the way we look
at food's place in our lives and our place in the world, as long as we give the little guy a place at our table. Well, not an actual seat at the table. A bin in the shed is fine.

The worms break down food waste and other organic matter into castings, a fancy synonym for worm poop. Their excrement is absolutely
teeming with microbes, which continue the decomposition process, making all those once-wasted nutrients available again as fertilizer. The timeline for the whole process varies depending on the quantity of worms, the temperature, and how much waste is added to the bin. And there's another timeline to consider. In a healthy worm-bin habitat, worm reproduction will occur when the wigglers become sexually mature, indicated by an elongation of the segments into a bulbous structure. Three-month old wigglers can produce two to three semi-translucent
yellow worm cocoons a week. You thought only moths and butterflies come out of cocoons? Well, we can't all be majestic. It takes around 11 weeks
for new babies to hatch. When your bin seems to be full
of living vermicelli noodles, it's time to share
the bounty with your friends and start a vermicompost club. Or keep those worms to yourself and start a business. Vermicomposting isn't confined only to small worm bins, it's an emerging
entrepreneurial enterprise. Large-scale facilities convert bulk organic waste and even manure into rich, black castings
called black gold. Its value as a soil
additive is unparalleled, and it can help plants
resist harmful pathogens. The lack of available land
in urban environments, coupled with growing interest
in smaller-scale farming means there is a market
for vermicomposting. Many communities use composting as part of zero-waste strategies, and they can sell
their worm-eaten table scraps to local farms, hungry
for rich fertilizer. So, instead of wasting money, dumping wasted food in landfills, we can remake waste into an asset, putting it back into our food system to make it more sustainable, all with the help of the humble worm, the tiny organism that can help us change the way we look
at food's place in our lives and our place in the world, as long as we give the little guy a place at our table. Well, not an actual seat at the table. A bin in the shed is fine.

**Transcript**:
Think of all the food made
in the world each year. Hard to picture? Then, imagine that you
are all of humanity, and on a plate in front of you is the one lovely annual
meal you make for yourself. You did all sorts of work putting
that meal on your table. You must be eager to consume
the fruits of your labor. And the vegetables and meats and waffles of your labor, too, right? Well, oddly enough, a third of that meal ends up in the trash. A third of the food we eat globally, an estimated 1.3 billion tons ends up as waste. All the work we put into producing
that food is wasted. And what's worse, it costs us. America alone spends an estimated 165 billion dollars a year managing food waste. We're wasting food, energy, and money. Perhaps worst of all, we're wasting the chance to change, to make the system of food
consumption more efficient. If you want to bring on that change, you should know about a humble yet diligent and ever-so-crucial ally: the worm. Worms convert organic waste and other compostable products
into natural fertilizers. Up to 75% of what we put
in the waste stream can become food and bedding material for vermicomposting. You can create a worm bin in your own home to see the composting process in action. First off, you need worms and not your typical earthworms. You need redworms, eisenia foetida, the species responsible for most vermicomposting in North America. These red wigglers are surface dwellers who don't burrow too deep, they're optimal feeders
around room temperature, and they're well-suited
to converting organic waste into usable fertilizer. Now, your worms might be vermin, but they need a comfortable

**Transcript**:
What is at the center of the universe? It's an essential question that humans have
been wondering about for centuries. But the journey toward an answer has been a strange one. If you wanted to know
the answer to this question in third century B.C.E. Greece, you might look up at the night sky and trust what you see. That's what Aristotle, THE guy to ask back then, did. He thought that since we're
on Earth, looking up, it must be the center, right? For him, the sphere of the world was made up of four elements: Earth, water, air, and fire. These elements shifted around a nested set of solid crystalline spheres. Each of the wandering stars, the planets, had their own crystal sphere. The rest of the universe
and all of its stars were on the last crystal sphere. If you watch the sky change over time, you could see that this idea worked fine at explaining the motion you saw. For centuries, this
was central to how Europe and the Islamic world saw the universe. But in 1543, a guy named Copernicus proposed a different model. He believed that the sun was at the center of the universe. This radically new idea was hard for a lot of people to accept. After all, Aristotle's ideas made sense with what they could see, and they were pretty flattering to humans. But a series of subsequent discoveries made the sun-centric model hard to ignore. First, Johannes Kepler pointed out that orbits aren't perfect
circles or spheres. Then, Galileo's telescope caught Jupiter's moons orbiting around Jupiter, totally ignoring Earth. And then, Newton proposed the theory
of universal gravitation, demonstrating that all objects
are pulling on each other. Eventually, we had to let go of the idea that we were at the center
of the universe. Shortly after Copernicus, in the 1580s, an Italian friar, Giordano Bruno, suggested the stars were suns that likely had their own planets and that the universe was infinite. This idea didn't go over well. Bruno was burned at the stake
for his radical suggestion. Centuries later,
the philosopher Rene Descartes proposed that the universe
was a series of whirlpools, which he called vortices, and that each star
was at the center of a whirlpool. In time, we realized there
were far more stars than Aristotle ever dreamed. As astronomers like William Herschel got more and more advanced telescopes, it became clear that our sun is actually one of many stars inside the Milky Way. And those smudges we see in the night sky? They're other galaxies, just as vast as our Milky Way home. Maybe we're farther from the center
than we ever realized. In the 1920s, astronomers
studying the nebuli wanted to figure out how they were moving. Based on the Doppler Effect, they expected to see blue shift for objects moving toward us, and red shift for ones moving away. But all they saw was a red shift. Everything was moving away from us, fast. This observation
is one of the pieces of evidence for what we now call the Big Bang Theory. According to this theory, all matter in the universe was once a singular,
infinitely dense particle. In a sense, our piece of the universe was once at the center. But this theory eliminates
the whole idea of a center since there can't be a center
to an infinite universe. The Big Bang wasn't just
an explosion in space; it was an explosion of space. What each new discovery proves is that while our observations
are limited, our ability to speculate and dream of what's out there isn't. What we think we know today
can change tomorrow. As with many of the thinkers we just met, sometimes our wildest guesses lead to wonderful and humbling answers and propel us toward even more
perplexing questions.

**Transcript**:
What is at the center of the universe? It's an essential question that humans have
been wondering about for centuries. But the journey toward an answer has been a strange one. If you wanted to know
the answer to this question in third century B.C.E. Greece, you might look up at the night sky and trust what you see. That's what Aristotle, THE guy to ask back then, did. He thought that since we're
on Earth, looking up, it must be the center, right? For him, the sphere of the world was made up of four elements: Earth, water, air, and fire. These elements shifted around a nested set of solid crystalline spheres. Each of the wandering stars, the planets, had their own crystal sphere. The rest of the universe
and all of its stars were on the last crystal sphere. If you watch the sky change over time, you could see that this idea worked fine at explaining the motion you saw. For centuries, this
was central to how Europe and the Islamic world saw the universe. But in 1543, a guy named Copernicus proposed a different model. He believed that the sun was at the center of the universe. This radically new idea was hard for a lot of people to accept. After all, Aristotle's ideas made sense with what they could see, and they were pretty flattering to humans. But a series of subsequent discoveries made the sun-centric model hard to ignore. First, Johannes Kepler pointed out that orbits aren't perfect
circles or spheres. Then, Galileo's telescope caught Jupiter's moons orbiting around Jupiter, totally ignoring Earth. And then, Newton proposed the theory
of universal gravitation, demonstrating that all objects
are pulling on each other. Eventually, we had to let go of the idea that we were at the center
of the universe. Shortly after Copernicus, in the 1580s, an Italian friar, Giordano Bruno, suggested the stars were suns that likely had their own planets and that the universe was infinite. This idea didn't go over well. Bruno was burned at the stake
for his radical suggestion. Centuries later,
the philosopher Rene Descartes proposed that the universe
was a series of whirlpools, which he called vortices, and that each star
was at the center of a whirlpool. In time, we realized there
were far more stars than Aristotle ever dreamed. As astronomers like William Herschel got more and more advanced telescopes, it became clear that our sun is actually one of many stars inside the Milky Way. And those smudges we see in the night sky? They're other galaxies, just as vast as our Milky Way home. Maybe we're farther from the center
than we ever realized. In the 1920s, astronomers
studying the nebuli wanted to figure out how they were moving. Based on the Doppler Effect, they expected to see blue shift for objects moving toward us, and red shift for ones moving away. But all they saw was a red shift. Everything was moving away from us, fast. This observation
is one of the pieces of evidence for what we now call the Big Bang Theory. According to this theory, all matter in the universe was once a singular,
infinitely dense particle. In a sense, our piece of the universe was once at the center. But this theory eliminates
the whole idea of a center since there can't be a center
to an infinite universe. The Big Bang wasn't just
an explosion in space; it was an explosion of space. What each new discovery proves is that while our observations
are limited, our ability to speculate and dream of what's out there isn't. What we think we know today
can change tomorrow. As with many of the thinkers we just met, sometimes our wildest guesses lead to wonderful and humbling answers and propel us toward even more
perplexing questions.

**Transcript**:
Today lots of girls play sports. But, for a long time,
girls were not encouraged to kick, throw, run, jump, shoot, slide, or hit like boys. So, why did things change? And how much have they changed? Are girls and boys treated equally when it comes to sports? To begin to answer these questions, we have to look back. In 1972, Congress passed
a law called Title IX, which protected girls and women from discrimination in schools, colleges, and universities. This included discrimination
in school-sponsored sports. At that time, only 15%
of college athletes were women, and in high schools, only 7% of athletes were girls. Female athletes didn't get
a lot of support either and often had to provide
their own uniforms and equipment. It was Title IX that forced
school administrators to make sports more equal. But what does equal mean in sports? The government developed rules to measure equality
under two general categories: participation and treatment. In the early days of Title IX, the number of girls
playing sports was so low that it would have been very difficult for schools to suddenly provide
exactly the same number of opportunities for girls and boys. Instead, the government wrote rules that gave schools three options, or tests, to demonstrate fairness
in opportunities for girls. The three tests are proportionality, progress, and satisfied interests. A school can pick which test to follow. Proportionality means
that girls should receive the same percentage
of athletic opportunities as the percentage of girls
in the student body. So, if 51% of students are girls, then girls should have approximately 51% of the opportunities to play sports. The second test, progress, requires schools to make up for the days when girls had fewer opportunities by adding new sports for girls
on a regular basis. The third test asks if girls interested in athletics are satisfied. Under this test, a school
must regularly ask female students what sports
they are interested in and also take into consideration
the popularity of certain sports in the area where the school is located. It must, then, add teams according
to the girls' interests. Another important part of Title IX is that it doesn't just look at how many athletic opportunities
are available to each sex but whether those opportunities
are of equal quality. Specifically, Title IX requires equality between boys and girls teams for things like equipment and supplies, publicity, the scheduling of games
and practice times, and the quality and number of coaches. Girls should also have equal access to locker rooms, practice spaces,
and competitive facilities, as well as medical services. So, if the best time to play
basketball is on Friday nights because that's when
most parents and fans can come, then the girls and boys teams should take turns playing on Friday night. If boys teams play
in a stadium with lights, scoreboards, and concession stands, then girls teams must have
the same opportunity, either by sharing those facilities or getting their own of equal quality. But, as we all know, just because a law exists doesn't mean that everybody follows it. School officials are responsible for making sure there
is fairness in sports, but you can help, too, by keeping an eye on your own school. Look around. Are there a lot more boys
than girls who play sports? Is the boys' soccer field
better than the girls'? Are athletic trainers available
to all teams equally? Does the baseball team get
new uniforms every year, while the softball team gets
them every three years? If you think there might be
inequality in your schools, you can approach a school administrator, a parent, or the Office of Civil Rights, a government agency
that makes sure schools comply with Title IX because equality
is important for everyone, both on the field and off.

**Transcript**:
Today lots of girls play sports. But, for a long time,
girls were not encouraged to kick, throw, run, jump, shoot, slide, or hit like boys. So, why did things change? And how much have they changed? Are girls and boys treated equally when it comes to sports? To begin to answer these questions, we have to look back. In 1972, Congress passed
a law called Title IX, which protected girls and women from discrimination in schools, colleges, and universities. This included discrimination
in school-sponsored sports. At that time, only 15%
of college athletes were women, and in high schools, only 7% of athletes were girls. Female athletes didn't get
a lot of support either and often had to provide
their own uniforms and equipment. It was Title IX that forced
school administrators to make sports more equal. But what does equal mean in sports? The government developed rules to measure equality
under two general categories: participation and treatment. In the early days of Title IX, the number of girls
playing sports was so low that it would have been very difficult for schools to suddenly provide
exactly the same number of opportunities for girls and boys. Instead, the government wrote rules that gave schools three options, or tests, to demonstrate fairness
in opportunities for girls. The three tests are proportionality, progress, and satisfied interests. A school can pick which test to follow. Proportionality means
that girls should receive the same percentage
of athletic opportunities as the percentage of girls
in the student body. So, if 51% of students are girls, then girls should have approximately 51% of the opportunities to play sports. The second test, progress, requires schools to make up for the days when girls had fewer opportunities by adding new sports for girls
on a regular basis. The third test asks if girls interested in athletics are satisfied. Under this test, a school
must regularly ask female students what sports
they are interested in and also take into consideration
the popularity of certain sports in the area where the school is located. It must, then, add teams according
to the girls' interests. Another important part of Title IX is that it doesn't just look at how many athletic opportunities
are available to each sex but whether those opportunities
are of equal quality. Specifically, Title IX requires equality between boys and girls teams for things like equipment and supplies, publicity, the scheduling of games
and practice times, and the quality and number of coaches. Girls should also have equal access to locker rooms, practice spaces,
and competitive facilities, as well as medical services. So, if the best time to play
basketball is on Friday nights because that's when
most parents and fans can come, then the girls and boys teams should take turns playing on Friday night. If boys teams play

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] when I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old we were playing on top of a bunk bed I was two years older than my sister at the time I'm two years older than her now but at the time that meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do and I wanted to play war so we were up on top of our bunk beds and on one side of the bunk bed I put out all my GI Joe soldiers and weaponry and on the other side were all my sisters Milo's and ponies and ready for a Calvary charge there are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon but since my sister is not here with us today let me tell you the true story which is my sister's a little bit on the clumsy side and somehow without any help or push from her older brother at all suddenly Amy disappeared off the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor and I never sleep eared over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible and seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm just one week before heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet for which I have yet to be thanked I was trying as hard as I could she didn't even see it coming I was trying as hard as I could to be on my best behavior and I saw my sister's faces wail a pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and threatening to wake my parents from the long winters nap for which they had settled so I did the only thing my little frantic seven-year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy if you have children you've seen this hundreds of times before I said Amy Amy wait don't cry don't cry did you see how you landed no human lands on all fours like that Amy I think this means you're a unicorn now that was cheating because there's nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five-year-old little sister but Amy the special unicorn of course this was an option that was open to her brain to no point in the past and you could see on my poor manipulated sister's face conflict as their little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering surprise she just experienced or contemplating her newfound identity as a unicorn and the latter one now instead of crying instead of ceasing our planes of waking my parents with all the negative consequences that would have been sued for me instead of smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn with one broken leg what we stumbled across at this tender age which is five and seven we had no idea at the time was something that was going to be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain what we had stumbled across is something called positive psychology which is the reason that I'm here today and the reason that I wake up every morning when I first started talking about this research outside of academia out with companies in schools the very first thing they said to never do is to start your talk with a graph the very first thing I wanted to do is start my talk with a graph this graph looks boring but this graph is the reason that I get excited and wake up every morning and this graph doesn't even mean anything it's faked out of what we found is if I got this data back studying you here in the room I would be thrilled because there's very clearly a trend that's going on there and that means that I can get published which is all that really matters the fact that there's one weird red dot that's up above the curve there's one weird in the room you know who you are I saw you earlier that's no prom that's no problem as most of you know because I can just delete that dot I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error and we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data so one of the very first things do we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how in a statistically valid way do we eliminate the weirdos how do we eliminate the outliers so that we can find the line of best fit which is fantastic if I'm trying to find out how many advil the average person should be taking too but if I'm interested in potential if I'm interested in your potential or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity what we're doing is we're creating the coal to the average with science if I ask you a question like how fast can the child learn how to read in a classroom scientists change the answer to how fast is the average child learn how to read in that classroom and then we tailor the class right towards the average now if you fall below the average on this curve then psychologists get thrilled because that means you're either depressed or you have a disorder or hopefully both we're hoping for both because our business motto is if you come into a therapy session with one problem we want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10 so you'll keep coming back over and over again we'll go back into your child have necessary but eventually what we want to do is to make you normal again but normal is merely average and what I pause it and what positive psychology posits is if we study what is merely average we will remain merely average then instead of deleting those positive outliers what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and says why why is it the some of you are so high above the curve in terms of your intellectual voting athletic ability musical ability creativity energy levels your resiliency in the face of challenge your sense of humor whatever it is instead of deleting you what I want to do is study you because maybe we can glean information not just how to move people up to the average but how we can move the entire average up that our companies in schools worldwide the reason this graph is important to me is when I turn on the news it seems like the majority of the information is not positive in fact is negative most of us about murder corruption diseases natural disasters and very quickly my brain starts to think that's the accurate ratio of negative positive in the world what that's doing is creating something called the medical school syndrome which if you know people who have been to medical school during the first year of medical training as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases it could happen suddenly you realize you have all of them have a brother-in-law named Bobo which is a whole nother story Bobo married Amy the Unicorn Bobo called me on the phone from Yale Medical School from Yale Medical School I'm bill Bessette Sean I have leprosy which even at Yale is extraordinarily rare but I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause see what we're finding is not necessarily the reality that shapes us but the lens to which your brain views the world that shapes your reality if we can change the lens not only can we change your happiness we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time when I applied to Harvard I applied on it there I didn't expect to get in and my family had no money for college when I got a military scholarship two weeks later that allowed me to go suddenly something wasn't even a possibility became a reality when I went there I assumed everyone else would see it as a privilege as well that they'd be excited to be there even if you're in a classroom full of people smarter than you you'd be happy just to be in that classroom which is what I felt but what I found there is while some people experienced that when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students Harvard asked me to wasn't that guy but what happened I was an officer of Harvard accounts those students through the difficult four years and what I found in my research my teaching is that these students no matter how happy they were with the original SAS success of getting into the school two weeks later the brains were focused not on the privilege of being there nor on their philosophy or their physics the brain was focused on the competition the workload the hassles the stresses the complaints when I first went in there I walked into the freshmen dining hall which is where my friends from Waco Texas which is where I grew up I know some of you've heard of it when I when they come to visit me they look around they say this freshman dining hall looks like something out of Hogwarts some movie Harry Potter which it does because Hogwarts and movie Harry Potter and that's Harvard when they see this they say Shawn why you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard seriously what does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels when in reality if I know everything about your external world I can only predict 10% of your long-term happiness 90% of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world but by it through the way your brain processes the world and if we change it if we change our formula for happiness and success what we can do is change the way that we can then affect reality what we found is that only 25% of job successes are predicted by IQ 75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels your social support and your abilities see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat I talked to a boarding school up in New England probably the most prestigious boarding school and they said we already know that so every year instead of just teaching our students we also have a Wellness Week and we're so excited Monday night we have the world's leading expert coming in to speak about adolescent depression Tuesday night is school violence and bullying Wednesday night Wednesday nights eating disorders Thursday night is illicit drug user Friday night we're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness I said that's most people's Friday nights [Music] which I'm glad you like but they did not like that at all silence on the phone and into the silence I said I'd be happy to speak to your school but just you know that's not a Wellness week that's the sickness week what you've done is you've outlined all the negative things that can happen but not talked about the positive the absence of disease is not health here's how we get to health we need to reverse the formula for happiness and success in the past three years I've traveled to 45 different countries working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn and what I found is the most companies and schools follow a formula for success which is this if I work harder I'll be more successful and if I'm more successful then I'll be happier that undergirds most of our parenting styles are managing style is the way that we motivate our behavior and the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons first every time your brain has a success you just change the goalposts of what success look like you got good grades now you have to get better grades it's gone to good schooling after you get a better school you got a good job now you have to get a better job you hit your sales target we're gonna change your sales target and if happiness is on the opposite side of success your brain never gets there what we've done is we pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society and that's because we think we have to be successful successful then we'll be happier but the real problem is our brains work in the opposite order if you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage which is your brain and positive perform significantly better than does a negative neutral stress your intelligence Rises your creativity Rises your energy levels rise in fact what we found is that every single business outcome improves your brain a positive is 31% more productive than it your brain and negative neutral stress you're 37% better at sales doctors are 19% faster more accurate at coming up with a correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative neutral stress which means we can reverse the formula if we can find a way becoming positive in the present then our brains work even more successfully as we're able to work harder faster and more intelligently what we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of because dopamine which floods into your system when you're positive has two functions not only does it make you happier it turns on all the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way we found that there are ways you can train your brain to be able to come more positive in just a two minute span of time done for 21 days in row we can actually rewire your brain allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully we've done these things in research now and every single company that I've worked with getting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for for 21 days in a row three new things each day and at the end of that their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative but for the positive first journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it exercise teaches your brain your behavior matters we find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand and finally random acts of kindness or conscious acts of kindness we get people when they open up their inbox to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their social support network and by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we trained our bodies what we found is we could reverse the formula for happiness and success and in doing so not only create ripples of positivity but create a real revolution thank you very much [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] when I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old we were playing on top of a bunk bed I was two years older than my sister at the time I'm two years older than her now but at the time that meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do and I wanted to play war so we were up on top of our bunk beds and on one side of the bunk bed I put out all my GI Joe soldiers and weaponry and on the other side were all my sisters Milo's and ponies and ready for a Calvary charge there are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon but since my sister is not here with us today let me tell you the true story which is my sister's a little bit on the clumsy side and somehow without any help or push from her older brother at all suddenly Amy disappeared off the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor and I never sleep eared over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible and seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm just one week before heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet for which I have yet to be thanked I was trying as hard as I could she didn't even see it coming I was trying as hard as I could to be on my best behavior and I saw my sister's faces wail a pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and threatening to wake my parents from the long winters nap for which they had settled so I did the only thing my little frantic seven-year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy if you have children you've seen this hundreds of times before I said Amy Amy wait don't cry don't cry did you see how you landed no human lands on all fours like that Amy I think this means you're a unicorn now that was cheating because there's nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five-year-old little sister but Amy the special unicorn of course this was an option that was open to her brain to no point in the past and you could see on my poor manipulated sister's face conflict as their little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering surprise she just experienced or contemplating her newfound identity as a unicorn and the latter one now instead of crying instead of ceasing our planes of waking my parents with all the negative consequences that would have been sued for me instead of smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn with one broken leg what we stumbled across at this tender age which is five and seven we had no idea at the time was something that was going to be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain what we had stumbled across is something called positive psychology which is the reason that I'm here today and the reason that I wake up every morning when I first started talking about this research outside of academia out with companies in schools the very first thing they said to never do is to start your talk with a graph the very first thing I wanted to do is start my talk with a graph this graph looks boring but this graph is the reason that I get excited and wake up every morning and this graph doesn't even mean anything it's faked out of what we found is if I got this data back studying you here in the room I would be thrilled because there's very clearly a trend that's going on there and that means that I can get published which is all that really matters the fact that there's one weird red dot that's up above the curve there's one weird in the room you know who you are I saw you earlier that's no prom that's no problem as most of you know because I can just delete that dot I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error and we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data so one of the very first things do we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how in a statistically valid way do we eliminate the weirdos how do we eliminate the outliers so that we can find the line of best fit which is fantastic if I'm trying to find out how many advil the average person should be taking too but if I'm interested in potential if I'm interested in your potential or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity what we're doing is we're creating the coal to the average with science if I ask you a question like how fast can the child learn how to read in a classroom scientists change the answer to how fast is the average child learn how to read in that classroom and then we tailor the class right towards the average now if you fall below the average on this curve then psychologists get thrilled because that means you're either depressed or you have a disorder or hopefully both we're hoping for both because our business motto is if you come into a therapy session with one problem we want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10 so you'll keep coming back over and over again we'll go back into your child have necessary but eventually what we want to do is to make you normal again but normal is merely average and what I pause it and what positive psychology posits is if we study what is merely average we will remain merely average then instead of deleting those positive outliers what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and says why why is it the some of you are so high above the curve in terms of your intellectual voting athletic ability musical ability creativity energy levels your resiliency in the face of challenge your sense of humor whatever it is instead of deleting you what I want to do is study you because maybe we can glean information not just how to move people up to the average but how we can move the entire average up that our companies in schools worldwide the reason this graph is important to me is when I turn on the news it seems like the majority of the information is not positive in fact is negative most of us about murder corruption diseases natural disasters and very quickly my brain starts to think that's the accurate ratio of negative positive in the world what that's doing is creating something called the medical school syndrome which if you know people who have been to medical school during the first year of medical training as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases it could happen suddenly you realize you have all of them have a brother-in-law named Bobo which is a whole nother story Bobo married Amy the Unicorn Bobo called me on the phone from Yale Medical School from Yale Medical School I'm bill Bessette Sean I have leprosy which even at Yale is extraordinarily rare but I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause see what we're finding is not necessarily the reality that shapes us but the lens to which your brain views the world that shapes your reality if we can change the lens not only can we change your happiness we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time when I applied to Harvard I applied on it there I didn't expect to get in and my family had no money for college when I got a military scholarship two weeks later that allowed me to go suddenly something wasn't even a possibility became a reality when I went there I assumed everyone else would see it as a privilege as well that they'd be excited to be there even if you're in a classroom full of people smarter than you you'd be happy just to be in that classroom which is what I felt but what I found there is while some people experienced that when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students Harvard asked me to wasn't that guy but what happened I was an officer of Harvard accounts those students through the difficult four years and what I found in my research my teaching is that these students no matter how happy they were with the original SAS success of getting into the school two weeks later the brains were focused not on the privilege of being there nor on their philosophy or their physics the brain was focused on the competition the workload the hassles the stresses the complaints when I first went in there I walked into the freshmen dining hall which is where my friends from Waco Texas which is where I grew up I know some of you've heard of it when I when they come to visit me they look around they say this freshman dining hall looks like something out of Hogwarts some movie Harry Potter which it does because Hogwarts and movie Harry Potter and that's Harvard when they see this they say Shawn why you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard seriously what does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels when in reality if I know everything about your external world I can only predict 10% of your long-term happiness 90% of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world but by it through the way your brain processes the world and if we change it if we change our formula for happiness and success what we can do is change the way that we can then affect reality what we found is that only 25% of job successes are predicted by IQ 75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels your social support and your abilities see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat I talked to a boarding school up in New England probably the most prestigious boarding school and they said we already know that so every year instead of just teaching our students we also have a Wellness Week and we're so excited Monday night we have the world's leading expert coming in to speak about adolescent depression Tuesday night is school violence and bullying Wednesday night Wednesday nights eating disorders Thursday night is illicit drug user Friday night we're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness I said that's most people's Friday nights [Music] which I'm glad you like but they did not like that at all silence on the phone and into the silence I said I'd be happy to speak to your school but just you know that's not a Wellness week that's the sickness week what you've done is you've outlined all the negative things that can happen but not talked about the positive the absence of disease is not health here's how we get to health we need to reverse the formula for happiness and success in the past three years I've traveled to 45 different countries working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn and what I found is the most companies and schools follow a formula for success which is this if I work harder I'll be more successful and if I'm more successful then I'll be happier that undergirds most of our parenting styles are managing style is the way that we motivate our behavior and the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons first every time your brain has a success you just change the goalposts of what success look like you got good grades now you have to get better grades it's gone to good schooling after you get a better school you got a good job now you have to get a better job you hit your sales target we're gonna change your sales target and if happiness is on the opposite side of success your brain never gets there what we've done is we pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society and that's because we think we have to be successful successful then we'll be happier but the real problem is our brains work in the opposite order if you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage which is your brain and positive perform significantly better than does a negative neutral stress your intelligence Rises your creativity Rises your energy levels rise in fact what we found is that every single business outcome improves your brain a positive is 31% more productive than it your brain and negative neutral stress you're 37% better at sales doctors are 19% faster more accurate at coming up with a correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative neutral stress which means we can reverse the formula if we can find a way becoming positive in the present then our brains work even more successfully as we're able to work harder faster and more intelligently what we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of because dopamine which floods into your system when you're positive has two functions not only does it make you happier it turns on all the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way we found that there are ways you can train your brain to be able to come more positive in just a two minute span of time done for 21 days in row we can actually rewire your brain allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully we've done these things in research now and every single company that I've worked with getting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for for 21 days in a row three new things each day and at the end of that their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative but for the positive first journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it exercise teaches your brain your behavior matters we find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand and finally random acts of kindness or conscious acts of kindness we get people when they open up their inbox to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their social support network and by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we trained our bodies what we found is we could reverse the formula for happiness and success and in doing so not only create ripples of positivity but create a real revolution thank you very much [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] when I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old we were playing on top of a bunk bed I was two years older than my sister at the time I'm two years older than her now but at the time that meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do and I wanted to play war so we were up on top of our bunk beds and on one side of the bunk bed I put out all my GI Joe soldiers and weaponry and on the other side were all my sisters Milo's and ponies and ready for a Calvary charge there are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon but since my sister is not here with us today let me tell you the true story which is my sister's a little bit on the clumsy side and somehow without any help or push from her older brother at all suddenly Amy disappeared off the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor and I never sleep eared over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible and seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm just one week before heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet for which I have yet to be thanked I was trying as hard as I could she didn't even see it coming I was trying as hard as I could to be on my best behavior and I saw my sister's faces wail a pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and threatening to wake my parents from the long winters nap for which they had settled so I did the only thing my little frantic seven-year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy if you have children you've seen this hundreds of times before I said Amy Amy wait don't cry don't cry did you see how you landed no human lands on all fours like that Amy I think this means you're a unicorn now that was cheating because there's nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five-year-old little sister but Amy the special unicorn of course this was an option that was open to her brain to no point in the past and you could see on my poor manipulated sister's face conflict as their little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering surprise she just experienced or contemplating her newfound identity as a unicorn and the latter one now instead of crying instead of ceasing our planes of waking my parents with all the negative consequences that would have been sued for me instead of smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn with one broken leg what we stumbled across at this tender age which is five and seven we had no idea at the time was something that was going to be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain what we had stumbled across is something called positive psychology which is the reason that I'm here today and the reason that I wake up every morning when I first started talking about this research outside of academia out with companies in schools the very first thing they said to never do is to start your talk with a graph the very first thing I wanted to do is start my talk with a graph this graph looks boring but this graph is the reason that I get excited and wake up every morning and this graph doesn't even mean anything it's faked out of what we found is if I got this data back studying you here in the room I would be thrilled because there's very clearly a trend that's going on there and that means that I can get published which is all that really matters the fact that there's one weird red dot that's up above the curve there's one weird in the room you know who you are I saw you earlier that's no prom that's no problem as most of you know because I can just delete that dot I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error and we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data so one of the very first things do we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how in a statistically valid way do we eliminate the weirdos how do we eliminate the outliers so that we can find the line of best fit which is fantastic if I'm trying to find out how many advil the average person should be taking too but if I'm interested in potential if I'm interested in your potential or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity what we're doing is we're creating the coal to the average with science if I ask you a question like how fast can the child learn how to read in a classroom scientists change the answer to how fast is the average child learn how to read in that classroom and then we tailor the class right towards the average now if you fall below the average on this curve then psychologists get thrilled because that means you're either depressed or you have a disorder or hopefully both we're hoping for both because our business motto is if you come into a therapy session with one problem we want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10 so you'll keep coming back over and over again we'll go back into your child have necessary but eventually what we want to do is to make you normal again but normal is merely average and what I pause it and what positive psychology posits is if we study what is merely average we will remain merely average then instead of deleting those positive outliers what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and says why why is it the some of you are so high above the curve in terms of your intellectual voting athletic ability musical ability creativity energy levels your resiliency in the face of challenge your sense of humor whatever it is instead of deleting you what I want to do is study you because maybe we can glean information not just how to move people up to the average but how we can move the entire average up that our companies in schools worldwide the reason this graph is important to me is when I turn on the news it seems like the majority of the information is not positive in fact is negative most of us about murder corruption diseases natural disasters and very quickly my brain starts to think that's the accurate ratio of negative positive in the world what that's doing is creating something called the medical school syndrome which if you know people who have been to medical school during the first year of medical training as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases it could happen suddenly you realize you have all of them have a brother-in-law named Bobo which is a whole nother story Bobo married Amy the Unicorn Bobo called me on the phone from Yale Medical School from Yale Medical School I'm bill Bessette Sean I have leprosy which even at Yale is extraordinarily rare but I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause see what we're finding is not necessarily the reality that shapes us but the lens to which your brain views the world that shapes your reality if we can change the lens not only can we change your happiness we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time when I applied to Harvard I applied on it there I didn't expect to get in and my family had no money for college when I got a military scholarship two weeks later that allowed me to go suddenly something wasn't even a possibility became a reality when I went there I assumed everyone else would see it as a privilege as well that they'd be excited to be there even if you're in a classroom full of people smarter than you you'd be happy just to be in that classroom which is what I felt but what I found there is while some people experienced that when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students Harvard asked me to wasn't that guy but what happened I was an officer of Harvard accounts those students through the difficult four years and what I found in my research my teaching is that these students no matter how happy they were with the original SAS success of getting into the school two weeks later the brains were focused not on the privilege of being there nor on their philosophy or their physics the brain was focused on the competition the workload the hassles the stresses the complaints when I first went in there I walked into the freshmen dining hall which is where my friends from Waco Texas which is where I grew up I know some of you've heard of it when I when they come to visit me they look around they say this freshman dining hall looks like something out of Hogwarts some movie Harry Potter which it does because Hogwarts and movie Harry Potter and that's Harvard when they see this they say Shawn why you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard seriously what does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels when in reality if I know everything about your external world I can only predict 10% of your long-term happiness 90% of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world but by it through the way your brain processes the world and if we change it if we change our formula for happiness and success what we can do is change the way that we can then affect reality what we found is that only 25% of job successes are predicted by IQ 75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels your social support and your abilities see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat I talked to a boarding school up in New England probably the most prestigious boarding school and they said we already know that so every year instead of just teaching our students we also have a Wellness Week and we're so excited Monday night we have the world's leading expert coming in to speak about adolescent depression Tuesday night is school violence and bullying Wednesday night Wednesday nights eating disorders Thursday night is illicit drug user Friday night we're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness I said that's most people's Friday nights [Music] which I'm glad you like but they did not like that at all silence on the phone and into the silence I said I'd be happy to speak to your school but just you know that's not a Wellness week that's the sickness week what you've done is you've outlined all the negative things that can happen but not talked about the positive the absence of disease is not health here's how we get to health we need to reverse the formula for happiness and success in the past three years I've traveled to 45 different countries working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn and what I found is the most companies and schools follow a formula for success which is this if I work harder I'll be more successful and if I'm more successful then I'll be happier that undergirds most of our parenting styles are managing style is the way that we motivate our behavior and the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons first every time your brain has a success you just change the goalposts of what success look like you got good grades now you have to get better grades it's gone to good schooling after you get a better school you got a good job now you have to get a better job you hit your sales target we're gonna change your sales target and if happiness is on the opposite side of success your brain never gets there what we've done is we pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society and that's because we think we have to be successful successful then we'll be happier but the real problem is our brains work in the opposite order if you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage which is your brain and positive perform significantly better than does a negative neutral stress your intelligence Rises your creativity Rises your energy levels rise in fact what we found is that every single business outcome improves your brain a positive is 31% more productive than it your brain and negative neutral stress you're 37% better at sales doctors are 19% faster more accurate at coming up with a correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative neutral stress which means we can reverse the formula if we can find a way becoming positive in the present then our brains work even more successfully as we're able to work harder faster and more intelligently what we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of because dopamine which floods into your system when you're positive has two functions not only does it make you happier it turns on all the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way we found that there are ways you can train your brain to be able to come more positive in just a two minute span of time done for 21 days in row we can actually rewire your brain allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully we've done these things in research now and every single company that I've worked with getting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for for 21 days in a row three new things each day and at the end of that their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative but for the positive first journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it exercise teaches your brain your behavior matters we find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand and finally random acts of kindness or conscious acts of kindness we get people when they open up their inbox to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their social support network and by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we trained our bodies what we found is we could reverse the formula for happiness and success and in doing so not only create ripples of positivity but create a real revolution thank you very much [Applause]

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Welcome to the Department of Plagiarism Investigation. The D.P.I. has dealt with numerous complex cases in their effort to bring plagiarists to justice and to rescue purloined texts. The first form of plagiarism that the D.P.I. regularly encounters is known as brain child snatching, in honor of the Latin word, plagiarius, from which plagiarism originates. Brain child snatchers sneak up on innocent papers and copy and paste them without citing any sources, putting quotation marks around direct quotes or changing a word. They've also been known to steal and hold particularly eloquent essays for ransom. When brain child snatchers get together, they form a kidnapping ring, which involves brain child snatching from multiple sources. Some perpetrators have even been known to commit self-plagiarism, one of the laziest crimes in the annals of the D.P.I. Also known as one-sided collaborators, these odd balls snatch up entire texts or small passages that they've written before and present them as brand-new material. Brain child snatchers and kidnapping rings are easy for the D.P.I. to catch. Just paste a few passages into a search engine, and BAM! They're caught red-handed. The more covert forms of plagiarism include the wild goose chase technique, in which plagiarists create fake authors, book titles, page numbers, or other information in order to cover up plagiarism. And the old synonym switcheroo in which plagiarists utilize a thesaurus as their main weapon. By substituting a synonym for nearly every word in the document and leaving the sentence structure and order of the ideas the same, plagiarists give legitimate paraphrasing a very bad name. Shoddy paraphrasing is also a key part of variations on a smokescreen, a technique in which multiple passages are paraphrased, then pasted together into one. The thorniest issue that the D.P.I. deals with is the misconception that you can never be accused of plagiarism if you use quotes and cite your sources. This is most certainly not the case because a paper that is made up of passage upon passage of other people's ideas is known as a wholly quotable document. This is considered plagiarism since there are no original thoughts in the work. Similarly, passage after passage of too closely paraphrased text from multiple cited sources is also plagiarism of the pervasively paraphrased kind because the ideas still aren't one's own. And lastly, the technique of revealing while concealing is plagiarism because it involves selective amnesia regarding one's sources in an attempt to cover up wholly quotable and pervasively paraphrased issues in a text. Some passages are meticulously documented, quoted, or paraphrased, while others are presented entirely as one's own. As you can see, the D.P.I. has its hands full, tackling all sorts of academic mischief and mayhem, ranging from the petty to the outrageous. Given the gravity of these transgressions, you might be wondering why you've never heard of the Department of Plagiarism Investigation's victories. That's because it doesn't technically exist. But people, like you and me, can be our own D.P.I. agents to fight plagiarism and uphold the values of original thinking. We know that the best defense against plagiarism consists of writers who save themselves time, worry, and effort by taking the far easier road of just doing the work themselves.

Brain child snatchers and kidnapping rings are easy for the D.P.I. to catch. Just paste a few passages into a search engine, and BAM! They're caught red-handed. The more covert forms of plagiarism include the wild goose chase technique, in which plagiarists create fake authors, book titles, page numbers, or other information in order to cover up plagiarism. And the old synonym switcheroo in which plagiarists utilize a thesaurus as their main weapon. By substituting a synonym for nearly every word in the document and leaving the sentence structure and order of the ideas the same, plagiarists give legitimate paraphrasing a very bad name. Shoddy paraphrasing is also a key part of variations on a smokescreen, a technique in which multiple passages are paraphrased, then pasted together into one. The thorniest issue that the D.P.I. deals with is the misconception that you can never be accused of plagiarism if you use quotes and cite your sources. This is most certainly not the case because a paper that is made up of passage upon passage of other people's ideas is known as a wholly quotable document. This is considered plagiarism since there are no original thoughts in the work. Similarly, passage after passage of too closely paraphrased text from multiple cited sources is also plagiarism of the pervasively paraphrased kind because the ideas still aren't one's own. And lastly, the technique of revealing while concealing is plagiarism because it involves selective amnesia regarding one's sources in an attempt to cover up wholly quotable and pervasively paraphrased issues in a text. Some passages are meticulously documented, quoted, or paraphrased, while others are presented entirely as one's own. As you can see, the D.P.I. has its hands full, tackling all sorts of academic mischief and mayhem, ranging from the petty to the outrageous. Given the gravity of these transgressions, you might be wondering why you've never heard of the Department of Plagiarism Investigation's victories. That's because it doesn't technically exist. But people, like you and me, can be our own D.P.I. agents to fight plagiarism and uphold the values of original thinking. We know that the best defense against plagiarism consists of writers who save themselves time, worry, and effort by taking the far easier road of just doing the work themselves.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Welcome to the Department of Plagiarism Investigation. The D.P.I. has dealt with numerous complex cases in their effort to bring plagiarists to justice and to rescue purloined texts. The first form of plagiarism that the D.P.I. regularly encounters is known as brain child snatching, in honor of the Latin word, plagiarius, from which plagiarism originates. Brain child snatchers sneak up on innocent papers and copy and paste them without citing any sources, putting quotation marks around direct quotes or changing a word. They've also been known to steal and hold particularly eloquent essays for ransom. When brain child snatchers get together, they form a kidnapping ring, which involves brain child snatching from multiple sources. Some perpetrators have even been known to commit self-plagiarism, one of the laziest crimes in the annals of the D.P.I. Also known as one-sided collaborators, these odd balls snatch up entire texts or small passages that they've written before and present them as brand-new material. Brain child snatchers and kidnapping rings are easy for the D.P.I. to catch. Just paste a few passages into a search engine, and BAM! They're caught red-handed.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Nowadays, we take curiosity for granted. We believe that if we put in the hard work, we might one day stand before the pyramids, discover a new species of flower, or even go to the moon. But, in the 18th and 19th century, female eyes gazed out windows at a world they were unlikely to ever explore. Life for women in the time of Queen Victoria was largely relegated to house chores and gossip. And, although they devoured books on exotic travel, most would never would leave the places in which they were born. However, there were a few Victorian women, who, through privilege, endurance, and not taking "no" for an answer, did set sail for wilder shores. In 1860, Marianne North, an amateur gardener and painter, crossed the ocean to America with letters of introduction, an easel, and a love of flowers. She went on to travel to Jamaica, Peru, Japan, India, Australia. In fact, she went to every continent except Antarctica in pursuit of new flowers to paint. "I was overwhelmed with the amount of subjects to be painted," she wrote. "The hills were marvelously blue, piled one over the other beyond them. I never saw such abundance of pure color." With no planes or automobiles and rarely a paved street, North rode donkeys, scaled cliffs, and crossed swamps to reach the plants she wanted. And all this in the customary dress of her day, floor-length gowns. As photography had not yet been perfected, Marianne's paintings gave botanists back in Europe their first glimpses of some of the world's most unusual plants, like the giant pitcher plant of Borneo, the African torch lily, and the many other species named for her as she was the first European to catalog them in the wild. Meanwhile, back in London, Miss Mary Kingsley was the sheltered daughter of a traveling doctor who loved hearing her father's tales of native customs in Africa. Midway through writing a book on the subject, her father fell ill and died. So, Kingsley decided she would finish the book for him. Peers of her father advised her not to go, showing her maps of tropical diseases, but she went anyhow, landing in modern-day Sierra Leone in 1896 with two large suitcases and a phrase book. Traveling into the jungle, she was able to confirm the existence of a then-mythical creature, the gorilla. She recalls fighting with crocodiles, being caught in a tornado, and tickling a hippopotamus with her umbrella so that he'd leave the side of her canoe. Falling into a spiky pit, she was saved from harm by her thick petticoat. "A good snake properly cooked is one of the best meals one gets out here," she wrote. Think Indiana Jones was resourceful? Kingsley could out-survive him any day! But when it comes to breaking rules, perhaps no female traveler was as daring as Alexandra David-Neel. Alexandra, who had studied Eastern religions at home in France, wanted desperately to prove herself to Parisian scholars of the day, all of whom were men. She decided the only way to be taken seriously was to visit the fabled city of Lhasa in the mountains of Tibet. "People will have to say, 'This woman lived among the things she's talking about. She touched them and she saw them alive,'" she wrote. When she arrived at the border from India, she was forbidden to cross. So, she disguised herself as a Tibetan man. Dressed in a yak fur coat and a necklace of carved skulls, she hiked through the barren Himilayas all the way to Lhasa, where she was subsequently arrested. She learned that the harder the journey, the better the story, and went on to write many books on Tibetan religion, which not only made a splash back in Paris but remain important today. These brave women, and others like them, went all over the world to prove that the desire to see for oneself not only changes the course of human knowledge, it changes the very idea of what is possible. They used the power of curiosity to try and understand the viewpoints and peculiarities of other places, perhaps because they, themselves, were seen as so unusual in their own societies. But their journeys revealed to them something more than the ways of foreign lands, they revealed something only they, themselves, could find: a sense of their own self.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Aside from their beauty, why were Marianne North’s paintings so useful to scientists back in Europe?
Options: A. The painted landscapes helped scientists make maps of foreign lands, B. The skies she painted helped scientists understand tropical meteorology, C. Their botanical accuracy showed scientists new species of plants which they hadn’t seen before, D. Their use of color helped scientists understand how the eye works

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Nowadays, we take curiosity for granted. We believe that if we put in the hard work, we might one day stand before the pyramids, discover a new species of flower, or even go to the moon. But, in the 18th and 19th century, female eyes gazed out windows at a world they were unlikely to ever explore. Life for women in the time of Queen Victoria was largely relegated to house chores and gossip. And, although they devoured books on exotic travel, most would never would leave the places in which they were born. However, there were a few Victorian women, who, through privilege, endurance, and not taking "no" for an answer, did set sail for wilder shores. In 1860, Marianne North, an amateur gardener and painter, crossed the ocean to America with letters of introduction, an easel, and a love of flowers. She went on to travel to Jamaica, Peru, Japan, India, Australia. In fact, she went to every continent except Antarctica in pursuit of new flowers to paint. "I was overwhelmed with the amount of subjects to be painted," she wrote. "The hills were marvelously blue, piled one over the other beyond them. I never saw such abundance of pure color." With no planes or automobiles and rarely a paved street, North rode donkeys, scaled cliffs, and crossed swamps to reach the plants she wanted. And all this in the customary dress of her day, floor-length gowns. As photography had not yet been perfected, Marianne's paintings gave botanists back in Europe their first glimpses of some of the world's most unusual plants, like the giant pitcher plant of Borneo, the African torch lily, and the many other species named for her as she was the first European to catalog them in the wild. Meanwhile, back in London, Miss Mary Kingsley was the sheltered daughter of a traveling doctor who loved hearing her father's tales of native customs in Africa. Midway through writing a book on the subject, her father fell ill and died. So, Kingsley decided she would finish the book for him. Peers of her father advised her not to go, showing her maps of tropical diseases, but she went anyhow, landing in modern-day Sierra Leone in 1896 with two large suitcases and a phrase book. Traveling into the jungle, she was able to confirm the existence of a then-mythical creature, the gorilla. She recalls fighting with crocodiles, being caught in a tornado, and tickling a hippopotamus with her umbrella so that he'd leave the side of her canoe. Falling into a spiky pit, she was saved from harm by her thick petticoat. "A good snake properly cooked is one of the best meals one gets out here," she wrote. Think Indiana Jones was resourceful? Kingsley could out-survive him any day! But when it comes to breaking rules, perhaps no female traveler was as daring as Alexandra David-Neel. Alexandra, who had studied Eastern religions at home in France, wanted desperately to prove herself to Parisian scholars of the day, all of whom were men. She decided the only way to be taken seriously was to visit the fabled city of Lhasa in the mountains of Tibet. "People will have to say, 'This woman lived among the things she's talking about. She touched them and she saw them alive,'" she wrote. When she arrived at the border from India, she was forbidden to cross. So, she disguised herself as a Tibetan man. Dressed in a yak fur coat and a necklace of carved skulls, she hiked through the barren Himilayas all the way to Lhasa, where she was subsequently arrested. She learned that the harder the journey, the better the story, and went on to write many books on Tibetan religion, which not only made a splash back in Paris but remain important today. These brave women, and others like them, went all over the world to prove that the desire to see for oneself not only changes the course of human knowledge, it changes the very idea of what is possible. They used the power of curiosity to try and understand the viewpoints and peculiarities of other places, perhaps because they, themselves, were seen as so unusual in their own societies. But their journeys revealed to them something more than the ways of foreign lands, they revealed something only they, themselves, could find: a sense of their own self.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What did Alexandra David-Neel do when she was prevented from crossing the Tibetan border?
Options: A. Snuck across secretly in the night, B. Changed her travel plans, C. Protested that the rule was unfair, D. Disguised herself as a local man
Correct Option: D

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: How did Alexandra David-Neel disguise herself to cross the border from India into Tibet?

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Hello, humans. My name is Matt and for the next several moments, you are going to listen to me. Mwah, ha, ha, ha, ha. Sorry. I'm just joking. This is my normal voice. Have you ever taken direction from a mysterious voice on the computer before? No? Perfect! I want to try an experiment with you, but I can't tell you what that experiment entails because if I do, it won't work. You'll just have to trust me. This will all make sense soon, hopefully. If you're sitting down, stand up from your chair and take a step back. In a moment, I'm going to have you twirl around, so give yourself a bit of space. Need to move some furniture around? Take your time. I'll wait. On the count of three, you're going to start hopping on one foot. Are you ready? One, two, three! Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop. Nice work! OK, while you're still hopping, I now want you to begin barking like a dog. Ruff, ruff; ruff, ruff; ruff, ruff. Wow, that's quite a bark! And a few more. Ruff, ruff, ruff. And three, two, one, stop! Feel free to relax and sit back down. Now, I want you think about how much time passed between the moment I said, "Go!" and you began hopping on one foot to the moment I said, "Stop!" Take a guess. I'm looking for an exact number of seconds or minutes. Now, with a pen and paper, write that number down. All done? The exact time was actually 26 seconds. Did you overestimate? Chances are that you did. So, what was the culprit? The culprit was time perception. Although we can make shockingly precise time estimates, when we experience something new, unusual, or dynamic, like hopping on one foot while taking instructions from a voice on the computer, or, say, jumping out of an airplane, we often miscalculate how much time has passed. Meaning, if you bungee jump for the first time, your fall to the bottom may seem like it lasted for 10 seconds while the recorded time may actually show that the jump only lasted for 5. The reason for this difference is unlike your body's physical drop to the bottom, your brain's perception of time does not follow a straight line between two points. Some scientists even believe your brain follows more of a curved path that is dependent on the amount of information you take in as you fall downwards. For example, David Eagleman, a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine, believes time perception is heavily influenced by the number of memories and data you record onto your brain. When you have a new experience, like jumping off a high dive for the first time, your senses are heightened. You're taking in more details about sights, sounds, and smells than you normally would. And you store more data onto your brain in the form of memories. So, the more data you store in your brain, like the smell of chlorine as you leapt from the high dive or the color of the water, the longer your perception of that experience. Meaning, the number of memories and data you record on your brain has a direct impact on how long you believe that experience to have lasted. Have you ever heard a person recount what it's like to be in a car accident? Although automotive accidents typically last seconds, those involved often say they felt the accident lasted far longer. Time perception can also account for why your childhood may have seem to have lasted forever. By adulthood, a year can slip by in a heartbeat, but children record more data onto their brains. This occurs because many of the experiences we have as children are new and unfamiliar to us. The stack of encoded memories on your brain is so dense that reading them back makes you believe your experiences must have taken forever. Additionally, when you're 5 years old, one year is 1/5 of your life. But, when you're 25, one year makes up 1/25, further altering your perception of time. And, if you're an adult, think about a trip that you may have taken to a far-away land for the first time. Didn't those two weeks you spent exploring your surroundings seem to have lasted far longer than 14 days? Though time perception is rooted in both hard science and theory, it provides a great lesson for us on how to live our lives. I'm sure you have all heard that a person shouldn't sit on a couch and let life pass them by. Well, time perception tells us why that is. If you get up and engage with the world and have new experiences, and maybe even hop around on one foot and bark like a dog, you will literally perceive your own life to have lasted for a longer period of time.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Hello, humans. My name is Matt and for the next several moments, you are going to listen to me. Mwah, ha, ha, ha, ha. Sorry. I'm just joking. This is my normal voice. Have you ever taken direction from a mysterious voice on the computer before? No? Perfect! I want to try an experiment with you, but I can't tell you what that experiment entails because if I do, it won't work. You'll just have to trust me. This will all make sense soon, hopefully. If you're sitting down, stand up from your chair and take a step back. In a moment, I'm going to have you twirl around, so give yourself a bit of space. Need to move some furniture around? Take your time. I'll wait. On the count of three, you're going to start hopping on one foot. Are you ready? One, two, three! Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop. Nice work! OK, while you're still hopping, I now want you to begin barking like a dog. Ruff, ruff; ruff, ruff; ruff, ruff. Wow, that's quite a bark! And a few more. Ruff, ruff, ruff. And three, two, one, stop! Feel free to relax and sit back down. Now, I want you think about how much time passed between the moment I said, "Go!" and you began hopping on one foot to the moment I said, "Stop!" Take a guess. I'm looking for an exact number of seconds or minutes. Now, with a pen and paper, write that number down. All done? The exact time was actually 26 seconds. Did you overestimate? Chances are that you did. So, what was the culprit? The culprit was time perception. Although we can make shockingly precise time estimates, when we experience something new, unusual, or dynamic, like hopping on one foot while taking instructions from a voice on the computer, or, say, jumping out of an airplane, we often miscalculate how much time has passed. Meaning, if you bungee jump for the first time, your fall to the bottom may seem like it lasted for 10 seconds while the recorded time may actually show that the jump only lasted for 5. The reason for this difference is unlike your body's physical drop to the bottom, your brain's perception of time does not follow a straight line between two points. Some scientists even believe your brain follows more of a curved path that is dependent on the amount of information you take in as you fall downwards. For example, David Eagleman, a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine, believes time perception is heavily influenced by the number of memories and data you record onto your brain. When you have a new experience, like jumping off a high dive for the first time, your senses are heightened. You're taking in more details about sights, sounds, and smells than you normally would. And you store more data onto your brain in the form of memories. So, the more data you store in your brain, like the smell of chlorine as you leapt from the high dive or the color of the water, the longer your perception of that experience. Meaning, the number of memories and data you record on your brain has a direct impact on how long you believe that experience to have lasted. Have you ever heard a person recount what it's like to be in a car accident? Although automotive accidents typically last seconds, those involved often say they felt the accident lasted far longer. Time perception can also account for why your childhood may have seem to have lasted forever. By adulthood, a year can slip by in a heartbeat, but children record more data onto their brains. This occurs because many of the experiences we have as children are new and unfamiliar to us. The stack of encoded memories on your brain is so dense that reading them back makes you believe your experiences must have taken forever. Additionally, when you're 5 years old, one year is 1/5 of your life. But, when you're 25, one year makes up 1/25, further altering your perception of time. And, if you're an adult, think about a trip that you may have taken to a far-away land for the first time. Didn't those two weeks you spent exploring your surroundings seem to have lasted far longer than 14 days? Though time perception is rooted in both hard science and theory, it provides a great lesson for us on how to live our lives. I'm sure you have all heard that a person shouldn't sit on a couch and let life pass them by. Well, time perception tells us why that is. If you get up and engage with the world and have new experiences, and maybe even hop around on one foot and bark like a dog, you will literally perceive your own life to have lasted for a longer period of time.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Imagine a world in which you see numbers and letters as colored even though they're printed in black, in which music or voices trigger a swirl of moving, colored shapes, in which words and names fill your mouth with unusual flavors. Jail tastes like cold, hard bacon while Derek tastes like earwax. Welcome to synesthesia, the neurological phenomenon that couples two or more senses in 4% of the population. A synesthete might not only hear my voice, but also see it, taste it, or feel it as a physical touch. Sharing the same root with anesthesia, meaning no sensation, synesthesia means joined sensation. Having one type, such as colored hearing, gives you a 50% chance of having a second, third, or fourth type. One in 90 among us experience graphemes, the written elements of language, like letters, numerals, and punctuation marks, as saturated with color. Some even have gender or personality. For Gail, 3 is athletic and sporty, 9 is a vain, elitist girl. By contrast, the sound units of language, or phonemes, trigger synestetic tastes. For James, college tastes like sausage, as does message and similar words with the -age ending. Synesthesia is a trait, like having blue eyes, rather than a disorder because there's nothing wrong. In fact, all the extra hooks endow synesthetes with superior memories. For example, a girl runs into someone she met long ago. "Let's see, she had a green name. D's are green: Debra, Darby, Dorothy, Denise. Yes! Her name is Denise!" Once established in childhood, pairings remain fixed for life. Synesthetes inherit a biological propensity for hyperconnecting brain neurons, but then must be exposed to cultural artifacts, such as calendars, food names, and alphabets. The amazing thing is that a single nucleotide change in the sequence of one's DNA alters perception. In this way, synesthesia provides a path to understanding subjective differences, how two people can see the same thing differently. Take Sean, who prefers blue tasting food, such as milk, oranges, and spinach. The gene heightens normally occurring connections between the taste area in his frontal lobe and the color area further back. But suppose in someone else that the gene acted in non-sensory areas. You would then have the ability to link seemingly unrelated things, which is the definition of metaphor, seeing the similar in the dissimilar. Not surprisingly, synesthesia is more common in artists who excel at making metaphors, like novelist Vladimir Nabokov, painter David Hockney, and composers Billy Joel and Lady Gaga. But why do the rest of us non-synesthetes understand metaphors like "sharp cheese" or "sweet person"? It so happens that sight, sound, and movement already map to one another so closely, that even bad ventriloquists convince us that the dummy is talking. Movies, likewise, can convince us that the sound is coming from the actors' mouths rather than surrounding speakers. So, inwardly, we're all synesthetes, outwardly unaware of the perceptual couplings happening all the time. Cross-talk in the brain is the rule, not the exception. And that sounds like a sweet deal to me!

Not surprisingly, synesthesia is more common in artists who excel at making metaphors, like novelist Vladimir Nabokov, painter David Hockney, and composers Billy Joel and Lady Gaga. But why do the rest of us non-synesthetes understand metaphors like "sharp cheese" or "sweet person"? It so happens that sight, sound, and movement already map to one another so closely, that even bad ventriloquists convince us that the dummy is talking. Movies, likewise, can convince us that the sound is coming from the actors' mouths rather than surrounding speakers. So, inwardly, we're all synesthetes, outwardly unaware of the perceptual couplings happening all the time. Cross-talk in the brain is the rule, not the exception. And that sounds like a sweet deal to me!

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Imagine a world in which you see numbers and letters as colored even though they're printed in black, in which music or voices trigger a swirl of moving, colored shapes, in which words and names fill your mouth with unusual flavors. Jail tastes like cold, hard bacon while Derek tastes like earwax. Welcome to synesthesia, the neurological phenomenon that couples two or more senses in 4% of the population. A synesthete might not only hear my voice, but also see it, taste it, or feel it as a physical touch. Sharing the same root with anesthesia, meaning no sensation, synesthesia means joined sensation. Having one type, such as colored hearing, gives you a 50% chance of having a second, third, or fourth type. One in 90 among us experience graphemes, the written elements of language, like letters, numerals, and punctuation marks, as saturated with color. Some even have gender or personality. For Gail, 3 is athletic and sporty, 9 is a vain, elitist girl. By contrast, the sound units of language, or phonemes, trigger synestetic tastes. For James, college tastes like sausage, as does message and similar words with the -age ending. Synesthesia is a trait, like having blue eyes, rather than a disorder because there's nothing wrong. In fact, all the extra hooks endow synesthetes with superior memories. For example, a girl runs into someone she met long ago. "Let's see, she had a green name. D's are green: Debra, Darby, Dorothy, Denise. Yes! Her name is Denise!" Once established in childhood, pairings remain fixed for life. Synesthetes inherit a biological propensity for hyperconnecting brain neurons, but then must be exposed to cultural artifacts, such as calendars, food names, and alphabets. The amazing thing is that a single nucleotide change in the sequence of one's DNA alters perception. In this way, synesthesia provides a path to understanding subjective differences, how two people can see the same thing differently. Take Sean, who prefers blue tasting food, such as milk, oranges, and spinach. The gene heightens normally occurring connections between the taste area in his frontal lobe and the color area further back. But suppose in someone else that the gene acted in non-sensory areas. You would then have the ability to link seemingly unrelated things, which is the definition of metaphor, seeing the similar in the dissimilar.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] so i want to start by um offering you a free no tech life hack um and all it requires of you is this that you change your posture for two minutes but before i give it away i want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body so how many of you are sort of making yourself smaller maybe you're hunching um crossing your legs maybe wrapping your ankles sometimes we hold on to our arms like this sometimes we spread out i see you so i want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now we're going to come back to that in a few minutes and i'm hoping that if you sort of learn to tweak this a little bit it could significantly change the way your life unfolds um so we're really fascinated with body language and we're particularly interested in other people's body language you know we're interested in like you know um a uh uh an awkward interaction or a smile or a contemptuous glance or maybe a very awkward wink or maybe even something like a handshake here they are arriving at number 10 and uh look at this lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the president of the united states on here comes the prime minister of it now so um a handshake or the lack of a handshake can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks even the bbc in the new york times so so obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior or body language but we call it nonverbals as social scientists it's language so we think about communication when we think about communication we think about interactions so what is your body language communicating to me what's mine communicating to you and there's a lot of reason to be to believe that this is this is a valid way to look at this so social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of of our body language or other people's body language on judgments and we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language and those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote um who we ask out on the date for example uh nalani ambadi a researcher at tufts university shows that when people watch 30 minute a 30 second soundless clips of real physician patient interactions their judgments of the physician's niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued so it doesn't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent but do we like that person and how they interacted um even more dramatic alex todorov at princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates faces in just one second predict 70 percent of u.s senate and gubernatorial race outcomes and even let's go digital emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead you to claim more value from that negotiation if you use them poorly bad idea right so so when we think of nonverbals we think of how we judge others how they judge us and what the outcomes are we tend to forget though the other audience that's influenced by our nonverbals and that's ourselves we are also influenced by our non-verbals our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology so what nonverbals am i talking about i'm a social psychologist i study prejudice and i teach at a competitive business school so it was inevitable that i would become interested in power dynamics i became especially interested in non-verbal expressions of power and dominance and what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance well this is what they are so in the animal kingdom they are about expanding so you make yourself big you stretch out you take up space you're basically opening up it's about opening up and this is true across the animal kingdom it's not just limited to primates and humans do the same thing so they do this both when they when they have power sort of chronically and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment and this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are this expression which is known as pride jessica tracy has studied she shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition so when they cross the finish line and they've won it doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it they do this so the arms up in the v the chin is slightly lifted what do we do when we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite we close up we wrap ourselves up we make ourselves small we don't want to bump into the person next to us so again both animals and humans do the same thing and this is what happens when you put together high and low power so what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the others non-verbals so if someone's being really powerful with us we tend to make ourselves smaller we don't mirror them we do the opposite of them so i'm watching this behavior in the classroom and what do i notice i notice that mba students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbal so you have people who are like caricatures of alphas like really come into the room they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts like they really want to occupy space when they sit down they're sort of spread out they raise their hands like this you have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in as soon as they come in you see it you see it on their faces and their bodies and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny and they go like this when they raise their hand i notice a couple things about this one you're not going to be surprised it seems to be related to gender so women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men women feel chronically less powerful than men so this is not surprising but the other thing i noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating and how well they were participating and this is really important in the mba classroom because participation counts for half a grade so business schools have been struggling with its gender grade gap you get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences and grades and it seems to be partly attributable to participation so i started to wonder you know okay so you have these people coming in like this and they're participating is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more so my main collaborator dana carney who's at berkeley and i really wanted to know can you fake it till you make it like can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful so we know that our non-verbals govern how other people think and feel about us there's a lot of evidence but our question really was do our non-verbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves there's some evidence that they do so for example um when we we smile when we feel happy but also when we're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this it makes us feel happy so it goes both ways when it comes to power um it also goes both ways so when you when you uh feel powerful you're more likely to do this but it's also possible that um when you when you pretend to be powerful you are more likely to actually feel powerful so the second question really was you know so we know that our minds change our bodies but is it also true that that our bodies change our minds and when i say minds in the case of the powerful what am i talking about so i'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings and in my case that's hormones i look at hormones so what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like so powerful people tend to be not surprisingly more assertive and more confident more more optimistic they actually feel that they're going to win even at games of chance they also tend to be able to think more abstractly so there are a lot of differences they take more risks there are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people physiologically there also our differences on two key hormones testosterone which is the dominance hormone and cortisol which is the stress hormone so what we find is that um a high power alpha males and primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol so what does that mean when you think about power 10 people tended to think only about testosterone because that was about dominance but really power is also about how you react to stress so do you want the high power leader that's dominant high on testosterone but really stress reactive probably not right you want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant but not very stress reactive the person who's laid back so we know that in in private hierarchies if an alpha needs to take over uh if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly within a few days that individual's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly so we have this evidence both that the body can shape the mind at least at the facial level and also that role changes can shape the mind so what happens okay you take a role change what happens if you do that at a really minimal level like this tiny manipulation this tiny intervention for two minutes you say i want you to stand like this and it's going to make you feel more powerful so this is what we did we decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment and these people adopted for two minutes either high power poses or low power poses and i'm just going to show you five of the poses although they took on on two so here's one a couple more this one has been dubbed the wonder woman by the media here a couple more so you can be standing or you can be sitting and here are the low power poses so you're folding up you're making yourself small this one is very low power when you're touching your neck you're really kind of protecting yourself so this is what happens they come in they spit into a vial we for two minutes say you need to do this or this they don't look at pictures of the poses we don't want to prime them with a concept of power we want them to be feeling power right so two minutes they do this we then ask them how powerful do you feel on a series of items and then we give them an opportunity to gamble and then we take another saliva sample that's it that's the whole experiment so this is what we find risk tolerance which is the gambling what we find is that when you're not when the when you're in the high power pose condition 86 of you will gamble when you're in the low power post condition only 60 and that's a pretty whopping significant difference here's what we find on testosterone from their baseline when they come in high-powered people experience about a 20 increase and low power people experience about a 10 decrease so again two minutes and you get these changes here's what you get on cortisol high power people experience about a 25 decrease and the low power people experience about a 15 increase so two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive confident and comfortable or really stress reactive and you know feeling sort of shut down and we've all had that feeling right so it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves so it's not just others but it's also ourselves also our bodies change our minds but the next question of course is can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways so this is in the lab it's this little task you know it's just a couple of minutes you know where can you actually apply this which we cared about of course and so we think it's really what what what matters i mean where you want to use this is evaluative situations like social threat situations where are you being evaluated either by your friends like for teenagers at the lunchroom table it could be you know for some people speaking at a school board meeting it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview we decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through was the job interview so um we published these these findings and the media are all over and they say um okay so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview right you know so we were of course horrified and said oh my god no no no that's not what we meant at all for numerous reasons no no no don't do that again this is not about you talking to other people it's you talking to yourself what do you do before you go into a job interview you do this right you're sitting down you're looking at your iphone or your android not trying to leave anyone out um you are you know you're looking at your notes you're hunting up making yourself small when really what you should be doing maybe is this like in the bathroom right do that find two minutes so that's what we want to test okay so we bring people into a lab and they do a cup they do either higher low power poses again they go through a very stressful job interview it's five minutes long they are being recorded they're being judged also and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback so they look like this like imagine this is the person interviewing you so for five minutes nothing and this is worse than being heckled people hate this it's it's what marianne lafrance calls standing in social quicksand so this really spikes your cortisol so this is the job interview we put them through because we really wanted to see what happened we then have these coders look at these tapes four of them they're blind to the hypothesis they're blind to the conditions they have no idea who's been posing in what pose and they they end up looking at these sets of tapes and they say oh we want to hire these people all the high power posers we don't want to hire these people we also evaluate these people much more positively overall but what's driving it it's not about the content of the speech it's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech we also because we rate them on all these variables related to sort of competence like how well structured is the speech how good is it what are their qualifications no effect on those things this is what's affected these kinds of things people are bringing their true selves basically they're bringing themselves they bring their ideas but as themselves with no you know residue over them so this is what's driving the effect or media mediating the effect so um when i tell people about this that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior and our behavior can change our outcomes they say to me i don't it feels fake right so i said fake it till you make it like i don't it's not me like i don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud i don't want to feel like an imposter i don't want to get there only to feel like i'm not supposed to be here and that really resonated with me because i want to tell you a little story about being an imposter and feeling like i'm not supposed to be here when i was 19 i was in a really bad car accident i was thrown out of a car rolled several times i was thrown from the car and i woke up in a head injury rehab ward and i had been withdrawn from college and i learned that my iq had dropped by two standard deviations which was um very traumatic i knew my iq because i had identified with being smart and i had been called gifted as a child so i'm taken out of college i keep trying to go back they say you're not gonna finish college like just you know there's there are other things for you to do but that's not gonna work out for you so i really struggled with this and i have to say having your identity taken from you your core identity and if for me it was being smart having that taken from you there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that so i felt entirely powerless i worked and worked and worked and i got lucky and worked and got lucky and worked eventually i graduated from college took me four years longer than my peers and i convinced someone my my angel advisor susan fisk to take me on and so i ended up at princeton and i was like i am not supposed to be here i am an imposter and the night before my first year talking the first year talk at princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people that's it i was so afraid of being found out the next day that i called her and said i'm quitting she was like you are not quitting because i took a gamble on you and you're staying you're going to stay and this is what you're going to do you're going to fake it you're going to take you're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do you're just gonna do it and do it and do it even if you're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience until you have this moment where you say oh my gosh i'm doing it like i have become this i am actually doing this so that's what i did five years in grad school a few years you know i'm at northwestern i moved to harvard i'm at harvard i'm not really thinking about it anymore but for a long time i had been thinking not supposed to be here not supposed to be here so at the end of my first year at harvard a student who had not talked in class the entire semester who had said look you've got to participate or else you're going to fail came into my office i really didn't know her at all and she said she came in totally defeated and she said i'm not supposed to be here and that was the moment for me because two things happened one was that i realized oh my gosh i don't feel like that anymore you know i don't feel that anymore but she does and i get that feeling and the second was she is supposed to be here like she can fake it she can become it so he's like yes you are you are supposed to be here and tomorrow you're gonna fake it you're gonna make yourself powerful and you know you're gonna and you're gonna go you're gonna go into the classroom and you are gonna give the best comment ever you know and she gave the best comment ever and people turned around they were like oh my god i didn't even notice her sitting there you know she comes back to me months later and i realized that she had not just faked it till she made it she had actually faked it till she became it so she had changed um and so i i i want to say to you don't fake it till you make it fake it till you become it you know it's not do it enough until you actually become it and internalize the last thing i want to leave you with is this tiny tweaks can lead to big changes so this is two minutes two minutes two minutes two minutes before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation for two minutes try doing this in the elevator in a bathroom stall at your desk behind closed doors that's what you want to do get configure your brain to cope the best in that situation get your testosterone up get your quarters all down don't leave that situation feeling like oh i didn't show them who i am leave that situation feeling like i really feel like i got to say who i am and show who i am so i want to ask you first you know both to try power posing and also i want to ask you to share this science because this is simple i don't have ego involved in this give it away like share it with people because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power give it to them because they can do it in private they need their bodies privacy and two minutes and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life thank you [Music] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] so i want to start by um offering you a free no tech life hack um and all it requires of you is this that you change your posture for two minutes but before i give it away i want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body so how many of you are sort of making yourself smaller maybe you're hunching um crossing your legs maybe wrapping your ankles sometimes we hold on to our arms like this sometimes we spread out i see you so i want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now we're going to come back to that in a few minutes and i'm hoping that if you sort of learn to tweak this a little bit it could significantly change the way your life unfolds um so we're really fascinated with body language and we're particularly interested in other people's body language you know we're interested in like you know um a uh uh an awkward interaction or a smile or a contemptuous glance or maybe a very awkward wink or maybe even something like a handshake here they are arriving at number 10 and uh look at this lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the president of the united states on here comes the prime minister of it now so um a handshake or the lack of a handshake can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks even the bbc in the new york times so so obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior or body language but we call it nonverbals as social scientists it's language so we think about communication when we think about communication we think about interactions so what is your body language communicating to me what's mine communicating to you and there's a lot of reason to be to believe that this is this is a valid way to look at this so social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of of our body language or other people's body language on judgments and we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language and those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote um who we ask out on the date for example uh nalani ambadi a researcher at tufts university shows that when people watch 30 minute a 30 second soundless clips of real physician patient interactions their judgments of the physician's niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued so it doesn't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent but do we like that person and how they interacted um even more dramatic alex todorov at princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates faces in just one second predict 70 percent of u.s senate and gubernatorial race outcomes and even let's go digital emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead you to claim more value from that negotiation if you use them poorly bad idea right so so when we think of nonverbals we think of how we judge others how they judge us and what the outcomes are we tend to forget though the other audience that's influenced by our nonverbals and that's ourselves we are also influenced by our non-verbals our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology so what nonverbals am i talking about i'm a social psychologist i study prejudice and i teach at a competitive business school so it was inevitable that i would become interested in power dynamics i became especially interested in non-verbal expressions of power and dominance and what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance well this is what they are so in the animal kingdom they are about expanding so you make yourself big you stretch out you take up space you're basically opening up it's about opening up and this is true across the animal kingdom it's not just limited to primates and humans do the same thing so they do this both when they when they have power sort of chronically and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment and this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are this expression which is known as pride jessica tracy has studied she shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition so when they cross the finish line and they've won it doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it they do this so the arms up in the v the chin is slightly lifted what do we do when we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite we close up we wrap ourselves up we make ourselves small we don't want to bump into the person next to us so again both animals and humans do the same thing and this is what happens when you put together high and low power so what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the others non-verbals so if someone's being really powerful with us we tend to make ourselves smaller we don't mirror them we do the opposite of them so i'm watching this behavior in the classroom and what do i notice i notice that mba students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbal so you have people who are like caricatures of alphas like really come into the room they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts like they really want to occupy space when they sit down they're sort of spread out they raise their hands like this you have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in as soon as they come in you see it you see it on their faces and their bodies and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny and they go like this when they raise their hand i notice a couple things about this one you're not going to be surprised it seems to be related to gender so women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men women feel chronically less powerful than men so this is not surprising but the other thing i noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating and how well they were participating and this is really important in the mba classroom because participation counts for half a grade so business schools have been struggling with its gender grade gap you get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences and grades and it seems to be partly attributable to participation so i started to wonder you know okay so you have these people coming in like this and they're participating is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more so my main collaborator dana carney who's at berkeley and i really wanted to know can you fake it till you make it like can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful so we know that our non-verbals govern how other people think and feel about us there's a lot of evidence but our question really was do our non-verbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves there's some evidence that they do so for example um when we we smile when we feel happy but also when we're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this it makes us feel happy so it goes both ways when it comes to power um it also goes both ways so when you when you uh feel powerful you're more likely to do this but it's also possible that um when you when you pretend to be powerful you are more likely to actually feel powerful so the second question really was you know so we know that our minds change our bodies but is it also true that that our bodies change our minds and when i say minds in the case of the powerful what am i talking about so i'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings and in my case that's hormones i look at hormones so what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like so powerful people tend to be not surprisingly more assertive and more confident more more optimistic they actually feel that they're going to win even at games of chance they also tend to be able to think more abstractly so there are a lot of differences they take more risks there are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people physiologically there also our differences on two key hormones testosterone which is the dominance hormone and cortisol which is the stress hormone so what we find is that um a high power alpha males and primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol so what does that mean when you think about power 10 people tended to think only about testosterone because that was about dominance but really power is also about how you react to stress so do you want the high power leader that's dominant high on testosterone but really stress reactive probably not right you want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant but not very stress reactive the person who's laid back so we know that in in private hierarchies if an alpha needs to take over uh if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly within a few days that individual's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly so we have this evidence both that the body can shape the mind at least at the facial level and also that role changes can shape the mind so what happens okay you take a role change what happens if you do that at a really minimal level like this tiny manipulation this tiny intervention for two minutes you say i want you to stand like this and it's going to make you feel more powerful so this is what we did we decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment and these people adopted for two minutes either high power poses or low power poses and i'm just going to show you five of the poses although they took on on two so here's one a couple more this one has been dubbed the wonder woman by the media here a couple more so you can be standing or you can be sitting and here are the low power poses so you're folding up you're making yourself small this one is very low power when you're touching your neck you're really kind of protecting yourself so this is what happens they come in they spit into a vial we for two minutes say you need to do this or this they don't look at pictures of the poses we don't want to prime them with a concept of power we want them to be feeling power right so two minutes they do this we then ask them how powerful do you feel on a series of items and then we give them an opportunity to gamble and then we take another saliva sample that's it that's the whole experiment so this is what we find risk tolerance which is the gambling what we find is that when you're not when the when you're in the high power pose condition 86 of you will gamble when you're in the low power post condition only 60 and that's a pretty whopping significant difference here's what we find on testosterone from their baseline when they come in high-powered people experience about a 20 increase and low power people experience about a 10 decrease so again two minutes and you get these changes here's what you get on cortisol high power people experience about a 25 decrease and the low power people experience about a 15 increase so two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive confident and comfortable or really stress reactive and you know feeling sort of shut down and we've all had that feeling right so it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves so it's not just others but it's also ourselves also our bodies change our minds but the next question of course is can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways so this is in the lab it's this little task you know it's just a couple of minutes you know where can you actually apply this which we cared about of course and so we think it's really what what what matters i mean where you want to use this is evaluative situations like social threat situations where are you being evaluated either by your friends like for teenagers at the lunchroom table it could be you know for some people speaking at a school board meeting it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview we decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through was the job interview so um we published these these findings and the media are all over and they say um okay so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview right you know so we were of course horrified and said oh my god no no no that's not what we meant at all for numerous reasons no no no don't do that again this is not about you talking to other people it's you talking to yourself what do you do before you go into a job interview you do this right you're sitting down you're looking at your iphone or your android not trying to leave anyone out um you are you know you're looking at your notes you're hunting up making yourself small when really what you should be doing maybe is this like in the bathroom right do that find two minutes so that's what we want to test okay so we bring people into a lab and they do a cup they do either higher low power poses again they go through a very stressful job interview it's five minutes long they are being recorded they're being judged also and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback so they look like this like imagine this is the person interviewing you so for five minutes nothing and this is worse than being heckled people hate this it's it's what marianne lafrance calls standing in social quicksand so this really spikes your cortisol so this is the job interview we put them through because we really wanted to see what happened we then have these coders look at these tapes four of them they're blind to the hypothesis they're blind to the conditions they have no idea who's been posing in what pose and they they end up looking at these sets of tapes and they say oh we want to hire these people all the high power posers we don't want to hire these people we also evaluate these people much more positively overall but what's driving it it's not about the content of the speech it's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech we also because we rate them on all these variables related to sort of competence like how well structured is the speech how good is it what are their qualifications no effect on those things this is what's affected these kinds of things people are bringing their true selves basically they're bringing themselves they bring their ideas but as themselves with no you know residue over them so this is what's driving the effect or media mediating the effect so um when i tell people about this that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior and our behavior can change our outcomes they say to me i don't it feels fake right so i said fake it till you make it like i don't it's not me like i don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud i don't want to feel like an imposter i don't want to get there only to feel like i'm not supposed to be here and that really resonated with me because i want to tell you a little story about being an imposter and feeling like i'm not supposed to be here when i was 19 i was in a really bad car accident i was thrown out of a car rolled several times i was thrown from the car and i woke up in a head injury rehab ward and i had been withdrawn from college and i learned that my iq had dropped by two standard deviations which was um very traumatic i knew my iq because i had identified with being smart and i had been called gifted as a child so i'm taken out of college i keep trying to go back they say you're not gonna finish college like just you know there's there are other things for you to do but that's not gonna work out for you so i really struggled with this and i have to say having your identity taken from you your core identity and if for me it was being smart having that taken from you there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that so i felt entirely powerless i worked and worked and worked and i got lucky and worked and got lucky and worked eventually i graduated from college took me four years longer than my peers and i convinced someone my my angel advisor susan fisk to take me on and so i ended up at princeton and i was like i am not supposed to be here i am an imposter and the night before my first year talking the first year talk at princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people that's it i was so afraid of being found out the next day that i called her and said i'm quitting she was like you are not quitting because i took a gamble on you and you're staying you're going to stay and this is what you're going to do you're going to fake it you're going to take you're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do you're just gonna do it and do it and do it even if you're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience until you have this moment where you say oh my gosh i'm doing it like i have become this i am actually doing this so that's what i did five years in grad school a few years you know i'm at northwestern i moved to harvard i'm at harvard i'm not really thinking about it anymore but for a long time i had been thinking not supposed to be here not supposed to be here so at the end of my first year at harvard a student who had not talked in class the entire semester who had said look you've got to participate or else you're going to fail came into my office i really didn't know her at all and she said she came in totally defeated and she said i'm not supposed to be here and that was the moment for me because two things happened one was that i realized oh my gosh i don't feel like that anymore you know i don't feel that anymore but she does and i get that feeling and the second was she is supposed to be here like she can fake it she can become it so he's like yes you are you are supposed to be here and tomorrow you're gonna fake it you're gonna make yourself powerful and you know you're gonna and you're gonna go you're gonna go into the classroom and you are gonna give the best comment ever you know and she gave the best comment ever and people turned around they were like oh my god i didn't even notice her sitting there you know she comes back to me months later and i realized that she had not just faked it till she made it she had actually faked it till she became it so she had changed um and so i i i want to say to you don't fake it till you make it fake it till you become it you know it's not do it enough until you actually become it and internalize the last thing i want to leave you with is this tiny tweaks can lead to big changes so this is two minutes two minutes two minutes two minutes before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation for two minutes try doing this in the elevator in a bathroom stall at your desk behind closed doors that's what you want to do get configure your brain to cope the best in that situation get your testosterone up get your quarters all down don't leave that situation feeling like oh i didn't show them who i am leave that situation feeling like i really feel like i got to say who i am and show who i am so i want to ask you first you know both to try power posing and also i want to ask you to share this science because this is simple i don't have ego involved in this give it away like share it with people because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power give it to them because they can do it in private they need their bodies privacy and two minutes and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life thank

um when we we smile when we feel happy but also when we're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this it makes us feel happy so it goes both ways when it comes to power um it also goes both ways so when you when you uh feel powerful you're more likely to do this but it's also possible that um when you when you pretend to be powerful you are more likely to actually feel powerful so the second question really was you know so we know that our minds change our bodies but is it also true that that our bodies change our minds and when i say minds in the case of the powerful what am i talking about so i'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings and in my case that's hormones i look at hormones so what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like so powerful people tend to be not surprisingly more assertive and more confident more more optimistic they actually feel that they're going to win even at games of chance they also tend to be able to think more abstractly so there are a lot of differences they take more risks there are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people physiologically there also our differences on two key hormones testosterone which is the dominance hormone and cortisol which is the stress hormone so what we find is that um a high power alpha males and primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol so what does that mean when you think about power 10 people tended to think only about testosterone because that was about dominance but really power is also about how you react to stress so do you want the high power leader that's dominant high on testosterone but really stress reactive probably not right you want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant but not very stress reactive the person who's laid back so we know that in in private hierarchies if an alpha needs to take over uh if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly within a few days that individual's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly so we have this evidence both that the body can shape the mind at least at the facial level and also that role changes can shape the mind so what happens okay you take a role change what happens if you do that at a really minimal level like this tiny manipulation this tiny intervention for two minutes you say i want you to stand like this and it's going to make you feel more powerful so this is what we did we decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment and these people adopted for two minutes either high power poses or low power poses and i'm just going to show you five of the poses although they took on on two so here's one a couple more this one has been dubbed the wonder woman by the media here a couple more so you can be standing or you can be sitting and here are the low power poses so you're folding up you're making yourself small this one is very low power when you're touching your neck you're really kind of protecting yourself so this is what happens they come in they spit into a vial we for two minutes say you need to do this or this they don't look at pictures of the poses we don't want to prime them with a concept of power we want them to be feeling power right so two minutes they do this we then ask them how powerful do you feel on a series of items and then we give them an opportunity to gamble and then we take another saliva sample that's it that's the whole experiment so this is what we find risk tolerance which is the gambling what we find is that when you're not when the when you're in the high power pose condition 86 of you will gamble when you're in the low power post condition only 60 and that's a pretty whopping significant difference here's what we find on testosterone from their baseline when they come in high-powered people experience about a 20 increase and low power people experience about a 10 decrease so again two minutes and you get these changes here's what you get on cortisol high power people experience about a 25 decrease and the low power people experience about a 15 increase so two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive confident and comfortable or really stress reactive and you know feeling sort of shut down and we've all had that feeling right so it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves so it's not just others but it's also ourselves also our bodies change our minds but the next question of course is can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways so this is in the lab it's this little task you know it's just a couple of minutes you know where can you actually apply this which we cared about of course and so we think it's really what what what matters i mean where you want to use this is evaluative situations like social threat situations where are you being evaluated either by your friends like for teenagers at the lunchroom table it could be you know for some people speaking at a school board meeting it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview we decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through was the job interview so um we published these these findings and the media are all over and they say um okay so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview right you know so we were of course horrified and said oh my god no no no that's not what we meant at all for numerous reasons no no no don't do that again this is not about you talking to other people it's you talking to yourself what do you do before you go into a job interview you do this right you're sitting down you're looking at your iphone or your android not trying to leave anyone out um you are you know you're looking at your notes you're hunting up making yourself small when really what you should be doing maybe is this like in the bathroom right do that find two minutes so that's what we want to test okay so we bring people into a lab and they do a cup they do either higher low power poses again they go through a very stressful job interview it's five minutes long they are being recorded they're being judged also and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback so they look like this like imagine this is the person interviewing you so for five minutes nothing and this is worse than being heckled people hate this it's it's what marianne lafrance calls standing in social quicksand so this really spikes your cortisol so this is the job interview we put them through because we really wanted to see what happened we then have these coders look at these tapes four of them they're blind to the hypothesis they're blind to the conditions they have no idea who's been posing in what pose and they they end up looking at these sets of tapes and they say oh we want to hire these people all the high power posers we don't want to hire these people we also evaluate these people much more positively overall but what's driving it it's not about the content of the speech it's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech we also because we rate them on all these variables related to sort of competence like how well structured is the speech how good is it what are their qualifications no effect on those things this is what's affected these kinds of things people are bringing their true selves basically they're bringing themselves they bring their ideas but as themselves with no you know residue over them so this is what's driving the effect or media mediating the effect so um when i tell people about this that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior and our behavior can change our outcomes they say to me i don't it feels fake right so i said fake it till you make it like i don't it's not me like i don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud i don't want to feel like an imposter i don't want to get there only to feel like i'm not supposed to be here and that really resonated with me because i want to tell you a little story about being an imposter and feeling like i'm not supposed to be here when i was 19 i was in a really bad car accident i was thrown out of a car rolled several times i was thrown from the car and i woke up in a head injury rehab ward and i had been withdrawn from college and i learned that my iq had dropped by two standard deviations which was um very traumatic i knew my iq because i had identified with being smart and i had been called gifted as a child so i'm taken out of college i keep trying to go back they say you're not gonna finish college like just you know there's there are other things for you to do but that's not gonna work out for you so i really struggled with this and i have to say having your identity taken from you your core identity and if for me it was being smart having that taken from you there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that so i felt entirely powerless i worked and worked and worked and i got lucky and worked and got lucky and worked eventually i graduated from college took me four years longer than my peers and i convinced someone my my angel advisor susan fisk to take me on and so i ended up at princeton and i was like i am not supposed to be here i am an imposter and the night before my first year talking the first year talk at princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people that's it i was so afraid of being found out the next day that i called her and said i'm quitting she was like you are not quitting because i took a gamble on you and you're staying you're going to stay and this is what you're going to do you're going to fake it you're going to take you're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do you're just gonna do it and do it and do it even if you're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience until you have this moment where you say oh my gosh i'm doing it like i have become this i am actually doing this so that's what i did five years in grad school a few years you know i'm at northwestern i moved to harvard i'm at harvard i'm not really thinking about it anymore but for a long time i had been thinking not supposed to be here not supposed to be here so at the end of my first year at harvard a student who had not talked in class the entire semester who had said look you've got to participate or else you're going to fail came into my office i really didn't know her at all and she said she came in totally defeated and she said i'm not supposed to be here and that was the moment for me because two things happened one was that i realized oh my gosh i don't feel like that anymore you know i don't feel that anymore but she does and i get that feeling and the second was she is supposed to be here like she can fake it she can become it so he's like yes you are you are supposed to be here and tomorrow you're gonna fake it you're gonna make yourself powerful and you know you're gonna and you're gonna go you're gonna go into the classroom and you are gonna give the best comment ever you know and she gave the best comment ever and people turned around they were like oh my god i didn't even notice her sitting there you know she comes back to me months later and i realized that she had not just faked it till she made it she had actually faked it till she became it so she had changed um and so i i i want to say to you don't fake it till you make it fake it till you become it you know it's not do it enough until you actually become it and internalize the last thing i want to leave you with is this tiny tweaks can lead to big changes so this is two minutes two minutes two minutes two minutes before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation for two minutes try doing this in the elevator in a bathroom stall at your desk behind closed doors that's what you want to do get configure your brain to cope the best in that situation get your testosterone up get your quarters all down don't leave that situation feeling like oh i didn't show them who i am leave that situation feeling like i really feel like i got to say who i am and show who i am so i want to ask you first you know both to try power posing and also i want to ask you to share this science because this is simple i don't have ego involved in this give it away like share it with people because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power give it to them because they can do it in private they need their bodies privacy and two minutes and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life thank you [Music] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] so i want to start by um offering you a free no tech life hack um and all it requires of you is this that you change your posture for two minutes but before i give it away i want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body so how many of you are sort of making yourself smaller maybe you're hunching um crossing your legs maybe wrapping your ankles sometimes we hold on to our arms like this sometimes we spread out i see you so i want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now we're going to come back to that in a few minutes and i'm hoping that if you sort of learn to tweak this a little bit it could significantly change the way your life unfolds um so we're really fascinated with body language and we're particularly interested in other people's body language you know we're interested in like you know um a uh uh an awkward interaction or a smile or a contemptuous glance or maybe a very awkward wink or maybe even something like a handshake here they are arriving at number 10 and uh look at this lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the president of the united states on here comes the prime minister of it now so um a handshake or the lack of a handshake can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks even the bbc in the new york times so so obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior or body language but we call it nonverbals as social scientists it's language so we think about communication when we think about communication we think about interactions so what is your body language communicating to me what's mine communicating to you and there's a lot of reason to be to believe that this is this is a valid way to look at this so social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of of our body language or other people's body language on judgments and we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language and those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote um who we ask out on the date for example uh nalani ambadi a researcher at tufts university shows that when people watch 30 minute a 30 second soundless clips of real physician patient interactions their judgments of the physician's niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued so it doesn't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent but do we like that person and how they interacted um even more dramatic alex todorov at princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates faces in just one second predict 70 percent of u.s senate and gubernatorial race outcomes and even let's go digital emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead you to claim more value from that negotiation if you use them poorly bad idea right so so when we think of nonverbals we think of how we judge others how they judge us and what the outcomes are we tend to forget though the other audience that's influenced by our nonverbals and that's ourselves we are also influenced by our non-verbals our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology so what nonverbals am i talking about i'm a social psychologist i study prejudice and i teach at a competitive business school so it was inevitable that i would become interested in power dynamics i became especially interested in non-verbal expressions of power and dominance and what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance well this is what they are so in the animal kingdom they are about expanding so you make yourself big you stretch out you take up space you're basically opening up it's about opening up and this is true across the animal kingdom it's not just limited to primates and humans do the same thing so they do this both when they when they have power sort of chronically and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment and this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are this expression which is known as pride jessica tracy has studied she shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition so when they cross the finish line and they've won it doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it they do this so the arms up in the v the chin is slightly lifted what do we do when we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite we close up we wrap ourselves up we make ourselves small we don't want to bump into the person next to us so again both animals and humans do the same thing and this is what happens when you put together high and low power so what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the others non-verbals so if someone's being really powerful with us we tend to make ourselves smaller we don't mirror them we do the opposite of them so i'm watching this behavior in the classroom and what do i notice i notice that mba students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbal so you have people who are like caricatures of alphas like really come into the room they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts like they really want to occupy space when they sit down they're sort of spread out they raise their hands like this you have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in as soon as they come in you see it you see it on their faces and their bodies and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny and they go like this when they raise their hand i notice a couple things about this one you're not going to be surprised it seems to be related to gender so women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men women feel chronically less powerful than men so this is not surprising but the other thing i noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating and how well they were participating and this is really important in the mba classroom because participation counts for half a grade so business schools have been struggling with its gender grade gap you get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences and grades and it seems to be partly attributable to participation so i started to wonder you know okay so you have these people coming in like this and they're participating is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more so my main collaborator dana carney who's at berkeley and i really wanted to know can you fake it till you make it like can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful so we know that our non-verbals govern how other people think and feel about us there's a lot of evidence but our question really was do our non-verbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves there's some evidence that they do so for example um when we we smile when we feel happy but also when we're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this it makes us feel happy so it goes both ways when it comes to power um it also goes both ways so when you when you uh feel powerful you're more likely to do this but it's also possible that um when you when you pretend to be powerful you are more likely to actually feel powerful so the second question really was you know so we know that our minds change our bodies but is it also true that that our bodies change our minds and when i say minds in the case of the powerful what am i talking about so i'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings and in my case that's hormones i look at hormones so what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like so powerful people tend to be not surprisingly more assertive and more confident more more optimistic they actually feel that they're going to win even at games of chance they also tend to be able to think more abstractly so there are a lot of differences they take more risks there are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people physiologically there also our differences on two key hormones testosterone which is the dominance hormone and cortisol which is the stress hormone so what we find is that um a high power alpha males and primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol so what does that mean when you think about power 10 people tended to think only about testosterone because that was about dominance but really power is also about how you react to stress so do you want the high power leader that's dominant high on testosterone but really stress reactive probably not right you want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant but not very stress reactive the person who's laid back so we know that in in private hierarchies if an alpha needs to take over uh if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly within a few days that individual's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly so we have this evidence both that the body can shape the mind at least at the facial level and also that role changes can shape the mind so what happens okay you take a role change what happens if you do that at a really minimal level like this tiny manipulation this tiny intervention for two minutes you say i want you to stand like this and it's going to make you feel more powerful so this is what we did we decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment and these people adopted for two minutes either high power poses or low power

minutes two minutes two minutes two minutes before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation for two minutes try doing this in the elevator in a bathroom stall at your desk behind closed

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Venom, the poisonous fluid secreted by animals, like snakes and scorpions, typically transmitted by bite or sting. As vile as the word is now, the history of venom begins with the pleasant Indo-European root wen, which meant to desire or strive for. Perhaps, not surprisingly, wen also generated a number of amiable modern words, like win or wish. Wenes, a form of the original root, was tailored to the mythology of the time, and applied to the Roman goddess of love, Venus, known to the Greeks as Aphrodite and to the Egyptians as Hathor. From this milieu of amore, the word wenesom emerged, meaning love potion. Over time, wenesom became venenum, a word that specifically described potions or medicines that evoked intense physical reactions from the patient. The definition of venenum eventually narrowed to refer solely to poisonous concoctions, a shift that puts us within striking distance of the word under investigation. A bit of shortening and a slight distinction in source brings us to venom, a deadly fluid that comes from a snake rather than a pharmacist.

Question: What does the word wen mean?
Options: A. Parting ways, B. To accomplish a great task, C. To desire or strive for, D. A broken vessel formerly used for olive oil

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. How will you survive? You might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography, I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apocalypse is movement. So, first, what moves? People move, animals move, and, while sometimes slowly, zombies move as well. But that's not all. Goods move, too. Goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. People or zombies tend to move these. So, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where there wasn't one before, you're probably on the trail. Ideas also move. Ideas can include entertainment, zombie movies, news and information about zombie attacks, and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. And, second, why do people or zombies move? When people, animals, or zombies move, it's called migration. Two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. Push factors will make you want to leave somewhere. Pull factors make you want to go to a place. A lack of resources, unstable economy, or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. Nice weather, a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people, enticing them to move. While zombies are definitely a push factor for humans, a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. There are some things that make movement easier for people or zombies. Waterways and highways can make traveling faster. Moving across clear, open space is easier than a tough terrain. And just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries, like a border gate, for example. So, how can you analyze these movement factors to help your chance of survival? There are three basic steps. One - identify the points or locations to analyze. What are your options? Two - find what connects them. Are there highways, waterways, or open land? And three - find the patterns of movement that happen over that connection. Do people or goods move across it? By comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. For example, pick two cities. Look at the highway connecting them. If people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. But this other city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. There's even a river in the way. It doesn't have as strong of a relationship. If a zombie outbreak started here, which city would you rather start out in? Where would you flee to? So, how do you decide where to go in a zombie apocalypse? Do you just run in a random direction? Or do you use your geographic skills to lead your camp of survivors to safety? If you want to stay alive, it helps to understand how and why we move.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. How will you survive? You might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography, I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apocalypse is movement. So, first, what moves? People move, animals move, and, while sometimes slowly, zombies move as well. But that's not all. Goods move, too. Goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. People or zombies tend to move these. So, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where there wasn't one before, you're probably on the trail. Ideas also move. Ideas can include entertainment, zombie movies, news and information about zombie attacks, and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. And, second, why do people or zombies move? When people, animals, or zombies move, it's called migration. Two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. Push factors will make you want to leave somewhere. Pull factors make you want to go to a place. A lack of resources, unstable economy, or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. Nice weather, a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people, enticing them to move. While zombies are definitely a push factor for humans, a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. There are some things that make movement easier for people or zombies. Waterways and highways can make traveling faster. Moving across clear, open space is easier than a tough terrain. And just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries, like a border gate, for example. So, how can you analyze these movement factors to help your chance of survival? There are three basic steps. One - identify the points or locations to analyze. What are your options? Two - find what connects them. Are there highways, waterways, or open land? And three - find the patterns of movement that happen over that connection. Do people or goods move across it? By comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. For example, pick two cities. Look at the highway connecting them. If people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. But this other city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. There's even a river in the way. It doesn't have as strong of a relationship. If a zombie outbreak started here, which city would you rather start out in? Where would you flee to? So, how do you decide where to go in a zombie apocalypse? Do you just run in a random direction? Or do you use your geographic skills to lead your camp of survivors to safety? If you want to stay alive, it helps to understand how and why we move.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby There are still lots of things about space that we may never be able to answer, like is time travel possible? Or are aliens living somewhere else in the Milky Way? But there is one thing I believe about space: Space is trying to kill me. Space isn't out to get me personally. It's also trying to kill you and everybody else. Think about it. Space doesn't naturally have what we need to survive when we travel there: no air, it's too hot or too cold, no ozone to protect us from those nasty UV rays, either. This all sounds bad, but what can space really do to me if I stay on Earth? What we need to understand is that objects in space can cause people to think their days are numbered, even when there are events on Earth that can hurt or kill us before something from space does. So, what are the odds that one of these objects will really affect Earth and you and me in our lifetime? Well, we can take what we know about the universe to try and figure that out. You might have heard stories about asteroids hitting the Earth. That would be pretty bad. Scientists think asteroids might have killed off most of the dinosaurs. Sounds like something we should worry about, right? Well, astronomers can now watch asteroids in space and see them coming using complex computer models to predict the deadly rock's path. For a while, the reported odds that asteroid Apophis would strike Earth in 2036 were once 1 in 625. But, after updating their data, astronomers now say the chances are extremely low. Okay, what about the sun? Hollywood movies like to pick on our sun by showing Earth destroyed by solar flares or the sun dying out, which would cause Earth to freeze. Astronomers predict our sun contains enough gas to make energy for another 3 to 5 billion years. So, in 3 to 5 billion years, if people still exist on Earth, they'll have to deal with that. But today, well, we're safe. Sometimes the sun does shoot flares at Earth, but the magnetic fields surrounding our planet blocks most of that radiation. The radiation that does get through creates things like the Aurora Borealis. Gigantic solar flares can mess with our satellites and electrical equipment, but the chances of it killing you are pretty slim. Okay, what about that supermassive black hole in the middle of our galaxy? What happens to Earth, and us, when it pulls us in? After all, it is supermassive. Nope, not going to happen. That's one big object that can't bother us. How can we be so sure? Our solar system is on the edge of the Milky Way while the nearest supermassive black hole is about 26,000 light years from Earth. That means we aren't on that black hole's menu. So, you still think space objects are trying to kill you even after what I've told you so far? I think I've even convinced myself that odds are really good that space and the objects up there won't kill me after all. But I'll probably keep looking up just to make sure nothing is headed my way.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

You might have heard stories about asteroids hitting the Earth. That would be pretty bad. Scientists think asteroids might have killed off most of the dinosaurs. Sounds like something we should worry about, right? Well, astronomers can now watch asteroids in space and see them coming using complex computer models to predict the deadly rock's path. For a while, the reported odds that asteroid Apophis would strike Earth in 2036 were once 1 in 625. But, after updating their data, astronomers now say the chances are extremely low. Okay, what about the sun? Hollywood movies like to pick on our sun by showing Earth destroyed by solar flares or the sun dying out, which would cause Earth to freeze. Astronomers predict our sun contains enough gas to make energy for another 3 to 5 billion years. So, in 3 to 5 billion years, if people still exist on Earth, they'll have to deal with that. But today, well, we're safe. Sometimes the sun does shoot flares at Earth, but the magnetic fields surrounding our planet blocks most of that radiation. The radiation that does get through creates things like the Aurora Borealis. Gigantic solar flares can mess with our satellites and electrical equipment, but the chances of it killing you are pretty slim. Okay, what about that supermassive black hole in the middle of our galaxy? What happens to Earth, and us, when it pulls us in? After all, it is supermassive. Nope, not going to happen. That's one big object that can't bother us. How can we be so sure? Our solar system is on the edge of the Milky Way while the nearest supermassive black hole is about 26,000 light years from Earth. That means we aren't on that black hole's menu. So, you still think space objects are trying to kill you even after what I've told you so far? I think I've even convinced myself that odds are really good that space and the objects up there won't kill me after all. But I'll probably keep looking up just to make sure nothing is headed my way.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby When I was a kid, my understanding of the seasons was that December and January were cold and covered with snow, April and May were bursting with flowers, July and August were hot and sunshiny, and September and October were a kaleidoscope of colorful leaves. It was just the way the world worked, and it was magical. If you had told me back then that one-third of Earth's population had never seen snow or that July 4th was most definitely not a beach day, I would have thought you were crazy. But in reality, seasonal change with four distinct seasons only happens in two regions on the planet. And, even in those two, the seasons are reversed. But why? A lot of people have heard of an astronomer called Johannes Kepler and how he proved that planetary orbits are elliptical and that the sun is not at the center of the orbit. It was a big deal when he figured this out several hundred years ago. His discovery solved a lot of mathematical problems that astronomers were having with planetary orbit measurements. While it's true that our orbit's not perfectly circular, those pictures in our science books, on TV, and in the movies give an exaggerated impression of how elongated our orbit is. In fact, Earth's orbit is very nearly a perfect circle. However, because Earth's orbit is technically an ellipse, even though it doesn't look like one, and the sun isn't quite exactly at the center, it means that our distance from the sun does change through the year. Ah-ha! So, winter happens when the Earth is further away from the sun! Well, no, not so fast. The Earth is actually closer to the sun in January than we are in July by 5 million kilometers. January is smack-dab in the middle of the coldest season of the year for those of us up north. Still not convinced? How about this: Summer and winter occur simultaneously on the surface of our planet. When it's winter in Connecticut, it's summer in New Zealand. So, if it's not the distance from the sun, what else could it be? Well, we need to also need to know that the Earth doesn't sit straight up. It actually tilts. And that axial tilt of the Earth is one of the main reasons for the seasons. The Earth spins on an axis that's tilted 23.5 degrees from vertical. At the same time, the Earth revolves around the sun with the axis always pointing in the same direction in space. Together with the tilt, the spinning and revolving causes the number of hours of daylight in a region to change as the year goes by, with more hours in summer and fewer in winter. So, when the sun is shining on the Earth, it warms up. After the sun sets, it has time to cool down. So, in the summer, any location that's about 40 degrees north of the equator, like Hartford, Connecticut, will get 15 hours of daylight each day and 9 hours of darkness. It warms up for longer than it cools. This happens day after day, so there is an overall warming effect. Remember this fact for later! In the winter, the opposite happens. There are many more hours of cooling time than warming time, and day after day, this results in a cooling effect. The interesting thing is, as you move north, the number of daylight hours in summer increases. So, Juneau, Alaska would get about 19 hours of daylight on the same summer day that Tallahassee, Florida gets about 14. In fact, in the summertime at the North Pole, the sun never sets. OK, then, it's all about daylight hours, I've got it! Well, no, there's another important piece to this puzzle. If daylight hours were the only thing that determined average temperature, wouldn't the North Pole be the hottest place on Earth in northern summer because it receives 24 hours of daylight in the months surrounding the summer solstice? But it's the North Pole. There's still icebergs in the water and snow on the ground. So, what's going on? The Earth is a sphere and so the amount of solar energy an area receives changes based on how high the sun is in the sky, which, as you know, changes during the day between sunrise and sunset. But, the maximum height also changes during the year, with the greatest solar height during the summer months and highest of all at noon on the summer solstice, which is June 21st in the northern hemisphere and December 21st in the southern hemisphere. This is because as the Earth revolves, the northern hemisphere ends up tilted away from the sun in the winter and toward the sun in summer, which puts the sun more directly overhead for longer amounts of time. Remember those increased summer time daylight hours? And solar energy per square kilometer increases as the sun gets higher in the sky. So, when the sun's at an angle, the amount of energy delivered to each square of the sunlit area is less. Therefore, even though the North Pole is getting 24 hours of daylight to warm up, the sunlight it receives is very spread out and delivers less energy than a place further south, where the sun is higher in the sky because it's more tilted toward the sun. Besides, the North Pole has a lot to make up for. It was cooling down without any sunlight at all for 6 months straight. So, as the seasons change, wherever you are, you can now appreciate not just the beauty of each new season but the astronomical complexity that brings them to you.

January is smack-dab in the middle of the coldest season of the year for those of us up north. Still not convinced? How about this: Summer and winter occur simultaneously on the surface of our planet. When it's winter in Connecticut, it's summer in New Zealand. So, if it's not the distance from the sun, what else could it be? Well, we need to also need to know that the Earth doesn't sit straight up. It actually tilts. And that axial tilt of the Earth is one of the main reasons for the seasons. The Earth spins on an axis that's tilted 23.5 degrees from vertical. At the same time, the Earth revolves around the sun with the axis always pointing in the same direction in space. Together with the tilt, the spinning and revolving causes the number of hours of daylight in a region to change as the year goes by, with more hours in summer and fewer in winter. So, when the sun is shining on the Earth, it warms up. After the sun sets, it has time to cool down. So, in the summer, any location that's about 40 degrees north of the equator, like Hartford, Connecticut, will get 15 hours of daylight each day and 9 hours of darkness. It warms up for longer than it cools. This happens day after day, so there is an overall warming effect. Remember this fact for later! In the winter, the opposite happens. There are many more hours of cooling time than warming time, and day after day, this results in a cooling effect. The interesting thing is, as you move north, the number of daylight hours in summer increases. So, Juneau, Alaska would get about 19 hours of daylight on the same summer day that Tallahassee, Florida gets about 14. In fact, in the summertime at the North Pole, the sun never sets. OK, then, it's all about daylight hours, I've got it! Well, no, there's another important piece to this puzzle. If daylight hours were the only thing that determined average temperature, wouldn't the North Pole be the hottest place on Earth in northern summer because it receives 24 hours of daylight in the months surrounding the summer solstice? But it's the North Pole. There's still icebergs in the water and snow on the ground. So, what's going on? The Earth is a sphere and so the amount of solar energy an area receives changes based on how high the sun is in the sky, which, as you know, changes during the day between sunrise and sunset. But, the maximum height also changes during the year, with the greatest solar height during the summer months and highest of all at noon on the summer solstice, which is June 21st in the northern hemisphere and December 21st in the southern hemisphere. This is because as the Earth revolves, the northern hemisphere ends up tilted away from the sun in the winter and toward the sun in summer, which puts the sun more directly overhead for longer amounts of time. Remember those increased summer time daylight hours? And solar energy per square kilometer increases as the sun gets higher in the sky. So, when the sun's at an angle, the amount of energy delivered to each square of the sunlit area is less. Therefore, even though the North Pole is getting 24 hours of daylight to warm up, the sunlight it receives is very spread out and delivers less energy than a place further south, where the sun is higher in the sky because it's more tilted toward the sun. Besides, the North Pole has a lot to make up for. It was cooling down without any sunlight at all for 6 months straight. So, as the seasons change, wherever you are, you can now appreciate not just the beauty of each new season but the astronomical complexity that brings them to you.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby When I was a kid, my understanding of the seasons was that December and January were cold and covered with snow, April and May were bursting with flowers, July and August were hot and sunshiny, and September and October were a kaleidoscope of colorful leaves. It was just the way the world worked, and it was magical. If you had told me back then that one-third of Earth's population had never seen snow or that July 4th was most definitely not a beach day, I would have thought you were crazy. But in reality, seasonal change with four distinct seasons only happens in two regions on the planet. And, even in those two, the seasons are reversed. But why? A lot of people have heard of an astronomer called Johannes Kepler and how he proved that planetary orbits are elliptical and that the sun is not at the center of the orbit. It was a big deal when he figured this out several hundred years ago. His discovery solved a lot of mathematical problems that astronomers were having with planetary orbit measurements. While it's true that our orbit's not perfectly circular, those pictures in our science books, on TV, and in the movies give an exaggerated impression of how elongated our orbit is. In fact, Earth's orbit is very nearly a perfect circle. However, because Earth's orbit is technically an ellipse, even though it doesn't look like one, and the sun isn't quite exactly at the center, it means that our distance from the sun does change through the year. Ah-ha! So, winter happens when the Earth is further away from the sun! Well, no, not so fast. The Earth is actually closer to the sun in January than we are in July by 5 million kilometers.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby What's an algorithm? In computer science, an algorithm is a set of instructions for solving some problem, step-by-step. Typically, algorithms are executed by computers, but we humans have algorithms as well. For instance, how would you go about counting the number of people in a room? Well, if you're like me, you probably point at each person, one at a time, and count up from 0: 1, 2, 3, 4 and so forth. Well, that's an algorithm. In fact, let's try to express it a bit more formally in pseudocode, English-like syntax that resembles a programming language. Let n equal 0. For each person in room, set n = n + 1. How to interpret this pseudocode? Well, line 1 declares, so to speak, a variable called n and initializes its value to zero. This just means that at the beginning of our algorithm, the thing with which we're counting has a value of zero. After all, before we start counting, we haven't counted anything yet. Calling this variable n is just a convention. I could have called it almost anything. Now, line 2 demarks the start of loop, a sequence of steps that will repeat some number of times. So, in our example, the step we're taking is counting people in the room. Beneath line 2 is line 3, which describes exactly how we'll go about counting. The indentation implies that it's line 3 that will repeat. So, what the pseudocode is saying is that after starting at zero, for each person in the room, we'll increase n by 1. Now, is this algorithm correct? Well, let's bang on it a bit. Does it work if there are 2 people in the room? Let's see. In line 1, we initialize n to zero. For each of these two people, we then increment n by 1. So, in the first trip through the loop, we update n from zero to 1, on the second trip through that same loop, we update n from 1 to 2. And so, by this algorithm's end, n is 2, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. So far, so good. How about a corner case, though? Suppose that there are zero people in the room, besides me, who's doing the counting. In line 1, we again initialize n to zero. This time, though, line 3 doesn't execute at all since there isn't a person in the room, and so, n remains zero, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. Pretty simple, right? But counting people one a time is pretty inefficient, too, no? Surely, we can do better! Why not count two people at a time? Instead of counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and so forth, why not count 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on? It even sounds faster, and it surely is. Let's express this optimization in pseudocode. Let n equal zero. For each pair of people in room, set n = n + 2. Pretty simple change, right? Rather than count people one at a time, we instead count them two at a time. This algorithm's thus twice as fast as the last. But is it correct? Let's see. Does it work if there are 2 people in the room? In line 1, we initialize n to zero. For that one pair of people, we then increment n by 2. And so, by this algorithm's end, n is 2, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. Suppose next that there are zero people in the room. In line 1, we initialize n to zero. As before, line 3 doesn't execute at all since there aren't any pairs of people in the room, and so, n remains zero, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. But what if there are 3 people in the room? How does this algorithm fair? Let's see. In line 1, we initialize n to zero. For a pair of those people, we then increment n by 2, but then what? There isn't another full pair of people in the room, so line 2 no longer applies. And so, by this algorithm's end, n is still 2, which isn't correct. Indeed this algorithm is said to be buggy because it has a mistake. Let's redress with some new pseudocode. Let n equal zero. For each pair of people in room, set n = n + 2. If 1 person remains unpaired, set n = n + 1. To solve this particular problem, we've introduced in line 4 a condition, otherwise known as a branch, that only executes if there is one person we could not pair with another. So now, whether there's 1 or 3 or any odd number of people in the room, this algorithm will now count them. Can we do even better? Well, we could count in 3's or 4's or even 5's and 10's, but beyond that it's going to get a little bit difficult to point. At the end of the day, whether executed by computers or humans, algorithms are just a set of instructions with which to solve problems. These were just three. What problem would you solve with an algorithm?

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby What's an algorithm? In computer science, an algorithm is a set of instructions for solving some problem, step-by-step. Typically, algorithms are executed by computers, but we humans have algorithms as well. For instance, how would you go about counting the number of people in a room? Well, if you're like me, you probably point at each person, one at a time, and count up from 0: 1, 2, 3, 4 and so forth. Well, that's an algorithm. In fact, let's try to express it a bit more formally in pseudocode, English-like syntax that resembles a programming language. Let n equal 0. For each person in room, set n = n + 1. How to interpret this pseudocode? Well, line 1 declares, so to speak, a variable called n and initializes its value to zero. This just means that at the beginning of our algorithm, the thing with which we're counting has a value of zero. After all, before we start counting, we haven't counted anything yet. Calling this variable n is just a convention. I could have called it almost anything. Now, line 2 demarks the start of loop, a sequence of steps that will repeat some number of times. So, in our example, the step we're taking is counting people in the room. Beneath line 2 is line 3, which describes exactly how we'll go about counting. The indentation implies that it's line 3 that will repeat. So, what the pseudocode is saying is that after starting at zero, for each person in the room, we'll increase n by 1. Now, is this algorithm correct? Well, let's bang on it a bit. Does it work if there are 2 people in the room? Let's see. In line 1, we initialize n to zero. For each of these two people, we then increment n by 1. So, in the first trip through the loop, we update n from zero to 1, on the second trip through that same loop, we update n from 1 to 2. And so, by this algorithm's end, n is 2, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. So far, so good. How about a corner case, though? Suppose that there are zero people in the room, besides me, who's doing the counting. In line 1, we again initialize n to zero. This time, though, line 3 doesn't execute at all since there isn't a person in the room, and so, n remains zero, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. Pretty simple, right? But counting people one a time is pretty inefficient, too, no? Surely, we can do better! Why not count two people at a time? Instead of counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and so forth, why not count 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on? It even sounds faster, and it surely is. Let's express this optimization in pseudocode. Let n equal zero. For each pair of people in room, set n = n + 2. Pretty simple change, right? Rather than count people one at a time, we instead count them two at a time. This algorithm's thus twice as fast as the last. But is it correct? Let's see. Does it work if there are 2 people in the room? In line 1, we initialize n to zero. For that one pair of people, we then increment n by 2. And so, by this algorithm's end, n is 2, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. Suppose next that there are zero people in the room. In line 1, we initialize n to zero. As before, line 3 doesn't execute at all since there aren't any pairs of people in the room, and so, n remains zero, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. But what if there are 3 people in the room? How does this algorithm fair? Let's see. In line 1, we initialize n to zero. For a pair of those people, we then increment n by 2, but then what? There isn't another full pair of people in the room, so line 2 no longer applies. And so, by this algorithm's end, n is still 2, which isn't correct. Indeed this algorithm is said to be buggy because it has a mistake. Let's redress with some new pseudocode. Let n equal zero. For each pair of people in room, set n = n + 2. If 1 person remains unpaired, set n = n + 1. To solve this particular problem, we've introduced in line 4 a condition, otherwise known as a branch, that only executes if there is one person we could not pair with another. So now, whether there's 1 or 3 or any odd number of people in the room, this algorithm will now count them. Can we do even better? Well, we could count in 3's or 4's or even 5's and 10's, but beyond that it's going to get a little bit difficult to point. At the end of the day, whether executed by computers or humans, algorithms are just a set of instructions with which to solve problems. These were just three. What problem would you solve with an algorithm?

and I have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life what happens I think and then it was no vote it's my fault I'm not blaming anybody else reading as you've requested the whole pie bit let me just stop right there I want to say right here now I said things that were not proof I try and rob a bank and fail that's no defense I still tried to rubberband I did not hear they called him and tell you during the 18 and a half minute there was no cover-up of any criminal active that is obstruction of justice jester ma here's your conclusion not commitment in my view an impeachable I was concerned about whether or not the other side was bugging us I cut off one arm and cut off the other no I don't interpret that right off all that I said things were not I thought myself why didn't you stop it I gave him a sword and they stuck it in the break in the political scandal began on June 17th 1972 when a security guard at the Watergate complex noticed that a few doors were taped so that they were left unlocked he removed the tape and did not think twice about it but it was only when he returned to find the doors retake 20 got suspicious and called the cops that night five men were arrested on account of attempted burglary and attempted interception of telephone and other communications these men were Virgilio gonzales bernard barker James W McCord jr. Eugene o Martinez and Frank Sturgis the grand jury charged all five men plus E Howard hunt and G gordon Liddy in September for conspiracy burglary and violation of federal wiretapping laws after being tried and convicted in late January it was found that all five men were directly tied to the 1972 community to reelect the president it was suspected that high-ranked government involved as well the investigation the breaking out Watergate was revealed to have been a part of a huge campaign of political spine and sabotage headed by the people running the nixon reelection campaign however on November 7th the president was reelected in the biggest landslide in American history reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of the post uncovered information which linked to breakin and cover up a tons back to the CIA FBI White House and Justice Department they're most knowledgeable anonymous source deep throat who told them of Howard hunts involvement in the break-in and warned them that the FBI was trying to find out who is leaking information of an entire collection of crimes greater than Watergate the child did not end with five burglars but White House staff members were issued subpoenas Senate committee chaired by Senator Ervin was said to examine them April 30th 1973 Nixon was forced to ask for resignation of his two most powerful aides HR Haldeman and John L Richmond and he also fired white house counsel John Dean the tapes Alexandra Butterfield was asked if there was any taping system in the White House and even though reluctant he answered yes there was a recording system which automatically taped what went on in every room including the Oval Office and Nixon's private office the tapes were sub subpoena by a special prosecutor Archibald Cox and later by the Senate Nixon refused to release them but Cox refused to job his subpoena a conversation vital in the case against Nixon took place March 21st 1973 between Nixon and John Dee and where they talked about the Watergate case and the cover-up he spoke about the hush money that the team was being paid for their silence Dean states that hunt is black man in the White House for the money and Nixon says that the blackmail money should during the congregational debate on impeachment those who believed impeachment required a criminal indictable offense focus their attention on ik's ins agreement to blackmail payments making him a part of the cover-up of a conspiracy the audio tapes caused an increasing amount of controversy and when it was found that 18 minutes had been erased from one tape people were suspicious Nixon's personal secretary had said that she erased it by accident but it was found later that many segments from the tapes were found missing issue of the audio tapes went to the Supreme Court on July 24th 1974 in the United States versus Nixon was forced to hand over subpoena tapes to the special prosecutor resignation Halderman L Richmond Mitchell Charles Colson Gordon C Strachan Robert ardian and Kenneth Parkinson's known as the Watergate 7 were inducted for conspiring to hinder the investigation John Dean and Jed Stuart Magruder had already pleaded guilty like others secretary Dwight Chapman was convicted and so was a dry night Republican Lieutenant Governor of California the smoking gun tape was the unknown audio tape that was found release recorded days after the break-in it was a conversation between Nixon and Halderman Haldeman discussed the cover-up plan Nixon approved it and has given a lot of information about the break-ins involvement with his campaign after the release of the tapes Nixon's own lawyers were able to say that Nixon had the line to the nation for two years still Nixon denied any involvement in the situation but after being told that enough votes existed to remove iron pages Nixon decided to resign impact prior to the Watergate scandal everyone in America believed that politicians truly have with the people's best interest in mind there were never any questions as to why politicians do what they do or how they do it basically everyone trusted the government after Watergate Americans began to realize that politicians could be corrupt this realization leads to higher demand from the public to know more of what politicians are doing behind closed doors politically the Watergate scandal showed the darker side of the government and gave the Democrats a chance to rise up the image of the legal system was also severely by Watergate to try and fix this the American Bar Association launched two major reforms also they led a campaign finance reform for legislation culturally Watergate appeared in every aspect of entertainment during that time many journalists started being more aggressive about reporting on politics and also harsher and more cynical media had the power to bring down a government as proved by Woodward and Bernstein additionally it gave new meaning to the First Amendment protection of the freedom of the press nothing is off-limits to the journalists there used to be boundaries that journalists felt had to be kept between the government and the media but after the Watergate scandal these boundaries faded ideals as a part of the Watergate scandal Nixon violated the American ideal Justice Nixon lied to the American people and broke a number of laws he promised to follow as an American citizen and the president of the United States he was an unjust leader as he allowed people who work directly under him to violate laws as well Nixon lost the trust of the people he swore to protect and the discussions I have with congressional and other leaders I have concluded but because of the lot of gate matter I might not have the support of the Congress that I will consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office and the way the interests of the nation will require I have never been a quitter to leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body as president I must book the interests of America first America needs a full-time president and a full-time Congress particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad to continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication but I almost totally absorbed the time and attention of both the president and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home therefore I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby So two guys walk into a bar. Really? No, seriously. Two guys walk into a bar, an ice cream bar: Dave, a physicist working on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, and Steve, a blues singer. "Dave, how's it going?" "Steve, good to see you!" "Two scoops of chocolate almond for me." "Vanilla shake." "Hey, I just saw something about the LHC on TV. You guys found bozo in your detector?" "Well, not exactly. We found a boson, probably the Higgs boson." "What's that?" "It's a particle." "Don't you find particles all the time?" "Yes, but this one means that the Higgs field might really exist." "Field? What field?" "The Higgs field. It's named after Peter Higgs, although many others contributed to the idea. It isn't a field, like where you grow corn, but a hypothetical, invisible kind of force field that pervades the whole universe." "Hmmmm, okay. If it pervades the whole universe, how come I've never seen it? That's a bit strange." "Well, actually, it's not that strange. Think of the air around us. We can't see it or smell it. Well, perhaps in some places we can. But we can detect its presence with sophisticated equipment, like our own bodies. So the fact that we can't see something just makes it a bit harder to determine whether its really there or not." "Alright, go on." "So, we believe this Higgs field is all around us, everywhere in the universe. And what it does is rather special - it gives mass to elementary particles." "What's an elementary particle?" "An elementary particle is what we call particles that have no structure, they can't be divided, they're the basic building blocks of the universe." "I thought those were atoms." "Well, atoms are actually made of smaller components, protons, neutrons, and electrons. While electrons are fundamental particles, neutrons and protons are not. They are made up of other fundamental particles called quarks." "Sounds like Russian dolls. Does it ever end?" "Actually, we don't really know. But our current understanding is called the Standard Model. In it, there are two types of fundamental particles: the fermions, that make up matter, and the bosons, that carry forces. We often order these particles according to their properties, such as mass. We can measure the masses of the particles, but we never really knew where this mass came from or why they have the masses they do." "So how does this Higgs field thing explain mass?" "Well, when a particle passes through the Higgs field, it interacts and gets mass. The more it interacts, the more mass it has." "OK, I kind of get that, but is it really that important? I mean, what if there were no Higgs field?" "If there were no Higgs field, the world wouldn't exist at all. There would be no stars, no planets, no air, no anything, not even that spoon or the ice cream you're eating." "Oh, that would be bad. Okay, but where does this Higgs boson fit into things?" "Alright, now, you see the cherry in my shake?" "Can I have it?" "No, not yet. We have to use it as an analogy first." "Oh, right, the cherry's the Higgs boson." "No, not quite. The cherry is a particle moving through the Higgs field, the shake. The shake gives the cherry its mass." "I get it. Okay, so the molecules of the shake are the Higgs bosons!" "Well, you're getting closer. It takes an excitation of the Higgs field to produce the Higgs boson. So, for example, if I were to add energy by, say, dropping this cherry in the shake," "Ah, then the drops that spill on the bar are the Higgs bosons." "Almost! The splash itself is the Higgs boson." "Are you serious?" "Well, that's what quantum mechanics teaches us. In fact, all particles are excitations of fields." "Okay, right. Well, I kind of see why you like particle physics, it's quite cool, strange, but cool." "Yeah, you could call it a bit strange, it's not like everyday life. The Higgs boson is an excitation of the Higgs field. By finding the Higgs boson, we know that the Higgs field exists." "Right. So now you found it, we know this Higgs field exists. You must be done. Is there anything left of particle physics?" "Actually, we've just begun. It's a bit like, you know, when Columbus thought he had found a new route to India. He'd, indeed, found something new, but not quite what he was expecting. So, first, we need to make sure that the boson we found is actually the Higgs boson. It seems to fit, but we need to measure its properties to be sure." "How'd you do that?" "Take a lot more data. This new boson lives for only a very short time before it breaks down or decays into lighter, more stable particles. By measuring these particles, you learn about the properties of the boson." "And what exactly are you looking for?" "Well, the Standard Model predicts how often and in what ways the Higgs boson would decay to the various, lighter particles. So we want to see if the particle we have found is the one predicted by the Standard Model or if it fits into other possible theoretical models." "And if it fits a different model?" "That would be even more exciting! In fact, that's how science advances. We replace old models with new ones if they better explain our observations." "Right, so it seems like finding this Higgs boson gives a direction for exploration, a bit like that Columbus guy heading west." "Exactly! And this is really just the beginning."

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby So two guys walk into a bar. Really? No, seriously. Two guys walk into a bar, an ice cream bar: Dave, a physicist working on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, and Steve, a blues singer. "Dave, how's it going?" "Steve, good to see you!" "Two scoops of chocolate almond for me." "Vanilla shake." "Hey, I just saw something about the LHC on TV. You guys found bozo in your detector?" "Well, not exactly. We found a boson, probably the Higgs boson." "What's that?" "It's a particle." "Don't you find particles all the time?" "Yes, but this one means that the Higgs field might really exist." "Field? What field?" "The Higgs field. It's named after Peter Higgs, although many others contributed to the idea. It isn't a field, like where you grow corn, but a hypothetical, invisible kind of force field that pervades the whole universe." "Hmmmm, okay. If it pervades the whole universe, how come I've never seen it? That's a bit strange." "Well, actually, it's not that strange. Think of the air around us. We can't see it or smell it. Well, perhaps in some places we can. But we can detect its presence with sophisticated equipment, like our own bodies. So the fact that we can't see something just makes it a bit harder to determine whether its really there or not." "Alright, go on." "So, we believe this Higgs field is all around us, everywhere in the universe. And what it does is rather special - it gives mass to elementary particles." "What's an elementary particle?" "An elementary particle is what we call particles that have no structure, they can't be divided, they're the basic building blocks of the universe." "I thought those were atoms." "Well, atoms are actually made of smaller components, protons, neutrons, and electrons. While electrons are fundamental particles, neutrons and protons are not. They are made up of other fundamental particles called quarks." "Sounds like Russian dolls. Does it ever end?" "Actually, we don't really know. But our current understanding is called the Standard Model. In it, there are two types of fundamental particles: the fermions, that make up matter, and the bosons, that carry forces. We often order these particles according to their properties, such as mass. We can measure the masses of the particles, but we never really knew where this mass came from or why they have the masses they do." "So how does this Higgs field thing explain mass?" "Well, when a particle passes through the Higgs field, it interacts and gets mass. The more it interacts, the more mass it has." "OK, I kind of get that, but is it really that important? I mean, what if there were no Higgs field?" "If there were no Higgs field, the world wouldn't exist at all. There would be no stars, no planets, no air, no anything, not even that spoon or the ice cream you're eating." "Oh, that would be bad. Okay, but where does this Higgs boson fit into things?" "Alright, now, you see the cherry in my shake?" "Can I have it?" "No, not yet. We have to use it as an analogy first." "Oh, right, the cherry's the Higgs boson." "No, not quite. The cherry is a particle moving through the Higgs field, the shake. The shake gives the cherry its mass." "I get it. Okay, so the molecules of the shake are the Higgs bosons!" "Well, you're getting closer. It takes an excitation of the Higgs field to produce the Higgs boson. So, for example, if I were to add energy by, say, dropping this cherry in the shake," "Ah, then the drops that spill on the bar are the Higgs bosons." "Almost! The splash itself is the Higgs boson." "Are you serious?" "Well, that's what quantum mechanics teaches us. In fact, all particles are excitations of fields." "Okay, right. Well, I kind of see why you like particle physics, it's quite cool, strange, but cool." "Yeah, you could call it a bit strange, it's not like everyday life. The Higgs boson is an excitation of the Higgs field. By finding the Higgs boson, we know that the Higgs field exists." "Right. So now you found it, we know this Higgs field exists. You must be done.

So the fact that we can't see something just makes it a bit harder to determine whether its really there or not." "Alright, go on." "So, we believe this Higgs field is all around us, everywhere in the universe. And what it does is rather special - it gives mass to elementary particles." "What's an elementary particle?" "An elementary particle is what we call particles that have no structure, they can't be divided, they're the basic building blocks of the universe." "I thought those were atoms." "Well, atoms are actually made of smaller components, protons, neutrons, and electrons. While electrons are fundamental particles, neutrons and protons are not. They are made up of other fundamental particles called quarks." "Sounds like Russian dolls. Does it ever end?" "Actually, we don't really know. But our current understanding is called the Standard Model. In it, there are two types of fundamental particles: the fermions, that make up matter, and the bosons, that carry forces. We often order these particles according to their properties, such as mass. We can measure the masses of the particles, but we never really knew where this mass came from or why they have the masses they do." "So how does this Higgs field thing explain mass?" "Well, when a particle passes through the Higgs field, it interacts and gets mass. The more it interacts, the more mass it has." "OK, I kind of get that, but is it really that important? I mean, what if there were no Higgs field?" "If there were no Higgs field, the world wouldn't exist at all. There would be no stars, no planets, no air, no anything, not even that spoon or the ice cream you're eating." "Oh, that would be bad. Okay, but where does this Higgs boson fit into things?" "Alright, now, you see the cherry in my shake?" "Can I have it?" "No, not yet. We have to use it as an analogy first." "Oh, right, the cherry's the Higgs boson." "No, not quite. The cherry is a particle moving through the Higgs field, the shake. The shake gives the cherry its mass." "I get it. Okay, so the molecules of the shake are the Higgs bosons!" "Well, you're getting closer. It takes an excitation of the Higgs field to produce the Higgs boson. So, for example, if I were to add energy by, say, dropping this cherry in the shake," "Ah, then the drops that spill on the bar are the Higgs bosons." "Almost! The splash itself is the Higgs boson." "Are you serious?" "Well, that's what quantum mechanics teaches us. In fact, all particles are excitations of fields." "Okay, right. Well, I kind of see why you like particle physics, it's quite cool, strange, but cool." "Yeah, you could call it a bit strange, it's not like everyday life. The Higgs boson is an excitation of the Higgs field. By finding the Higgs boson, we know that the Higgs field exists." "Right. So now you found it, we know this Higgs field exists. You must be done. Is there anything left of particle physics?" "Actually, we've just begun. It's a bit like, you know, when Columbus thought he had found a new route to India. He'd, indeed, found something new, but not quite what he was expecting. So, first, we need to make sure that the boson we found is actually the Higgs boson. It seems to fit, but we need to measure its properties to be sure." "How'd you do that?" "Take a lot more data. This new boson lives for only a very short time before it breaks down or decays into lighter, more stable particles. By measuring these particles, you learn about the properties of the boson." "And what exactly are you looking for?" "Well, the Standard Model predicts how often and in what ways the Higgs boson would decay to the various, lighter particles. So we want to see if the particle we have found is the one predicted by the Standard Model or if it fits into other possible theoretical models." "And if it fits a different model?" "That would be even more exciting! In fact, that's how science advances. We replace old models with new ones if they better explain our observations." "Right, so it seems like finding this Higgs boson gives a direction for exploration, a bit like that Columbus guy heading west." "Exactly! And this is really just the beginning."

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby So two guys walk into a bar. Really? No, seriously. Two guys walk into a bar, an ice cream bar: Dave, a physicist working on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, and Steve, a blues singer. "Dave, how's it going?" "Steve, good to see you!" "Two scoops of chocolate almond for me." "Vanilla shake." "Hey, I just saw something about the LHC on TV. You guys found bozo in your detector?" "Well, not exactly. We found a boson, probably the Higgs boson." "What's that?" "It's a particle." "Don't you find particles all the time?" "Yes, but this one means that the Higgs field might really exist." "Field? What field?" "The Higgs field. It's named after Peter Higgs, although many others contributed to the idea. It isn't a field, like where you grow corn, but a hypothetical, invisible kind of force field that pervades the whole universe." "Hmmmm, okay. If it pervades the whole universe, how come I've never seen it? That's a bit strange." "Well, actually, it's not that strange. Think of the air around us. We can't see it or smell it. Well, perhaps in some places we can. But we can detect its presence with sophisticated equipment, like our own bodies. So the fact that we can't see something just makes it a bit harder to determine whether its really there or not." "Alright, go on."

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar "I need a hero!" So many people in distress have said this, but why? What kind of hero do we need and do we even really even need a hero at all? Well, if you look at any piece of literature written for page, script, or stage, the answer is yes! But, heroes come in all shapes and sizes, depending on what needs to be dealt with. First, you have your epic heroes. Epic heroes usually come from a famous family, have super-human strength, are unusually good-looking. They take on challenges that no one else will and succeed. They have great journeys and adventures, some supernatural and some, right here on Earth. Beowulf does all of this. He travels across the sea with his band of warriors to help another king defeat a supernatural monster that has been terrorizing his kingdom. He defeats the monster and the monster's mother in an epic battle, and then goes back home and becomes king himself. In his old age, he has one more monster to face, one more threat that he must keep from his people, a dragon. Now, being an epic hero, of course he wins, but he is also human, and so he also dies. But he leaves behind stories to inspire others even today. Next, we have our tragic heroes. Tragic heroes are usually leaders or powerful characters, but the tragic hero is also majorly flawed and that flaw usually leads him down the path to a horrible and tragic death. Take the story of Oedipus the King, for example. One day, a young man travels to a town called Thebes. On the way, he kills a man for not yielding to him on the road in the first documented case of road rage. He also defeats a magical creature and is rewarded by becoming the King of Thebes, and thus, marrying their queen. Well, that's not so tragic, right? Wrong! The queen he just married is actually his birth mother! Oedipus was supposed to have been killed as a child by a servant, but instead he was given to another family. Oh, and the man he killed on the road, the previous King of Thebes and his dad. So he killed his father and married his mother. Now that is quite tragic. Not tragic enough for you? Try this one. Romeo Montague is a guy born into a wealthy family and finds the love of his life at a party, Juliet. But, Juliet is from a different family that just so happens to hate his family. Instead of being patient and working through the family feud, Romeo decides he must have his love now, and his impatience leads to bloodshed and death, including his own and Juliet's. Moving on to romantic heroes. Now these guys might sound like they might have a better love life and chance at happiness, but that's not always the case. These heroes are emotional and very human. But there is something magical about them. Some have a miraculous birth and then are separated from their family. Others use enchanted swords or get help from magical beans. They could also reject the expectations of society and adhere to their own code of morality. And in the end, the hero triumphs over evil in an idyllic way, but at great personal, emotional sacrifice. King Arthur is a good example of a romantic hero. Sure, he became king and married the love of his life, but he was also killed by his son, who was born out of wedlock, and had his wife cheat on him with his best friend. So, although he, too, like Beowulf, was a great king, he suffered much more for the greater purpose of society, which makes him more human and relatable to us all. There are different heroes for different situations. Sometimes we need the strong warrior to slay the evils of the world. At other times, we need a common person who becomes great so that they can inspire us all to be better. So do we need heroes? Absolutely! No matter what the time or place, we still need something to believe in. They remind us of the good in each of us, and the need for hope and the importance of knowledge.

Oh, and the man he killed on the road, the previous King of Thebes and his dad. So he killed his father and married his mother. Now that is quite tragic. Not tragic enough for you? Try this one. Romeo Montague is a guy born into a wealthy family and finds the love of his life at a party, Juliet. But, Juliet is from a different family that just so happens to hate his family. Instead of being patient and working through the family feud, Romeo decides he must have his love now, and his impatience leads to bloodshed and death, including his own and Juliet's. Moving on to romantic heroes. Now these guys might sound like they might have a better love life and chance at happiness, but that's not always the case. These heroes are emotional and very human. But there is something magical about them. Some have a miraculous birth and then are separated from their family. Others use enchanted swords or get help from magical beans. They could also reject the expectations of society and adhere to their own code of morality. And in the end, the hero triumphs over evil in an idyllic way, but at great personal, emotional sacrifice. King Arthur is a good example of a romantic hero. Sure, he became king and married the love of his life, but he was also killed by his son, who was born out of wedlock, and had his wife cheat on him with his best friend. So, although he, too, like Beowulf, was a great king, he suffered much more for the greater purpose of society, which makes him more human and relatable to us all. There are different heroes for different situations. Sometimes we need the strong warrior to slay the evils of the world. At other times, we need a common person who becomes great so that they can inspire us all to be better. So do we need heroes? Absolutely! No matter what the time or place, we still need something to believe in. They remind us of the good in each of us, and the need for hope and the importance of knowledge.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar "I need a hero!" So many people in distress have said this, but why? What kind of hero do we need and do we even really even need a hero at all? Well, if you look at any piece of literature written for page, script, or stage, the answer is yes! But, heroes come in all shapes and sizes, depending on what needs to be dealt with. First, you have your epic heroes. Epic heroes usually come from a famous family, have super-human strength, are unusually good-looking. They take on challenges that no one else will and succeed. They have great journeys and adventures, some supernatural and some, right here on Earth. Beowulf does all of this. He travels across the sea with his band of warriors to help another king defeat a supernatural monster that has been terrorizing his kingdom. He defeats the monster and the monster's mother in an epic battle, and then goes back home and becomes king himself. In his old age, he has one more monster to face, one more threat that he must keep from his people, a dragon. Now, being an epic hero, of course he wins, but he is also human, and so he also dies. But he leaves behind stories to inspire others even today. Next, we have our tragic heroes. Tragic heroes are usually leaders or powerful characters, but the tragic hero is also majorly flawed and that flaw usually leads him down the path to a horrible and tragic death. Take the story of Oedipus the King, for example. One day, a young man travels to a town called Thebes. On the way, he kills a man for not yielding to him on the road in the first documented case of road rage. He also defeats a magical creature and is rewarded by becoming the King of Thebes, and thus, marrying their queen. Well, that's not so tragic, right? Wrong! The queen he just married is actually his birth mother! Oedipus was supposed to have been killed as a child by a servant, but instead he was given to another family. Oh, and the man he killed on the road, the previous King of Thebes and his dad. So he killed his father and married his mother. Now that is quite tragic. Not tragic enough for you? Try this one.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I like to think of life science as one big pyramid. Let's call the pyramid, "biological organization". Let's work our way from very small and specific concepts to very large and complex topics. So let's start at the tip of the pyramid, with something so small, it can't be seen by the human eye, a single cell. A cell by itself is the most basic component of life. A single cell, which is capable of living on its own, is called a unicellular organism, organisms like bacteria or protists. These organisms are everywhere you look, you just can't see them. But, when cells join together, with more than one cell like itself to perform a similar function, it's no longer a unicellular organism. It's then called a tissue. No, not that kind of tissue. There are four types of tissues found in the human body: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial. Bone tissue is a type of connective tissue and it's not flimsy like a Kleenex at all. Blood is also an example of the same cells working together to perform the same job, but it's a liquid, again, not like a Kleenex at all. No matter what the consistency is, a tissue is a group of the same cells, working together to perform a similar function. Any time there are different tissues working together, we then call it an organ. That's the next level of the pyramid. Animals aren't the only ones with organs; plants have organs too. When we find multiple different organs working together to perform the same job, we then call it an organ system. Take the digestive system, for example. It's made up of a mouth, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, gall bladder, small intestine, and large intestine, also known as your colon. Although each individual organ in this organ system does a very different job, together, these organs work to achieve the one goal of taking all the nutrients out of the food we eat and getting rid of what we don't need. An organ system, by definition, can only do one job, like get the nutrients from our food, send and receive electrical signals, or exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide. Regardless of their individual function, all organ systems rely on one another to do the vital jobs which they can't do themselves. If one organ system doesn't work, the others will shut down, too. An organism is a complicated, living thing, which requires the proper functioning of multiple organ systems to maintain stability. This stability is called homeostasis. When all organ systems are working together and maintaining homeostasis, then it results in a happy, living organism. Organisms are incredibly diverse and can be as simple as a bacteria or as complex as you. When a group of the same organisms, also known as a species, live together in the same environment, we then call it a population. Often there are several populations all living in one environment. That is what we call a community. Each time you look out the window, you're seeing a community. When we look at multiple communities, along with how all of the organisms interact with the physical environment, then we refer to it as an ecosystem. When you look at all the ecosystems of Earth together, you're looking at the Earth. The Earth is a big, round circle of life. That's why we call it a biosphere - bio, meaning life and sphere, meaning circle. And there you go! When you break it down to each level, a very complex concept and phrase becomes easy to understand. All life starts with a single cell. When cells join together, they are called a tissue. A group of different tissues are called an organ, and a group of different organs are an organ system. A group of organ systems working together make up an organism, and a group of the same organisms are a population. Combining several different populations together give us a community. And several different communities in a large area is an ecosystem. And every ecosystem together makes up our biosphere. And that, my friends, is biological organization, the pyramid of life.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Biological organization is a way to organize:
Options: A. everything in science from biggest to smallest, B. concepts in life science from simplest to most complex, C. several scientific concepts in a way that looks pretty, D. life science concepts from newest to oldest

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I like to think of life science as one big pyramid. Let's call the pyramid, "biological organization". Let's work our way from very small and specific concepts to very large and complex topics. So let's start at the tip of the pyramid, with something so small, it can't be seen by the human eye, a single cell. A cell by itself is the most basic component of life. A single cell, which is capable of living on its own, is called a unicellular organism, organisms like bacteria or protists. These organisms are everywhere you look, you just can't see them. But, when cells join together, with more than one cell like itself to perform a similar function, it's no longer a unicellular organism. It's then called a tissue. No, not that kind of tissue. There are four types of tissues found in the human body: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial. Bone tissue is a type of connective tissue and it's not flimsy like a Kleenex at all. Blood is also an example of the same cells working together to perform the same job, but it's a liquid, again, not like a Kleenex at all. No matter what the consistency is, a tissue is a group of the same cells, working together to perform a similar function. Any time there are different tissues working together, we then call it an organ. That's the next level of the pyramid. Animals aren't the only ones with organs; plants have organs too. When we find multiple different organs working together to perform the same job, we then call it an organ system. Take the digestive system, for example. It's made up of a mouth, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, gall bladder, small intestine, and large intestine, also known as your colon. Although each individual organ in this organ system does a very different job, together, these organs work to achieve the one goal of taking all the nutrients out of the food we eat and getting rid of what we don't need. An organ system, by definition, can only do one job, like get the nutrients from our food, send and receive electrical signals, or exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide. Regardless of their individual function, all organ systems rely on one another to do the vital jobs which they can't do themselves. If one organ system doesn't work, the others will shut down, too. An organism is a complicated, living thing, which requires the proper functioning of multiple organ systems to maintain stability. This stability is called homeostasis. When all organ systems are working together and maintaining homeostasis, then it results in a happy, living organism. Organisms are incredibly diverse and can be as simple as a bacteria or as complex as you. When a group of the same organisms, also known as a species, live together in the same environment, we then call it a population. Often there are several populations all living in one environment. That is what we call a community. Each time you look out the window, you're seeing a community. When we look at multiple communities, along with how all of the organisms interact with the physical environment, then we refer to it as an ecosystem. When you look at all the ecosystems of Earth together, you're looking at the Earth. The Earth is a big, round circle of life. That's why we call it a biosphere - bio, meaning life and sphere, meaning circle. And there you go! When you break it down to each level, a very complex concept and phrase becomes easy to understand. All life starts with a single cell. When cells join together, they are called a tissue. A group of different tissues are called an organ, and a group of different organs are an organ system. A group of organ systems working together make up an organism, and a group of the same organisms are a population. Combining several different populations together give us a community. And several different communities in a large area is an ecosystem. And every ecosystem together makes up our biosphere. And that, my friends, is biological organization, the pyramid of life.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered who has the authority to make laws or punish people who break them? When we think of power in the United States, we usually think of the President, but he does not act alone. In fact, he is only one piece of the power puzzle and for very good reason. When the American Revolution ended in 1783, the United States government was in a state of change. The founding fathers knew that they did not want to establish another country that was ruled by a king, so the discussions were centered on having a strong and fair national government that protected individual freedoms and did not abuse its power. When the new constitution was adopted in 1787, the structure of the infant government of the United States called for three separate branches, each with their own powers, and a system of checks and balances. This would ensure that no one branch would ever become too powerful because the other branches would always be able to check the power of the other two. These branches work together to run the country and set guidelines for us all to live by. The legislative branch is described in Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution. Many people feel that the founding fathers put this branch in the document first because they thought it was the most important. The legislative branch is comprised of 100 U.S. Senators and 435 members in the U.S. House of Representatives. This is better known as the U.S. Congress. Making laws is the primary function of the legislative branch, but it is also responsible for approving federal judges and justices, passing the national budget, and declaring war. Each state gets two Senators and some number of Representatives, depending on how many people live in that state. The executive branch is described in Article 2 of the Constitution. The leaders of this branch of government are the President and Vice President, who are responsible for enforcing the laws that Congress sets forth. The President works closely with a group of advisors, known as the Cabinet. These appointed helpers assist the President in making important decisions within their area of expertise, such as defense, the treasury, and homeland security. The executive branch also appoints government officials, commands the armed forces, and meets with leaders of other nations. All that combined is a lot of work for a lot of people. In fact, the executive branch employs over 4 million people to get everything done. The third brand of the U.S. government is the judicial branch and is detailed in Article 3. This branch is comprised of all the courts in the land, from the federal district courts to the U.S. Supreme Court. These courts interpret our nation's laws and punish those who break them. The highest court, the Supreme Court, settles disputes among states, hears appeals from state and federal courts, and determines if federal laws are constitutional. There are nine justices on the Supreme Court, and, unlike any other job in our government, Supreme Court justices are appointed for life, or for as long as they want to stay. Our democracy depends on an informed citizenry, so it is our duty to know how it works and what authority each branch of government has over its citizens. Besides voting, chances are that some time in your life you'll be called upon to participate in your government, whether it is to serve on a jury, testify in court, or petition your Congress person to pass or defeat an idea for a law. By knowning the branches, who runs them, and how they work together, you can be involved, informed, and intelligent.

Besides voting, chances are that some time in your life you'll be called upon to participate in your government, whether it is to serve on a jury, testify in court, or petition your Congress person to pass or defeat an idea for a law. By knowning the branches, who runs them, and how they work together, you can be involved, informed, and intelligent.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered who has the authority to make laws or punish people who break them? When we think of power in the United States, we usually think of the President, but he does not act alone. In fact, he is only one piece of the power puzzle and for very good reason. When the American Revolution ended in 1783, the United States government was in a state of change. The founding fathers knew that they did not want to establish another country that was ruled by a king, so the discussions were centered on having a strong and fair national government that protected individual freedoms and did not abuse its power. When the new constitution was adopted in 1787, the structure of the infant government of the United States called for three separate branches, each with their own powers, and a system of checks and balances. This would ensure that no one branch would ever become too powerful because the other branches would always be able to check the power of the other two. These branches work together to run the country and set guidelines for us all to live by. The legislative branch is described in Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution. Many people feel that the founding fathers put this branch in the document first because they thought it was the most important. The legislative branch is comprised of 100 U.S. Senators and 435 members in the U.S. House of Representatives. This is better known as the U.S. Congress. Making laws is the primary function of the legislative branch, but it is also responsible for approving federal judges and justices, passing the national budget, and declaring war. Each state gets two Senators and some number of Representatives, depending on how many people live in that state. The executive branch is described in Article 2 of the Constitution. The leaders of this branch of government are the President and Vice President, who are responsible for enforcing the laws that Congress sets forth. The President works closely with a group of advisors, known as the Cabinet. These appointed helpers assist the President in making important decisions within their area of expertise, such as defense, the treasury, and homeland security. The executive branch also appoints government officials, commands the armed forces, and meets with leaders of other nations. All that combined is a lot of work for a lot of people. In fact, the executive branch employs over 4 million people to get everything done. The third brand of the U.S. government is the judicial branch and is detailed in Article 3. This branch is comprised of all the courts in the land, from the federal district courts to the U.S. Supreme Court. These courts interpret our nation's laws and punish those who break them. The highest court, the Supreme Court, settles disputes among states, hears appeals from state and federal courts, and determines if federal laws are constitutional. There are nine justices on the Supreme Court, and, unlike any other job in our government, Supreme Court justices are appointed for life, or for as long as they want to stay. Our democracy depends on an informed citizenry, so it is our duty to know how it works and what authority each branch of government has over its citizens. Besides voting, chances are that some time in your life you'll be called upon to participate in your government, whether it is to serve on a jury, testify in court, or petition your Congress person to pass or defeat an idea for a law. By knowning the branches, who runs them, and how they work together, you can be involved, informed, and intelligent.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar It's that time again. You need another internship to bolster your college applications. Last year you worked at a local art museum, helping organize their collection and giving tours to visitors. This year, it's going to be much more difficult. You want to work on an organic farm across the country in California. That's your real passion. Unfortunately, your friends' list of contacts doesn't include organic farmers. The same for your parents' group of friends. They want to help you, but they simply don't know of any internships in agriculture. The school counselor, she just laughed. To make your farming dreams come true, you're going to have to press beyond your strong ties, people like your family and closest friends, and try tapping into your weaker ties. Weak ties are a broader network, your friends of friends of friends. They're important because they have access to resources that your strong ties don't have. This works in both directions, by the way - you have access to resources that they don't have. Let's say most people speak to three close friends on a regular basis. Each time you reach beyond the next degree of contacts, you have access to three more people, like a tree that branches out three times per node, so you can look beyond your closest circles. During the last family get-together, didn't you hear that your aunt's friend studied lighting with a nature photographer on the West Coast? In fact, you recall this because you saw a recent image by said photographer on the front cover of The New York Times. So, you email him and learn that the photographer's wife's cousin publishes a sustainability magazine, which employs a staff writer who pitches on a local baseball team with an umpire who, wait for it, is an organic farmer. Bingo! Get ready to trade in those cuff links for some apple seeds, all because you reached out to your weak ties. That's your key, remember? Every conversation is an opportunity. Moreover, don't wait for opportunity, make it happen. Take Kathryn Minshew for example. She went from not knowing anyone at Yahoo to three warm introductions to major executives in 30 days. Here are her suggestions for three steps to networking. 1 - Always say yes to invitations, even if it's not clear what you'll get out of the meeting. Many of Kathryn's most productive relationships resulted from a meeting or call without a clear agenda. 2 - When you want something, broadcast it to everyone you meet. That doesn't mean you beg everyone for help as soon as you meet them, but talk about what you're trying to do. Be excited, ask for feedback, and try to get them excited too. 3 - Show up and often. Be at the forefront of other's minds when opportunities arise. You don't want to be that person who only shows up when he needs something. Be the one that people think of and want to reach out to when a new opportunity presents itself. So while networking may not be the most intuitive, or even for some of you introverts, the most comfortable skill, it's a helpful tool to have as you think about getting a job, going to school, or most importantly, learning from others. Good luck!

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar It's that time again. You need another internship to bolster your college applications. Last year you worked at a local art museum, helping organize their collection and giving tours to visitors. This year, it's going to be much more difficult. You want to work on an organic farm across the country in California. That's your real passion. Unfortunately, your friends' list of contacts doesn't include organic farmers. The same for your parents' group of friends. They want to help you, but they simply don't know of any internships in agriculture. The school counselor, she just laughed. To make your farming dreams come true, you're going to have to press beyond your strong ties, people like your family and closest friends, and try tapping into your weaker ties. Weak ties are a broader network, your friends of friends of friends. They're important because they have access to resources that your strong ties don't have. This works in both directions, by the way - you have access to resources that they don't have. Let's say most people speak to three close friends on a regular basis. Each time you reach beyond the next degree of contacts, you have access to three more people, like a tree that branches out three times per node, so you can look beyond your closest circles. During the last family get-together, didn't you hear that your aunt's friend studied lighting with a nature photographer on the West Coast? In fact, you recall this because you saw a recent image by said photographer on the front cover of The New York Times. So, you email him and learn that the photographer's wife's cousin publishes a sustainability magazine, which employs a staff writer who pitches on a local baseball team with an umpire who, wait for it, is an organic farmer. Bingo! Get ready to trade in those cuff links for some apple seeds, all because you reached out to your weak ties. That's your key, remember? Every conversation is an opportunity. Moreover, don't wait for opportunity, make it happen. Take Kathryn Minshew for example. She went from not knowing anyone at Yahoo to three warm introductions to major executives in 30 days. Here are her suggestions for three steps to networking. 1 - Always say yes to invitations, even if it's not clear what you'll get out of the meeting. Many of Kathryn's most productive relationships resulted from a meeting or call without a clear agenda. 2 - When you want something, broadcast it to everyone you meet. That doesn't mean you beg everyone for help as soon as you meet them, but talk about what you're trying to do. Be excited, ask for feedback, and try to get them excited too. 3 - Show up and often. Be at the forefront of other's minds when opportunities arise. You don't want to be that person who only shows up when he needs something. Be the one that people think of and want to reach out to when a new opportunity presents itself. So while networking may not be the most intuitive, or even for some of you introverts, the most comfortable skill, it's a helpful tool to have as you think about getting a job, going to school, or most importantly, learning from others. Good luck!

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so people want a lot of things out of life but I think more than anything else they want happiness Aristotle called happiness the chief good the end towards which all other things aim according to this view the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable it's that we expect them to bring us happiness now in the last 50 years we Americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want we're richer we live longer we have access to technology that would have seems like science fiction just a few years ago the paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically we haven't actually gotten any happier maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness there's been an increased interest in recent years and happiness itself people have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time in fact for thousands of years but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved why is with many other domains in life I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question in fact in the last few years there's been an explosion in research on happiness for example we've learned a lot about its demographics how things like income and education gender and marriage relate to it but one of the puzzles this is revealed is that factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect yes it's better to make more money rather than less or to graduate from college instead of dropping out but the differences in happiness tend to be small which leaves the question what are the big causes of happiness I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet but I think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences it certainly seems that we're going about our lives that what we're doing who were with what we're thinking about have a big influence on our happiness and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult in fact almost impossible for scientists to study a few years ago I came up with a way to study people's happiness moment-to-moment is they're going about their daily lives on the massive scale all over the world something we've never been able to do before called track your happiness org it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real-time how does this work basically I send people signals at random points throughout the day and then I ask them a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience at the instant just before the signal the idea is that if we can watch how people's happiness goes up and down over the course of the day minute to minute in some cases and try to understand how what people are doing who they're with what they're thinking about and all the other factors that describe our day how those might relate to those changes in happiness we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness we've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data a lot more data of this kind than I think has ever been collected before over 650,000 real-time reports from over 15,000 people and it's not just a lot of people it's a really diverse group people from wide range of Ages from eighteen to late 80s a wide range of incomes education levels people who are married divorced widowed etc they collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries what I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been investigating and that's mind wandering as human beings we have this unique ability to have our mind stray away from the present this guy is sitting here working on his computer and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month wondering was gonna have for dinner maybe he's worried that he's going bald this ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing it allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can and yet it's not clear what the relationship is between our use of disability and our happiness you've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present be here now you've probably heard a hundred times maybe to really be happy we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment maybe these people right maybe wandering is a bad thing on the other hand when our minds wander their unconstrained we can't change the physical reality in front of us but we can go anywhere in our minds since we know people want to be happy maybe when our minds wander they're going to someplace happier than the place that they're leaving it would make a lot of sense in other words maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind wandering well since I'm a scientist I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I asked with track your happiness remember this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives there's three questions the first one is a happiness question how do you feel on a scale ranging from very bad to very good second an activity question what are you doing on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV and finally a mind wandering question are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing people could say no in other words I'm focused only on my task or yes I am thinking about something else and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant neutral or unpleasant any of those yes responses are what we called mind wandering so what did we find this graph shows happiness on the vertical axis and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they're focused on the present when they're not mind wandering as it turns out people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they're not now you might look at this result and say okay sure on average people are less happy when their mind wandering but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with at least then mind wandering should be doing something good for us nope as it turns out people are less happy when their mind wandering no matter what they're doing for example people don't really like commuting to work very much it's one of their least enjoyable activities and yet they are substantially happier when they're focused only on their commute then when their mind is going off to something else it's amazing so how could this be happening I think part of the reason a big part of the is that when our minds wander we often think about unpleasant things and they are enormous ly less happy when they do that our worries our anxieties our regrets and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral they're still considerably less happy than when they're not mind wandering at all even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant they're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren't mind wandering if mind wandering we're a slot-machine would be like having the chance to lose $50 $20 or $1 right you'd never want to play so I've been talking about this suggesting perhaps that mind wandering causes unhappiness but all I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated it's possible that's the case but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy then they mind wonder maybe that's what's really going on how could we ever disentangle these two possibilities well one in fact that we can take advantage of I think a fact you'll all agree is true is that time goes forward not backward right the cause has to come before the effect we're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person and so we can look and see does mind-wandering tend to precede unhappiness or does unhappiness tend to precede mind-wandering to get some insight into the causal direction as it turns out there is a strong relationship between mind wandering now and being unhappy a short time later consistent with the idea that mind wandering is causing people to be unhappy in contrast there's no relationship between being unhappy now and mind wandering a short time later in other words mind wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause and not merely a consequence of unhappiness a few minutes ago I likened mind-wandering to a slot machine you'd never want to play well how often do people's minds wander turns out they wonder a lot in fact really a lot forty-seven percent of the time people were thinking about something other than what they're currently doing how does that depend on what people are doing this shows the rate of mind wandering across 22 activities ranging from a high of 65 percent when people are taking a shower brushing their teeth to 50% when they're working to 40% when they're exercising all the way down to this one and short bar on the right that I think some of you were probably laughing at 10% of the time people's minds are wandering when they're having sex but there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph and that is basically with one exception no matter what people are doing their mind wandering at least thirty percent of the time which suggests I think that mind wandering isn't just frequent it's ubiquitous it pervades basically everything that we do in my talk today I've told you a little bit about mind wandering a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness my hope is that over time by tracking people's moments moment happiness and their experiences in daily life will be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness and then in the end a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that's not only richer and healthier but happier as well thank you [Applause] [Music]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so people want a lot of things out of life but I think more than anything else they want happiness Aristotle called happiness the chief good the end towards which all other things aim according to this view the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable it's that we expect them to bring us happiness now in the last 50 years we Americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want we're richer we live longer we have access to technology that would have seems like science fiction just a few years ago the paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically we haven't actually gotten any happier maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness there's been an increased interest in recent years and happiness itself people have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time in fact for thousands of years but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved why is with many other domains in life I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question in fact in the last few years there's been an explosion in research on happiness for example we've learned a lot about its demographics how things like income and education gender and marriage relate to it but one of the puzzles this is revealed is that factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect yes it's better to make more money rather than less or to graduate from college instead of dropping out but the differences in happiness tend to be small which leaves the question what are the big causes of happiness I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet but I think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences it certainly seems that we're going about our lives that what we're doing who were with what we're thinking about have a big influence on our happiness and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult in fact almost impossible for scientists to study a few years ago I came up with a way to study people's happiness moment-to-moment is they're going about their daily lives on the massive scale all over the world something we've never been able to do before called track your happiness org it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real-time how does this work basically I send people signals at random points throughout the day and then I ask them a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience at the instant just before the signal the idea is that if we can watch how people's happiness goes up and down over the course of the day minute to minute in some cases and try to understand how what people are doing who they're with what they're thinking about and all the other factors that describe our day how those might relate to those changes in happiness we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness we've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data a lot more data of this kind than I think has ever been collected before over 650,000 real-time reports from over 15,000 people and it's not just a lot of people it's a really diverse group people from wide range of Ages from eighteen to late 80s a wide range of incomes education levels people who are married divorced widowed etc they collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries what I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been investigating and that's mind wandering as human beings we have this unique ability to have our mind stray away from the present this guy is sitting here working on his computer and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month wondering was gonna have for dinner maybe he's worried that he's going bald this ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing it allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can and yet it's not clear what the relationship is between our use of disability and our happiness you've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present be here now you've probably heard a hundred times maybe to really be happy we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment maybe these people right maybe wandering is a bad thing on the other hand when our minds wander their unconstrained we can't change the physical reality in front of us but we can go anywhere in our minds since we know people want to be happy maybe when our minds wander they're going to someplace happier than the place that they're leaving it would make a lot of sense in other words maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind wandering well since I'm a scientist I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I asked with track your happiness remember this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives there's three questions the first one is a happiness question how do you feel on a scale ranging from very bad to very good second an activity question what are you doing on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV and finally a mind wandering question are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing people could say no in other words I'm focused only on my task or yes I am thinking about something else and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant neutral or unpleasant any of those yes responses are what we called mind wandering so what did we find this graph shows happiness on the vertical axis and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they're focused on the present when they're not mind wandering as it turns out people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they're not now you might look at this result and say okay sure on average people are less happy when their mind wandering but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with at least then mind wandering should be doing something good for us nope as it turns out people are less happy when their mind wandering no matter what they're doing for example people don't really like commuting to work very much it's one of their least enjoyable activities and yet they are substantially happier when they're focused only on their commute then when their mind is going off to something else it's amazing so how could this be happening I think part of the reason a big part of the is that when our minds wander we often think about unpleasant things and they are enormous ly less happy when they do that our worries our anxieties our regrets and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral they're still considerably less happy than when they're not mind wandering at all even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant they're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren't mind wandering if mind wandering we're a slot-machine would be like having the chance to lose $50 $20 or $1 right you'd never want to play so I've been talking about this suggesting perhaps that mind wandering causes unhappiness but all I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated it's possible that's the case but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy then they mind wonder maybe that's what's really going on how could we ever disentangle these two possibilities well one in fact that we can take advantage of I think a fact you'll all agree is true is that time goes forward not backward right the cause has to come before the effect we're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person and so we can look and see does mind-wandering tend to precede unhappiness or does unhappiness tend to precede mind-wandering to get some insight into the causal direction as it turns out there is a strong relationship between mind wandering now and being unhappy a short time later consistent with the idea that mind wandering is causing people to be unhappy in contrast there's no relationship between being unhappy now and mind wandering a short time later in other words mind wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause and not merely a consequence of unhappiness a few minutes ago I likened mind-wandering to a slot machine you'd never want to play well how often do people's minds wander turns out they wonder a lot in fact really a lot forty-seven percent of the time people were thinking about something other than what they're currently doing how does that depend on what people are doing this shows the rate of mind wandering across 22 activities ranging from a high of 65 percent when people are taking a shower brushing their teeth to 50% when they're working to 40% when they're exercising all the way down to this one and short bar on the right that I think some of you were probably laughing at 10% of the time people's minds are wandering when they're having sex but there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph and that is basically with one exception no matter what people are doing their mind wandering at least thirty percent of the time which suggests I think that mind wandering isn't just frequent it's ubiquitous it pervades basically everything that we do in my talk today I've told you a little bit about mind wandering a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness my hope is that over time by tracking people's moments moment happiness and their experiences in daily life will be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness and then in the end a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that's not only richer and healthier but happier as well thank you [Applause] [Music]

activities and yet they are substantially happier when they're focused only on their commute then when their mind is going off to something else it's amazing so how could this be happening I think part of the reason a big part of the is that when our minds wander we often think about unpleasant things and they are enormous ly less happy when they do that our worries our anxieties our regrets and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral they're still considerably less happy than when they're not mind wandering at all even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant they're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren't mind wandering if mind wandering we're a slot-machine would be like having the chance to lose $50 $20 or $1 right you'd never want to play so I've been talking about this suggesting perhaps that mind wandering causes unhappiness but all I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated it's possible that's the case but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy then they mind wonder maybe that's what's really going on how could we ever disentangle these two possibilities well one in fact that we can take advantage of I think a fact you'll all agree is true is that time goes forward not backward right the cause has to come before the effect we're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person and so we can look and see does mind-wandering tend to precede unhappiness or does unhappiness tend to precede mind-wandering to get some insight into the causal direction as it turns out there is a strong relationship between mind wandering now and being unhappy a short time later consistent with the idea that mind wandering is causing people to be unhappy in contrast there's no relationship between being unhappy now and mind wandering a short time later in other words mind wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause and not merely a consequence of unhappiness a few minutes ago I likened mind-wandering to a slot machine you'd never want to play well how often do people's minds wander turns out they wonder a lot in fact really a lot forty-seven percent of the time people were thinking about something other than what they're currently doing how does that depend on what people are doing this shows the rate of mind wandering across 22 activities ranging from a high of 65 percent when people are taking a shower brushing their teeth to 50% when they're working to 40% when they're exercising all the way down to this one and short bar on the right that I think some of you were probably laughing at 10% of the time people's minds are wandering when they're having sex but there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph and that is basically with one exception no matter what people are doing their mind wandering at least thirty percent of the time which suggests I think that mind wandering isn't just frequent it's ubiquitous it pervades basically everything that we do in my talk today I've told you a little bit about mind wandering a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness my hope is that over time by tracking people's moments moment happiness and their experiences in daily life will be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness and then in the end a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that's not only richer and healthier but happier as well thank you [Applause] [Music]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so people want a lot of things out of life but I think more than anything else they want happiness Aristotle called happiness the chief good the end towards which all other things aim according to this view the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable it's that we expect them to bring us happiness now in the last 50 years we Americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want we're richer we live longer we have access to technology that would have seems like science fiction just a few years ago the paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically we haven't actually gotten any happier maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness there's been an increased interest in recent years and happiness itself people have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time in fact for thousands of years but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved why is with many other domains in life I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question in fact in the last few years there's been an explosion in research on happiness for example we've learned a lot about its demographics how things like income and education gender and marriage relate to it but one of the puzzles this is revealed is that factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect yes it's better to make more money rather than less or to graduate from college instead of dropping out but the differences in happiness tend to be small which leaves the question what are the big causes of happiness I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet but I think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences it certainly seems that we're going about our lives that what we're doing who were with what we're thinking about have a big influence on our happiness and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult in fact almost impossible for scientists to study a few years ago I came up with a way to study people's happiness moment-to-moment is they're going about their daily lives on the massive scale all over the world something we've never been able to do before called track your happiness org it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real-time how does this work basically I send people signals at random points throughout the day and then I ask them a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience at the instant just before the signal the idea is that if we can watch how people's happiness goes up and down over the course of the day minute to minute in some cases and try to understand how what people are doing who they're with what they're thinking about and all the other factors that describe our day how those might relate to those changes in happiness we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness we've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data a lot more data of this kind than I think has ever been collected before over 650,000 real-time reports from over 15,000 people and it's not just a lot of people it's a really diverse group people from wide range of Ages from eighteen to late 80s a wide range of incomes education levels people who are married divorced widowed etc they collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries what I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been investigating and that's mind wandering as human beings we have this unique ability to have our mind stray away from the present this guy is sitting here working on his computer and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month wondering was gonna have for dinner maybe he's worried that he's going bald this ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing it allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can and yet it's not clear what the relationship is between our use of disability and our happiness you've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present be here now you've probably heard a hundred times maybe to really be happy we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment maybe these people right maybe wandering is a bad thing on the other hand when our minds wander their unconstrained we can't change the physical reality in front of us but we can go anywhere in our minds since we know people want to be happy maybe when our minds wander they're going to someplace happier than the place that they're leaving it would make a lot of sense in other words maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind wandering well since I'm a scientist I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I asked with track your happiness remember this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives there's three questions the first one is a happiness question how do you feel on a scale ranging from very bad to very good second an activity question what are you doing on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV and finally a mind wandering question are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing people could say no in other words I'm focused only on my task or yes I am thinking about something else and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant neutral or unpleasant any of those yes responses are what we called mind wandering so what did we find this graph shows happiness on the vertical axis and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they're focused on the present when they're not mind wandering as it turns out people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they're not now you might look at this result and say okay sure on average people are less happy when their mind wandering but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with at least then mind wandering should be doing something good for us nope as it turns out people are less happy when their mind wandering no matter what they're doing for example people don't really like commuting to work very much it's one of their least enjoyable activities and yet they are substantially happier when they're focused only on their commute then when their mind is going off to something else it's amazing so how could this be happening I think
