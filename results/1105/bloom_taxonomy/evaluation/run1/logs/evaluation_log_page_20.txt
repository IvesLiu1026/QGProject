**Transcript**:
In 1995, the British Medical Journal published an astonishing report 
about a 29-year-old builder. He accidentally jumped 
onto a 15-centimeter nail, which pierced straight through 
his steel-toed boot. He was in such agonizing pain that even 
the smallest movement was unbearable. But when the doctors took off his boot, 
they faced a surprising sight: the nail had never touched 
his foot at all. For hundreds of years, scientists thought that pain was 
a direct response to damage. By that logic, the more severe an injury 
is, the more pain it should cause. But as we’ve learned more about 
the science of pain, we’ve discovered that pain and tissue 
damage don’t always go hand in hand, even when the body’s threat signaling 
mechanisms are fully functioning. We’re capable of experiencing severe pain 
out of proportion to an actual injury, and even pain without any injury, like the builder, or the well-documented 
cases of male partners of pregnant women experiencing pain
during the pregnancy or labor. What’s going on here? There are actually two phenomena at play: the experience of pain, and a biological 
process called nociception. Nociception is part of the nervous 
system’s protective response to harmful or potentially harmful stimuli. Sensors in specialized nerve endings detect mechanical, thermal, 
and chemical threats. If enough sensors are activated, electrical signals shoot up the nerve 
to the spine and on to the brain. The brain weighs the importance 
of these signals and produces pain if it decides 
the body needs protection. Typically, pain helps the body 
avoid further injury or damage. But there are a whole set of factors 
besides nociception that can influence the experience of pain—
and make pain less useful. First, there are biological factors that 
amplify nociceptive signals to the brain. If nerve fibers are activated repeatedly, the brain may decide they need 
to be more sensitive to adequately protect the body 
from threats. More stress sensors can be 
added to nerve fibers until they become so sensitive that 
even light touches to the skin spark intense electrical signals. In other cases, nerves adapt to send signals more 
efficiently, amplifying the message. These forms of amplification  are most common in people experiencing 
chronic pain, which is defined as pain lasting 
more than 3 months. When the nervous system is nudged 
into an ongoing state of high alert, pain can outlast physical injury. This creates a vicious cycle in which 
the longer pain persists, the more difficult it becomes to reverse. Psychological factors clearly 
play a role in pain too, potentially by influencing nociception and
by influencing the brain directly. A person’s emotional state, memories, beliefs about pain and expectations 
about treatment can all influence how much 
pain they experience. In one study, children who reported believing they 
had no control over pain actually experienced more intense pain than those who believed they 
had some control. Features of the environment matter too: In one experiment, volunteers with a cold rod placed on 
the back of their hand reported feeling more pain when they were 
shown a red light than a blue one, even though the rod was the same 
temperature each time. Finally, social factors like the 
availability of family support can affect perception of pain. All of this means that a multi-pronged 
approach to pain treatment that includes pain specialists, physical 
therapists, clinical psychologists, nurses and other healthcare professionals 
is often most effective. We’re only beginning to uncover the 
mechanisms behind the experience of pain, but there are some promising 
areas of research. Until recently, we thought the glial cells surrounding 
neurons were just support structures, but now we know they have a huge role 
in influencing nociception. Studies have shown that disabling certain 
brain circuits in the amygdala can eliminate pain in rats. And genetic testing in people with 
rare disorders that prevent them from feeling pain have pinpointed several other 
possible targets for drugs and perhaps eventually gene therapy.

a direct response to damage. By that logic, the more severe an injury 
is, the more pain it should cause. But as we’ve learned more about 
the science of pain, we’ve discovered that pain and tissue 
damage don’t always go hand in hand, even when the body’s threat signaling 
mechanisms are fully functioning. We’re capable of experiencing severe pain 
out of proportion to an actual injury, and even pain without any injury, like the builder, or the well-documented 
cases of male partners of pregnant women experiencing pain
during the pregnancy or labor. What’s going on here? There are actually two phenomena at play: the experience of pain, and a biological 
process called nociception. Nociception is part of the nervous 
system’s protective response to harmful or potentially harmful stimuli. Sensors in specialized nerve endings detect mechanical, thermal, 
and chemical threats. If enough sensors are activated, electrical signals shoot up the nerve 
to the spine and on to the brain. The brain weighs the importance 
of these signals and produces pain if it decides 
the body needs protection. Typically, pain helps the body 
avoid further injury or damage. But there are a whole set of factors 
besides nociception that can influence the experience of pain—
and make pain less useful. First, there are biological factors that 
amplify nociceptive signals to the brain. If nerve fibers are activated repeatedly, the brain may decide they need 
to be more sensitive to adequately protect the body 
from threats. More stress sensors can be 
added to nerve fibers until they become so sensitive that 
even light touches to the skin spark intense electrical signals. In other cases, nerves adapt to send signals more 
efficiently, amplifying the message. These forms of amplification  are most common in people experiencing 
chronic pain, which is defined as pain lasting 
more than 3 months. When the nervous system is nudged 
into an ongoing state of high alert, pain can outlast physical injury. This creates a vicious cycle in which 
the longer pain persists, the more difficult it becomes to reverse. Psychological factors clearly 
play a role in pain too, potentially by influencing nociception and
by influencing the brain directly. A person’s emotional state, memories, beliefs about pain and expectations 
about treatment can all influence how much 
pain they experience. In one study, children who reported believing they 
had no control over pain actually experienced more intense pain than those who believed they 
had some control. Features of the environment matter too: In one experiment, volunteers with a cold rod placed on 
the back of their hand reported feeling more pain when they were 
shown a red light than a blue one, even though the rod was the same 
temperature each time. Finally, social factors like the 
availability of family support can affect perception of pain. All of this means that a multi-pronged 
approach to pain treatment that includes pain specialists, physical 
therapists, clinical psychologists, nurses and other healthcare professionals 
is often most effective. We’re only beginning to uncover the 
mechanisms behind the experience of pain, but there are some promising 
areas of research. Until recently, we thought the glial cells surrounding 
neurons were just support structures, but now we know they have a huge role 
in influencing nociception. Studies have shown that disabling certain 
brain circuits in the amygdala can eliminate pain in rats. And genetic testing in people with 
rare disorders that prevent them from feeling pain have pinpointed several other 
possible targets for drugs and perhaps eventually gene therapy.

**Transcript**:
Black holes are among the most 
destructive objects in the universe. Anything that gets too close to the 
central singularity of a black hole, be it an asteroid, planet, or star, risks being torn apart by its 
extreme gravitational field. And if the approaching object happens 
to cross the black hole’s event horizon, it’ll disappear and never re-emerge, adding to the black hole’s mass and 
expanding its radius in the process. There is nothing we could throw 
at a black hole that would do the least bit of 
damage to it. Even another black hole won’t destroy it– the two will simply merge into a larger
black hole, releasing a bit of energy as gravitational
waves in the process. By some accounts, it’s possible that the universe may 
eventually consist entirely of black holes in a very distant future. And yet, there may be a way to destroy, 
or “evaporate,” these objects after all. If the theory is true, all we need to do is to wait. In 1974, Stephen Hawking theorized a process that could lead a black hole 
to gradually lose mass. Hawking radiation, as it came to be known, is based on a well-established phenomenon
called quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. According to quantum mechanics, a given point in spacetime fluctuates 
between multiple possible energy states. These fluctuations are driven by the 
continuous creation and destruction of virtual particle pairs, which consist of a particle and its 
oppositely charged antiparticle. Normally, the two collide and annihilate 
each other shortly after appearing, preserving the total energy. But what happens when they appear just at
the edge of a black hole’s event horizon? If they’re positioned just right, one of the particles could escape the 
black hole’s pull while its counterpart falls in. It would then annihilate another 
oppositely charged particle within the event horizon 
of the black hole, reducing the black hole’s mass. Meanwhile, to an outside observer, it would look like the black hole 
had emitted the escaped particle. Thus, unless a black hole continues 
to absorb additional matter and energy, it’ll evaporate particle by particle, 
at an excruciatingly slow rate. How slow? A branch of physics, called black hole
thermodynamics, gives us an answer. When everyday objects or celestial bodies
release energy to their environment, we perceive that as heat, and can use their energy emission to 
measure their temperature. Black hole thermodynamics suggests that we can similarly define the
“temperature” of a black hole. It theorizes that the more massive the 
black hole, the lower its temperature. The universe’s largest black holes would give off temperatures of the
order of 10 to the -17th power Kelvin, very close to absolute zero. Meanwhile, one with the
mass of the asteroid Vesta would have a temperature close to 200
degrees Celsius, thus releasing a lot of energy 
in the form of Hawking Radiation to the cold outside environment. The smaller the black hole, the hotter it seems to be burning– and the sooner it’ll burn out completely. Just how soon? Well, don’t hold your breath. First of all, most black holes accrete, 
or absorb matter and energy, more quickly than they emit
Hawking radiation. But even if a black hole with the 
mass of our Sun stopped accreting, it would take 10 to the 67th power years– many many magnitudes longer than the
current age of the Universe— to fully evaporate. When a black hole reaches 
about 230 metric tons, it’ll have only one more second to live. In that final second, its event horizon becomes 
increasingly tiny, until finally releasing all of its energy 
back into the universe. And while Hawking radiation has never 
been directly observed, some scientists believe that certain gamma
ray flashes detected in the sky are actually traces of the last moments of small, primordial black holes formed 
at the dawn of time. Eventually, in an almost inconceivably
distant future, the universe may be left 
as a cold and dark place. But if Stephen Hawking was right, before that happens, the normally terrifying and otherwise
impervious black holes will end their existence in a final 
blaze of glory.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking about the relationship between the mass of a black hole and its radius. The correct answer is that an increase in the mass of a black hole leads to an increase in its radius.

Among the generated MCQs, the one that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not directly available. However, Question 4 talks about the relationship between a black hole's mass and its temperature, which is related to the concept of black hole thermodynamics mentioned in the transcript. While it does not directly address the relationship between mass and radius, it is the closest in terms of discussing the properties of black holes and how they change with mass.

However, a closer look reveals that Question 7 addresses the relationship between a black hole's size (which can be related to its radius) and its temperature. Again, this doesn't directly answer the ground truth MCQ but is somewhat related.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address the relationship between a black hole's mass and its radius. But if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the properties of black holes and how they change with mass or size, I would choose Question 4 or Question 7. Between these two, I would say Question 4 is a bit more relevant as it talks about the relationship between mass and a property of the black hole (temperature), whereas Question 7 talks about size (which is related to radius) and temperature.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ would be 4, with the caveat that it's not a direct match but rather a related concept.

**Transcript**:
Black holes are among the most 
destructive objects in the universe. Anything that gets too close to the 
central singularity of a black hole, be it an asteroid, planet, or star, risks being torn apart by its 
extreme gravitational field. And if the approaching object happens 
to cross the black hole’s event horizon, it’ll disappear and never re-emerge, adding to the black hole’s mass and 
expanding its radius in the process. There is nothing we could throw 
at a black hole that would do the least bit of 
damage to it. Even another black hole won’t destroy it– the two will simply merge into a larger
black hole, releasing a bit of energy as gravitational
waves in the process. By some accounts, it’s possible that the universe may 
eventually consist entirely of black holes in a very distant future. And yet, there may be a way to destroy, 
or “evaporate,” these objects after all. If the theory is true, all we need to do is to wait. In 1974, Stephen Hawking theorized a process that could lead a black hole 
to gradually lose mass. Hawking radiation, as it came to be known, is based on a well-established phenomenon
called quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. According to quantum mechanics, a given point in spacetime fluctuates 
between multiple possible energy states. These fluctuations are driven by the 
continuous creation and destruction of virtual particle pairs, which consist of a particle and its 
oppositely charged antiparticle. Normally, the two collide and annihilate 
each other shortly after appearing, preserving the total energy. But what happens when they appear just at
the edge of a black hole’s event horizon? If they’re positioned just right, one of the particles could escape the 
black hole’s pull while its counterpart falls in. It would then annihilate another 
oppositely charged particle within the event horizon 
of the black hole, reducing the black hole’s mass. Meanwhile, to an outside observer, it would look like the black hole 
had emitted the escaped particle. Thus, unless a black hole continues 
to absorb additional matter and energy, it’ll evaporate particle by particle, 
at an excruciatingly slow rate. How slow? A branch of physics, called black hole
thermodynamics, gives us an answer. When everyday objects or celestial bodies
release energy to their environment, we perceive that as heat, and can use their energy emission to 
measure their temperature. Black hole thermodynamics suggests that we can similarly define the
“temperature” of a black hole. It theorizes that the more massive the 
black hole, the lower its temperature. The universe’s largest black holes would give off temperatures of the
order of 10 to the -17th power Kelvin, very close to absolute zero. Meanwhile, one with the
mass of the asteroid Vesta would have a temperature close to 200
degrees Celsius, thus releasing a lot of energy 
in the form of Hawking Radiation to the cold outside environment. The smaller the black hole, the hotter it seems to be burning– and the sooner it’ll burn out completely. Just how soon? Well, don’t hold your breath. First of all, most black holes accrete, 
or absorb matter and energy, more quickly than they emit
Hawking radiation. But even if a black hole with the 
mass of our Sun stopped accreting, it would take 10 to the 67th power years– many many magnitudes longer than the
current age of the Universe— to fully evaporate. When a black hole reaches 
about 230 metric tons, it’ll have only one more second to live. In that final second, its event horizon becomes 
increasingly tiny, until finally releasing all of its energy 
back into the universe. And while Hawking radiation has never 
been directly observed, some scientists believe that certain gamma
ray flashes detected in the sky are actually traces of the last moments of small, primordial black holes formed 
at the dawn of time. Eventually, in an almost inconceivably
distant future, the universe may be left 
as a cold and dark place. But if Stephen Hawking was right, before that happens, the normally terrifying and otherwise
impervious black holes will end their existence in a final 
blaze of glory.

**Transcript**:
What drives someone to kill in cold blood? What goes through the murderer’s mind? And what kind of a society 
breeds such people? Over 150 years ago Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky 
took these questions up in what would become one of the 
best-known works of Russian literature: "Crime and Punishment." First serialized in a literary 
magazine in 1866, the novel tells the story of Rodion 
Romanovich Raskolnikov, a young law student in Saint Petersburg. Raskolnikov lives in abject poverty, and at the start of the story has run 
out of funds to continue his studies. Letters from his rural home 
only add to his distress when he realizes how much his mother and 
sister have sacrificed for his success. Increasingly desperate after selling the last of his valuables
to an elderly pawnbroker, he resolves on a plan 
to murder and rob her. But the impact of carrying out 
this unthinkable act proves to be more than 
he was prepared for. Though the novel is sometimes cited as one
of the first psychological thrillers, its scope reaches far beyond 
Raskolnikov’s inner turmoil. From dank taverns to dilapidated 
apartments and claustrophobic police stations, the underbelly of 19th century Saint 
Petersburg is brought to life by Dostoyevsky’s searing prose. We’re introduced to characters 
such as Marmeladov, a miserable former official who 
has drank his family into ruin, and Svidrigailov, an unhinged 
and lecherous nobleman. As Raskolnikov’s own family 
arrives in town, their moral innocence stands 
in stark contrast to the depravity of those around them, even as their fates grow 
increasingly intertwined. This bleak portrait of Russian society reflects the author’s own complex life 
experiences and evolving ideas. As a young writer who left behind 
a promising military career, Fyodor had been attracted to 
ideas of socialism and reform, and joined a circle of intellectuals to 
discuss radical texts banned by the Imperial government. Upon exposure, members of this group, including 
Dostoyevsky, were arrested. Many were sentenced to death, only to be subjected to a mock execution 
and last-minute pardon from the Tsar. Dostoyevsky spent the next four 
years in a Siberian labor camp before being released in 1854. The experience left him with a far 
more pessimistic view of social reform, and his focus shifted toward 
spiritual concerns. In the 1864 novella "Notes from 
Underground," he expounded on his belief that utopian
Western philosophies could never satisfy the contradictory 
yearnings of the human soul. "Crime and Punishment" was conceived 
and completed the following year, picking up on many of the same themes. In many ways, the novel follows a common 
narrative thread where a promising youth is seduced and
corrupted by the dangers of urban life. But its social critique cuts far deeper. Raskolnikov rationalizes that 
his own advancement at the cost of the exploitative 
pawnbroker’s death would be a net benefit to society. In doing so, he echoes the doctrines of egoism 
and utilitarianism embraced by many of Dostoyevsky’s 
contemporary intellectuals. And in believing that his intelligence 
allows him to transcend moral taboos, Raskolnikov cuts himself off from 
his own humanity. Yet although the book is deeply 
concerned with morality, "Crime and Punishment" never comes across
as merely moralizing, with each character given their own 
distinctive and convincing voice. One of the most remarkable things about
"Crime and Punishment" is its ability to thrill despite the details of the central murder 
being revealed in the first act. Raskolnikov’s crime is clear. But it’s only through Dostoyevsky’s 
gripping account of the ensuing social and 
psychological turmoil that we learn the true nature 
of his punishment– and the possibility of redemption.

to an elderly pawnbroker, he resolves on a plan 
to murder and rob her. But the impact of carrying out 
this unthinkable act proves to be more than 
he was prepared for. Though the novel is sometimes cited as one
of the first psychological thrillers, its scope reaches far beyond 
Raskolnikov’s inner turmoil. From dank taverns to dilapidated 
apartments and claustrophobic police stations, the underbelly of 19th century Saint 
Petersburg is brought to life by Dostoyevsky’s searing prose. We’re introduced to characters 
such as Marmeladov, a miserable former official who 
has drank his family into ruin, and Svidrigailov, an unhinged 
and lecherous nobleman. As Raskolnikov’s own family 
arrives in town, their moral innocence stands 
in stark contrast to the depravity of those around them, even as their fates grow 
increasingly intertwined. This bleak portrait of Russian society reflects the author’s own complex life 
experiences and evolving ideas. As a young writer who left behind 
a promising military career, Fyodor had been attracted to 
ideas of socialism and reform, and joined a circle of intellectuals to 
discuss radical texts banned by the Imperial government. Upon exposure, members of this group, including 
Dostoyevsky, were arrested. Many were sentenced to death, only to be subjected to a mock execution 
and last-minute pardon from the Tsar. Dostoyevsky spent the next four 
years in a Siberian labor camp before being released in 1854. The experience left him with a far 
more pessimistic view of social reform, and his focus shifted toward 
spiritual concerns. In the 1864 novella "Notes from 
Underground," he expounded on his belief that utopian
Western philosophies could never satisfy the contradictory 
yearnings of the human soul. "Crime and Punishment" was conceived 
and completed the following year, picking up on many of the same themes. In many ways, the novel follows a common 
narrative thread where a promising youth is seduced and
corrupted by the dangers of urban life. But its social critique cuts far deeper. Raskolnikov rationalizes that 
his own advancement at the cost of the exploitative 
pawnbroker’s death would be a net benefit to society. In doing so, he echoes the doctrines of egoism 
and utilitarianism embraced by many of Dostoyevsky’s 
contemporary intellectuals. And in believing that his intelligence 
allows him to transcend moral taboos, Raskolnikov cuts himself off from 
his own humanity. Yet although the book is deeply 
concerned with morality, "Crime and Punishment" never comes across
as merely moralizing, with each character given their own 
distinctive and convincing voice. One of the most remarkable things about
"Crime and Punishment" is its ability to thrill despite the details of the central murder 
being revealed in the first act. Raskolnikov’s crime is clear. But it’s only through Dostoyevsky’s 
gripping account of the ensuing social and 
psychological turmoil that we learn the true nature 
of his punishment– and the possibility of redemption.

What drives someone to kill in cold blood? What goes through the murderer’s mind? And what kind of a society 
breeds such people? Over 150 years ago Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky 
took these questions up in what would become one of the 
best-known works of Russian literature: "Crime and Punishment." First serialized in a literary 
magazine in 1866, the novel tells the story of Rodion 
Romanovich Raskolnikov, a young law student in Saint Petersburg. Raskolnikov lives in abject poverty, and at the start of the story has run 
out of funds to continue his studies. Letters from his rural home 
only add to his distress when he realizes how much his mother and 
sister have sacrificed for his success. Increasingly desperate after selling the last of his valuables
to an elderly pawnbroker, he resolves on a plan

**Transcript**:
It’s late, pitch dark, and a self-driving 
car winds down a narrow country road. Suddenly, three hazards appear 
at the same time. What happens next? Before it can navigate this 
onslaught of obstacles, the car has to detect them— gleaning enough information about 
their size, shape, and position, so that its control algorithms 
can plot the safest course. With no human at the wheel, the car needs smart eyes, sensors 
that’ll resolve these details— no matter the environment, 
weather, or how dark it is— all in a split-second. That’s a tall order, but there’s a 
solution that partners two things: a special kind of laser-based probe 
called LIDAR, and a miniature version of 
the communications technology that keeps the internet humming,
called integrated photonics. To understand LIDAR, it helps to start 
with a related technology— radar. In aviation, radar antennas launch pulses 
of radio or microwaves at planes to learn their locations by timing 
how long the beams take to bounce back. That’s a limited way of seeing, though, because the large beam-size 
can’t visualize fine details. In contrast, a self-driving car’s 
LIDAR system, which stands for Light Detection 
and Ranging, uses a narrow invisible infrared laser. It can image features as small as the 
button on a pedestrian’s shirt across the street. But how do we determine the shape, 
or depth, of these features? LIDAR fires a train of super-short laser 
pulses to give depth resolution. Take the moose on the country road. As the car drives by, one LIDAR pulse 
scatters off the base of its antlers, while the next may travel to the tip 
of one antler before bouncing back. Measuring how much longer 
the second pulse takes to return provides data about the antler’s shape. With a lot of short pulses, a LIDAR system
quickly renders a detailed profile. The most obvious way to create a pulse 
of light is to switch a laser on and off. But this makes a laser unstable and 
affects the precise timing of its pulses, which limits depth resolution. Better to leave it on, and use something else to periodically 
block the light reliably and rapidly. That’s where integrated photonics come in. The digital data of the internet is carried by precision-timed 
pulses of light, some as short as a hundred picoseconds. One way to create these pulses is 
with a Mach-Zehnder modulator. This device takes advantage of a 
particular wave property, called interference. Imagine dropping pebbles into a pond: as the ripples spread and overlap, 
a pattern forms. In some places, wave peaks add 
up to become very large; in other places, they completely 
cancel out. The Mach-Zehnder modulator 
does something similar. It splits waves of light along two 
parallel arms and eventually rejoins them. If the light is slowed down and 
delayed in one arm, the waves recombine out of sync and 
cancel, blocking the light. By toggling this delay in one arm, the modulator acts like an on/off switch, 
emitting pulses of light. A light pulse lasting a hundred 
picoseconds leads to a depth resolution of a 
few centimeters, but tomorrow’s cars will need 
to see better than that. By pairing the modulator with a super-
sensitive, fast-acting light detector, the resolution can be refined 
to a millimeter. That’s more than a hundred times better  than what we can make out with 
20/20 vision, from across a street. The first generation of automobile LIDAR 
has relied on complex spinning assemblies that scan from rooftops or hoods. With integrated photonics, modulators and detectors are being shrunk 
to less than a tenth of a millimeter, and packed into tiny chips that’ll one 
day fit inside a car’s lights. These chips will also include a clever 
variation on the modulator to help do away with moving parts 
and scan at rapid speeds. By slowing the light in a modulator 
arm only a tiny bit, this additional device will act more 
like a dimmer than an on/off switch. If an array of many such arms, each with 
a tiny controlled delay, is stacked in parallel, something novel 
can be designed: a steerable laser beam. From their new vantage, these smart eyes will probe and 
see more thoroughly than anything nature could’ve imagined— and help navigate any number 
of obstacles. All without anyone breaking a sweat— except for maybe one disoriented moose.

**Transcript**:
It’s late, pitch dark, and a self-driving 
car winds down a narrow country road. Suddenly, three hazards appear 
at the same time. What happens next? Before it can navigate this 
onslaught of obstacles, the car has to detect them— gleaning enough information about 
their size, shape, and position, so that its control algorithms 
can plot the safest course. With no human at the wheel, the car needs smart eyes, sensors 
that’ll resolve these details— no matter the environment, 
weather, or how dark it is— all in a split-second. That’s a tall order, but there’s a 
solution that partners two things: a special kind of laser-based probe 
called LIDAR, and a miniature version of 
the communications technology that keeps the internet humming,
called integrated photonics. To understand LIDAR, it helps to start 
with a related technology— radar. In aviation, radar antennas launch pulses 
of radio or microwaves at planes to learn their locations by timing 
how long the beams take to bounce back. That’s a limited way of seeing, though, because the large beam-size 
can’t visualize fine details. In contrast, a self-driving car’s 
LIDAR system, which stands for Light Detection 
and Ranging, uses a narrow invisible infrared laser. It can image features as small as the 
button on a pedestrian’s shirt across the street. But how do we determine the shape, 
or depth, of these features? LIDAR fires a train of super-short laser 
pulses to give depth resolution. Take the moose on the country road. As the car drives by, one LIDAR pulse 
scatters off the base of its antlers, while the next may travel to the tip 
of one antler before bouncing back. Measuring how much longer 
the second pulse takes to return provides data about the antler’s shape. With a lot of short pulses, a LIDAR system
quickly renders a detailed profile. The most obvious way to create a pulse 
of light is to switch a laser on and off. But this makes a laser unstable and 
affects the precise timing of its pulses, which limits depth resolution. Better to leave it on, and use something else to periodically 
block the light reliably and rapidly. That’s where integrated photonics come in. The digital data of the internet is carried by precision-timed 
pulses of light, some as short as a hundred picoseconds. One way to create these pulses is 
with a Mach-Zehnder modulator. This device takes advantage of a 
particular wave property, called interference. Imagine dropping pebbles into a pond: as the ripples spread and overlap, 
a pattern forms. In some places, wave peaks add 
up to become very large; in other places, they completely 
cancel out. The Mach-Zehnder modulator 
does something similar. It splits waves of light along two 
parallel arms and eventually rejoins them. If the light is slowed down and 
delayed in one arm, the waves recombine out of sync and 
cancel, blocking the light. By toggling this delay in one arm, the modulator acts like an on/off switch, 
emitting pulses of light. A light pulse lasting a hundred 
picoseconds leads to a depth resolution of a 
few centimeters, but tomorrow’s cars will need 
to see better than that. By pairing the modulator with a super-
sensitive, fast-acting light detector, the resolution can be refined 
to a millimeter. That’s more than a hundred times better  than what we can make out with 
20/20 vision, from across a street. The first generation of automobile LIDAR 
has relied on complex spinning assemblies that scan from rooftops or hoods. With integrated photonics, modulators and detectors are being shrunk 
to less than a tenth of a millimeter, and packed into tiny chips that’ll one 
day fit inside a car’s lights. These chips will also include a clever 
variation on the modulator to help do away with moving parts 
and scan at rapid speeds. By slowing the light in a modulator 
arm only a tiny bit, this additional device will act more 
like a dimmer than an on/off switch. If an array of many such arms, each with 
a tiny controlled delay, is stacked in parallel, something novel 
can be designed: a steerable laser beam. From their new vantage, these smart eyes will probe and 
see more thoroughly than anything nature could’ve imagined— and help navigate any number 
of obstacles. All without anyone breaking a sweat— except for maybe one disoriented moose.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although the wording of the question is different, the intent and content of Question 4 are similar to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the effect of switching a laser on and off rapidly, while Question 4 asks about the primary advantage of using integrated photonics in LIDAR technology, which is related to the issue of switching a laser on and off. 

However, a closer examination of the options reveals that Question 4, Option C is the most relevant to the ground truth MCQ. It mentions the ability to "block light reliably and rapidly", which is related to the issue of switching a laser on and off.

But an even closer match can be found in the passage that mentions "But this makes a laser unstable and affects the precise timing of its pulses, which limits depth resolution. Better to leave it on, and use something else to periodically block the light reliably and rapidly."

With this context in mind, we can see that the passage is actually more closely related to Question 5, which mentions the function of a Mach-Zehnder modulator in LIDAR technology. The modulator acts like an on/off switch, emitting pulses of light by blocking the light reliably and rapidly.

However, the closest match is actually not Question 4 or Question 5, but rather the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ are more closely related to the passage that mentions the issue of switching a laser on and off. 

Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 is the closest match in terms of the content and the options, but it does not directly address the issue of switching a laser on and off.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I realize that I made an error in my previous response. The correct answer is actually not among the generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose the closest match, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 5.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 5: What is the function of a Mach-Zehnder modulator in LIDAR technology?**

Although this question does not directly ask about the similarity between the device for steering a laser beam and a Mach-Zehnder modulator, it does provide information about the Mach-Zehnder modulator, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ. However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match can be found in **Question 9: What is the function of a steerable laser beam in LIDAR technology?** and **Question 5: What is the function of a Mach-Zehnder modulator in LIDAR technology?**, as they both relate to the devices mentioned in the ground truth MCQ. However, neither of these questions directly compares the two devices.

If I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 5** is the most similar, as it at least mentions the Mach-Zehnder modulator, which is one of the devices mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly compares the device for steering a laser beam and a Mach-Zehnder modulator.

**Transcript**:
What shape are your cells? Squishy cylinders? Jagged zig-zags? You probably don’t think much about
the bodies of these building blocks, but at the microscopic level, small 
changes can have huge consequences. And while some adaptations change 
these shapes for the better, others can spark a cascade of 
debilitating complications. This is the story of sickle-cell disease. Sickle-cell disease affects the 
red blood cells, which transport oxygen from the lungs 
to all the tissues in the body. To perform this vital task, red blood cells are filled with hemoglobin
proteins to carry oxygen molecules. These proteins float independently inside the red blood cell’s pliable, 
doughnut-like shape, keeping the cells flexible enough to accommodate even the 
tiniest of blood vessels. But in sickle cell disease, a single genetic mutation alters
the structure of hemoglobin. After releasing oxygen to tissues, these mutated proteins lock 
together into rigid rows. Rods of hemoglobin cause the cell 
to deform into a long, pointed sickle. These red blood cells are 
harder and stickier, and no longer flow smoothly through 
blood vessels. Sickled cells snag and pile up– sometimes blocking the vessel completely. This keeps oxygen from reaching
a variety of cells, causing the wide range of symptoms experienced by people 
with sickle-cell disease. Starting when they’re 
less than a year old, patients suffer from repeated episodes of
stabbing pain in oxygen-starved tissues. The location of the clogged vessel determines the specific 
symptoms experienced. A blockage in the spleen, 
part of the immune system, puts patients at risk for 
dangerous infections. A pileup in the lungs can produce 
fevers and difficulty breathing. A clog near the eye can cause vision 
problems and retinal detachment. And if the obstructed vessels 
supply the brain the patient could even 
suffer a stroke. Worse still, sickled red blood cells 
also don’t survive very long— just 10 or 20 days, versus a 
healthy cell’s 4 months. This short lifespan means that patients live with a constantly
depleted supply of red blood cells; a condition called sickle-cell anemia. Perhaps what’s most surprising 
about this malignant mutation is that it originally evolved
as a beneficial adaptation. Researchers have been able to trace
the origins of the sickle cell mutation to regions historically ravaged 
by a tropical disease called malaria. Spread by a parasite found 
in local mosquitoes, malaria uses red blood cells as incubators to spread quickly and lethally 
through the bloodstream. However, the same structural changes
that turn red blood cells into roadblocks also make them more resistant to malaria. And if a child inherits a copy of the
mutation from only one parent, there will be just enough abnormal 
hemoglobin to make life difficult for the 
malaria parasite, while most of their red blood cells retain
their normal shape and function. In regions rife with this parasite, sickle cell mutation offered a serious 
evolutionary advantage. But as the adaptation flourished, it became clear that inheriting the 
mutation from both parents resulted in sickle-cell anemia. Today, most people with 
sickle-cell disease can trace their ancestry to a country
where malaria is endemic. And this mutation still plays a key role
in Africa, where more than 90% of malaria 
infections occur worldwide. Fortunately, as this “adaptation” thrives, our treatment for sickle cell continues 
to improve. For years, hydroxyurea was the only 
medication available to reduce the amount of sickling, blunting symptoms and 
increasing life expectancy. Bone marrow transplantations 
offer a curative measure, but these procedures are 
complicated and often inaccessible. But promising new medications 
are intervening in novel ways, like keeping oxygen bonded to 
hemoglobin to prevent sickling, or reducing the stickiness 
of sickled cells. And the ability to edit DNA has raised the possibility of enabling 
stem cells to produce normal hemoglobin. As these tools become available in the areas most affected by malaria
and sickle cell disease, we can improve the quality of life for more patients with this 
adverse adaptation.

**Transcript**:
What shape are your cells? Squishy cylinders? Jagged zig-zags? You probably don’t think much about
the bodies of these building blocks, but at the microscopic level, small 
changes can have huge consequences. And while some adaptations change 
these shapes for the better, others can spark a cascade of 
debilitating complications. This is the story of sickle-cell disease. Sickle-cell disease affects the 
red blood cells, which transport oxygen from the lungs 
to all the tissues in the body. To perform this vital task, red blood cells are filled with hemoglobin
proteins to carry oxygen molecules. These proteins float independently inside the red blood cell’s pliable, 
doughnut-like shape, keeping the cells flexible enough to accommodate even the 
tiniest of blood vessels. But in sickle cell disease, a single genetic mutation alters
the structure of hemoglobin. After releasing oxygen to tissues, these mutated proteins lock 
together into rigid rows. Rods of hemoglobin cause the cell 
to deform into a long, pointed sickle. These red blood cells are 
harder and stickier, and no longer flow smoothly through 
blood vessels. Sickled cells snag and pile up– sometimes blocking the vessel completely. This keeps oxygen from reaching
a variety of cells, causing the wide range of symptoms experienced by people 
with sickle-cell disease. Starting when they’re 
less than a year old, patients suffer from repeated episodes of
stabbing pain in oxygen-starved tissues. The location of the clogged vessel determines the specific 
symptoms experienced. A blockage in the spleen, 
part of the immune system, puts patients at risk for 
dangerous infections. A pileup in the lungs can produce 
fevers and difficulty breathing. A clog near the eye can cause vision 
problems and retinal detachment. And if the obstructed vessels 
supply the brain the patient could even 
suffer a stroke. Worse still, sickled red blood cells 
also don’t survive very long— just 10 or 20 days, versus a 
healthy cell’s 4 months. This short lifespan means that patients live with a constantly
depleted supply of red blood cells; a condition called sickle-cell anemia. Perhaps what’s most surprising 
about this malignant mutation is that it originally evolved
as a beneficial adaptation. Researchers have been able to trace
the origins of the sickle cell mutation to regions historically ravaged 
by a tropical disease called malaria. Spread by a parasite found 
in local mosquitoes, malaria uses red blood cells as incubators to spread quickly and lethally 
through the bloodstream. However, the same structural changes
that turn red blood cells into roadblocks also make them more resistant to malaria. And if a child inherits a copy of the
mutation from only one parent, there will be just enough abnormal 
hemoglobin to make life difficult for the 
malaria parasite, while most of their red blood cells retain
their normal shape and function. In regions rife with this parasite, sickle cell mutation offered a serious 
evolutionary advantage. But as the adaptation flourished, it became clear that inheriting the 
mutation from both parents resulted in sickle-cell anemia. Today, most people with 
sickle-cell disease can trace their ancestry to a country
where malaria is endemic. And this mutation still plays a key role
in Africa, where more than 90% of malaria 
infections occur worldwide. Fortunately, as this “adaptation” thrives, our treatment for sickle cell continues 
to improve. For years, hydroxyurea was the only 
medication available to reduce the amount of sickling, blunting symptoms and 
increasing life expectancy. Bone marrow transplantations 
offer a curative measure, but these procedures are 
complicated and often inaccessible. But promising new medications 
are intervening in novel ways, like keeping oxygen bonded to 
hemoglobin to prevent sickling, or reducing the stickiness 
of sickled cells. And the ability to edit DNA has raised the possibility of enabling 
stem cells to produce normal hemoglobin. As these tools become available in the areas most affected by malaria
and sickle cell disease, we can improve the quality of life for more patients with this 
adverse adaptation.

**Transcript**:
On April 26th, 1937, Fascist forces bombed the Basque village 
of Guernica in Northern Spain. It was one of the worst civilian 
casualties of the Spanish Civil War, waged between the democratic republic and 
General Franco’s fascist contingent. For Pablo Picasso, the 
tragedy sparked a frenzied period of work in which he produced a 
massive anti-war mural, aptly titled "Guernica." The painting is a powerful work of 
historical documentation and political protest. But while Picasso’s artistic 
motivations are clear, the symbolism of the painting can be as 
confusing and chaotic as war itself. How can we make sense of this 
overwhelming image, and what exactly makes it a 
masterpiece of anti-war art? The painting’s monumental canvas is 
disorienting from the start, rendered in the abstracted Cubist style 
Picasso pioneered. Cubism deliberately emphasized the 
two-dimensionality of the canvas by flattening the objects being painted. This afforded viewers multiple and often impossible perspectives 
on the same object; a technique considered shocking 
even in Picasso’s domestic scenes. But in this context, the style offers a profoundly 
overwhelming view of violence, destruction, and casualties. Multiple perspectives only compound
the horror on display– sending the eyes hurtling around the 
frame in a futile hunt for peace. On the far left, a woman holding her 
dead child releases a scream; her eyes sliding down her face 
in the shape of tears and her head bending back unnaturally 
to echo her baby’s. There is the statue of a soldier 
present below, but he is unable to defend 
the woman and child. Instead his broken body lies in pieces, his arm clutching a splintered sword 
in a signal of utmost defeat. The tip of his sword meets a woman’s foot 
as she attempts to flee the devastation. But her other leg appears 
rooted to the spot, locked in the corner of the canvas 
even as she stretches to move it. Another victim appears 
behind this slouching figure. Falling helplessly as flames 
lick around her, she too is caught in her 
own hopeless scene. Each of these figures bordering the 
painting are horribly trapped, giving the work an acute 
sense of claustrophobia. And where you might expect the canvas’ 
massive size to counteract this feeling, its scale only highlights the nearly 
life-sized atrocities on display. Some possible relief comes from a lamp held tightly by a ghostly woman 
reaching out her window. But is her lantern’s hopeful glow 
truly lighting the scene? Or is it the jagged lightbulb– thought to represent the technologies 
of modern warfare– which illuminates her view of 
the chaos below? From the coffin-like confines
of her window, her arm guides the viewer back 
into the fray, to perhaps the most controversial
symbols of all– two ghostly animals caught 
in the destruction. Does the screaming horse embody the
threat of Franco’s military nationalism; or does the spike running through 
its body convey its victimhood? Does the white bull represent Spain, the country of matadors and a common 
theme in Picasso’s work– or does it stand for the 
brutality of war? In this scene of strife, these animals 
raise more questions than answers. And additional elements hidden 
throughout the frame offer even more secrets for 
close observers. At the top of the canvas flashes a bird 
desperate to escape the carnage. And the abundance of animals on display 
may hint at the bombing’s date– a market day which flooded the streets with villagers, animals, and 
other potential causalities. Like the bombing of Guernica itself, Picasso’s painting is dense 
with destruction. But hidden beneath this supposed chaos,
are carefully crafted scenes and symbols, carrying out the painting’s multifaceted 
attack on fascism. Decades after its creation, "Guernica" retains its power to shock 
viewers and ignite debate, and is often referenced at anti-war 
gatherings around the world. Hundreds of viewers have grappled with 
its harsh imagery, shattering symbolism and complex political messaging. But even without a close understanding 
of it’s complicated subtext, Picasso’s work remains a searing reminder 
of the true casualties of violence.

**Transcript**:
On April 26th, 1937, Fascist forces bombed the Basque village 
of Guernica in Northern Spain. It was one of the worst civilian 
casualties of the Spanish Civil War, waged between the democratic republic and 
General Franco’s fascist contingent. For Pablo Picasso, the 
tragedy sparked a frenzied period of work in which he produced a 
massive anti-war mural, aptly titled "Guernica." The painting is a powerful work of 
historical documentation and political protest. But while Picasso’s artistic 
motivations are clear, the symbolism of the painting can be as 
confusing and chaotic as war itself. How can we make sense of this 
overwhelming image, and what exactly makes it a 
masterpiece of anti-war art? The painting’s monumental canvas is 
disorienting from the start, rendered in the abstracted Cubist style 
Picasso pioneered. Cubism deliberately emphasized the 
two-dimensionality of the canvas by flattening the objects being painted. This afforded viewers multiple and often impossible perspectives 
on the same object; a technique considered shocking 
even in Picasso’s domestic scenes. But in this context, the style offers a profoundly 
overwhelming view of violence, destruction, and casualties. Multiple perspectives only compound
the horror on display– sending the eyes hurtling around the 
frame in a futile hunt for peace. On the far left, a woman holding her 
dead child releases a scream; her eyes sliding down her face 
in the shape of tears and her head bending back unnaturally 
to echo her baby’s. There is the statue of a soldier 
present below, but he is unable to defend 
the woman and child. Instead his broken body lies in pieces, his arm clutching a splintered sword 
in a signal of utmost defeat. The tip of his sword meets a woman’s foot 
as she attempts to flee the devastation. But her other leg appears 
rooted to the spot, locked in the corner of the canvas 
even as she stretches to move it. Another victim appears 
behind this slouching figure. Falling helplessly as flames 
lick around her, she too is caught in her 
own hopeless scene. Each of these figures bordering the 
painting are horribly trapped, giving the work an acute 
sense of claustrophobia. And where you might expect the canvas’ 
massive size to counteract this feeling, its scale only highlights the nearly 
life-sized atrocities on display. Some possible relief comes from a lamp held tightly by a ghostly woman 
reaching out her window. But is her lantern’s hopeful glow 
truly lighting the scene? Or is it the jagged lightbulb– thought to represent the technologies 
of modern warfare– which illuminates her view of 
the chaos below? From the coffin-like confines
of her window, her arm guides the viewer back 
into the fray, to perhaps the most controversial
symbols of all– two ghostly animals caught 
in the destruction. Does the screaming horse embody the
threat of Franco’s military nationalism; or does the spike running through 
its body convey its victimhood? Does the white bull represent Spain, the country of matadors and a common 
theme in Picasso’s work– or does it stand for the 
brutality of war? In this scene of strife, these animals 
raise more questions than answers. And additional elements hidden 
throughout the frame offer even more secrets for 
close observers. At the top of the canvas flashes a bird 
desperate to escape the carnage. And the abundance of animals on display 
may hint at the bombing’s date– a market day which flooded the streets with villagers, animals, and 
other potential causalities. Like the bombing of Guernica itself, Picasso’s painting is dense 
with destruction. But hidden beneath this supposed chaos,
are carefully crafted scenes and symbols, carrying out the painting’s multifaceted 
attack on fascism. Decades after its creation, "Guernica" retains its power to shock 
viewers and ignite debate, and is often referenced at anti-war 
gatherings around the world. Hundreds of viewers have grappled with 
its harsh imagery, shattering symbolism and complex political messaging. But even without a close understanding 
of it’s complicated subtext, Picasso’s work remains a searing reminder 
of the true casualties of violence.

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and options.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the elements present in the painting "Guernica". Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 9: What is the significance of the abundance of animals on display in "Guernica"?** is the closest match, as it mentions animals, which is one of the elements mentioned in the ground truth MCQ. However, it does not include people, technology, or weapons, which are also mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that **Question 9** is the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not a perfect match.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match in terms of question content, but rather in terms of question intent and options.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the agreement among art critics and viewers regarding the symbolism of certain figures in the painting "Guernica". The correct answer is "False", indicating that there is no general agreement about the symbolism.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 is the most similar in terms of question intent and options. It asks about the interpretation of the white bull symbol in "Guernica" and provides options that reflect different possible meanings. While the question content is not identical to the ground truth MCQ, the intent to assess the understanding of the painting's symbolism and the options provided make it the most similar generated MCQ.

However, another generated MCQ, Question 5, is also similar in terms of question intent, as it asks about the interpretation of the ghostly animals in the painting.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4 is not the best match, a better match is:

 Question 5: What is the significance of the ghostly animals in the painting "Guernica"? Options: A. They represent the threat of Franco's military nationalism, B. They represent the victimhood of the animals, C. They represent the hope of peace, D. They represent the power of the military 

This question is more similar to the ground truth MCQ because it also deals with the interpretation of symbols in the painting, and the options provided reflect the ambiguity and complexity of the symbolism, which is in line with the ground truth MCQ's correct answer "False".

disorienting from the start, rendered in the abstracted Cubist style 
Picasso pioneered. Cubism deliberately emphasized the

in the shape of tears and her head bending back unnaturally 
to echo her baby’s. There is the statue of a soldier 
present below, but he is unable to defend 
the woman and child. Instead his broken body lies in pieces, his arm clutching a splintered sword 
in a signal of utmost defeat. The tip of his sword meets a woman’s foot 
as she attempts to flee the devastation. But her other leg appears 
rooted to the spot, locked in the corner of the canvas 
even as she stretches to move it. Another victim appears 
behind this slouching figure. Falling helplessly as flames

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**None of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.**

The ground truth MCQ asks about the current relevance of Guernica, while the generated MCQs focus on specific aspects of the painting or its symbolism.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

**Question 10: How can the painting "Guernica" be described in terms of its impact on the viewer?**

This generated MCQ is related to the ground truth MCQ in the sense that it asks about the painting's impact on the viewer, which could be inferred to be related to its relevance today. However, the options and content of this generated MCQ do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: **10 (with the caveat that it's not an exact match)**

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
For your son’s sixth birthday, you’ve promised to get him the cutest 
creature in creation: the cuddly. It’s hard to believe that it’s a cousin of
the terrifying duddly or the hideous fuddly. They’re all members of the Wuddly species, and the process of adopting 
them is deeply peculiar. It takes 100 eggs to make a single 
animal in genus Wuddly. When 100 eggs are placed together 
in an incubator, they undergo egg fusion, and combine 
in the following way. Blue and purple combine to make red eggs. Red and blue combine to make purple eggs, and red and purple 
combine to make blue eggs. The most plentiful eggs pair up first, and if two piles are even, an egg comes from one of them at random. They keep combining until 
there’s just one left. If the final egg is blue, a Cuddly hatches out of it. Purple eggs give you Duddlies, and Red eggs give you Fuddlies. The incubator currently has 99 eggs in it. 23 are blue, 33 are purple, 
and 43 are red. You can begin the process of egg fusion
by adding an egg of any color to the room. When all the eggs have combined
into a single egg, the creature that hatches will bond 
with you on sight, which is why getting a Cuddly 
is so important. After all, you made a promise to your son. Which color egg should you add 
to the incubator to get a cuddly? Pause the video to figure it out 
for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It’s easy to get mixed up with all the
cuddlies, duddlies, and fuddlies coming from different colored eggs. If we ignore how many total eggs
of each color there are, and just look at the 
process of egg fusion, we might notice something that 
will make this problem simpler. When two eggs fuse, the number of eggs of each of those 
colors decreases by one, and the number of the third 
color increases by one. That means they all change parity, or evenness and oddness, 
at the same time. Right now all three piles are odd, 
but you get to add an egg to one color, which means that it’ll be even 
and the other two will be odd. Whichever color you choose will always be the opposite parity 
of the other two piles: odd when they’re even and 
even when they’re odd, since every egg fusion flips each pile’s 
parity simultaneously. We want to end with 1 blue, 0 purple,
and 0 red eggs, or odd, even, even. That means we want the blue egg pile 
to be the opposite parity of the other two piles 
at the start as well. So you add a blue egg into the room, and 99 egg fusions later, only a single blue egg remains. The Cuddly that hatches is sure to make 
your 6-year-old as happy as can be. Just be sure to follow the 
shopkeeper’s warning, and never feed it after midnight.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: If two eggs fuse, what happens to the number of eggs of each color? 

However, the options provided in Question 3 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a question that directly asks about the process of egg fusion and provides options that describe the combination of eggs.

A closer match is Question 1, but it asks about the name of the process, not what happens during the process.

Considering the provided options, the closest match is Question 3, but it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose an index, I would say:

Index: 3 

However, please note that this is not a perfect match. A more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about the combination of eggs during the egg fusion process.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that none of them perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible modification to Question 3 to make it more similar to the ground truth MCQ:

Modified Question 3: What happens during the egg fusion process?
Options: A. Two eggs of the same color combine., B. Two eggs of different colors combine., C. Three eggs fuse into a single egg., D. One egg splits into 10 pieces.

This modified question would be a more accurate match to the ground truth MCQ. However, since this is not among the original generated MCQs, I will stick with my initial answer:

**Transcript**:
For your son’s sixth birthday, you’ve promised to get him the cutest 
creature in creation: the cuddly. It’s hard to believe that it’s a cousin of
the terrifying duddly or the hideous fuddly. They’re all members of the Wuddly species, and the process of adopting 
them is deeply peculiar. It takes 100 eggs to make a single 
animal in genus Wuddly. When 100 eggs are placed together 
in an incubator, they undergo egg fusion, and combine 
in the following way. Blue and purple combine to make red eggs. Red and blue combine to make purple eggs, and red and purple 
combine to make blue eggs. The most plentiful eggs pair up first, and if two piles are even, an egg comes from one of them at random. They keep combining until 
there’s just one left. If the final egg is blue, a Cuddly hatches out of it. Purple eggs give you Duddlies, and Red eggs give you Fuddlies. The incubator currently has 99 eggs in it. 23 are blue, 33 are purple, 
and 43 are red. You can begin the process of egg fusion
by adding an egg of any color to the room. When all the eggs have combined
into a single egg, the creature that hatches will bond 
with you on sight, which is why getting a Cuddly 
is so important. After all, you made a promise to your son. Which color egg should you add 
to the incubator to get a cuddly? Pause the video to figure it out 
for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It’s easy to get mixed up with all the
cuddlies, duddlies, and fuddlies coming from different colored eggs. If we ignore how many total eggs
of each color there are, and just look at the 
process of egg fusion, we might notice something that 
will make this problem simpler. When two eggs fuse, the number of eggs of each of those 
colors decreases by one, and the number of the third 
color increases by one. That means they all change parity, or evenness and oddness, 
at the same time. Right now all three piles are odd, 
but you get to add an egg to one color, which means that it’ll be even 
and the other two will be odd. Whichever color you choose will always be the opposite parity 
of the other two piles: odd when they’re even and 
even when they’re odd, since every egg fusion flips each pile’s 
parity simultaneously. We want to end with 1 blue, 0 purple,
and 0 red eggs, or odd, even, even. That means we want the blue egg pile 
to be the opposite parity of the other two piles 
at the start as well. So you add a blue egg into the room, and 99 egg fusions later, only a single blue egg remains. The Cuddly that hatches is sure to make 
your 6-year-old as happy as can be. Just be sure to follow the 
shopkeeper’s warning, and never feed it after midnight.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
This is the 13th hole at Augusta National Golf Club. And to reach it, you have to hit a series of shots around the corner from the tee. One to get down the fairway, and a few more to get around the corner and onto the green. But not if you're Bubba Watson. "Bubba Watson with a driver." At the 2014 Masters Tournament, he did something remarkable. His drive sliced left, and into the woods, looking like a huge mistake. Until the announcers realized what Bubba was up to. That ball flew far enough to go over the trees and land right in front of the green. Bubba cut the corner. And that shot helped him win the tournament. But it also showed that golf might have a problem. Players like Bubba might be hitting the ball too far. Bernhard Langer is a pro golfer who had an average drive of 280 yards in 2018. That's 20 yards farther than what he was hitting when he was 30. And that jump is part of a much bigger trend. Since 1980, the average driving distance on the PGA Pro Tour has climbed over 30 yards. So the question is, what's causing this rise? The truth is, there are a lot of reasons why golfers are hitting the ball farther. They're stronger, their clubs are high-tech, and the courses are in better condition. But while all of these factors have had an effect, one particular thing has become a focus of conversation: The earliest golf balls were, likely, wooden, or "Hairies," made with stitched fabric filled with...hair. Then came "Featheries," made from leather filled with...feathers. And later, "Gutties," made with ...  Maybe you've never heard of the gutta percha, a tropical tree species that provided the sap used to make gutty balls. Playing Gutties, golfers noticed that their older balls,  the ones beaten up with nicks and scratches, were flying farther than the new ones. So they started carving designs into Gutties to get more distance. And, experimenting with different patterns, golfers realized that dimples work best. Dimpled balls fly farther because air, coming into contact with an uneven surface, creates a protective layer of turbulence around the golf ball. And that creates a smaller wake, that has less drag on the ball. But remember this chart? Dimples were around way before this line started rising, so they don't really explain what's going on here. And I mean right here. See this jump? It's the steepest part of this trendline. Something caused this, and it wasn't dimples. It was this: The golf ball that revolutionized the sport. I know what you're thinking — this looks like any other golf ball. But not when you look on the inside. So, for about 100 years before the Pro V1, the standard golf ball had been a "wound ball." The inside is a rubber band, wound around a core, and sometimes filled with liquid, which you can see if you cut one open, like golfer Rick Shiels. But cutting open a Pro V1, you can see what makes this ball different. It's the solid, multi-layered core.  Before the Pro V1 and balls like it, players had to choose: between a solid-core ball that's good for distance, or a wound ball that's better for accuracy. But a multi-layered ball can do both. Its rigid core helps it fly far for distance, and the flexible outer layers allow a golfer to control spin when hitting closer to the hole. Before 2000, nearly all players hit wound balls. But afterwards, nearly all pro players in the US Open had switched to hitting solid multi-layer balls like the Pro V1. And that year was the year that the average driving distance shot up six yards. "Unusual and concerning" is how a 2017 report described the rise in driving distance for professional players. Hitting the ball too far means golfers can fly the ball over obstacles designed to make the game difficult. And that's making some courses obsolete. Especially older ones, like Oakmont Country Club, where holes designed in another era are being overpowered by modern players. Now, officials are considering what they can do to limit distance. Making golf balls bigger would increase drag, and a heavier ball would fall out of the air more quickly. But adjusting dimpling, or rolling back innovations that made the Pro V1 successful, like layering and materials, could also reduce the flight of golf balls, and solve the problem. However, not everyone's happy about this idea. "We own our manufacturing process, we own our technology, and we own our responsibility to the end-user." As this epic marketing video shows, Titleist invests a lot in making golf balls. And for ball manufacturers, any little change to production would cost them a lot of money. But they probably shouldn't be too worried. The truth is, golf has been having a version of this debate for nearly a hundred years, and nothing's been settled yet. Debating the flight of the ball started a long time ago, with people asking "does it go too far?" as far back as 1936. And in the end, maybe it just doesn't even matter. Remember the 13th hole at Augusta? That got fixed. The club just bought the land behind the tee box, in order to pull it back, and make it farther to hit a drive over the corner. No matter what kind of ball you use.

Remember the 13th hole at Augusta? That got fixed. The club just bought the land behind the tee box, in order to pull it back, and make it farther to hit a drive over the corner. No matter what kind of ball you use.

**Transcript**:
This is the 13th hole at Augusta National Golf Club. And to reach it, you have to hit a series of shots around the corner from the tee. One to get down the fairway, and a few more to get around the corner and onto the green. But not if you're Bubba Watson. "Bubba Watson with a driver." At the 2014 Masters Tournament, he did something remarkable. His drive sliced left, and into the woods, looking like a huge mistake. Until the announcers realized what Bubba was up to. That ball flew far enough to go over the trees and land right in front of the green. Bubba cut the corner. And that shot helped him win the tournament. But it also showed that golf might have a problem. Players like Bubba might be hitting the ball too far. Bernhard Langer is a pro golfer who had an average drive of 280 yards in 2018. That's 20 yards farther than what he was hitting when he was 30. And that jump is part of a much bigger trend. Since 1980, the average driving distance on the PGA Pro Tour has climbed over 30 yards. So the question is, what's causing this rise? The truth is, there are a lot of reasons why golfers are hitting the ball farther. They're stronger, their clubs are high-tech, and the courses are in better condition. But while all of these factors have had an effect, one particular thing has become a focus of conversation: The earliest golf balls were, likely, wooden, or "Hairies," made with stitched fabric filled with...hair. Then came "Featheries," made from leather filled with...feathers. And later, "Gutties," made with ...  Maybe you've never heard of the gutta percha, a tropical tree species that provided the sap used to make gutty balls. Playing Gutties, golfers noticed that their older balls,  the ones beaten up with nicks and scratches, were flying farther than the new ones. So they started carving designs into Gutties to get more distance. And, experimenting with different patterns, golfers realized that dimples work best. Dimpled balls fly farther because air, coming into contact with an uneven surface, creates a protective layer of turbulence around the golf ball. And that creates a smaller wake, that has less drag on the ball. But remember this chart? Dimples were around way before this line started rising, so they don't really explain what's going on here. And I mean right here. See this jump? It's the steepest part of this trendline. Something caused this, and it wasn't dimples. It was this: The golf ball that revolutionized the sport. I know what you're thinking — this looks like any other golf ball. But not when you look on the inside. So, for about 100 years before the Pro V1, the standard golf ball had been a "wound ball." The inside is a rubber band, wound around a core, and sometimes filled with liquid, which you can see if you cut one open, like golfer Rick Shiels. But cutting open a Pro V1, you can see what makes this ball different. It's the solid, multi-layered core.  Before the Pro V1 and balls like it, players had to choose: between a solid-core ball that's good for distance, or a wound ball that's better for accuracy. But a multi-layered ball can do both. Its rigid core helps it fly far for distance, and the flexible outer layers allow a golfer to control spin when hitting closer to the hole. Before 2000, nearly all players hit wound balls. But afterwards, nearly all pro players in the US Open had switched to hitting solid multi-layer balls like the Pro V1. And that year was the year that the average driving distance shot up six yards. "Unusual and concerning" is how a 2017 report described the rise in driving distance for professional players. Hitting the ball too far means golfers can fly the ball over obstacles designed to make the game difficult. And that's making some courses obsolete. Especially older ones, like Oakmont Country Club, where holes designed in another era are being overpowered by modern players. Now, officials are considering what they can do to limit distance. Making golf balls bigger would increase drag, and a heavier ball would fall out of the air more quickly. But adjusting dimpling, or rolling back innovations that made the Pro V1 successful, like layering and materials, could also reduce the flight of golf balls, and solve the problem. However, not everyone's happy about this idea. "We own our manufacturing process, we own our technology, and we own our responsibility to the end-user." As this epic marketing video shows, Titleist invests a lot in making golf balls. And for ball manufacturers, any little change to production would cost them a lot of money. But they probably shouldn't be too worried. The truth is, golf has been having a version of this debate for nearly a hundred years, and nothing's been settled yet. Debating the flight of the ball started a long time ago, with people asking "does it go too far?" as far back as 1936. And in the end, maybe it just doesn't even matter.

**Transcript**:
A rabbit attempts to play a church organ, while a knight fights a giant snail and a naked man blows a trumpet 
with his rear end. Painted with squirrel-hair brushes 
on vellum or parchment by monks, nuns, and urban craftspeople, these bizarre images populate the 
margins of the most prized books from the Middle Ages. Their illustrations often tell a second 
story as rich as the text itself. Some images appear in many 
different illuminated manuscripts, and often reinforce the religious 
content of the books they decorated. For example, a porcupine picking 
up fruit on its spines could represent the devil stealing 
the fruits of faith-- or Christ taking up the sins of mankind. Medieval lore stated that a hunter 
could only capture a unicorn when it lay its horn in 
the lap of a virgin, so a unicorn could symbolize 
either sexual temptation or Christ being captured by his enemies. Rabbits, meanwhile, could represent 
human’s lustful natures— and could redeem themselves through 
attempts to make sacred music despite their failings. All of these references would have 
been familiar to medieval Europeans from other art forms and oral tradition, though some have grown more 
mysterious over the centuries. Today, no one can say for sure what the common 
motif of a knight fighting a snail means— or why the knight so often 
appears to be losing. The snail might be a symbol of the 
inevitability of death, which defeats even the strongest knights. Or it could represent humility, and a 
knight’s need to vanquish his own pride. Many illuminated manuscripts were 
copies of religious or classical texts, and the bookmakers incorporated their 
own ideas and opinions in illustrations. The butt tuba, for example, was likely shorthand to 
express disapproval with-- or add an ironic spin to--
the action in the text. Illuminations could also be used to 
make subversive political commentary. The text of the "Smithfield Decretals" details the Church’s laws and 
punishments for lawbreakers. But the margins show a fox being 
hanged by geese, a possible allusion to the common people 
turning on their powerful oppressors. In the "Chronica Majora," Matthew Paris summarized a 
scandal of his day, in which the Welsh prince Griffin plummeted to his death 
from the tower of London. Some believed the prince fell, 
Paris wrote, while others thought he was pushed. He added his own take in the margins, which show the prince falling to his death while trying to escape on a rope 
made of bed-sheets. Some margins told stories of 
a more personal nature. "The Luttrell Psalter," a book of psalms and prayers commissioned 
by Sir Geoffrey Luttrell, shows a young woman having her hair done, while a young man catches a bird in a net. The shaved patch on his 
head is growing out, indicating that he is a clergyman 
neglecting his duties. This alludes to a family scandal where a young cleric ran away with Sir 
Geoffrey’s daughter Elizabeth. The family’s personal spiritual advisor 
likely painted it into the book to remind his clients of their failings and encourage their spiritual development. Some artists even painted themselves 
into the manuscripts. The opening image of Christine de 
Pisan’s collected works shows de Pisan presenting 
the book to the Queen of France. The queen was so impressed by de Pisan's 
previous work that she commissioned her own copy. Such royal patronage enabled her to establish her own 
publishing house in Paris. The tradition of illuminated manuscripts 
lasted for over a thousand years. The books were created by individuals or 
teams for uses as wide-ranging as private prayer aids, service books 
in churches, textbooks, and protective talismans to 
take into battle. Across all this variation, those tricky little drawings 
in the margins are a unique window into the 
minds of medieval artists.

on vellum or parchment by monks, nuns, and urban craftspeople, these bizarre images populate the 
margins of the most prized books from the Middle Ages. Their illustrations often tell a second 
story as rich as the text itself. Some images appear in many 
different illuminated manuscripts, and often reinforce the religious 
content of the books they decorated. For example, a porcupine picking 
up fruit on its spines could represent the devil stealing 
the fruits of faith-- or Christ taking up the sins of mankind. Medieval lore stated that a hunter 
could only capture a unicorn when it lay its horn in 
the lap of a virgin, so a unicorn could symbolize 
either sexual temptation or Christ being captured by his enemies. Rabbits, meanwhile, could represent 
human’s lustful natures— and could redeem themselves through 
attempts to make sacred music despite their failings. All of these references would have 
been familiar to medieval Europeans from other art forms and oral tradition, though some have grown more 
mysterious over the centuries. Today, no one can say for sure what the common 
motif of a knight fighting a snail means— or why the knight so often 
appears to be losing. The snail might be a symbol of the 
inevitability of death, which defeats even the strongest knights. Or it could represent humility, and a 
knight’s need to vanquish his own pride. Many illuminated manuscripts were 
copies of religious or classical texts, and the bookmakers incorporated their 
own ideas and opinions in illustrations. The butt tuba, for example, was likely shorthand to 
express disapproval with-- or add an ironic spin to--
the action in the text. Illuminations could also be used to 
make subversive political commentary. The text of the "Smithfield Decretals" details the Church’s laws and 
punishments for lawbreakers. But the margins show a fox being 
hanged by geese, a possible allusion to the common people 
turning on their powerful oppressors. In the "Chronica Majora," Matthew Paris summarized a 
scandal of his day, in which the Welsh prince Griffin plummeted to his death 
from the tower of London. Some believed the prince fell, 
Paris wrote, while others thought he was pushed. He added his own take in the margins, which show the prince falling to his death while trying to escape on a rope 
made of bed-sheets. Some margins told stories of 
a more personal nature. "The Luttrell Psalter," a book of psalms and prayers commissioned 
by Sir Geoffrey Luttrell, shows a young woman having her hair done, while a young man catches a bird in a net. The shaved patch on his 
head is growing out, indicating that he is a clergyman 
neglecting his duties. This alludes to a family scandal where a young cleric ran away with Sir 
Geoffrey’s daughter Elizabeth. The family’s personal spiritual advisor 
likely painted it into the book to remind his clients of their failings and encourage their spiritual development. Some artists even painted themselves 
into the manuscripts. The opening image of Christine de 
Pisan’s collected works shows de Pisan presenting 
the book to the Queen of France. The queen was so impressed by de Pisan's 
previous work that she commissioned her own copy. Such royal patronage enabled her to establish her own 
publishing house in Paris. The tradition of illuminated manuscripts 
lasted for over a thousand years. The books were created by individuals or 
teams for uses as wide-ranging as private prayer aids, service books 
in churches, textbooks, and protective talismans to 
take into battle. Across all this variation, those tricky little drawings 
in the margins are a unique window into the 
minds of medieval artists.

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only mentions one of the animals (snail) and does not provide an option that includes all the animals mentioned in the ground truth MCQ (monkeys are not mentioned in the transcript, but rabbits and snails are).

A more similar question would be one that asks about the types of animals found in the margins of manuscripts, but such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

Although the question content is not identical, both questions relate to the ownership and purpose of illuminated manuscripts. The ground truth MCQ asks about the ownership of illuminated manuscripts, while Question 9 asks about their purpose. However, the correct option for Question 9 (C. To serve as private prayer aids, service books in churches, textbooks, and protective talismans) implies that illuminated manuscripts were used by a wide range of people, which aligns with the correct option for the ground truth MCQ (C. Everyone except peasants).

The other generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ as closely, as they focus on specific aspects of illuminated manuscripts, such as the materials used to create them, the meaning of certain images, or the purposes of specific manuscripts.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 9.

You’re on an airplane 
when you feel a sudden jolt. Outside your window nothing 
seems to be happening, yet the plane continues to rattle 
you and your fellow passengers as it passes through turbulent air
in the atmosphere. Although it may not comfort 
you to hear it, this phenomenon is one of the 
prevailing mysteries of physics. After more than a century 
of studying turbulence, we’ve only come up with a few 
answers for how it works and affects the world around us. And yet, turbulence is ubiquitous, springing up in virtually any system 
that has moving fluids. That includes the airflow 
in your respiratory tract. The blood moving through your arteries. And the coffee in your cup, 
as you stir it. Clouds are governed by turbulence, as are waves crashing along the shore 
and the gusts of plasma in our sun. Understanding precisely how this 
phenomenon works would have a bearing on so many 
aspects of our lives. Here’s what we do know. Liquids and gases usually have 
two types of motion: a laminar flow, which is stable 
and smooth; and a turbulent flow, which is composed 
of seemingly unorganized swirls. Imagine an incense stick. The laminar flow of unruffled smoke 
at the base is steady and easy to predict. Closer to the top, however, the smoke accelerates, becomes unstable, and the pattern of movement changes
to something chaotic. That’s turbulence in action, and turbulent flows have certain
characteristics in common. Firstly, turbulence is always chaotic. That’s different from being random. Rather, this means that turbulence 
is very sensitive to disruptions. A little nudge one way or the other will eventually turn into 
completely different results. That makes it nearly impossible 
to predict what will happen, even with a lot of information 
about the current state of a system. Another important characteristic of 
turbulence is the different scales of motion 
that these flows display. Turbulent flows have many 
differently-sized whirls called eddies, which are like vortices of 
different sizes and shapes. All those differently-sized eddies 
interact with each other, breaking up to become smaller and smaller until all that movement is 
transformed into heat, in a process called the “energy cascade." So that’s how we recognize turbulence– but why does it happen? In every flowing liquid or gas there 
are two opposing forces: inertia and viscosity. Inertia is the tendency of fluids 
to keep moving, which causes instability. Viscosity works against disruption, making the flow laminar instead. In thick fluids such as honey, viscosity almost always wins. Less viscous substances like water or air 
are more prone to inertia, which creates instabilities that 
develop into turbulence. We measure where a flow falls 
on that spectrum with something called the Reynolds number, which is the ratio between a flow’s 
inertia and its viscosity. The higher the Reynolds number, the more likely it is that 
turbulence will occur. Honey being poured into a cup, 
for example, has a Reynolds number of about 1. The same set up with water has a Reynolds 
number that’s closer to 10,000. The Reynolds number is useful for 
understanding simple scenarios, but it’s ineffective in many situations. For example, the motion of the atmosphere
is significantly influenced by factors including gravity and the 
earth’s rotation. Or take relatively simple things 
like the drag on buildings and cars. We can model those thanks to many 
experiments and empirical evidence. But physicists want to be able to predict 
them through physical laws and equations as well as we can model the orbits 
of planets or electromagnetic fields. Most scientists think that getting there 
will rely on statistics and increased computing power. Extremely high-speed computer simulations 
of turbulent flows could help us identify patterns that could
lead to a theory that organizes and unifies predictions
across different situations. Other scientists think that the phenomenon
is so complex that such a full-fledged theory 
isn’t ever going to be possible. Hopefully we’ll reach a breakthrough, because a true understanding of turbulence
could have huge positive impacts. That would include more 
efficient wind farms; the ability to better prepare for 
catastrophic weather events; or even the power to manipulate 
hurricanes away. And, of course, smoother rides 
for millions of airline passengers.

to predict what will happen, even with a lot of information 
about the current state of a system. Another important characteristic of 
turbulence is the different scales of motion 
that these flows display. Turbulent flows have many 
differently-sized whirls called eddies, which are like vortices of 
different sizes and shapes. All those differently-sized eddies 
interact with each other, breaking up to become smaller and smaller until all that movement is 
transformed into heat, in a process called the “energy cascade." So that’s how we recognize turbulence– but why does it happen? In every flowing liquid or gas there 
are two opposing forces: inertia and viscosity. Inertia is the tendency of fluids 
to keep moving, which causes instability. Viscosity works against disruption, making the flow laminar instead. In thick fluids such as honey, viscosity almost always wins. Less viscous substances like water or air 
are more prone to inertia, which creates instabilities that 
develop into turbulence. We measure where a flow falls 
on that spectrum with something called the Reynolds number, which is the ratio between a flow’s 
inertia and its viscosity. The higher the Reynolds number, the more likely it is that 
turbulence will occur. Honey being poured into a cup, 
for example, has a Reynolds number of about 1. The same set up with water has a Reynolds 
number that’s closer to 10,000. The Reynolds number is useful for 
understanding simple scenarios, but it’s ineffective in many situations. For example, the motion of the atmosphere
is significantly influenced by factors including gravity and the 
earth’s rotation. Or take relatively simple things 
like the drag on buildings and cars. We can model those thanks to many 
experiments and empirical evidence. But physicists want to be able to predict 
them through physical laws and equations as well as we can model the orbits 
of planets or electromagnetic fields. Most scientists think that getting there 
will rely on statistics and increased computing power. Extremely high-speed computer simulations 
of turbulent flows could help us identify patterns that could
lead to a theory that organizes and unifies predictions
across different situations. Other scientists think that the phenomenon
is so complex that such a full-fledged theory 
isn’t ever going to be possible. Hopefully we’ll reach a breakthrough, because a true understanding of turbulence
could have huge positive impacts. That would include more 
efficient wind farms; the ability to better prepare for 
catastrophic weather events; or even the power to manipulate 
hurricanes away. And, of course, smoother rides 
for millions of airline passengers.

**Transcript**:
Little do they know it, but these six creatures are each about to
experience a very unusual death. One-by-one, they will fall prey to the remarkable, 
predatory antics of... a carnivorous plant. Around the world there are more than 
600 plant species that supplement a regular 
diet of sunlight, water, and soil with insects, microbes, 
or even frogs and rats. Scientists believe that carnivory in 
plants evolved separately at least six times on our planet, suggesting that this flesh-munching 
adaptation holds a major benefit for plants. Carnivorous plants tend to grow in places 
with highly acidic soil, which is poor in crucial nutrients 
like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. In these hostile conditions, plants that are able to lure, trap, 
and digest prey have an advantage over those that rely 
on soil for their nutrients. Take this inhospitable bog, where pitcher plants reign supreme. Drawn to the pitcher’s vivid colors 
and alluring scent, the fly closes in and slurps its nectar. But this pitcher species has an ingredient
called coniine in its nectar, a powerful narcotic to insects. As the coniine takes effect, the fly grows sluggish, stumbles, 
and falls down the funnel into a pool of liquid at the base, where he drowns. Enzymes and bacteria in the liquid slowly
break his body down into microscopic particles the pitcher 
plant can consume through its leaves. Occasionally, larger prey also tumbles into the 
fatal funnel of the pitcher plant. The second victim faces off with the 
sticky sundew plant. The sundew’s tiny leaves are equipped with
a viscous secretion called mucilage. The ant is swiftly trapped in this goo. As she struggles, enzymes begin 
to digest her body. Special tentacles sense her movement 
and curl around her, clenching her in their suffocating grip. Once she asphyxiates, which can happen in under an hour, the tentacles unfurl again 
to snare their next victim. Two down, four to go. The next target meets his end underground, in the coils of the corkscrew plant. He enters the roots through a tiny slit
in search of food. But inside, he quickly loses his way 
through the tangled labyrinth. A forest of curved hairs 
prevents his escape, guiding him into a central chamber
with flesh-digesting enzymes and deadly low levels of oxygen. In the murky depths of a nearby pond, a tadpole unwittingly swims into the path
of the bladderwort, the speediest of all carnivorous plants. She treads on the bladderwort’s trigger, and in milliseconds, a trapdoor swings open and sucks her in. Trapped half in and half out, she struggles to free herself while the part of her body inside 
the plant gets digested. Over the next few hours, her writhing sets the trap off repeatedly, each time bringing her deeper 
into the plant to be digested alive bit by bit. Meanwhile, this beetle is bewitched by 
sweet-smelling nectar. The scent draws him closer and closer until he lands on the leaves of the 
world’s most infamous carnivorous plant. His landing triggers tiny hairs on the 
surface of the leaves, and the jaws of the venus fly trap 
snap shut around him. The spikes interlock to seal his fate. Once closed, the leaves act like an external stomach
that digests the beetle’s soft tissues. When they open again a few days later, only the dry husk of his 
exoskeleton remains. The mayfly is the last creature standing. As she approaches the butterwort plant, she heads for the flowers that wave high
above the plant’s globs of adhesive goo. She alights on the petals, drinks the 
nectar, and takes off unscathed. These long flower stalks keep certain 
insects away from the carnivore’s traps— a way of separating pollinators from food. Off the mayfly buzzes 
to live a long and fruitful life– oh.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

This question is about the bladderwort plant's capture mechanism, which is the same topic as the ground truth MCQ. The correct option in Question 7 (D. By using a high-speed camera to record the bladderwort's capture mechanism) mentions the bladderwort's capture mechanism, which is a trapdoor that swings open and sucks in prey, as described in the transcript. This matches the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (B. Trap door). 

While Question 7 does not directly ask about the type of trapping method employed by bladderworts, it is the closest match among the generated MCQs in terms of content and intent.

**Transcript**:
Little do they know it, but these six creatures are each about to
experience a very unusual death. One-by-one, they will fall prey to the remarkable, 
predatory antics of... a carnivorous plant. Around the world there are more than 
600 plant species that supplement a regular 
diet of sunlight, water, and soil with insects, microbes, 
or even frogs and rats. Scientists believe that carnivory in 
plants evolved separately at least six times on our planet, suggesting that this flesh-munching 
adaptation holds a major benefit for plants. Carnivorous plants tend to grow in places 
with highly acidic soil, which is poor in crucial nutrients 
like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. In these hostile conditions, plants that are able to lure, trap, 
and digest prey have an advantage over those that rely 
on soil for their nutrients. Take this inhospitable bog, where pitcher plants reign supreme. Drawn to the pitcher’s vivid colors 
and alluring scent, the fly closes in and slurps its nectar. But this pitcher species has an ingredient
called coniine in its nectar, a powerful narcotic to insects. As the coniine takes effect, the fly grows sluggish, stumbles, 
and falls down the funnel into a pool of liquid at the base, where he drowns. Enzymes and bacteria in the liquid slowly
break his body down into microscopic particles the pitcher 
plant can consume through its leaves. Occasionally, larger prey also tumbles into the 
fatal funnel of the pitcher plant. The second victim faces off with the 
sticky sundew plant. The sundew’s tiny leaves are equipped with
a viscous secretion called mucilage. The ant is swiftly trapped in this goo. As she struggles, enzymes begin 
to digest her body. Special tentacles sense her movement 
and curl around her, clenching her in their suffocating grip. Once she asphyxiates, which can happen in under an hour, the tentacles unfurl again 
to snare their next victim. Two down, four to go. The next target meets his end underground, in the coils of the corkscrew plant. He enters the roots through a tiny slit
in search of food. But inside, he quickly loses his way 
through the tangled labyrinth. A forest of curved hairs 
prevents his escape, guiding him into a central chamber
with flesh-digesting enzymes and deadly low levels of oxygen. In the murky depths of a nearby pond, a tadpole unwittingly swims into the path
of the bladderwort, the speediest of all carnivorous plants. She treads on the bladderwort’s trigger, and in milliseconds, a trapdoor swings open and sucks her in. Trapped half in and half out, she struggles to free herself while the part of her body inside 
the plant gets digested. Over the next few hours, her writhing sets the trap off repeatedly, each time bringing her deeper 
into the plant to be digested alive bit by bit. Meanwhile, this beetle is bewitched by 
sweet-smelling nectar. The scent draws him closer and closer until he lands on the leaves of the 
world’s most infamous carnivorous plant. His landing triggers tiny hairs on the 
surface of the leaves, and the jaws of the venus fly trap 
snap shut around him. The spikes interlock to seal his fate. Once closed, the leaves act like an external stomach
that digests the beetle’s soft tissues. When they open again a few days later, only the dry husk of his 
exoskeleton remains. The mayfly is the last creature standing. As she approaches the butterwort plant, she heads for the flowers that wave high
above the plant’s globs of adhesive goo. She alights on the petals, drinks the 
nectar, and takes off unscathed. These long flower stalks keep certain 
insects away from the carnivore’s traps— a way of separating pollinators from food. Off the mayfly buzzes 
to live a long and fruitful life– oh.

**Transcript**:
In 2004, a new company called Vemma Nutrition started offering a life-changing 
opportunity to earn full time income 
for part time work. Vemma’s offer was open to everybody, regardless of prior experience 
or education. There were only two steps to start 
get started earning: purchase a $500-600 kit 
of their liquid nutrition products, and recruit two more members 
to do the same. Vemma Nutrition Company grew quickly, becoming a global operation that brought in 30,000 new members 
per month at its peak. There was just one problem— while the company generated $200 million
of annual revenue by 2013, the vast majority of participants 
earned less than they paid in. Vemma was eventually charged with 
operating a pyramid scheme: a common type of fraud where members make money by recruiting more people to buy in. Typically, the founder solicits an initial
group of people to buy in and promote the scheme. They are then encouraged to recruit others and promised part of the money 
those people invest, while the founder also takes a share. The pattern repeats for each group 
of new participants, with money from recent arrivals funneled 
to those who recruited them. This differs from a Ponzi scheme, where the founders recruit new members and secretly use their fees to 
pay existing members, who think the payments come 
from a legitimate investment. As a pyramid scheme grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for new 
recruits to make money. That’s because the number of participants
expands exponentially. Take a structure where each person has 
to recruit six more to earn a profit. The founder recruits six people to start, and each of them recruits six more. There are 36 people in that second
round of recruits, who then each recruit 6 people— a total of 216 new recruits. By the twelfth round of recruiting, the 2.1 billion newest members 
would have to recruit over 13 billion more people total 
to make money– more than the entire world population. In this scenario, the most recent recruits, over 80% of the scheme’s participants, lose all the money they paid in. And in real life, many earlier joiners lose out too. Pyramid schemes are illegal 
in most countries, but they can be difficult to detect. They are presented as many 
different things, including gifting groups, investment clubs, and multi-level 
marketing businesses. The distinction between pyramid schemes 
and legitimate multi-level marketing can be particularly hazy. In theory, the difference is that the members of the multi-level 
marketing companies primarily earn compensation from selling
a particular product or a service to retail customers, while pyramid schemes primarily compensate
members for recruitment of new sellers. In practice, though, many multi-level marketing companies make 
it all but impossible for members to profit purely 
through sales. And many pyramid schemes, 
like Vemma Nutrition, disguise themselves as legal multi-level
marketing businesses, using a product or service to hide the
pay-and-recruit structure. Many pyramid schemes also capitalize 
on already existing trust within churches, immigrant communities, 
or other tightly knit groups. The first few members are encouraged 
to report a good experience before they actually start 
making a profit. Others in their network follow 
their example, and the schemes balloon in size before it comes clear that most members
aren’t actually profiting. Often, the victims are 
embarrassed into silence. Pyramid schemes entice people with the
promise of opportunity and empowerment. So when members don’t end up making money, they can blame themselves 
rather than the scheme, thinking they weren’t tenacious enough 
to earn the returns promised. Some victims keep trying, investing in multiple schemes, and losing money each time. In spite of all these factors, there are ways to spot a pyramid scheme. Time pressure is one red flag— be wary of directives to “act now or 
miss a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” Promises of large, life-altering
amounts of income are also suspect. And finally, a legitimate multi-level 
marketing business shouldn’t require members to pay for the
opportunity to sell a product or service. Pyramid schemes can be incredibly 
destructive to individuals, communities, and even entire countries. But you can fight fire with fire by sending this video to three 
people you know, and encouraging them to do the same.

to earn the returns promised. Some victims keep trying, investing in multiple schemes, and losing money each time. In spite of all these factors, there are ways to spot a pyramid scheme. Time pressure is one red flag— be wary of directives to “act now or 
miss a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” Promises of large, life-altering
amounts of income are also suspect. And finally, a legitimate multi-level 
marketing business shouldn’t require members to pay for the
opportunity to sell a product or service. Pyramid schemes can be incredibly 
destructive to individuals, communities, and even entire countries. But you can fight fire with fire by sending this video to three

**Transcript**:
In 2004, a new company called Vemma Nutrition started offering a life-changing 
opportunity to earn full time income 
for part time work. Vemma’s offer was open to everybody, regardless of prior experience 
or education. There were only two steps to start 
get started earning: purchase a $500-600 kit 
of their liquid nutrition products, and recruit two more members 
to do the same. Vemma Nutrition Company grew quickly, becoming a global operation that brought in 30,000 new members 
per month at its peak. There was just one problem— while the company generated $200 million
of annual revenue by 2013, the vast majority of participants 
earned less than they paid in. Vemma was eventually charged with 
operating a pyramid scheme: a common type of fraud where members make money by recruiting more people to buy in. Typically, the founder solicits an initial
group of people to buy in and promote the scheme. They are then encouraged to recruit others and promised part of the money 
those people invest, while the founder also takes a share. The pattern repeats for each group 
of new participants, with money from recent arrivals funneled 
to those who recruited them. This differs from a Ponzi scheme, where the founders recruit new members and secretly use their fees to 
pay existing members, who think the payments come 
from a legitimate investment. As a pyramid scheme grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for new 
recruits to make money. That’s because the number of participants
expands exponentially. Take a structure where each person has 
to recruit six more to earn a profit. The founder recruits six people to start, and each of them recruits six more. There are 36 people in that second
round of recruits, who then each recruit 6 people— a total of 216 new recruits. By the twelfth round of recruiting, the 2.1 billion newest members 
would have to recruit over 13 billion more people total 
to make money– more than the entire world population. In this scenario, the most recent recruits, over 80% of the scheme’s participants, lose all the money they paid in. And in real life, many earlier joiners lose out too. Pyramid schemes are illegal 
in most countries, but they can be difficult to detect. They are presented as many 
different things, including gifting groups, investment clubs, and multi-level 
marketing businesses. The distinction between pyramid schemes 
and legitimate multi-level marketing can be particularly hazy. In theory, the difference is that the members of the multi-level 
marketing companies primarily earn compensation from selling
a particular product or a service to retail customers, while pyramid schemes primarily compensate
members for recruitment of new sellers. In practice, though, many multi-level marketing companies make 
it all but impossible for members to profit purely 
through sales. And many pyramid schemes, 
like Vemma Nutrition, disguise themselves as legal multi-level
marketing businesses, using a product or service to hide the
pay-and-recruit structure. Many pyramid schemes also capitalize 
on already existing trust within churches, immigrant communities, 
or other tightly knit groups. The first few members are encouraged 
to report a good experience before they actually start 
making a profit. Others in their network follow 
their example, and the schemes balloon in size before it comes clear that most members
aren’t actually profiting. Often, the victims are 
embarrassed into silence. Pyramid schemes entice people with the
promise of opportunity and empowerment. So when members don’t end up making money, they can blame themselves

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3: How does a pyramid scheme typically grow, and what happens to new recruits?**

Although this question does not directly ask about the level at which recruitment would exceed the world's population, it does address the concept of exponential growth in pyramid schemes, which is the underlying idea behind the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs do not specifically ask about the level at which recruitment would exceed the world's population.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, but I would like to emphasize that it's not a perfect match.

over 200,000 years ago, modern humans have established 
homes and communities all over the planet. But they didn’t do it alone. Whatever corner of the globe you find 
homo sapiens in today, you’re likely to find another 
species nearby: Canis lupus familiaris. Whether they’re herding, hunting, 
sledding, or slouching the sheer variety of domestic 
dogs is staggering. But what makes the story of man’s 
best friend so surprising is that they all evolved from a creature often seen as one of our oldest rivals: Canis lupus, or the gray wolf. When our Paleolithic ancestors first 
settled Eurasia roughly 100,000 years ago, wolves were one of their main rivals 
at the top of the food chain. Able to exert over 300 lbs. of pressure 
in one bone-crushing bite and sniff out prey more than a mile away, these formidable predators didn’t have 
much competition. Much like human hunter-gatherers, they lived and hunted 
in complex social groups consisting of a few nuclear families, and used their social skills to 
cooperatively take down larger creatures. Using these group tactics, they operated as effective 
persistence hunters, relying not on outrunning their prey, but pursuing it to the point 
of exhaustion. But when pitted against the similar
strengths of their invasive new neighbors, wolves found themselves at a crossroads. For most packs, these bourgeoning bipeds represented 
a serious threat to their territory. But for some wolves, especially those without a pack, human camps offered new opportunities. Wolves that showed less aggression
towards humans could come closer to their encampments, feeding on leftovers. And as these more docile scavengers 
outlasted their aggressive brethren, their genetic traits were passed on, gradually breeding tamer wolves
in areas near human populations. Over time humans found a multitude of uses
for these docile wolves. They helped to track and hunt prey, and might have served as sentinels
to guard camps and warn of approaching enemies. Their similar social structure made
it easy to integrate with human families and learn to understand their commands. Eventually they moved from the fringes 
of our communities into our homes, becoming humanity’s 
first domesticated animal. The earliest of these Proto-Dogs
or Wolf-Dogs, seem to have appeared around 
33,000 years ago, and would not have looked all that 
different from their wild cousins. They were primarily distinguished 
by their smaller size and a shorter snout full of 
comparatively smaller teeth. But as human cultures and occupations 
became more diverse and specialized, so did our friends. Short stocky dogs to herd livestock 
by nipping their heels; elongated dogs to flush badgers 
and foxes out of burrows; thin and sleek dogs for racing; and large, muscular dogs for guard duty. With the emergence of kennel clubs and 
dog shows during England’s Victorian era, these dog types were standardized 
into breeds, with many new ones bred 
purely for appearance. Sadly, while all dog breeds are the 
product of artificial selection, some are healthier than others. Many of these aesthetic characteristics 
come with congenital health problems, such as difficulty breathing 
or being prone to spinal injuries. Humanity’s longest experiment 
in controlled evolution has had other side effects as well. Generations of selection for tameness have favored more juvenile 
and submissive traits that were pleasing to humans. This phenomenon of selecting traits 
associated with youth is known as neoteny, and can be seen in many domestic animals. Thousands of years of co-evolution 
may even have bonded us chemically. Not only can canines understand 
our emotions and body language, but when dogs and humans interact, both our bodies release oxytocin; a hormone commonly associated with 
feelings of love and protectiveness. It might be difficult to fathom how every
Pomeranian, Chihuahua, and Poodle are descended from fierce wolves. But the diversity of breeds today 
is the result of a relationship that precedes cities, agriculture, and even the disappearance 
of our Neanderthal cousins. And it’s heartening to know that given enough time, even our most dangerous rivals 
can become our fiercest friends.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the classification of modern domestic dogs, and the correct answer is Canis lupus familiaris.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the most relevant, as it mentions the evolution of dogs from a creature often seen as one of our oldest rivals (Canis lupus). However, it does not directly ask about the classification of modern domestic dogs.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2. However, please note that it is not a perfect match.

It is not listed, but if I had to create a match from the provided generated MCQs I would rephrase Question 1 as follows:

What is the approximate time period when the earliest dogs or wolf-dogs seem to have appeared?
Options: A. Around 33,000 years ago, B. Over 100,000 years ago, C. Over 200,000 years ago, D. Over 500,000 years ago 

This rephrased question matches the ground truth MCQ. Since this rephrased question is not available among the generated MCQs, I will choose the generated MCQ that is closest to this rephrased question.

The closest generated MCQ is Question 1.

**Transcript**:
Since their emergence 
over 200,000 years ago, modern humans have established 
homes and communities all over the planet. But they didn’t do it alone. Whatever corner of the globe you find 
homo sapiens in today, you’re likely to find another 
species nearby: Canis lupus familiaris. Whether they’re herding, hunting, 
sledding, or slouching the sheer variety of domestic 
dogs is staggering. But what makes the story of man’s 
best friend so surprising is that they all evolved from a creature often seen as one of our oldest rivals: Canis lupus, or the gray wolf. When our Paleolithic ancestors first 
settled Eurasia roughly 100,000 years ago, wolves were one of their main rivals 
at the top of the food chain. Able to exert over 300 lbs. of pressure 
in one bone-crushing bite and sniff out prey more than a mile away, these formidable predators didn’t have 
much competition. Much like human hunter-gatherers, they lived and hunted 
in complex social groups consisting of a few nuclear families, and used their social skills to 
cooperatively take down larger creatures. Using these group tactics, they operated as effective 
persistence hunters, relying not on outrunning their prey, but pursuing it to the point 
of exhaustion. But when pitted against the similar
strengths of their invasive new neighbors, wolves found themselves at a crossroads. For most packs, these bourgeoning bipeds represented 
a serious threat to their territory. But for some wolves, especially those without a pack, human camps offered new opportunities. Wolves that showed less aggression
towards humans could come closer to their encampments, feeding on leftovers. And as these more docile scavengers 
outlasted their aggressive brethren, their genetic traits were passed on, gradually breeding tamer wolves
in areas near human populations. Over time humans found a multitude of uses
for these docile wolves. They helped to track and hunt prey, and might have served as sentinels
to guard camps and warn of approaching enemies. Their similar social structure made
it easy to integrate with human families and learn to understand their commands. Eventually they moved from the fringes 
of our communities into our homes, becoming humanity’s 
first domesticated animal. The earliest of these Proto-Dogs
or Wolf-Dogs, seem to have appeared around 
33,000 years ago, and would not have looked all that 
different from their wild cousins. They were primarily distinguished 
by their smaller size and a shorter snout full of 
comparatively smaller teeth. But as human cultures and occupations 
became more diverse and specialized, so did our friends. Short stocky dogs to herd livestock 
by nipping their heels; elongated dogs to flush badgers 
and foxes out of burrows; thin and sleek dogs for racing; and large, muscular dogs for guard duty. With the emergence of kennel clubs and 
dog shows during England’s Victorian era, these dog types were standardized 
into breeds, with many new ones bred 
purely for appearance. Sadly, while all dog breeds are the 
product of artificial selection, some are healthier than others. Many of these aesthetic characteristics 
come with congenital health problems, such as difficulty breathing 
or being prone to spinal injuries. Humanity’s longest experiment 
in controlled evolution has had other side effects as well. Generations of selection for tameness have favored more juvenile 
and submissive traits that were pleasing to humans. This phenomenon of selecting traits 
associated with youth is known as neoteny, and can be seen in many domestic animals. Thousands of years of co-evolution 
may even have bonded us chemically. Not only can canines understand 
our emotions and body language, but when dogs and humans interact, both our bodies release oxytocin; a hormone commonly associated with 
feelings of love and protectiveness. It might be difficult to fathom how every
Pomeranian, Chihuahua, and Poodle are descended from fierce wolves. But the diversity of breeds today 
is the result of a relationship that precedes cities, agriculture, and even the disappearance 
of our Neanderthal cousins. And it’s heartening to know that given enough time, even our most dangerous rivals 
can become our fiercest friends.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has some similarity with the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the historical era when most modern dog breeds started appearing. The correct answer is the Victorian Era.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 mentions the emergence of kennel clubs and dog shows during a certain time period, but it does not explicitly ask about the historical era. However, according to the transcript, kennel clubs and dog shows emerged during England's Victorian era, which is the same era mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

Although not a perfect match, I would suggest that Question 7 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it indirectly relates to the same time period and event (emergence of kennel clubs and dog shows) mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
From Shakespeare’s plays 
to modern TV dramas, the unscrupulous schemer for whom 
the ends always justify the means has become a familiar character type 
we love to hate. So familiar, in fact, that for centuries we’ve had a single word to describe 
such characters: Machiavellian. But is it possible that we’ve been using 
that word wrong this whole time? The early 16th century statesman Niccoló 
Machiavelli wrote many works of history, philosophy, 
and drama. But his lasting notoriety comes from a 
brief political essay known as The Prince, framed as advice to current 
and future monarchs. Machiavelli wasn’t the first to do this– in fact there was an entire tradition of 
works known as “mirrors for princes” going back to antiquity. But unlike his predecessors, Machiavelli didn’t try to describe an 
ideal government or exhort his audience to rule 
justly and virtuously. Instead, he focused on the 
question of power– how to acquire it, and how to keep it. And in the decades after it was published, The Prince gained a diabolical reputation. During the European Wars of Religion, both Catholics and Protestants 
blamed Machiavelli for inspiring acts of violence and tyranny
committed by their opponents. By the end of the century, Shakespeare was using “Machiavel” to 
denote an amoral opportunist, leading directly to our popular use of 
“Machiavellian” as a synonym for manipulative villainy. At first glance, The Prince’s reputation as a manual for 
tyranny seems well-deserved. Throughout, Machiavelli appears entirely 
unconcerned with morality, except insofar as it’s helpful or harmful 
to maintaining power. For instance, princes are told to 
consider all the atrocities necessary to seize power, and to commit them in a single stroke to ensure future stability. Attacking neighboring territories and 
oppressing religious minorities are mentioned as effective ways of 
occupying the public. Regarding a prince’s personal behavior, Machiavelli advises keeping up the 
appearance of virtues such as honesty or generosity, but being ready to abandon them as soon 
as one’s interests are threatened. Most famously, he notes that for a ruler, “it is much safer to be feared 
than loved.” The tract even ends with an appeal to 
Lorenzo de’ Medici, the recently installed ruler of Florence, urging him to unite the fragmented 
city-states of Italy under his rule. Many have justified Machiavelli as 
motivated by unsentimental realism and a desire for peace in an Italy torn by
internal and external conflict. According to this view, Machiavelli was the first to understand 
a difficult truth: the greater good of political stability is worth whatever unsavory tactics 
are needed to attain it. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin suggested 
that rather than being amoral, The Prince hearkens back to 
ancient Greek morality, placing the glory of the state above the 
Christian ideal of individual salvation. But what we know about Machiavelli might
not fit this picture. The author had served in his native 
Florence for 14 years as a diplomat, staunchly defending its elected 
republican government against would-be monarchs. When the Medici family seized power, he not only lost his position, but was even tortured and banished. With this in mind, it’s possible to read the pamphlet 
he wrote from exile not as a defense of princely rule, but a scathing description 
of how it operates. Indeed, Enlightenment figures like Spinoza saw it as warning free citizens of the various ways in which they can be
subjugated by aspiring rulers. In fact, both readings might be true. Machiavelli may have written a manual for 
tyrannical rulers, but by sharing it, he also revealed 
the cards to those who would be ruled. In doing so, he revolutionized political philosophy, laying the foundations for Hobbes and 
future thinkers to study human affairs based on their 
concrete realities rather than preconceived ideals. Through his brutal and shocking honesty, Machiavelli sought to shatter popular 
delusions about what power really entails. And as he wrote to a friend 
shortly before his death, he hoped that people would “learn the way 
to Hell in order to flee from it."

**Transcript**:
From Shakespeare’s plays 
to modern TV dramas, the unscrupulous schemer for whom 
the ends always justify the means has become a familiar character type 
we love to hate. So familiar, in fact, that for centuries we’ve had a single word to describe 
such characters: Machiavellian. But is it possible that we’ve been using 
that word wrong this whole time? The early 16th century statesman Niccoló 
Machiavelli wrote many works of history, philosophy, 
and drama. But his lasting notoriety comes from a 
brief political essay known as The Prince, framed as advice to current 
and future monarchs. Machiavelli wasn’t the first to do this– in fact there was an entire tradition of 
works known as “mirrors for princes” going back to antiquity. But unlike his predecessors, Machiavelli didn’t try to describe an 
ideal government or exhort his audience to rule 
justly and virtuously. Instead, he focused on the 
question of power– how to acquire it, and how to keep it. And in the decades after it was published, The Prince gained a diabolical reputation. During the European Wars of Religion, both Catholics and Protestants 
blamed Machiavelli for inspiring acts of violence and tyranny
committed by their opponents. By the end of the century, Shakespeare was using “Machiavel” to 
denote an amoral opportunist, leading directly to our popular use of 
“Machiavellian” as a synonym for manipulative villainy. At first glance, The Prince’s reputation as a manual for 
tyranny seems well-deserved. Throughout, Machiavelli appears entirely 
unconcerned with morality, except insofar as it’s helpful or harmful 
to maintaining power. For instance, princes are told to 
consider all the atrocities necessary to seize power, and to commit them in a single stroke to ensure future stability. Attacking neighboring territories and 
oppressing religious minorities are mentioned as effective ways of 
occupying the public. Regarding a prince’s personal behavior, Machiavelli advises keeping up the 
appearance of virtues such as honesty or generosity, but being ready to abandon them as soon 
as one’s interests are threatened. Most famously, he notes that for a ruler, “it is much safer to be feared 
than loved.” The tract even ends with an appeal to 
Lorenzo de’ Medici, the recently installed ruler of Florence, urging him to unite the fragmented 
city-states of Italy under his rule. Many have justified Machiavelli as 
motivated by unsentimental realism and a desire for peace in an Italy torn by
internal and external conflict. According to this view, Machiavelli was the first to understand 
a difficult truth: the greater good of political stability is worth whatever unsavory tactics 
are needed to attain it. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin suggested 
that rather than being amoral, The Prince hearkens back to 
ancient Greek morality, placing the glory of the state above the 
Christian ideal of individual salvation. But what we know about Machiavelli might
not fit this picture. The author had served in his native 
Florence for 14 years as a diplomat, staunchly defending its elected 
republican government against would-be monarchs. When the Medici family seized power, he not only lost his position, but was even tortured and banished. With this in mind, it’s possible to read the pamphlet 
he wrote from exile not as a defense of princely rule, but a scathing description 
of how it operates. Indeed, Enlightenment figures like Spinoza saw it as warning free citizens of the various ways in which they can be
subjugated by aspiring rulers. In fact, both readings might be true. Machiavelli may have written a manual for 
tyrannical rulers, but by sharing it, he also revealed 
the cards to those who would be ruled. In doing so, he revolutionized political philosophy, laying the foundations for Hobbes and 
future thinkers to study human affairs based on their 
concrete realities rather than preconceived ideals. Through his brutal and shocking honesty, Machiavelli sought to shatter popular 
delusions about what power really entails. And as he wrote to a friend 
shortly before his death, he hoped that people would “learn the way 
to Hell in order to flee from it."

**Question 1: Who is the author of the book "The Prince"? Options: A. Niccoló Machiavelli, B. Lorenzo de' Medici, C. Isaiah Berlin, D. Spinoza Correct Option: A**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks about Machiavelli's most famous written work. A more accurate match would be a question that asks about the title of Machiavelli's most famous written work.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose the closest one, I would choose:

**Question 4: What was the main focus of Machiavelli's book "The Prince"? Options: A. To describe an ideal government, B. To exhort rulers to rule justly and virtuously, C. To discuss the question of power, D. To provide advice on personal behavior Correct Option: C**

This question is not a perfect match, but it is related to Machiavelli's book "The Prince", which is the main topic of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is **Question 4**, but with the caveat that it's not an exact match.

To create a more accurate match, I would suggest generating a new MCQ that asks about the title of Machiavelli's most famous written work, such as:

**Question: What is the title of Machiavelli's most famous written work? Options: A. The Book of the Courtier, B. The Prince, C. Leviathan, D. Richard the Third Correct Option: B**

This new question would be a more direct match to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1995, the British Medical Journal published an astonishing report 
about a 29-year-old builder. He accidentally jumped 
onto a 15-centimeter nail, which pierced straight through 
his steel-toed boot. He was in such agonizing pain that even 
the smallest movement was unbearable. But when the doctors took off his boot, 
they faced a surprising sight: the nail had never touched 
his foot at all. For hundreds of years, scientists thought that pain was 
a direct response to damage. By that logic, the more severe an injury 
is, the more pain it should cause. But as we’ve learned more about 
the science of pain, we’ve discovered that pain and tissue 
damage don’t always go hand in hand, even when the body’s threat signaling 
mechanisms are fully functioning. We’re capable of experiencing severe pain 
out of proportion to an actual injury, and even pain without any injury, like the builder, or the well-documented 
cases of male partners of pregnant women experiencing pain
during the pregnancy or labor. What’s going on here? There are actually two phenomena at play: the experience of pain, and a biological 
process called nociception. Nociception is part of the nervous 
system’s protective response to harmful or potentially harmful stimuli. Sensors in specialized nerve endings detect mechanical, thermal, 
and chemical threats. If enough sensors are activated, electrical signals shoot up the nerve 
to the spine and on to the brain. The brain weighs the importance 
of these signals and produces pain if it decides 
the body needs protection. Typically, pain helps the body 
avoid further injury or damage. But there are a whole set of factors 
besides nociception that can influence the experience of pain—
and make pain less useful. First, there are biological factors that 
amplify nociceptive signals to the brain. If nerve fibers are activated repeatedly, the brain may decide they need 
to be more sensitive to adequately protect the body 
from threats. More stress sensors can be 
added to nerve fibers until they become so sensitive that 
even light touches to the skin spark intense electrical signals. In other cases, nerves adapt to send signals more 
efficiently, amplifying the message. These forms of amplification  are most common in people experiencing 
chronic pain, which is defined as pain lasting 
more than 3 months. When the nervous system is nudged 
into an ongoing state of high alert, pain can outlast physical injury. This creates a vicious cycle in which 
the longer pain persists, the more difficult it becomes to reverse. Psychological factors clearly 
play a role in pain too, potentially by influencing nociception and
by influencing the brain directly. A person’s emotional state, memories, beliefs about pain and expectations 
about treatment can all influence how much 
pain they experience. In one study, children who reported believing they 
had no control over pain actually experienced more intense pain than those who believed they 
had some control. Features of the environment matter too: In one experiment, volunteers with a cold rod placed on 
the back of their hand reported feeling more pain when they were 
shown a red light than a blue one, even though the rod was the same 
temperature each time. Finally, social factors like the 
availability of family support can affect perception of pain. All of this means that a multi-pronged 
approach to pain treatment that includes pain specialists, physical 
therapists, clinical psychologists, nurses and other healthcare professionals 
is often most effective. We’re only beginning to uncover the 
mechanisms behind the experience of pain, but there are some promising 
areas of research. Until recently, we thought the glial cells surrounding 
neurons were just support structures, but now we know they have a huge role 
in influencing nociception. Studies have shown that disabling certain 
brain circuits in the amygdala can eliminate pain in rats. And genetic testing in people with 
rare disorders that prevent them from feeling pain have pinpointed several other 
possible targets for drugs and perhaps eventually gene therapy.

**Transcript**:
In 1995, the British Medical Journal published an astonishing report 
about a 29-year-old builder. He accidentally jumped 
onto a 15-centimeter nail, which pierced straight through 
his steel-toed boot. He was in such agonizing pain that even 
the smallest movement was unbearable. But when the doctors took off his boot, 
they faced a surprising sight: the nail had never touched 
his foot at all. For hundreds of years, scientists thought that pain was 
a direct response to damage. By that logic, the more severe an injury 
is, the more pain it should cause. But as we’ve learned more about 
the science of pain, we’ve discovered that pain and tissue 
damage don’t always go hand in hand, even when the body’s threat signaling 
mechanisms are fully functioning. We’re capable of experiencing severe pain 
out of proportion to an actual injury, and even pain without any injury, like the builder, or the well-documented 
cases of male partners of pregnant women experiencing pain
during the pregnancy or labor. What’s going on here? There are actually two phenomena at play: the experience of pain, and a biological 
process called nociception. Nociception is part of the nervous 
system’s protective response to harmful or potentially harmful stimuli. Sensors in specialized nerve endings detect mechanical, thermal, 
and chemical threats. If enough sensors are activated, electrical signals shoot up the nerve 
to the spine and on to the brain. The brain weighs the importance 
of these signals and produces pain if it decides 
the body needs protection. Typically, pain helps the body 
avoid further injury or damage. But there are a whole set of factors 
besides nociception that can influence the experience of pain—
and make pain less useful. First, there are biological factors that 
amplify nociceptive signals to the brain. If nerve fibers are activated repeatedly, the brain may decide they need 
to be more sensitive to adequately protect the body 
from threats. More stress sensors can be 
added to nerve fibers until they become so sensitive that 
even light touches to the skin spark intense electrical signals. In other cases, nerves adapt to send signals more 
efficiently, amplifying the message. These forms of amplification  are most common in people experiencing 
chronic pain, which is defined as pain lasting 
more than 3 months. When the nervous system is nudged 
into an ongoing state of high alert, pain can outlast physical injury. This creates a vicious cycle in which 
the longer pain persists, the more difficult it becomes to reverse. Psychological factors clearly 
play a role in pain too, potentially by influencing nociception and
by influencing the brain directly. A person’s emotional state, memories, beliefs about pain and expectations 
about treatment can all influence how much 
pain they experience. In one study, children who reported believing they 
had no control over pain actually experienced more intense pain than those who believed they 
had some control. Features of the environment matter too: In one experiment, volunteers with a cold rod placed on 
the back of their hand reported feeling more pain when they were 
shown a red light than a blue one, even though the rod was the same 
temperature each time. Finally, social factors like the 
availability of family support can affect perception of pain. All of this means that a multi-pronged 
approach to pain treatment that includes pain specialists, physical 
therapists, clinical psychologists, nurses and other healthcare professionals 
is often most effective. We’re only beginning to uncover the 
mechanisms behind the experience of pain, but there are some promising 
areas of research. Until recently, we thought the glial cells surrounding 
neurons were just support structures, but now we know they have a huge role 
in influencing nociception. Studies have shown that disabling certain 
brain circuits in the amygdala can eliminate pain in rats. And genetic testing in people with 
rare disorders that prevent them from feeling pain have pinpointed several other 
possible targets for drugs and perhaps eventually gene therapy.

**Transcript**:
Black holes are among the most 
destructive objects in the universe. Anything that gets too close to the 
central singularity of a black hole, be it an asteroid, planet, or star, risks being torn apart by its 
extreme gravitational field. And if the approaching object happens 
to cross the black hole’s event horizon, it’ll disappear and never re-emerge, adding to the black hole’s mass and 
expanding its radius in the process. There is nothing we could throw 
at a black hole that would do the least bit of 
damage to it. Even another black hole won’t destroy it– the two will simply merge into a larger
black hole, releasing a bit of energy as gravitational
waves in the process. By some accounts, it’s possible that the universe may 
eventually consist entirely of black holes in a very distant future. And yet, there may be a way to destroy, 
or “evaporate,” these objects after all. If the theory is true, all we need to do is to wait. In 1974, Stephen Hawking theorized a process that could lead a black hole 
to gradually lose mass. Hawking radiation, as it came to be known, is based on a well-established phenomenon
called quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. According to quantum mechanics, a given point in spacetime fluctuates 
between multiple possible energy states. These fluctuations are driven by the 
continuous creation and destruction of virtual particle pairs, which consist of a particle and its 
oppositely charged antiparticle. Normally, the two collide and annihilate 
each other shortly after appearing, preserving the total energy. But what happens when they appear just at
the edge of a black hole’s event horizon? If they’re positioned just right, one of the particles could escape the 
black hole’s pull while its counterpart falls in. It would then annihilate another 
oppositely charged particle within the event horizon 
of the black hole, reducing the black hole’s mass. Meanwhile, to an outside observer, it would look like the black hole 
had emitted the escaped particle. Thus, unless a black hole continues 
to absorb additional matter and energy, it’ll evaporate particle by particle, 
at an excruciatingly slow rate. How slow? A branch of physics, called black hole
thermodynamics, gives us an answer. When everyday objects or celestial bodies
release energy to their environment, we perceive that as heat, and can use their energy emission to 
measure their temperature. Black hole thermodynamics suggests that we can similarly define the
“temperature” of a black hole. It theorizes that the more massive the 
black hole, the lower its temperature. The universe’s largest black holes would give off temperatures of the
order of 10 to the -17th power Kelvin, very close to absolute zero. Meanwhile, one with the
mass of the asteroid Vesta would have a temperature close to 200
degrees Celsius, thus releasing a lot of energy 
in the form of Hawking Radiation to the cold outside environment. The smaller the black hole, the hotter it seems to be burning– and the sooner it’ll burn out completely. Just how soon? Well, don’t hold your breath. First of all, most black holes accrete, 
or absorb matter and energy, more quickly than they emit
Hawking radiation. But even if a black hole with the 
mass of our Sun stopped accreting, it would take 10 to the 67th power years– many many magnitudes longer than the
current age of the Universe— to fully evaporate. When a black hole reaches 
about 230 metric tons, it’ll have only one more second to live. In that final second, its event horizon becomes 
increasingly tiny, until finally releasing all of its energy 
back into the universe. And while Hawking radiation has never 
been directly observed, some scientists believe that certain gamma
ray flashes detected in the sky are actually traces of the last moments of small, primordial black holes formed 
at the dawn of time. Eventually, in an almost inconceivably
distant future, the universe may be left 
as a cold and dark place. But if Stephen Hawking was right, before that happens, the normally terrifying and otherwise
impervious black holes will end their existence in a final 
blaze of glory.

**Transcript**:
Black holes are among the most 
destructive objects in the universe. Anything that gets too close to the 
central singularity of a black hole, be it an asteroid, planet, or star, risks being torn apart by its 
extreme gravitational field. And if the approaching object happens 
to cross the black hole’s event horizon, it’ll disappear and never re-emerge, adding to the black hole’s mass and 
expanding its radius in the process. There is nothing we could throw 
at a black hole that would do the least bit of 
damage to it. Even another black hole won’t destroy it– the two will simply merge into a larger
black hole, releasing a bit of energy as gravitational
waves in the process. By some accounts, it’s possible that the universe may 
eventually consist entirely of black holes in a very distant future. And yet, there may be a way to destroy, 
or “evaporate,” these objects after all. If the theory is true, all we need to do is to wait. In 1974, Stephen Hawking theorized a process that could lead a black hole 
to gradually lose mass. Hawking radiation, as it came to be known, is based on a well-established phenomenon
called quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. According to quantum mechanics, a given point in spacetime fluctuates

distant future, the universe may be left 
as a cold and dark place. But if Stephen Hawking was right, before that happens, the normally terrifying and otherwise
impervious black holes will end their existence in a final 
blaze of glory.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
What drives someone to kill in cold blood? What goes through the murderer’s mind? And what kind of a society 
breeds such people? Over 150 years ago Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky 
took these questions up in what would become one of the 
best-known works of Russian literature: "Crime and Punishment." First serialized in a literary 
magazine in 1866, the novel tells the story of Rodion 
Romanovich Raskolnikov, a young law student in Saint Petersburg. Raskolnikov lives in abject poverty, and at the start of the story has run 
out of funds to continue his studies. Letters from his rural home 
only add to his distress when he realizes how much his mother and 
sister have sacrificed for his success. Increasingly desperate after selling the last of his valuables
to an elderly pawnbroker, he resolves on a plan 
to murder and rob her. But the impact of carrying out 
this unthinkable act proves to be more than 
he was prepared for. Though the novel is sometimes cited as one
of the first psychological thrillers, its scope reaches far beyond 
Raskolnikov’s inner turmoil. From dank taverns to dilapidated 
apartments and claustrophobic police stations, the underbelly of 19th century Saint 
Petersburg is brought to life by Dostoyevsky’s searing prose. We’re introduced to characters 
such as Marmeladov, a miserable former official who 
has drank his family into ruin, and Svidrigailov, an unhinged 
and lecherous nobleman. As Raskolnikov’s own family 
arrives in town, their moral innocence stands 
in stark contrast to the depravity of those around them, even as their fates grow 
increasingly intertwined. This bleak portrait of Russian society reflects the author’s own complex life 
experiences and evolving ideas. As a young writer who left behind 
a promising military career, Fyodor had been attracted to 
ideas of socialism and reform, and joined a circle of intellectuals to 
discuss radical texts banned by the Imperial government. Upon exposure, members of this group, including 
Dostoyevsky, were arrested. Many were sentenced to death, only to be subjected to a mock execution 
and last-minute pardon from the Tsar. Dostoyevsky spent the next four 
years in a Siberian labor camp before being released in 1854. The experience left him with a far 
more pessimistic view of social reform, and his focus shifted toward 
spiritual concerns. In the 1864 novella "Notes from 
Underground," he expounded on his belief that utopian
Western philosophies could never satisfy the contradictory 
yearnings of the human soul. "Crime and Punishment" was conceived 
and completed the following year, picking up on many of the same themes. In many ways, the novel follows a common 
narrative thread where a promising youth is seduced and
corrupted by the dangers of urban life. But its social critique cuts far deeper. Raskolnikov rationalizes that 
his own advancement at the cost of the exploitative 
pawnbroker’s death would be a net benefit to society. In doing so, he echoes the doctrines of egoism 
and utilitarianism embraced by many of Dostoyevsky’s 
contemporary intellectuals. And in believing that his intelligence 
allows him to transcend moral taboos, Raskolnikov cuts himself off from 
his own humanity. Yet although the book is deeply 
concerned with morality, "Crime and Punishment" never comes across
as merely moralizing, with each character given their own 
distinctive and convincing voice. One of the most remarkable things about
"Crime and Punishment" is its ability to thrill despite the details of the central murder 
being revealed in the first act. Raskolnikov’s crime is clear. But it’s only through Dostoyevsky’s 
gripping account of the ensuing social and 
psychological turmoil that we learn the true nature 
of his punishment– and the possibility of redemption.

Romanovich Raskolnikov, a young law student in Saint Petersburg. Raskolnikov lives in abject poverty, and at the start of the story has run 
out of funds to continue his studies. Letters from his rural home 
only add to his distress when he realizes how much his mother and 
sister have sacrificed for his success. Increasingly desperate after selling the last of his valuables
to an elderly pawnbroker, he resolves on a plan 
to murder and rob her. But the impact of carrying out 
this unthinkable act proves to be more than 
he was prepared for. Though the novel is sometimes cited as one
of the first psychological thrillers, its scope reaches far beyond 
Raskolnikov’s inner turmoil. From dank taverns to dilapidated 
apartments and claustrophobic police stations, the underbelly of 19th century Saint 
Petersburg is brought to life by Dostoyevsky’s searing prose. We’re introduced to characters 
such as Marmeladov, a miserable former official who 
has drank his family into ruin, and Svidrigailov, an unhinged 
and lecherous nobleman. As Raskolnikov’s own family 
arrives in town, their moral innocence stands 
in stark contrast to the depravity of those around them, even as their fates grow 
increasingly intertwined. This bleak portrait of Russian society reflects the author’s own complex life 
experiences and evolving ideas. As a young writer who left behind 
a promising military career, Fyodor had been attracted to 
ideas of socialism and reform, and joined a circle of intellectuals to 
discuss radical texts banned by the Imperial government. Upon exposure, members of this group, including 
Dostoyevsky, were arrested. Many were sentenced to death, only to be subjected to a mock execution 
and last-minute pardon from the Tsar. Dostoyevsky spent the next four 
years in a Siberian labor camp before being released in 1854. The experience left him with a far 
more pessimistic view of social reform, and his focus shifted toward 
spiritual concerns. In the 1864 novella "Notes from 
Underground," he expounded on his belief that utopian
Western philosophies could never satisfy the contradictory 
yearnings of the human soul. "Crime and Punishment" was conceived 
and completed the following year, picking up on many of the same themes. In many ways, the novel follows a common 
narrative thread where a promising youth is seduced and
corrupted by the dangers of urban life. But its social critique cuts far deeper. Raskolnikov rationalizes that 
his own advancement at the cost of the exploitative 
pawnbroker’s death would be a net benefit to society. In doing so, he echoes the doctrines of egoism 
and utilitarianism embraced by many of Dostoyevsky’s 
contemporary intellectuals. And in believing that his intelligence 
allows him to transcend moral taboos, Raskolnikov cuts himself off from 
his own humanity. Yet although the book is deeply 
concerned with morality, "Crime and Punishment" never comes across
as merely moralizing, with each character given their own 
distinctive and convincing voice. One of the most remarkable things about
"Crime and Punishment" is its ability to thrill despite the details of the central murder 
being revealed in the first act. Raskolnikov’s crime is clear. But it’s only through Dostoyevsky’s 
gripping account of the ensuing social and 
psychological turmoil that we learn the true nature 
of his punishment– and the possibility of redemption.

**Transcript**:
It’s late, pitch dark, and a self-driving 
car winds down a narrow country road. Suddenly, three hazards appear 
at the same time. What happens next? Before it can navigate this 
onslaught of obstacles, the car has to detect them— gleaning enough information about 
their size, shape, and position, so that its control algorithms 
can plot the safest course. With no human at the wheel, the car needs smart eyes, sensors 
that’ll resolve these details— no matter the environment, 
weather, or how dark it is— all in a split-second. That’s a tall order, but there’s a 
solution that partners two things: a special kind of laser-based probe 
called LIDAR, and a miniature version of 
the communications technology that keeps the internet humming,
called integrated photonics. To understand LIDAR, it helps to start 
with a related technology— radar. In aviation, radar antennas launch pulses 
of radio or microwaves at planes to learn their locations by timing 
how long the beams take to bounce back. That’s a limited way of seeing, though, because the large beam-size 
can’t visualize fine details. In contrast, a self-driving car’s 
LIDAR system, which stands for Light Detection 
and Ranging, uses a narrow invisible infrared laser. It can image features as small as the 
button on a pedestrian’s shirt across the street. But how do we determine the shape, 
or depth, of these features? LIDAR fires a train of super-short laser 
pulses to give depth resolution. Take the moose on the country road. As the car drives by, one LIDAR pulse 
scatters off the base of its antlers, while the next may travel to the tip 
of one antler before bouncing back. Measuring how much longer 
the second pulse takes to return provides data about the antler’s shape. With a lot of short pulses, a LIDAR system
quickly renders a detailed profile. The most obvious way to create a pulse 
of light is to switch a laser on and off. But this makes a laser unstable and 
affects the precise timing of its pulses, which limits depth resolution. Better to leave it on, and use something else to periodically 
block the light reliably and rapidly. That’s where integrated photonics come in. The digital data of the internet is carried by precision-timed 
pulses of light, some as short as a hundred picoseconds. One way to create these pulses is 
with a Mach-Zehnder modulator. This device takes advantage of a 
particular wave property, called interference. Imagine dropping pebbles into a pond: as the ripples spread and overlap, 
a pattern forms. In some places, wave peaks add 
up to become very large; in other places, they completely 
cancel out. The Mach-Zehnder modulator 
does something similar. It splits waves of light along two 
parallel arms and eventually rejoins them. If the light is slowed down and 
delayed in one arm, the waves recombine out of sync and 
cancel, blocking the light. By toggling this delay in one arm, the modulator acts like an on/off switch, 
emitting pulses of light. A light pulse lasting a hundred 
picoseconds leads to a depth resolution of a 
few centimeters, but tomorrow’s cars will need 
to see better than that. By pairing the modulator with a super-
sensitive, fast-acting light detector, the resolution can be refined 
to a millimeter. That’s more than a hundred times better  than what we can make out with 
20/20 vision, from across a street. The first generation of automobile LIDAR 
has relied on complex spinning assemblies that scan from rooftops or hoods. With integrated photonics, modulators and detectors are being shrunk 
to less than a tenth of a millimeter, and packed into tiny chips that’ll one 
day fit inside a car’s lights. These chips will also include a clever 
variation on the modulator to help do away with moving parts 
and scan at rapid speeds. By slowing the light in a modulator 
arm only a tiny bit, this additional device will act more 
like a dimmer than an on/off switch. If an array of many such arms, each with 
a tiny controlled delay, is stacked in parallel, something novel 
can be designed: a steerable laser beam. From their new vantage, these smart eyes will probe and 
see more thoroughly than anything nature could’ve imagined— and help navigate any number 
of obstacles. All without anyone breaking a sweat— except for maybe one disoriented moose.

scatters off the base of its antlers, while the next may travel to the tip 
of one antler before bouncing back. Measuring how much longer 
the second pulse takes to return provides data about the antler’s shape. With a lot of short pulses, a LIDAR system
quickly renders a detailed profile. The most obvious way to create a pulse 
of light is to switch a laser on and off. But this makes a laser unstable and 
affects the precise timing of its pulses, which limits depth resolution. Better to leave it on, and use something else to periodically 
block the light reliably and rapidly. That’s where integrated photonics come in. The digital data of the internet is carried by precision-timed 
pulses of light, some as short as a hundred picoseconds. One way to create these pulses is 
with a Mach-Zehnder modulator. This device takes advantage of a 
particular wave property, called interference. Imagine dropping pebbles into a pond: as the ripples spread and overlap, 
a pattern forms. In some places, wave peaks add 
up to become very large; in other places, they completely 
cancel out. The Mach-Zehnder modulator 
does something similar. It splits waves of light along two 
parallel arms and eventually rejoins them. If the light is slowed down and 
delayed in one arm, the waves recombine out of sync and 
cancel, blocking the light. By toggling this delay in one arm, the modulator acts like an on/off switch, 
emitting pulses of light. A light pulse lasting a hundred 
picoseconds leads to a depth resolution of a 
few centimeters, but tomorrow’s cars will need 
to see better than that. By pairing the modulator with a super-
sensitive, fast-acting light detector, the resolution can be refined 
to a millimeter. That’s more than a hundred times better  than what we can make out with 
20/20 vision, from across a street. The first generation of automobile LIDAR 
has relied on complex spinning assemblies that scan from rooftops or hoods. With integrated photonics, modulators and detectors are being shrunk 
to less than a tenth of a millimeter, and packed into tiny chips that’ll one 
day fit inside a car’s lights. These chips will also include a clever 
variation on the modulator to help do away with moving parts 
and scan at rapid speeds. By slowing the light in a modulator 
arm only a tiny bit, this additional device will act more 
like a dimmer than an on/off switch. If an array of many such arms, each with 
a tiny controlled delay, is stacked in parallel, something novel 
can be designed: a steerable laser beam. From their new vantage, these smart eyes will probe and 
see more thoroughly than anything nature could’ve imagined— and help navigate any number 
of obstacles. All without anyone breaking a sweat— except for maybe one disoriented moose.

**Transcript**:
It’s late, pitch dark, and a self-driving 
car winds down a narrow country road. Suddenly, three hazards appear 
at the same time. What happens next? Before it can navigate this 
onslaught of obstacles, the car has to detect them— gleaning enough information about 
their size, shape, and position, so that its control algorithms 
can plot the safest course. With no human at the wheel, the car needs smart eyes, sensors 
that’ll resolve these details— no matter the environment, 
weather, or how dark it is— all in a split-second. That’s a tall order, but there’s a 
solution that partners two things: a special kind of laser-based probe 
called LIDAR, and a miniature version of 
the communications technology that keeps the internet humming,
called integrated photonics. To understand LIDAR, it helps to start 
with a related technology— radar. In aviation, radar antennas launch pulses 
of radio or microwaves at planes to learn their locations by timing 
how long the beams take to bounce back. That’s a limited way of seeing, though, because the large beam-size 
can’t visualize fine details. In contrast, a self-driving car’s 
LIDAR system, which stands for Light Detection 
and Ranging, uses a narrow invisible infrared laser. It can image features as small as the 
button on a pedestrian’s shirt across the street. But how do we determine the shape, 
or depth, of these features? LIDAR fires a train of super-short laser 
pulses to give depth resolution. Take the moose on the country road. As the car drives by, one LIDAR pulse 
scatters off the base of its antlers, while the next may travel to the tip 
of one antler before bouncing back. Measuring how much longer 
the second pulse takes to return provides data about the antler’s shape. With a lot of short pulses, a LIDAR system

What shape are your cells? Squishy cylinders? Jagged zig-zags? You probably don’t think much about
the bodies of these building blocks, but at the microscopic level, small 
changes can have huge consequences. And while some adaptations change 
these shapes for the better, others can spark a cascade of 
debilitating complications. This is the story of sickle-cell disease. Sickle-cell disease affects the 
red blood cells, which transport oxygen from the lungs 
to all the tissues in the body. To perform this vital task, red blood cells are filled with hemoglobin
proteins to carry oxygen molecules. These proteins float independently inside the red blood cell’s pliable, 
doughnut-like shape, keeping the cells flexible enough to accommodate even the 
tiniest of blood vessels. But in sickle cell disease, a single genetic mutation alters
the structure of hemoglobin. After releasing oxygen to tissues, these mutated proteins lock 
together into rigid rows. Rods of hemoglobin cause the cell 
to deform into a long, pointed sickle. These red blood cells are 
harder and stickier, and no longer flow smoothly through 
blood vessels. Sickled cells snag and pile up– sometimes blocking the vessel completely. This keeps oxygen from reaching
a variety of cells, causing the wide range of symptoms experienced by people 
with sickle-cell disease. Starting when they’re 
less than a year old, patients suffer from repeated episodes of
stabbing pain in oxygen-starved tissues. The location of the clogged vessel determines the specific 
symptoms experienced. A blockage in the spleen, 
part of the immune system, puts patients at risk for 
dangerous infections. A pileup in the lungs can produce 
fevers and difficulty breathing. A clog near the eye can cause vision 
problems and retinal detachment. And if the obstructed vessels 
supply the brain the patient could even 
suffer a stroke. Worse still, sickled red blood cells 
also don’t survive very long— just 10 or 20 days, versus a 
healthy cell’s 4 months. This short lifespan means that patients live with a constantly
depleted supply of red blood cells; a condition called sickle-cell anemia. Perhaps what’s most surprising 
about this malignant mutation is that it originally evolved
as a beneficial adaptation. Researchers have been able to trace
the origins of the sickle cell mutation to regions historically ravaged 
by a tropical disease called malaria. Spread by a parasite found 
in local mosquitoes, malaria uses red blood cells as incubators to spread quickly and lethally 
through the bloodstream. However, the same structural changes
that turn red blood cells into roadblocks also make them more resistant to malaria. And if a child inherits a copy of the
mutation from only one parent, there will be just enough abnormal 
hemoglobin to make life difficult for the 
malaria parasite, while most of their red blood cells retain
their normal shape and function. In regions rife with this parasite, sickle cell mutation offered a serious 
evolutionary advantage. But as the adaptation flourished, it became clear that inheriting the 
mutation from both parents resulted in sickle-cell anemia. Today, most people with 
sickle-cell disease can trace their ancestry to a country
where malaria is endemic. And this mutation still plays a key role
in Africa, where more than 90% of malaria 
infections occur worldwide. Fortunately, as this “adaptation” thrives, our treatment for sickle cell continues 
to improve. For years, hydroxyurea was the only 
medication available to reduce the amount of sickling, blunting symptoms and 
increasing life expectancy. Bone marrow transplantations 
offer a curative measure, but these procedures are 
complicated and often inaccessible. But promising new medications 
are intervening in novel ways, like keeping oxygen bonded to 
hemoglobin to prevent sickling, or reducing the stickiness 
of sickled cells. And the ability to edit DNA has raised the possibility of enabling 
stem cells to produce normal hemoglobin. As these tools become available in the areas most affected by malaria
and sickle cell disease, we can improve the quality of life for more patients with this 
adverse adaptation.

**Transcript**:
What shape are your cells? Squishy cylinders? Jagged zig-zags? You probably don’t think much about
the bodies of these building blocks, but at the microscopic level, small 
changes can have huge consequences. And while some adaptations change 
these shapes for the better, others can spark a cascade of 
debilitating complications. This is the story of sickle-cell disease. Sickle-cell disease affects the 
red blood cells, which transport oxygen from the lungs 
to all the tissues in the body. To perform this vital task, red blood cells are filled with hemoglobin
proteins to carry oxygen molecules. These proteins float independently inside the red blood cell’s pliable, 
doughnut-like shape, keeping the cells flexible enough to accommodate even the 
tiniest of blood vessels. But in sickle cell disease, a single genetic mutation alters
the structure of hemoglobin. After releasing oxygen to tissues, these mutated proteins lock 
together into rigid rows. Rods of hemoglobin cause the cell 
to deform into a long, pointed sickle. These red blood cells are 
harder and stickier, and no longer flow smoothly through 
blood vessels. Sickled cells snag and pile up– sometimes blocking the vessel completely. This keeps oxygen from reaching
a variety of cells, causing the wide range of symptoms experienced by people 
with sickle-cell disease. Starting when they’re 
less than a year old, patients suffer from repeated episodes of
stabbing pain in oxygen-starved tissues. The location of the clogged vessel determines the specific 
symptoms experienced. A blockage in the spleen, 
part of the immune system, puts patients at risk for 
dangerous infections. A pileup in the lungs can produce 
fevers and difficulty breathing. A clog near the eye can cause vision 
problems and retinal detachment. And if the obstructed vessels 
supply the brain the patient could even 
suffer a stroke. Worse still, sickled red blood cells 
also don’t survive very long— just 10 or 20 days, versus a 
healthy cell’s 4 months. This short lifespan means that patients live with a constantly
depleted supply of red blood cells; a condition called sickle-cell anemia. Perhaps what’s most surprising 
about this malignant mutation is that it originally evolved
as a beneficial adaptation. Researchers have been able to trace
the origins of the sickle cell mutation to regions historically ravaged 
by a tropical disease called malaria. Spread by a parasite found 
in local mosquitoes, malaria uses red blood cells as incubators to spread quickly and lethally 
through the bloodstream. However, the same structural changes
that turn red blood cells into roadblocks also make them more resistant to malaria. And if a child inherits a copy of the
mutation from only one parent, there will be just enough abnormal 
hemoglobin to make life difficult for the 
malaria parasite, while most of their red blood cells retain
their normal shape and function. In regions rife with this parasite, sickle cell mutation offered a serious 
evolutionary advantage. But as the adaptation flourished, it became clear that inheriting the 
mutation from both parents resulted in sickle-cell anemia. Today, most people with 
sickle-cell disease can trace their ancestry to a country
where malaria is endemic. And this mutation still plays a key role
in Africa, where more than 90% of malaria 
infections occur worldwide. Fortunately, as this “adaptation” thrives, our treatment for sickle cell continues 
to improve. For years, hydroxyurea was the only 
medication available to reduce the amount of sickling, blunting symptoms and 
increasing life expectancy. Bone marrow transplantations 
offer a curative measure, but these procedures are 
complicated and often inaccessible. But promising new medications 
are intervening in novel ways, like keeping oxygen bonded to 
hemoglobin to prevent sickling, or reducing the stickiness 
of sickled cells. And the ability to edit DNA has raised the possibility of enabling 
stem cells to produce normal hemoglobin. As these tools become available in the areas most affected by malaria
and sickle cell disease, we can improve the quality of life for more patients with this 
adverse adaptation.

On April 26th, 1937, Fascist forces bombed the Basque village 
of Guernica in Northern Spain. It was one of the worst civilian 
casualties of the Spanish Civil War, waged between the democratic republic and 
General Franco’s fascist contingent. For Pablo Picasso, the 
tragedy sparked a frenzied period of work in which he produced a 
massive anti-war mural, aptly titled "Guernica." The painting is a powerful work of 
historical documentation and political protest. But while Picasso’s artistic 
motivations are clear, the symbolism of the painting can be as 
confusing and chaotic as war itself. How can we make sense of this 
overwhelming image, and what exactly makes it a 
masterpiece of anti-war art? The painting’s monumental canvas is 
disorienting from the start, rendered in the abstracted Cubist style 
Picasso pioneered. Cubism deliberately emphasized the 
two-dimensionality of the canvas by flattening the objects being painted. This afforded viewers multiple and often impossible perspectives 
on the same object; a technique considered shocking 
even in Picasso’s domestic scenes. But in this context, the style offers a profoundly 
overwhelming view of violence, destruction, and casualties. Multiple perspectives only compound
the horror on display– sending the eyes hurtling around the 
frame in a futile hunt for peace. On the far left, a woman holding her 
dead child releases a scream; her eyes sliding down her face 
in the shape of tears and her head bending back unnaturally 
to echo her baby’s. There is the statue of a soldier 
present below, but he is unable to defend 
the woman and child. Instead his broken body lies in pieces, his arm clutching a splintered sword 
in a signal of utmost defeat. The tip of his sword meets a woman’s foot 
as she attempts to flee the devastation. But her other leg appears 
rooted to the spot, locked in the corner of the canvas 
even as she stretches to move it. Another victim appears 
behind this slouching figure. Falling helplessly as flames 
lick around her, she too is caught in her 
own hopeless scene. Each of these figures bordering the 
painting are horribly trapped, giving the work an acute 
sense of claustrophobia. And where you might expect the canvas’ 
massive size to counteract this feeling, its scale only highlights the nearly 
life-sized atrocities on display. Some possible relief comes from a lamp held tightly by a ghostly woman 
reaching out her window. But is her lantern’s hopeful glow 
truly lighting the scene? Or is it the jagged lightbulb– thought to represent the technologies 
of modern warfare– which illuminates her view of 
the chaos below? From the coffin-like confines
of her window, her arm guides the viewer back 
into the fray, to perhaps the most controversial
symbols of all– two ghostly animals caught 
in the destruction. Does the screaming horse embody the
threat of Franco’s military nationalism; or does the spike running through 
its body convey its victimhood? Does the white bull represent Spain, the country of matadors and a common 
theme in Picasso’s work– or does it stand for the 
brutality of war? In this scene of strife, these animals 
raise more questions than answers. And additional elements hidden 
throughout the frame offer even more secrets for 
close observers. At the top of the canvas flashes a bird 
desperate to escape the carnage. And the abundance of animals on display 
may hint at the bombing’s date– a market day which flooded the streets with villagers, animals, and 
other potential causalities. Like the bombing of Guernica itself, Picasso’s painting is dense 
with destruction. But hidden beneath this supposed chaos,
are carefully crafted scenes and symbols, carrying out the painting’s multifaceted 
attack on fascism. Decades after its creation, "Guernica" retains its power to shock 
viewers and ignite debate, and is often referenced at anti-war 
gatherings around the world. Hundreds of viewers have grappled with 
its harsh imagery, shattering symbolism and complex political messaging. But even without a close understanding 
of it’s complicated subtext, Picasso’s work remains a searing reminder 
of the true casualties of violence.

may hint at the bombing’s date– a market day which flooded the streets with villagers, animals, and 
other potential causalities. Like the bombing of Guernica itself, Picasso’s painting is dense 
with destruction. But hidden beneath this supposed chaos,
are carefully crafted scenes and symbols, carrying out the painting’s multifaceted 
attack on fascism. Decades after its creation, "Guernica" retains its power to shock 
viewers and ignite debate, and is often referenced at anti-war 
gatherings around the world. Hundreds of viewers have grappled with 
its harsh imagery, shattering symbolism and complex political messaging. But even without a close understanding 
of it’s complicated subtext, Picasso’s work remains a searing reminder 
of the true casualties of violence.

**Transcript**:
For your son’s sixth birthday, you’ve promised to get him the cutest 
creature in creation: the cuddly. It’s hard to believe that it’s a cousin of
the terrifying duddly or the hideous fuddly. They’re all members of the Wuddly species, and the process of adopting 
them is deeply peculiar. It takes 100 eggs to make a single 
animal in genus Wuddly. When 100 eggs are placed together 
in an incubator, they undergo egg fusion, and combine 
in the following way. Blue and purple combine to make red eggs. Red and blue combine to make purple eggs, and red and purple 
combine to make blue eggs. The most plentiful eggs pair up first, and if two piles are even, an egg comes from one of them at random. They keep combining until 
there’s just one left. If the final egg is blue, a Cuddly hatches out of it. Purple eggs give you Duddlies, and Red eggs give you Fuddlies. The incubator currently has 99 eggs in it. 23 are blue, 33 are purple, 
and 43 are red. You can begin the process of egg fusion
by adding an egg of any color to the room. When all the eggs have combined
into a single egg, the creature that hatches will bond 
with you on sight, which is why getting a Cuddly 
is so important. After all, you made a promise to your son. Which color egg should you add 
to the incubator to get a cuddly? Pause the video to figure it out 
for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It’s easy to get mixed up with all the
cuddlies, duddlies, and fuddlies coming from different colored eggs. If we ignore how many total eggs
of each color there are, and just look at the 
process of egg fusion, we might notice something that 
will make this problem simpler. When two eggs fuse, the number of eggs of each of those 
colors decreases by one, and the number of the third 
color increases by one. That means they all change parity, or evenness and oddness, 
at the same time. Right now all three piles are odd, 
but you get to add an egg to one color, which means that it’ll be even 
and the other two will be odd. Whichever color you choose will always be the opposite parity 
of the other two piles: odd when they’re even and 
even when they’re odd, since every egg fusion flips each pile’s 
parity simultaneously. We want to end with 1 blue, 0 purple,
and 0 red eggs, or odd, even, even. That means we want the blue egg pile 
to be the opposite parity of the other two piles 
at the start as well. So you add a blue egg into the room, and 99 egg fusions later, only a single blue egg remains. The Cuddly that hatches is sure to make 
your 6-year-old as happy as can be. Just be sure to follow the 
shopkeeper’s warning, and never feed it after midnight.

**Transcript**:
This is the 13th hole at Augusta National Golf Club. And to reach it, you have to hit a series of shots around the corner from the tee. One to get down the fairway, and a few more to get around the corner and onto the green. But not if you're Bubba Watson. "Bubba Watson with a driver." At the 2014 Masters Tournament, he did something remarkable. His drive sliced left, and into the woods, looking like a huge mistake. Until the announcers realized what Bubba was up to. That ball flew far enough to go over the trees and land right in front of the green. Bubba cut the corner. And that shot helped him win the tournament. But it also showed that golf might have a problem. Players like Bubba might be hitting the ball too far. Bernhard Langer is a pro golfer who had an average drive of 280 yards in 2018. That's 20 yards farther than what he was hitting when he was 30. And that jump is part of a much bigger trend. Since 1980, the average driving distance on the PGA Pro Tour has climbed over 30 yards. So the question is, what's causing this rise? The truth is, there are a lot of reasons why golfers are hitting the ball farther. They're stronger, their clubs are high-tech, and the courses are in better condition. But while all of these factors have had an effect, one particular thing has become a focus of conversation: The earliest golf balls were, likely, wooden, or "Hairies," made with stitched fabric filled with...hair. Then came "Featheries," made from leather filled with...feathers. And later, "Gutties," made with ...  Maybe you've never heard of the gutta percha, a tropical tree species that provided the sap used to make gutty balls. Playing Gutties, golfers noticed that their older balls,  the ones beaten up with nicks and scratches, were flying farther than the new ones. So they started carving designs into Gutties to get more distance. And, experimenting with different patterns, golfers realized that dimples work best. Dimpled balls fly farther because air, coming into contact with an uneven surface, creates a protective layer of turbulence around the golf ball. And that creates a smaller wake, that has less drag on the ball. But remember this chart? Dimples were around way before this line started rising, so they don't really explain what's going on here. And I mean right here. See this jump? It's the steepest part of this trendline. Something caused this, and it wasn't dimples. It was this: The golf ball that revolutionized the sport. I know what you're thinking — this looks like any other golf ball. But not when you look on the inside. So, for about 100 years before the Pro V1, the standard golf ball had been a "wound ball." The inside is a rubber band, wound around a core, and sometimes filled with liquid, which you can see if you cut one open, like golfer Rick Shiels. But cutting open a Pro V1, you can see what makes this ball different. It's the solid, multi-layered core.  Before the Pro V1 and balls like it, players had to choose: between a solid-core ball that's good for distance, or a wound ball that's better for accuracy. But a multi-layered ball can do both. Its rigid core helps it fly far for distance, and the flexible outer layers allow a golfer to control spin when hitting closer to the hole. Before 2000, nearly all players hit wound balls. But afterwards, nearly all pro players in the US Open had switched to hitting solid multi-layer balls like the Pro V1. And that year was the year that the average driving distance shot up six yards. "Unusual and concerning" is how a 2017 report described the rise in driving distance for professional players. Hitting the ball too far means golfers can fly the ball over obstacles designed to make the game difficult. And that's making some courses obsolete. Especially older ones, like Oakmont Country Club, where holes designed in another era are being overpowered by modern players. Now, officials are considering what they can do to limit distance. Making golf balls bigger would increase drag, and a heavier ball would fall out of the air more quickly. But adjusting dimpling, or rolling back innovations that made the Pro V1 successful, like layering and materials, could also reduce the flight of golf balls, and solve the problem. However, not everyone's happy about this idea. "We own our manufacturing process, we own our technology, and we own our responsibility to the end-user." As this epic marketing video shows, Titleist invests a lot in making golf balls. And for ball manufacturers, any little change to production would cost them a lot of money. But they probably shouldn't be too worried. The truth is, golf has been having a version of this debate for nearly a hundred years, and nothing's been settled yet. Debating the flight of the ball started a long time ago, with people asking "does it go too far?" as far back as 1936. And in the end, maybe it just doesn't even matter. Remember the 13th hole at Augusta? That got fixed. The club just bought the land behind the tee box, in order to pull it back, and make it farther to hit a drive over the corner. No matter what kind of ball you use.

"Unusual and concerning" is how a 2017 report described the rise in driving distance for professional players. Hitting the ball too far means golfers can fly the ball over obstacles designed to make the game difficult. And that's making some courses obsolete. Especially older ones, like Oakmont Country Club, where holes designed in another era are being overpowered by modern players. Now, officials are considering what they can do to limit distance. Making golf balls bigger would increase drag, and a heavier ball would fall out of the air more quickly. But adjusting dimpling, or rolling back innovations that made the Pro V1 successful, like layering and materials, could also reduce the flight of golf balls, and solve the problem. However, not everyone's happy about this idea. "We own our manufacturing process, we own our technology, and we own our responsibility to the end-user." As this epic marketing video shows, Titleist invests a lot in making golf balls. And for ball manufacturers, any little change to production would cost them a lot of money. But they probably shouldn't be too worried. The truth is, golf has been having a version of this debate for nearly a hundred years, and nothing's been settled yet. Debating the flight of the ball started a long time ago, with people asking "does it go too far?" as far back as 1936. And in the end, maybe it just doesn't even matter. Remember the 13th hole at Augusta? That got fixed. The club just bought the land behind the tee box, in order to pull it back, and make it farther to hit a drive over the corner. No matter what kind of ball you use.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
This is the 13th hole at Augusta National Golf Club. And to reach it, you have to hit a series of shots around the corner from the tee. One to get down the fairway, and a few more to get around the corner and onto the green. But not if you're Bubba Watson. "Bubba Watson with a driver." At the 2014 Masters Tournament, he did something remarkable. His drive sliced left, and into the woods, looking like a huge mistake. Until the announcers realized what Bubba was up to. That ball flew far enough to go over the trees and land right in front of the green. Bubba cut the corner. And that shot helped him win the tournament. But it also showed that golf might have a problem. Players like Bubba might be hitting the ball too far. Bernhard Langer is a pro golfer who had an average drive of 280 yards in 2018. That's 20 yards farther than what he was hitting when he was 30. And that jump is part of a much bigger trend. Since 1980, the average driving distance on the PGA Pro Tour has climbed over 30 yards. So the question is, what's causing this rise? The truth is, there are a lot of reasons why golfers are hitting the ball farther. They're stronger, their clubs are high-tech, and the courses are in better condition. But while all of these factors have had an effect, one particular thing has become a focus of conversation: The earliest golf balls were, likely, wooden, or "Hairies," made with stitched fabric filled with...hair. Then came "Featheries," made from leather filled with...feathers. And later, "Gutties," made with ...  Maybe you've never heard of the gutta percha, a tropical tree species that provided the sap used to make gutty balls. Playing Gutties, golfers noticed that their older balls,  the ones beaten up with nicks and scratches, were flying farther than the new ones. So they started carving designs into Gutties to get more distance. And, experimenting with different patterns, golfers realized that dimples work best. Dimpled balls fly farther because air, coming into contact with an uneven surface, creates a protective layer of turbulence around the golf ball. And that creates a smaller wake, that has less drag on the ball. But remember this chart? Dimples were around way before this line started rising, so they don't really explain what's going on here. And I mean right here. See this jump? It's the steepest part of this trendline. Something caused this, and it wasn't dimples. It was this: The golf ball that revolutionized the sport. I know what you're thinking — this looks like any other golf ball. But not when you look on the inside. So, for about 100 years before the Pro V1, the standard golf ball had been a "wound ball." The inside is a rubber band, wound around a core, and sometimes filled with liquid, which you can see if you cut one open, like golfer Rick Shiels. But cutting open a Pro V1, you can see what makes this ball different. It's the solid, multi-layered core.  Before the Pro V1 and balls like it, players had to choose: between a solid-core ball that's good for distance, or a wound ball that's better for accuracy. But a multi-layered ball can do both. Its rigid core helps it fly far for distance, and the flexible outer layers allow a golfer to control spin when hitting closer to the hole. Before 2000, nearly all players hit wound balls. But afterwards, nearly all pro players in the US Open had switched to hitting solid multi-layer balls like the Pro V1. And that year was the year that the average driving distance shot up six yards. "Unusual and concerning" is how a 2017 report described the rise in driving distance for professional players.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A rabbit attempts to play a church organ, while a knight fights a giant snail and a naked man blows a trumpet 
with his rear end. Painted with squirrel-hair brushes 
on vellum or parchment by monks, nuns, and urban craftspeople, these bizarre images populate the 
margins of the most prized books from the Middle Ages. Their illustrations often tell a second 
story as rich as the text itself. Some images appear in many 
different illuminated manuscripts, and often reinforce the religious 
content of the books they decorated. For example, a porcupine picking 
up fruit on its spines could represent the devil stealing 
the fruits of faith-- or Christ taking up the sins of mankind. Medieval lore stated that a hunter 
could only capture a unicorn when it lay its horn in 
the lap of a virgin, so a unicorn could symbolize 
either sexual temptation or Christ being captured by his enemies. Rabbits, meanwhile, could represent 
human’s lustful natures— and could redeem themselves through 
attempts to make sacred music despite their failings. All of these references would have 
been familiar to medieval Europeans from other art forms and oral tradition, though some have grown more 
mysterious over the centuries. Today, no one can say for sure what the common 
motif of a knight fighting a snail means— or why the knight so often 
appears to be losing. The snail might be a symbol of the 
inevitability of death, which defeats even the strongest knights. Or it could represent humility, and a 
knight’s need to vanquish his own pride. Many illuminated manuscripts were 
copies of religious or classical texts, and the bookmakers incorporated their 
own ideas and opinions in illustrations. The butt tuba, for example, was likely shorthand to 
express disapproval with-- or add an ironic spin to--
the action in the text. Illuminations could also be used to 
make subversive political commentary. The text of the "Smithfield Decretals" details the Church’s laws and 
punishments for lawbreakers. But the margins show a fox being 
hanged by geese, a possible allusion to the common people 
turning on their powerful oppressors. In the "Chronica Majora," Matthew Paris summarized a 
scandal of his day, in which the Welsh prince Griffin plummeted to his death 
from the tower of London. Some believed the prince fell, 
Paris wrote, while others thought he was pushed. He added his own take in the margins, which show the prince falling to his death while trying to escape on a rope 
made of bed-sheets. Some margins told stories of 
a more personal nature. "The Luttrell Psalter," a book of psalms and prayers commissioned 
by Sir Geoffrey Luttrell, shows a young woman having her hair done, while a young man catches a bird in a net. The shaved patch on his 
head is growing out, indicating that he is a clergyman 
neglecting his duties. This alludes to a family scandal where a young cleric ran away with Sir 
Geoffrey’s daughter Elizabeth. The family’s personal spiritual advisor 
likely painted it into the book to remind his clients of their failings and encourage their spiritual development. Some artists even painted themselves 
into the manuscripts. The opening image of Christine de 
Pisan’s collected works shows de Pisan presenting 
the book to the Queen of France. The queen was so impressed by de Pisan's 
previous work that she commissioned her own copy. Such royal patronage enabled her to establish her own 
publishing house in Paris. The tradition of illuminated manuscripts 
lasted for over a thousand years. The books were created by individuals or 
teams for uses as wide-ranging as private prayer aids, service books 
in churches, textbooks, and protective talismans to 
take into battle. Across all this variation, those tricky little drawings 
in the margins are a unique window into the 
minds of medieval artists.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A rabbit attempts to play a church organ, while a knight fights a giant snail and a naked man blows a trumpet 
with his rear end. Painted with squirrel-hair brushes 
on vellum or parchment by monks, nuns, and urban craftspeople, these bizarre images populate the 
margins of the most prized books from the Middle Ages. Their illustrations often tell a second 
story as rich as the text itself. Some images appear in many 
different illuminated manuscripts, and often reinforce the religious 
content of the books they decorated. For example, a porcupine picking 
up fruit on its spines could represent the devil stealing 
the fruits of faith-- or Christ taking up the sins of mankind. Medieval lore stated that a hunter 
could only capture a unicorn when it lay its horn in 
the lap of a virgin, so a unicorn could symbolize 
either sexual temptation or Christ being captured by his enemies. Rabbits, meanwhile, could represent 
human’s lustful natures— and could redeem themselves through 
attempts to make sacred music despite their failings. All of these references would have 
been familiar to medieval Europeans from other art forms and oral tradition, though some have grown more 
mysterious over the centuries. Today, no one can say for sure what the common 
motif of a knight fighting a snail means— or why the knight so often 
appears to be losing. The snail might be a symbol of the 
inevitability of death, which defeats even the strongest knights. Or it could represent humility, and a 
knight’s need to vanquish his own pride. Many illuminated manuscripts were 
copies of religious or classical texts, and the bookmakers incorporated their 
own ideas and opinions in illustrations. The butt tuba, for example, was likely shorthand to 
express disapproval with-- or add an ironic spin to--
the action in the text. Illuminations could also be used to 
make subversive political commentary. The text of the "Smithfield Decretals" details the Church’s laws and 
punishments for lawbreakers. But the margins show a fox being 
hanged by geese, a possible allusion to the common people 
turning on their powerful oppressors. In the "Chronica Majora," Matthew Paris summarized a 
scandal of his day, in which the Welsh prince Griffin plummeted to his death 
from the tower of London. Some believed the prince fell, 
Paris wrote, while others thought he was pushed. He added his own take in the margins, which show the prince falling to his death while trying to escape on a rope 
made of bed-sheets. Some margins told stories of 
a more personal nature. "The Luttrell Psalter," a book of psalms and prayers commissioned 
by Sir Geoffrey Luttrell, shows a young woman having her hair done, while a young man catches a bird in a net. The shaved patch on his 
head is growing out, indicating that he is a clergyman 
neglecting his duties. This alludes to a family scandal where a young cleric ran away with Sir 
Geoffrey’s daughter Elizabeth. The family’s personal spiritual advisor 
likely painted it into the book to remind his clients of their failings and encourage their spiritual development. Some artists even painted themselves 
into the manuscripts. The opening image of Christine de 
Pisan’s collected works shows de Pisan presenting 
the book to the Queen of France. The queen was so impressed by de Pisan's 
previous work that she commissioned her own copy. Such royal patronage enabled her to establish her own 
publishing house in Paris. The tradition of illuminated manuscripts 
lasted for over a thousand years. The books were created by individuals or 
teams for uses as wide-ranging as private prayer aids, service books 
in churches, textbooks, and protective talismans to 
take into battle. Across all this variation, those tricky little drawings 
in the margins are a unique window into the 
minds of medieval artists.

**Transcript**:
You’re on an airplane 
when you feel a sudden jolt. Outside your window nothing 
seems to be happening, yet the plane continues to rattle 
you and your fellow passengers as it passes through turbulent air
in the atmosphere. Although it may not comfort 
you to hear it, this phenomenon is one of the 
prevailing mysteries of physics. After more than a century 
of studying turbulence, we’ve only come up with a few 
answers for how it works and affects the world around us. And yet, turbulence is ubiquitous, springing up in virtually any system 
that has moving fluids. That includes the airflow 
in your respiratory tract. The blood moving through your arteries. And the coffee in your cup, 
as you stir it. Clouds are governed by turbulence, as are waves crashing along the shore 
and the gusts of plasma in our sun. Understanding precisely how this 
phenomenon works would have a bearing on so many 
aspects of our lives. Here’s what we do know. Liquids and gases usually have 
two types of motion: a laminar flow, which is stable 
and smooth; and a turbulent flow, which is composed 
of seemingly unorganized swirls. Imagine an incense stick. The laminar flow of unruffled smoke 
at the base is steady and easy to predict. Closer to the top, however, the smoke accelerates, becomes unstable, and the pattern of movement changes
to something chaotic. That’s turbulence in action, and turbulent flows have certain
characteristics in common. Firstly, turbulence is always chaotic. That’s different from being random. Rather, this means that turbulence 
is very sensitive to disruptions. A little nudge one way or the other will eventually turn into 
completely different results. That makes it nearly impossible 
to predict what will happen, even with a lot of information 
about the current state of a system. Another important characteristic of 
turbulence is the different scales of motion 
that these flows display. Turbulent flows have many 
differently-sized whirls called eddies, which are like vortices of 
different sizes and shapes. All those differently-sized eddies 
interact with each other, breaking up to become smaller and smaller until all that movement is 
transformed into heat, in a process called the “energy cascade." So that’s how we recognize turbulence– but why does it happen? In every flowing liquid or gas there 
are two opposing forces: inertia and viscosity. Inertia is the tendency of fluids 
to keep moving, which causes instability. Viscosity works against disruption, making the flow laminar instead. In thick fluids such as honey, viscosity almost always wins. Less viscous substances like water or air 
are more prone to inertia, which creates instabilities that 
develop into turbulence. We measure where a flow falls 
on that spectrum with something called the Reynolds number, which is the ratio between a flow’s 
inertia and its viscosity. The higher the Reynolds number, the more likely it is that 
turbulence will occur. Honey being poured into a cup, 
for example, has a Reynolds number of about 1. The same set up with water has a Reynolds 
number that’s closer to 10,000. The Reynolds number is useful for 
understanding simple scenarios, but it’s ineffective in many situations. For example, the motion of the atmosphere
is significantly influenced by factors including gravity and the 
earth’s rotation. Or take relatively simple things 
like the drag on buildings and cars. We can model those thanks to many 
experiments and empirical evidence. But physicists want to be able to predict 
them through physical laws and equations as well as we can model the orbits 
of planets or electromagnetic fields. Most scientists think that getting there 
will rely on statistics and increased computing power. Extremely high-speed computer simulations 
of turbulent flows could help us identify patterns that could
lead to a theory that organizes and unifies predictions
across different situations. Other scientists think that the phenomenon
is so complex that such a full-fledged theory 
isn’t ever going to be possible. Hopefully we’ll reach a breakthrough, because a true understanding of turbulence
could have huge positive impacts. That would include more 
efficient wind farms; the ability to better prepare for 
catastrophic weather events; or even the power to manipulate 
hurricanes away. And, of course, smoother rides 
for millions of airline passengers.

to something chaotic. That’s turbulence in action, and turbulent flows have certain
characteristics in common. Firstly, turbulence is always chaotic. That’s different from being random. Rather, this means that turbulence 
is very sensitive to disruptions. A little nudge one way or the other will eventually turn into 
completely different results. That makes it nearly impossible 
to predict what will happen, even with a lot of information 
about the current state of a system. Another important characteristic of 
turbulence is the different scales of motion 
that these flows display. Turbulent flows have many 
differently-sized whirls called eddies, which are like vortices of 
different sizes and shapes. All those differently-sized eddies 
interact with each other, breaking up to become smaller and smaller until all that movement is 
transformed into heat, in a process called the “energy cascade." So that’s how we recognize turbulence– but why does it happen? In every flowing liquid or gas there 
are two opposing forces: inertia and viscosity. Inertia is the tendency of fluids 
to keep moving, which causes instability. Viscosity works against disruption, making the flow laminar instead. In thick fluids such as honey, viscosity almost always wins. Less viscous substances like water or air 
are more prone to inertia, which creates instabilities that 
develop into turbulence. We measure where a flow falls 
on that spectrum with something called the Reynolds number, which is the ratio between a flow’s 
inertia and its viscosity. The higher the Reynolds number, the more likely it is that 
turbulence will occur. Honey being poured into a cup, 
for example, has a Reynolds number of about 1. The same set up with water has a Reynolds 
number that’s closer to 10,000. The Reynolds number is useful for 
understanding simple scenarios, but it’s ineffective in many situations. For example, the motion of the atmosphere
is significantly influenced by factors including gravity and the 
earth’s rotation. Or take relatively simple things 
like the drag on buildings and cars. We can model those thanks to many 
experiments and empirical evidence. But physicists want to be able to predict 
them through physical laws and equations as well as we can model the orbits 
of planets or electromagnetic fields. Most scientists think that getting there 
will rely on statistics and increased computing power. Extremely high-speed computer simulations 
of turbulent flows could help us identify patterns that could
lead to a theory that organizes and unifies predictions
across different situations. Other scientists think that the phenomenon
is so complex that such a full-fledged theory 
isn’t ever going to be possible. Hopefully we’ll reach a breakthrough, because a true understanding of turbulence
could have huge positive impacts. That would include more 
efficient wind farms; the ability to better prepare for 
catastrophic weather events; or even the power to manipulate 
hurricanes away. And, of course, smoother rides 
for millions of airline passengers.

**Transcript**:
You’re on an airplane 
when you feel a sudden jolt. Outside your window nothing 
seems to be happening, yet the plane continues to rattle 
you and your fellow passengers as it passes through turbulent air
in the atmosphere. Although it may not comfort 
you to hear it, this phenomenon is one of the 
prevailing mysteries of physics. After more than a century 
of studying turbulence, we’ve only come up with a few 
answers for how it works and affects the world around us. And yet, turbulence is ubiquitous, springing up in virtually any system 
that has moving fluids. That includes the airflow 
in your respiratory tract. The blood moving through your arteries. And the coffee in your cup, 
as you stir it. Clouds are governed by turbulence, as are waves crashing along the shore 
and the gusts of plasma in our sun. Understanding precisely how this 
phenomenon works would have a bearing on so many 
aspects of our lives. Here’s what we do know. Liquids and gases usually have 
two types of motion: a laminar flow, which is stable 
and smooth; and a turbulent flow, which is composed 
of seemingly unorganized swirls. Imagine an incense stick. The laminar flow of unruffled smoke 
at the base is steady and easy to predict. Closer to the top, however, the smoke accelerates, becomes unstable, and the pattern of movement changes

**Transcript**:
Little do they know it, but these six creatures are each about to
experience a very unusual death. One-by-one, they will fall prey to the remarkable, 
predatory antics of... a carnivorous plant. Around the world there are more than 
600 plant species that supplement a regular 
diet of sunlight, water, and soil with insects, microbes, 
or even frogs and rats. Scientists believe that carnivory in 
plants evolved separately at least six times on our planet, suggesting that this flesh-munching 
adaptation holds a major benefit for plants. Carnivorous plants tend to grow in places 
with highly acidic soil, which is poor in crucial nutrients 
like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. In these hostile conditions, plants that are able to lure, trap, 
and digest prey have an advantage over those that rely 
on soil for their nutrients. Take this inhospitable bog, where pitcher plants reign supreme. Drawn to the pitcher’s vivid colors 
and alluring scent, the fly closes in and slurps its nectar. But this pitcher species has an ingredient
called coniine in its nectar, a powerful narcotic to insects. As the coniine takes effect, the fly grows sluggish, stumbles, 
and falls down the funnel into a pool of liquid at the base, where he drowns. Enzymes and bacteria in the liquid slowly
break his body down into microscopic particles the pitcher 
plant can consume through its leaves. Occasionally, larger prey also tumbles into the 
fatal funnel of the pitcher plant. The second victim faces off with the 
sticky sundew plant. The sundew’s tiny leaves are equipped with
a viscous secretion called mucilage. The ant is swiftly trapped in this goo. As she struggles, enzymes begin 
to digest her body. Special tentacles sense her movement 
and curl around her, clenching her in their suffocating grip. Once she asphyxiates, which can happen in under an hour, the tentacles unfurl again 
to snare their next victim. Two down, four to go. The next target meets his end underground, in the coils of the corkscrew plant. He enters the roots through a tiny slit
in search of food. But inside, he quickly loses his way 
through the tangled labyrinth. A forest of curved hairs 
prevents his escape, guiding him into a central chamber
with flesh-digesting enzymes and deadly low levels of oxygen. In the murky depths of a nearby pond, a tadpole unwittingly swims into the path
of the bladderwort, the speediest of all carnivorous plants. She treads on the bladderwort’s trigger, and in milliseconds, a trapdoor swings open and sucks her in. Trapped half in and half out, she struggles to free herself while the part of her body inside 
the plant gets digested. Over the next few hours, her writhing sets the trap off repeatedly, each time bringing her deeper 
into the plant to be digested alive bit by bit. Meanwhile, this beetle is bewitched by 
sweet-smelling nectar. The scent draws him closer and closer until he lands on the leaves of the 
world’s most infamous carnivorous plant. His landing triggers tiny hairs on the 
surface of the leaves, and the jaws of the venus fly trap 
snap shut around him. The spikes interlock to seal his fate. Once closed, the leaves act like an external stomach
that digests the beetle’s soft tissues. When they open again a few days later, only the dry husk of his 
exoskeleton remains. The mayfly is the last creature standing. As she approaches the butterwort plant, she heads for the flowers that wave high
above the plant’s globs of adhesive goo. She alights on the petals, drinks the 
nectar, and takes off unscathed. These long flower stalks keep certain 
insects away from the carnivore’s traps— a way of separating pollinators from food. Off the mayfly buzzes 
to live a long and fruitful life– oh.

the plant gets digested. Over the next few hours, her writhing sets the trap off repeatedly, each time bringing her deeper 
into the plant to be digested alive bit by bit. Meanwhile, this beetle is bewitched by 
sweet-smelling nectar. The scent draws him closer and closer until he lands on the leaves of the 
world’s most infamous carnivorous plant. His landing triggers tiny hairs on the 
surface of the leaves, and the jaws of the venus fly trap 
snap shut around him. The spikes interlock to seal his fate. Once closed, the leaves act like an external stomach
that digests the beetle’s soft tissues. When they open again a few days later, only the dry husk of his 
exoskeleton remains. The mayfly is the last creature standing. As she approaches the butterwort plant, she heads for the flowers that wave high
above the plant’s globs of adhesive goo. She alights on the petals, drinks the 
nectar, and takes off unscathed. These long flower stalks keep certain 
insects away from the carnivore’s traps— a way of separating pollinators from food. Off the mayfly buzzes

**Transcript**:
Little do they know it, but these six creatures are each about to
experience a very unusual death. One-by-one, they will fall prey to the remarkable, 
predatory antics of... a carnivorous plant. Around the world there are more than 
600 plant species that supplement a regular 
diet of sunlight, water, and soil with insects, microbes, 
or even frogs and rats. Scientists believe that carnivory in 
plants evolved separately at least six times on our planet, suggesting that this flesh-munching 
adaptation holds a major benefit for plants. Carnivorous plants tend to grow in places 
with highly acidic soil, which is poor in crucial nutrients 
like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. In these hostile conditions, plants that are able to lure, trap, 
and digest prey have an advantage over those that rely 
on soil for their nutrients. Take this inhospitable bog, where pitcher plants reign supreme. Drawn to the pitcher’s vivid colors 
and alluring scent, the fly closes in and slurps its nectar. But this pitcher species has an ingredient
called coniine in its nectar, a powerful narcotic to insects. As the coniine takes effect, the fly grows sluggish, stumbles, 
and falls down the funnel into a pool of liquid at the base, where he drowns. Enzymes and bacteria in the liquid slowly
break his body down into microscopic particles the pitcher 
plant can consume through its leaves. Occasionally, larger prey also tumbles into the 
fatal funnel of the pitcher plant. The second victim faces off with the 
sticky sundew plant. The sundew’s tiny leaves are equipped with
a viscous secretion called mucilage. The ant is swiftly trapped in this goo. As she struggles, enzymes begin 
to digest her body. Special tentacles sense her movement 
and curl around her, clenching her in their suffocating grip. Once she asphyxiates, which can happen in under an hour, the tentacles unfurl again 
to snare their next victim. Two down, four to go. The next target meets his end underground, in the coils of the corkscrew plant. He enters the roots through a tiny slit
in search of food. But inside, he quickly loses his way 
through the tangled labyrinth. A forest of curved hairs 
prevents his escape, guiding him into a central chamber
with flesh-digesting enzymes and deadly low levels of oxygen. In the murky depths of a nearby pond, a tadpole unwittingly swims into the path
of the bladderwort, the speediest of all carnivorous plants. She treads on the bladderwort’s trigger, and in milliseconds, a trapdoor swings open and sucks her in. Trapped half in and half out, she struggles to free herself while the part of her body inside

**Transcript**:
In 2004, a new company called Vemma Nutrition started offering a life-changing 
opportunity to earn full time income 
for part time work. Vemma’s offer was open to everybody, regardless of prior experience 
or education. There were only two steps to start 
get started earning: purchase a $500-600 kit 
of their liquid nutrition products, and recruit two more members 
to do the same. Vemma Nutrition Company grew quickly, becoming a global operation that brought in 30,000 new members 
per month at its peak. There was just one problem— while the company generated $200 million
of annual revenue by 2013, the vast majority of participants 
earned less than they paid in. Vemma was eventually charged with 
operating a pyramid scheme: a common type of fraud where members make money by recruiting more people to buy in. Typically, the founder solicits an initial
group of people to buy in and promote the scheme. They are then encouraged to recruit others and promised part of the money 
those people invest, while the founder also takes a share. The pattern repeats for each group 
of new participants, with money from recent arrivals funneled 
to those who recruited them. This differs from a Ponzi scheme, where the founders recruit new members and secretly use their fees to 
pay existing members, who think the payments come 
from a legitimate investment. As a pyramid scheme grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for new 
recruits to make money. That’s because the number of participants
expands exponentially. Take a structure where each person has 
to recruit six more to earn a profit. The founder recruits six people to start, and each of them recruits six more. There are 36 people in that second
round of recruits, who then each recruit 6 people— a total of 216 new recruits. By the twelfth round of recruiting, the 2.1 billion newest members 
would have to recruit over 13 billion more people total 
to make money– more than the entire world population. In this scenario, the most recent recruits, over 80% of the scheme’s participants, lose all the money they paid in. And in real life, many earlier joiners lose out too. Pyramid schemes are illegal 
in most countries, but they can be difficult to detect. They are presented as many 
different things, including gifting groups, investment clubs, and multi-level 
marketing businesses. The distinction between pyramid schemes 
and legitimate multi-level marketing can be particularly hazy. In theory, the difference is that the members of the multi-level 
marketing companies primarily earn compensation from selling
a particular product or a service to retail customers, while pyramid schemes primarily compensate
members for recruitment of new sellers. In practice, though, many multi-level marketing companies make 
it all but impossible for members to profit purely 
through sales. And many pyramid schemes, 
like Vemma Nutrition, disguise themselves as legal multi-level
marketing businesses, using a product or service to hide the
pay-and-recruit structure. Many pyramid schemes also capitalize 
on already existing trust within churches, immigrant communities, 
or other tightly knit groups. The first few members are encouraged 
to report a good experience before they actually start 
making a profit. Others in their network follow 
their example, and the schemes balloon in size before it comes clear that most members
aren’t actually profiting. Often, the victims are 
embarrassed into silence. Pyramid schemes entice people with the
promise of opportunity and empowerment. So when members don’t end up making money, they can blame themselves 
rather than the scheme, thinking they weren’t tenacious enough 
to earn the returns promised. Some victims keep trying, investing in multiple schemes, and losing money each time. In spite of all these factors, there are ways to spot a pyramid scheme. Time pressure is one red flag— be wary of directives to “act now or 
miss a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” Promises of large, life-altering
amounts of income are also suspect. And finally, a legitimate multi-level 
marketing business shouldn’t require members to pay for the
opportunity to sell a product or service. Pyramid schemes can be incredibly 
destructive to individuals, communities, and even entire countries. But you can fight fire with fire by sending this video to three 
people you know, and encouraging them to do the same.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is one identifiable way that a pyramid scheme is different from a Ponzi scheme?
Options: A. Participants pay in money that they may not recover, B. Participants are often promised income or returns that are misleading, C. Some people will make money and will often promote these “winnings” to others, D. Participants make money from recruiting other participants

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2004, a new company called Vemma Nutrition started offering a life-changing 
opportunity to earn full time income 
for part time work. Vemma’s offer was open to everybody, regardless of prior experience 
or education. There were only two steps to start 
get started earning: purchase a $500-600 kit 
of their liquid nutrition products, and recruit two more members 
to do the same. Vemma Nutrition Company grew quickly, becoming a global operation that brought in 30,000 new members 
per month at its peak. There was just one problem— while the company generated $200 million
of annual revenue by 2013, the vast majority of participants 
earned less than they paid in. Vemma was eventually charged with 
operating a pyramid scheme: a common type of fraud where members make money by recruiting more people to buy in. Typically, the founder solicits an initial
group of people to buy in and promote the scheme. They are then encouraged to recruit others and promised part of the money 
those people invest, while the founder also takes a share. The pattern repeats for each group 
of new participants, with money from recent arrivals funneled 
to those who recruited them. This differs from a Ponzi scheme, where the founders recruit new members and secretly use their fees to 
pay existing members, who think the payments come 
from a legitimate investment. As a pyramid scheme grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for new 
recruits to make money. That’s because the number of participants
expands exponentially. Take a structure where each person has 
to recruit six more to earn a profit. The founder recruits six people to start, and each of them recruits six more. There are 36 people in that second
round of recruits, who then each recruit 6 people— a total of 216 new recruits. By the twelfth round of recruiting, the 2.1 billion newest members 
would have to recruit over 13 billion more people total 
to make money– more than the entire world population. In this scenario, the most recent recruits, over 80% of the scheme’s participants, lose all the money they paid in. And in real life, many earlier joiners lose out too. Pyramid schemes are illegal 
in most countries, but they can be difficult to detect. They are presented as many 
different things, including gifting groups, investment clubs, and multi-level 
marketing businesses. The distinction between pyramid schemes 
and legitimate multi-level marketing can be particularly hazy. In theory, the difference is that the members of the multi-level 
marketing companies primarily earn compensation from selling
a particular product or a service to retail customers, while pyramid schemes primarily compensate
members for recruitment of new sellers. In practice, though, many multi-level marketing companies make 
it all but impossible for members to profit purely 
through sales. And many pyramid schemes, 
like Vemma Nutrition, disguise themselves as legal multi-level
marketing businesses, using a product or service to hide the
pay-and-recruit structure. Many pyramid schemes also capitalize 
on already existing trust within churches, immigrant communities, 
or other tightly knit groups. The first few members are encouraged 
to report a good experience before they actually start 
making a profit. Others in their network follow 
their example, and the schemes balloon in size before it comes clear that most members
aren’t actually profiting. Often, the victims are 
embarrassed into silence. Pyramid schemes entice people with the
promise of opportunity and empowerment. So when members don’t end up making money, they can blame themselves 
rather than the scheme, thinking they weren’t tenacious enough 
to earn the returns promised. Some victims keep trying, investing in multiple schemes, and losing money each time. In spite of all these factors, there are ways to spot a pyramid scheme. Time pressure is one red flag— be wary of directives to “act now or 
miss a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” Promises of large, life-altering
amounts of income are also suspect. And finally, a legitimate multi-level 
marketing business shouldn’t require members to pay for the
opportunity to sell a product or service. Pyramid schemes can be incredibly 
destructive to individuals, communities, and even entire countries. But you can fight fire with fire by sending this video to three 
people you know, and encouraging them to do the same.

**Transcript**:
Since their emergence 
over 200,000 years ago, modern humans have established 
homes and communities all over the planet. But they didn’t do it alone. Whatever corner of the globe you find 
homo sapiens in today, you’re likely to find another 
species nearby: Canis lupus familiaris. Whether they’re herding, hunting, 
sledding, or slouching the sheer variety of domestic 
dogs is staggering. But what makes the story of man’s 
best friend so surprising is that they all evolved from a creature often seen as one of our oldest rivals: Canis lupus, or the gray wolf. When our Paleolithic ancestors first 
settled Eurasia roughly 100,000 years ago, wolves were one of their main rivals 
at the top of the food chain. Able to exert over 300 lbs. of pressure 
in one bone-crushing bite and sniff out prey more than a mile away, these formidable predators didn’t have 
much competition. Much like human hunter-gatherers, they lived and hunted 
in complex social groups consisting of a few nuclear families, and used their social skills to 
cooperatively take down larger creatures. Using these group tactics, they operated as effective 
persistence hunters, relying not on outrunning their prey, but pursuing it to the point 
of exhaustion. But when pitted against the similar
strengths of their invasive new neighbors, wolves found themselves at a crossroads. For most packs, these bourgeoning bipeds represented 
a serious threat to their territory. But for some wolves, especially those without a pack, human camps offered new opportunities. Wolves that showed less aggression
towards humans could come closer to their encampments, feeding on leftovers. And as these more docile scavengers 
outlasted their aggressive brethren, their genetic traits were passed on, gradually breeding tamer wolves
in areas near human populations. Over time humans found a multitude of uses
for these docile wolves. They helped to track and hunt prey, and might have served as sentinels
to guard camps and warn of approaching enemies. Their similar social structure made
it easy to integrate with human families and learn to understand their commands. Eventually they moved from the fringes 
of our communities into our homes, becoming humanity’s 
first domesticated animal. The earliest of these Proto-Dogs
or Wolf-Dogs, seem to have appeared around 
33,000 years ago, and would not have looked all that 
different from their wild cousins. They were primarily distinguished 
by their smaller size and a shorter snout full of 
comparatively smaller teeth. But as human cultures and occupations 
became more diverse and specialized, so did our friends. Short stocky dogs to herd livestock 
by nipping their heels; elongated dogs to flush badgers 
and foxes out of burrows; thin and sleek dogs for racing; and large, muscular dogs for guard duty. With the emergence of kennel clubs and 
dog shows during England’s Victorian era, these dog types were standardized 
into breeds, with many new ones bred 
purely for appearance. Sadly, while all dog breeds are the 
product of artificial selection, some are healthier than others. Many of these aesthetic characteristics 
come with congenital health problems, such as difficulty breathing 
or being prone to spinal injuries. Humanity’s longest experiment 
in controlled evolution has had other side effects as well. Generations of selection for tameness have favored more juvenile 
and submissive traits that were pleasing to humans. This phenomenon of selecting traits 
associated with youth is known as neoteny, and can be seen in many domestic animals. Thousands of years of co-evolution 
may even have bonded us chemically. Not only can canines understand 
our emotions and body language, but when dogs and humans interact, both our bodies release oxytocin; a hormone commonly associated with 
feelings of love and protectiveness. It might be difficult to fathom how every
Pomeranian, Chihuahua, and Poodle are descended from fierce wolves. But the diversity of breeds today 
is the result of a relationship that precedes cities, agriculture, and even the disappearance 
of our Neanderthal cousins. And it’s heartening to know that given enough time, even our most dangerous rivals 
can become our fiercest friends.

cooperatively take down larger creatures. Using these group tactics, they operated as effective 
persistence hunters, relying not on outrunning their prey, but pursuing it to the point 
of exhaustion. But when pitted against the similar
strengths of their invasive new neighbors, wolves found themselves at a crossroads. For most packs, these bourgeoning bipeds represented 
a serious threat to their territory. But for some wolves, especially those without a pack, human camps offered new opportunities. Wolves that showed less aggression
towards humans could come closer to their encampments, feeding on leftovers. And as these more docile scavengers 
outlasted their aggressive brethren, their genetic traits were passed on, gradually breeding tamer wolves
in areas near human populations. Over time humans found a multitude of uses
for these docile wolves. They helped to track and hunt prey, and might have served as sentinels
to guard camps and warn of approaching enemies. Their similar social structure made
it easy to integrate with human families and learn to understand their commands. Eventually they moved from the fringes 
of our communities into our homes, becoming humanity’s 
first domesticated animal. The earliest of these Proto-Dogs
or Wolf-Dogs, seem to have appeared around 
33,000 years ago, and would not have looked all that 
different from their wild cousins. They were primarily distinguished 
by their smaller size and a shorter snout full of 
comparatively smaller teeth. But as human cultures and occupations 
became more diverse and specialized, so did our friends. Short stocky dogs to herd livestock 
by nipping their heels; elongated dogs to flush badgers 
and foxes out of burrows; thin and sleek dogs for racing; and large, muscular dogs for guard duty. With the emergence of kennel clubs and 
dog shows during England’s Victorian era, these dog types were standardized 
into breeds, with many new ones bred 
purely for appearance. Sadly, while all dog breeds are the 
product of artificial selection, some are healthier than others. Many of these aesthetic characteristics 
come with congenital health problems, such as difficulty breathing 
or being prone to spinal injuries. Humanity’s longest experiment 
in controlled evolution has had other side effects as well. Generations of selection for tameness have favored more juvenile 
and submissive traits that were pleasing to humans. This phenomenon of selecting traits 
associated with youth is known as neoteny, and can be seen in many domestic animals. Thousands of years of co-evolution 
may even have bonded us chemically. Not only can canines understand 
our emotions and body language, but when dogs and humans interact, both our bodies release oxytocin; a hormone commonly associated with 
feelings of love and protectiveness. It might be difficult to fathom how every
Pomeranian, Chihuahua, and Poodle are descended from fierce wolves. But the diversity of breeds today 
is the result of a relationship that precedes cities, agriculture, and even the disappearance 
of our Neanderthal cousins. And it’s heartening to know that given enough time, even our most dangerous rivals 
can become our fiercest friends.

**Transcript**:
From Shakespeare’s plays 
to modern TV dramas, the unscrupulous schemer for whom 
the ends always justify the means has become a familiar character type 
we love to hate. So familiar, in fact, that for centuries we’ve had a single word to describe 
such characters: Machiavellian. But is it possible that we’ve been using 
that word wrong this whole time? The early 16th century statesman Niccoló 
Machiavelli wrote many works of history, philosophy, 
and drama. But his lasting notoriety comes from a 
brief political essay known as The Prince, framed as advice to current 
and future monarchs. Machiavelli wasn’t the first to do this– in fact there was an entire tradition of 
works known as “mirrors for princes” going back to antiquity. But unlike his predecessors, Machiavelli didn’t try to describe an 
ideal government or exhort his audience to rule 
justly and virtuously. Instead, he focused on the 
question of power– how to acquire it, and how to keep it. And in the decades after it was published, The Prince gained a diabolical reputation. During the European Wars of Religion, both Catholics and Protestants 
blamed Machiavelli for inspiring acts of violence and tyranny
committed by their opponents. By the end of the century, Shakespeare was using “Machiavel” to 
denote an amoral opportunist, leading directly to our popular use of 
“Machiavellian” as a synonym for manipulative villainy. At first glance, The Prince’s reputation as a manual for 
tyranny seems well-deserved. Throughout, Machiavelli appears entirely 
unconcerned with morality, except insofar as it’s helpful or harmful 
to maintaining power. For instance, princes are told to 
consider all the atrocities necessary to seize power, and to commit them in a single stroke to ensure future stability. Attacking neighboring territories and 
oppressing religious minorities are mentioned as effective ways of 
occupying the public. Regarding a prince’s personal behavior, Machiavelli advises keeping up the 
appearance of virtues such as honesty or generosity, but being ready to abandon them as soon 
as one’s interests are threatened. Most famously, he notes that for a ruler, “it is much safer to be feared 
than loved.” The tract even ends with an appeal to 
Lorenzo de’ Medici, the recently installed ruler of Florence, urging him to unite the fragmented 
city-states of Italy under his rule. Many have justified Machiavelli as 
motivated by unsentimental realism and a desire for peace in an Italy torn by
internal and external conflict. According to this view, Machiavelli was the first to understand 
a difficult truth: the greater good of political stability is worth whatever unsavory tactics 
are needed to attain it. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin suggested 
that rather than being amoral, The Prince hearkens back to 
ancient Greek morality, placing the glory of the state above the 
Christian ideal of individual salvation. But what we know about Machiavelli might
not fit this picture. The author had served in his native 
Florence for 14 years as a diplomat, staunchly defending its elected 
republican government against would-be monarchs. When the Medici family seized power, he not only lost his position, but was even tortured and banished. With this in mind, it’s possible to read the pamphlet 
he wrote from exile not as a defense of princely rule, but a scathing description 
of how it operates. Indeed, Enlightenment figures like Spinoza saw it as warning free citizens of the various ways in which they can be
subjugated by aspiring rulers. In fact, both readings might be true. Machiavelli may have written a manual for 
tyrannical rulers, but by sharing it, he also revealed 
the cards to those who would be ruled. In doing so, he revolutionized political philosophy, laying the foundations for Hobbes and 
future thinkers to study human affairs based on their 
concrete realities rather than preconceived ideals. Through his brutal and shocking honesty, Machiavelli sought to shatter popular 
delusions about what power really entails. And as he wrote to a friend 
shortly before his death, he hoped that people would “learn the way 
to Hell in order to flee from it."

**Transcript**:
From Shakespeare’s plays 
to modern TV dramas, the unscrupulous schemer for whom 
the ends always justify the means has become a familiar character type 
we love to hate. So familiar, in fact, that for centuries we’ve had a single word to describe 
such characters: Machiavellian. But is it possible that we’ve been using 
that word wrong this whole time? The early 16th century statesman Niccoló 
Machiavelli wrote many works of history, philosophy, 
and drama. But his lasting notoriety comes from a 
brief political essay known as The Prince, framed as advice to current 
and future monarchs. Machiavelli wasn’t the first to do this– in fact there was an entire tradition of 
works known as “mirrors for princes” going back to antiquity. But unlike his predecessors, Machiavelli didn’t try to describe an 
ideal government or exhort his audience to rule 
justly and virtuously. Instead, he focused on the 
question of power– how to acquire it, and how to keep it. And in the decades after it was published, The Prince gained a diabolical reputation. During the European Wars of Religion, both Catholics and Protestants 
blamed Machiavelli for inspiring acts of violence and tyranny
committed by their opponents. By the end of the century, Shakespeare was using “Machiavel” to 
denote an amoral opportunist, leading directly to our popular use of 
“Machiavellian” as a synonym for manipulative villainy. At first glance, The Prince’s reputation as a manual for 
tyranny seems well-deserved. Throughout, Machiavelli appears entirely 
unconcerned with morality, except insofar as it’s helpful or harmful 
to maintaining power. For instance, princes are told to 
consider all the atrocities necessary to seize power, and to commit them in a single stroke to ensure future stability. Attacking neighboring territories and 
oppressing religious minorities are mentioned as effective ways of 
occupying the public. Regarding a prince’s personal behavior, Machiavelli advises keeping up the 
appearance of virtues such as honesty or generosity, but being ready to abandon them as soon 
as one’s interests are threatened. Most famously, he notes that for a ruler, “it is much safer to be feared 
than loved.” The tract even ends with an appeal to 
Lorenzo de’ Medici, the recently installed ruler of Florence, urging him to unite the fragmented 
city-states of Italy under his rule. Many have justified Machiavelli as 
motivated by unsentimental realism and a desire for peace in an Italy torn by
internal and external conflict. According to this view, Machiavelli was the first to understand 
a difficult truth: the greater good of political stability is worth whatever unsavory tactics 
are needed to attain it. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin suggested 
that rather than being amoral, The Prince hearkens back to 
ancient Greek morality, placing the glory of the state above the 
Christian ideal of individual salvation. But what we know about Machiavelli might
not fit this picture. The author had served in his native 
Florence for 14 years as a diplomat, staunchly defending its elected 
republican government against would-be monarchs. When the Medici family seized power, he not only lost his position, but was even tortured and banished. With this in mind, it’s possible to read the pamphlet 
he wrote from exile not as a defense of princely rule, but a scathing description 
of how it operates. Indeed, Enlightenment figures like Spinoza saw it as warning free citizens of the various ways in which they can be
subjugated by aspiring rulers. In fact, both readings might be true. Machiavelli may have written a manual for 
tyrannical rulers, but by sharing it, he also revealed 
the cards to those who would be ruled. In doing so, he revolutionized political philosophy, laying the foundations for Hobbes and 
future thinkers to study human affairs based on their 
concrete realities rather than preconceived ideals. Through his brutal and shocking honesty, Machiavelli sought to shatter popular 
delusions about what power really entails. And as he wrote to a friend 
shortly before his death, he hoped that people would “learn the way 
to Hell in order to flee from it."
