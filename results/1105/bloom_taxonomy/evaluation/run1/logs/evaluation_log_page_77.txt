**Transcript**:
So I'm here today to encourage
you to think about New York City, and not just as one
of humanity's greatest achievements, but as home to native wildlife that are subject to a grand
evolutionary experiment. So take this forested hillside
in Northern Manhattan, for example. This is one of the last areas
left in the city where there's clean spring water
seeping out of the ground. You could drink this
out of your hands and you'd be OK. These tiny little areas of seeping water contain huge populations
of northern dusky salamanders. These guys were common in the city
maybe 60 years ago, but now they're just stuck
on this single hillside and a few places in Staten Island. Not only do they suffer the indignity
of being stuck on this hillside, but we divided the hillside in two on two different occasions with bridges crossing
from the Bronx into Manhattan. But they're still there,
on either side of the bridges, where you see the red arrows --
about 180th Street, 167th Street. My lab has found that if you just take
a few segments of DNA from salamanders in those two locations, you can tell which side
of the bridge they came from. We built this single piece
of infrastructure that's changed their evolutionary history. We can go study these guys,
we just go to the hillside we know where they are,
we flip over rocks so we can catch them. There are a lot of other things
in New York City, though, that are not that easy to capture,
such as this guy, a coyote. We caught him on an automatic camera trap
in an undisclosed location; I'm not allowed to talk about it yet. But they're moving into New York City
for the first time. They're very flexible,
intelligent animals. This is one of this year's pups
checking out one of our cameras. And my colleagues and I
are very interested in understanding how they're going to spread
through the area, how they're going to survive here
and maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming
to a neighborhood near you, if they're not already there. Some things are too fast
to be caught by hand. We can't pick them up on the cameras, so we set up traps
around New York City and the parks. This is one of our most common activities. Here's some of my students
and collaborators getting the traps out and ready. This guy, we catch in almost
every forested area in New York City. This is the white-footed mouse -- not the mouse you find
running around your apartment. This is a native species,
been here long before humans. You find them in forests and meadows. Because they're so common
in forested areas in the city, we're using them as a model
to understand how species are adapting to urban environments. So if you think back 400 years ago, the five boroughs would've been covered
in forests and other types of vegetation. This mouse would've been everywhere
[in] huge populations that showed few genetic differences
across the landscape. But if you look at the situation today, they're just stuck in these little islands
of forest scattered around the city. Just using 18 short segments of DNA,
we can pretty much take a mouse somebody could give us a mouse,
not tell us where it was from, and we could determine
what park it came from. That's how different they've become. You'll notice in the middle
of this figure, there are some mixed-up colors. There are a few parks in the city
that are still connected to each other with strips of forest,
so the mice can run back and forth and spread their genes,
so they don't become different. But throughout the city, they're mostly
becoming different in the parks. So I'm telling you they're different,
but what does that mean? What's changing about their biology? To answer this question, we're sequencing thousands
of genes from our city mice and comparing those to thousands
of genes from the country mice, so, their ancestors
outside of New York City in these big, more wilderness areas. Now, genes are short segments of DNA
that code for amino acids. And amino acids are
the building blocks of proteins. If a single base pair changes in a gene, you can get a different amino acid, which will then change the shape
and structure of the protein. If you change the structure of a protein, you often change something
about what it does in the organism. Now if that change leads to a longer
life or more babies for a mouse, something evolutionary
biologists call fitness, then that single base-pair change
will spread quickly in an urban population. So this crazy figure
is called a Manhattan plot, because it kind of looks like a skyline. Each dot represents one gene, and the higher the dot is in the plot, the more different it is
between city and country mice. The ones kind of at the tips
of the skyscrapers are the most different, especially those above the red line. And these genes encode for things
like immune response to disease, because there might be more disease
in very dense, urban populations; metabolism, how the mice use energy; and heavy-metal tolerance. You guys can probably predict that New York City soils
are pretty contaminated with lead and chromium
and that sort of thing. And now our hard work is really starting. We're going back into the wilds
of New York City parks, following the lives of individual mice and seeing exactly
what these genes are doing for them. And I would encourage you guys
to try to look at your parks in a new way. I'm not going to be
the next Charles Darwin, but one of you guys might be,
so just keep your eyes open. Thank you. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: What is the speaker's lab studying about the northern dusky salamanders? Options: A. Their behavior in the wild, B. Their genetic differences based on their location, C. Their diet, D. Their habitat Correct Option: B.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not specifically mention the effect of the bridges on the salamander population.

A more accurate match would be a question that combines the information from Questions 2 and 3. Unfortunately, such a question does not exist in the provided generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 3 (index 3), but with the understanding that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

It's worth noting that the generated MCQs seem to focus more on the general topics discussed in the lecture, rather than specific details like the effect of the bridges on the salamander population. A more targeted generated MCQ might be: "What happened to the northern dusky salamander population when two bridges were built on a hillside in northern Manhattan?" Options: A. They became extinct, B. They were relocated, C. They were unaffected, D. They evolved into two genetically distinct populations. This question would more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about an animal moving into New York City for the first time, and the correct answer is Coyotes. Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 mentions the northern dusky salamanders being stuck on a single hillside, but it does not talk about an animal moving into the city for the first time.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of animals in New York City, I would suggest Question 2. But please note that it does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to provide an index, I would say Question 2 is the closest, but it's not a good match.

It would be better to generate a new MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ. Here's an example:

Generated MCQ:
Question: According to the speaker, what animal is moving into New York City for the first time?

**Transcript**:
So I'm here today to encourage
you to think about New York City, and not just as one
of humanity's greatest achievements, but as home to native wildlife that are subject to a grand
evolutionary experiment. So take this forested hillside
in Northern Manhattan, for example. This is one of the last areas
left in the city where there's clean spring water
seeping out of the ground. You could drink this
out of your hands and you'd be OK. These tiny little areas of seeping water contain huge populations
of northern dusky salamanders. These guys were common in the city
maybe 60 years ago, but now they're just stuck
on this single hillside and a few places in Staten Island. Not only do they suffer the indignity
of being stuck on this hillside, but we divided the hillside in two on two different occasions with bridges crossing
from the Bronx into Manhattan. But they're still there,
on either side of the bridges, where you see the red arrows --
about 180th Street, 167th Street. My lab has found that if you just take
a few segments of DNA from salamanders in those two locations, you can tell which side
of the bridge they came from. We built this single piece
of infrastructure that's changed their evolutionary history. We can go study these guys,
we just go to the hillside we know where they are,
we flip over rocks so we can catch them. There are a lot of other things
in New York City, though, that are not that easy to capture,
such as this guy, a coyote. We caught him on an automatic camera trap
in an undisclosed location; I'm not allowed to talk about it yet. But they're moving into New York City
for the first time. They're very flexible,
intelligent animals. This is one of this year's pups
checking out one of our cameras. And my colleagues and I
are very interested in understanding how they're going to spread
through the area, how they're going to survive here
and maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming
to a neighborhood near you, if they're not already there. Some things are too fast
to be caught by hand. We can't pick them up on the cameras, so we set up traps
around New York City and the parks. This is one of our most common activities. Here's some of my students
and collaborators getting the traps out and ready. This guy, we catch in almost
every forested area in New York City. This is the white-footed mouse -- not the mouse you find
running around your apartment. This is a native species,
been here long before humans. You find them in forests and meadows. Because they're so common
in forested areas in the city, we're using them as a model
to understand how species are adapting to urban environments. So if you think back 400 years ago, the five boroughs would've been covered
in forests and other types of vegetation. This mouse would've been everywhere
[in] huge populations that showed few genetic differences
across the landscape. But if you look at the situation today, they're just stuck in these little islands
of forest scattered around the city. Just using 18 short segments of DNA,
we can pretty much take a mouse somebody could give us a mouse,
not tell us where it was from, and we could determine
what park it came from. That's how different they've become. You'll notice in the middle
of this figure, there are some mixed-up colors. There are a few parks in the city
that are still connected to each other with strips of forest,
so the mice can run back and forth and spread their genes,
so they don't become different. But throughout the city, they're mostly
becoming different in the parks. So I'm telling you they're different,
but what does that mean? What's changing about their biology? To answer this question, we're sequencing thousands
of genes from our city mice and comparing those to thousands
of genes from the country mice, so, their ancestors
outside of New York City in these big, more wilderness areas. Now, genes are short segments of DNA
that code for amino acids. And amino acids are
the building blocks of proteins. If a single base pair changes in a gene, you can get a different amino acid, which will then change the shape
and structure of the protein. If you change the structure of a protein, you often change something
about what it does in the organism. Now if that change leads to a longer
life or more babies for a mouse, something evolutionary
biologists call fitness, then that single base-pair change
will spread quickly in an urban population. So this crazy figure
is called a Manhattan plot, because it kind of looks like a skyline. Each dot represents one gene, and the higher the dot is in the plot, the more different it is
between city and country mice. The ones kind of at the tips
of the skyscrapers are the most different, especially those above the red line. And these genes encode for things
like immune response to disease, because there might be more disease
in very dense, urban populations; metabolism, how the mice use energy; and heavy-metal tolerance. You guys can probably predict that New York City soils
are pretty contaminated with lead and chromium
and that sort of thing. And now our hard work is really starting. We're going back into the wilds
of New York City parks, following the lives of individual mice and seeing exactly
what these genes are doing for them. And I would encourage you guys
to try to look at your parks in a new way. I'm not going to be
the next Charles Darwin, but one of you guys might be,
so just keep your eyes open. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So I'm here today to encourage
you to think about New York City, and not just as one
of humanity's greatest achievements, but as home to native wildlife that are subject to a grand
evolutionary experiment. So take this forested hillside
in Northern Manhattan, for example. This is one of the last areas
left in the city where there's clean spring water
seeping out of the ground. You could drink this
out of your hands and you'd be OK. These tiny little areas of seeping water contain huge populations
of northern dusky salamanders. These guys were common in the city
maybe 60 years ago, but now they're just stuck
on this single hillside and a few places in Staten Island. Not only do they suffer the indignity
of being stuck on this hillside, but we divided the hillside in two on two different occasions with bridges crossing
from the Bronx into Manhattan. But they're still there,
on either side of the bridges, where you see the red arrows --
about 180th Street, 167th Street. My lab has found that if you just take
a few segments of DNA from salamanders in those two locations, you can tell which side
of the bridge they came from. We built this single piece
of infrastructure that's changed their evolutionary history. We can go study these guys,
we just go to the hillside we know where they are,
we flip over rocks so we can catch them. There are a lot of other things
in New York City, though, that are not that easy to capture,
such as this guy, a coyote. We caught him on an automatic camera trap
in an undisclosed location; I'm not allowed to talk about it yet. But they're moving into New York City
for the first time. They're very flexible,
intelligent animals. This is one of this year's pups
checking out one of our cameras. And my colleagues and I
are very interested in understanding how they're going to spread
through the area, how they're going to survive here
and maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming
to a neighborhood near you, if they're not already there. Some things are too fast
to be caught by hand. We can't pick them up on the cameras, so we set up traps
around New York City and the parks. This is one of our most common activities. Here's some of my students
and collaborators getting the traps out and ready. This guy, we catch in almost
every forested area in New York City. This is the white-footed mouse -- not the mouse you find
running around your apartment. This is a native species,
been here long before humans. You find them in forests and meadows. Because they're so common
in forested areas in the city, we're using them as a model
to understand how species are adapting to urban environments. So if you think back 400 years ago, the five boroughs would've been covered
in forests and other types of vegetation. This mouse would've been everywhere
[in] huge populations that showed few genetic differences
across the landscape. But if you look at the situation today, they're just stuck in these little islands
of forest scattered around the city. Just using 18 short segments of DNA,
we can pretty much take a mouse somebody could give us a mouse,
not tell us where it was from, and we could determine
what park it came from. That's how different they've become. You'll notice in the middle
of this figure, there are some mixed-up colors. There are a few parks in the city
that are still connected to each other with strips of forest,
so the mice can run back and forth and spread their genes,
so they don't become different. But throughout the city, they're mostly
becoming different in the parks. So I'm telling you they're different,
but what does that mean? What's changing about their biology? To answer this question, we're sequencing thousands

**Transcript**:
(Music) Everything is everywhere these days. Check out the supermarket -- orange
juice from China, nuts from India, swordfish from Japan,
lagers from Czechoslovakia, scores of European cheeses. You name it, it's there.
Not when I was growing up. You'd never taste a range
of French cheeses or Bohemian lager beer. At least, you couldn't
unless you were very rich and could go anywhere when the fancy
took you. All that has changed. But it's not just foods. Got an iPhone? Everyone knows it was invented
and designed at Cupertino in California, but who knows where the complex bits and pieces of its
innards are made or assembled? Apple doesn't say. The industry credits China,
Japan, Germany, South Korea and, of course, the United States itself. Just think for a moment
of the trillions of parts and finished goods moving
cheaply around the world every second, a small portion by air, but most by sea. We call it globalization, but the man who basically made
globalization a reality in our lives is too little known. This is his story. The story of the man who makes your day. In the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of Americans were
out of work, worse than now, Malcolm McLean was a 24-year-old
truck driver. He got a job to take cotton bales from Fayetteville in North
Carolina all the way to a pier in Hoboken, New
Jersey for shipping overseas. He was glad of the work,
but when he arrived he got bored out of his mind,
sitting in his truck waiting and waiting
and waiting on the docks as the worker ants muscled crates
and bundles off other trucks and into slings that lifted the goods
into the hold of the ship. On board the ship itself, with much yelling and arm waving, the stevedores then unloaded each sling and saw its contents placed
in a designated position in the hold. Malcolm wasn't just bored, he was fuming. His income depended on getting
back to North Carolina to pick up more loads in his truck. Out of the frustration,
inspiration struck. Wouldn't it be great, he thought, if my trailer could be lifted and placed on the ship without its cotton bales being touched.
Yes, it would be great. It would be revolutionary. For centuries, general non-bulk cargo had been shipped
in the process he watched. It was called break bulk shipping. Boxes, bales, crates
handled piece by piece. What Malcolm envisaged
would have saved him only a day, but it would have saved everyone else something like two weeks
in loading and unloading the ship. On average, it was eight days to haul and distribute break
bulk shipments in the hold, plus another eight days at the other end to retrieve and distribute. All that time would have been saved if Malcolm McLean could have just
driven his truck onto the ship and at the other end, driven it off. Well, today that concept is a reality. The concept that occurred to Malcolm is known as containerization. It has done more than just
save a great deal of time. It's the reason why we have
a thriving global marketplace, offering us that infinite
variety of things, and it's the reason we can move cargo from remote parts
of the world at minimal cost. Malcolm had his idea in 1937. The 24-year-old truck driver
sitting in his truck in Hoboken was 40 before he did anything about it. By then, he'd built his one truck into a big trucking company.
He borrowed money from an enterprising vice president
at Citibank in New York, and set about designing the steel
boxes and the decks of the ships to carry them stacked
one on top of another. A lot of people thought he was crazy. Inventors always attract
armies of naysayers who can never remember
how critical they were. For our part, we should
remember Malcolm McLean. His first container ship, the Ideal X, sailed from Shed 154 at Marsh Street, Port Newark with 58 well-filled boxes. It was the beginning of the container era, shrinking our world and enlarging human choice.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it also deals with Malcolm McLean's experience as a truck driver.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more closely related to the content of the ground truth MCQ (i.e., what McLean wanted to ship overseas), I would say that none of the generated MCQs match.

But if I really had to choose, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it talks about McLean's idea and its impact on shipping, which is somewhat related to what he wanted to ship overseas.

So, my answer would be Question 6 (Index: 5), but please note that this is a very loose match and not a direct match.

However, I must emphasize that the correct approach would be to generate a new MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options.

Here is an example of a new generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ:

Question: What type of cargo did Malcolm McLean want to ship overseas when he was a truck driver?
Options: A. Aircraft parts and munitions during WWII, B. Natural gas and oil, C. Refrigerated foods, D. Chickens, E. Cotton Bales
Correct Option: E

of the trillions of parts and finished goods moving

globalization a reality in our lives is too little known. This is his story. The story of the man who makes your day. In the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of Americans were
out of work, worse than now, Malcolm McLean was a 24-year-old
truck driver. He got a job to take cotton bales from Fayetteville in North
Carolina all the way to a pier in Hoboken, New
Jersey for shipping overseas. He was glad of the work,
but when he arrived he got bored out of his mind,
sitting in his truck waiting and waiting
and waiting on the docks as the worker ants muscled crates
and bundles off other trucks and into slings that lifted the goods
into the hold of the ship. On board the ship itself, with much yelling and arm waving, the stevedores then unloaded each sling and saw its contents placed
in a designated position in the hold. Malcolm wasn't just bored, he was fuming. His income depended on getting
back to North Carolina to pick up more loads in his truck. Out of the frustration,
inspiration struck. Wouldn't it be great, he thought, if my trailer could be lifted and placed on the ship without its cotton bales being touched.
Yes, it would be great. It would be revolutionary. For centuries, general non-bulk cargo had been shipped
in the process he watched. It was called break bulk shipping. Boxes, bales, crates
handled piece by piece. What Malcolm envisaged
would have saved him only a day, but it would have saved everyone else something like two weeks
in loading and unloading the ship. On average, it was eight days to haul and distribute break
bulk shipments in the hold, plus another eight days at the other end to retrieve and distribute. All that time would have been saved if Malcolm McLean could have just
driven his truck onto the ship and at the other end, driven it off. Well, today that concept is a reality. The concept that occurred to Malcolm is known as containerization. It has done more than just
save a great deal of time. It's the reason why we have
a thriving global marketplace, offering us that infinite
variety of things, and it's the reason we can move cargo from remote parts
of the world at minimal cost. Malcolm had his idea in 1937. The 24-year-old truck driver
sitting in his truck in Hoboken was 40 before he did anything about it. By then, he'd built his one truck into a big trucking company.
He borrowed money from an enterprising vice president
at Citibank in New York, and set about designing the steel
boxes and the decks of the ships to carry them stacked
one on top of another. A lot of people thought he was crazy. Inventors always attract
armies of naysayers who can never remember
how critical they were. For our part, we should
remember Malcolm McLean. His first container ship, the Ideal X, sailed from Shed 154 at Marsh Street, Port Newark with 58 well-filled boxes. It was the beginning of the container era, shrinking our world and enlarging human choice.

Keep the body, take the money. Force feed my people deception and failure. Condition our brains to malfunction at the sight of success. Just keep the cycle going. Make us pay for an education that will end up failing us. Put us in debt so we're giving back the money we earned from our back-breaking work. This seems all too familiar. Sounds like the rust of shackles locking their way onto my degree. Sounds like the Thirteenth Amendment in reverse. Lecture halls shouldn't feel like cotton fields, shouldn't sound like muffled freedom songs trapped in the jaws of a generation's dreams. Oho! Oh, it all makes sense. Give us enough to get by but not enough to provide for ourselves. Keep us psychologically feeble so we lose our purpose in the process. Stop thieving our aspirations out of our sleep. Don't call it financial aid if you're not helping anyone with it. We have fought. We have fought way too hard to let green paper build a barricade in front of our futures. I will not let you potentially rob food out of my children's stomach. Best believe I'm going out blasting. I ain't no killer, but don't push me. I wish it didn't come to this, but I have to for my cousins in Haiti who don't even know what a college looks like, for my best friend Raymond sitting in cell block nine instead of a university, for the nooses hanging my GPA by its neck. There is no other option. There is no other way. Just, please, put the money in the bag. Put the money in the bag. I just want to go to school, man. I just want to get my education. I just want to learn. I just want to grow. Put the money in the bag, please. Just put the money in the bag.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is focused on identifying the speaker's use of simile in the monologue, while the generated MCQs cover a range of topics related to the monologue's content.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would select Question 7: "What is the tone of the speaker's language in the monologue?" This question is not directly related to simile, but it does touch on the speaker's use of language, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that specifically asks about the speaker's use of literary devices, such as simile, in the monologue.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 7 (with the caveat that it's not a good match)

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
We all know the scene: Dorothy closes her eyes, and repeats the Good Witch's mantra, "No coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile." Only Dorothy doesn't say that. She says five one-syllable words, "There's no place like home." Each a word you probably learned in your first year of speaking, each perfectly concise. It's not that L. Frank Baum didn't have a thesaurus, it's that in most cases $10 words fail. Would Aerosmith have had a hit with "Ambulate This Direction?" Probably not. Would Patrick Henry have ignited a revolution by saying, "Provide me with liberty or bestow upon me fatality?" Unlikely. When it comes to words, bigger isn't always better. Ten-dollar words are rendered worthless if they're not understood. That's not to say every piece of literature should be written at a fourth-grade reading level, but it is important to know your audience. If you're a novelist, your audience is probably expecting 300 pages of vivid descriptors. At the very least, they're expecting you won't use the same 50 words to fill those pages. But most of us don't have the luxury of a captive audience. We're competing against a whole world of distractions and we're fighting for space in an attention span that continues to shrink across generations. So get to the point already. Variety may be the spice of life, but brevity is its bread and butter. So when it comes to $10 words, save your money and buy a Scrabble board.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Here's why:

- Question intent: Both the ground truth MCQ and Question 8 are asking about the relationship between the use of ten-dollar words and the audience's understanding.
- Options: Both MCQs have options that mention the audience's understanding of ten-dollar words. The correct option in both cases suggests that ten-dollar words may not be understood by the audience.
- Content: Both MCQs are related to the idea that ten-dollar words can be ineffective if they are not understood by the audience, which is a key point made in the transcript.

However, it's worth noting that the ground truth MCQ has a more specific focus on why $10 words are a bad idea, and it has more options that cover different aspects of the author's argument. Question 8 is more narrowly focused on the relationship between ten-dollar words and the audience's understanding.

If I had to choose another option that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of its broader focus, I would suggest Question 5 or Question 2 in combination with Question 5. However, since I can only choose one question, I would say that Question 8 is the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a specific Wizard of Oz quotation that drives the point home, which is about the effectiveness of simple words. Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is the most relevant, as it asks about the main idea of the author's argument about using ten-dollar words, which is related to the idea that simple words can be more effective.

However, a closer match is not available among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, but it's still not a very close match.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest the most similar generated MCQ based on the question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the $10-word-title translation of Aerosmith's "Walk This Way." The most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 7 mentions Aerosmith as an example of someone who might not have been effective if they used ten-dollar words.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar enough to be considered a match. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 7 is the closest, although it's not a direct match.

But since it is not a direct match I will say that there is no match.

If you insist on an index I will say -1 (to denote no match).

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking about a specific historical figure mentioned in the transcript. The correct answer is Patrick Henry, who is mentioned as an example of someone who might not have been effective if he used ten-dollar words.

Among the generated MCQs, the one that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not directly asking about Patrick Henry, but Question 7 mentions Patrick Henry as an example. However, it's not asking about who Patrick Henry is, but rather about the common theme between the examples of Aerosmith and Patrick Henry.

There isn't a direct match, but if I had to choose the closest one, I would say Question 7 is the most similar, as it at least mentions Patrick Henry.

**Transcript**:
Are you familiar with the word symbiosis? It's a fancy term for a partnership
between two different species, such as bees and flowers. In a symbiosis, both species
depend on each other. I want to tell you
about a remarkable symbiosis between a little bird,
the Clark's nutcracker, and a big tree, the whitebark pine. Whitebark grow in the mountains
of Wyoming, Montana and other western states. They have huge canopies
and lots of needles, which provide cover and shelter
for other plants and animals, and whitebark feed the forest. Their cones are packed with protein. Squirrels gnaw the cones
from the upper branches so they fall to the ground, and then race down to bury them
in piles, or middens. But they don't get to keep all of them; grizzlies and black bears
love finding middens. But there's more to a symbiosis
than one species feeding another. In the case of the Clark's nutcracker,
this bird gives back. While gathering its seeds,
it also replants the trees. Here's how it works:
using her powerful beak, the nutcracker picks apart
a cone in a treetop, pulling out the seeds. She can store up to 80 of them
in a pouch in her throat. Then she flies through the forest looking for a place to cache the seeds an inch under the soil
in piles of up to eight seeds. Nutcrackers can gather
up to 90,000 seeds in the autumn, which they return for
in the winter and spring. And these birds are smart. They remember where all those seeds are. They even use landmarks
on the landscape -- trees, stumps, rocks -- to triangulate to caches
buried deep under the snow. What they don't go back and get,
those seeds become whitebark. This symbiosis is
so important to both species that they've changed,
or evolved, to suit each other. Nutcrackers have developed
long, tough beaks for extracting seeds from cones, and whitebarks' branches all sweep upwards with the cones at the very ends, so they can offer them
to the nutcrackers as they fly by. That's a symbiosis: Two species cooperating to help
each other for the benefit of all.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match.

Question 6 asks about an example of how Clark's nutcrackers and whitebark pines have evolved to suit each other, and one of the options (A) mentions that Clark's nutcrackers have developed long beaks to extract seeds from cones. This is related to the ground truth MCQ, which asks about how the Whitebark Pine benefits from its association with the Clark's Nutcracker, and the correct option (A) mentions that a single bird can "plant" up to 90,000 Whitebark Pine seeds each autumn.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of the benefit to the Whitebark Pine, I would say that Question 7 is a better match. Question 7 asks about the benefit of the symbiotic relationship between Clark's nutcrackers and whitebark pines, and one of the options (C) mentions that it allows both species to benefit and thrive.

But since neither of these questions is an exact match, I would recommend creating a new question that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose an index from the provided options, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is:

 Question 7

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the most similar generated MCQ would be:

**Question 3: What do whitebark pine cones contain that is essential for other species?**

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of the specific action of squirrels. A more relevant question would be one that involves the action of another species (squirrels) interacting with whitebark pine cones.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly involve squirrels, it can be concluded that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that **none** of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to pick the closest one in terms of content (not intent), it would be:

**Question 3** (only because it talks about whitebark pine cones, but it doesn't mention squirrels).

But since this is not a good match, I would say that the generated MCQs do not have a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If you want a numerical index, I would say **-1** (to indicate no match) or **3** (to indicate the closest match in terms of content, but not intent).

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the location where Whitebark Pine trees can be found. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the location of Whitebark Pine trees, Question 2 mentions the Whitebark Pine in the context of its symbiotic relationship with the Clark's nutcracker.

However, a more relevant question that provides information about the location of Whitebark Pine trees is not present among the generated MCQs. But if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the topic, I would suggest:

 Question 2: Which bird is involved in a symbiotic relationship with the whitebark pine? 

However, please note that this question does not directly ask about the location of Whitebark Pine trees.

If I had more generated MCQs that directly ask about the location of Whitebark Pine trees, I would be happy to re-evaluate and provide a more accurate answer.

So, with the available information, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 2

**Transcript**:
(Music) Sometimes when I'm on a long plane flight, I gaze out at all those mountains and deserts and try to get my head around how vast our Earth is. And then I remember that there's an object we see every day that would literally fit one million Earths inside it. The sun seems impossibly big, but in the great scheme of things, it's a pinprick, one of about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which you can see on a clear night as a pale, white mist 
stretched across the sky. And it gets worse. There are maybe 100 billion galaxies detectable by our telescopes, so if each star was the size of a single grain of sand, just the Milky Way has enough stars to fill a 30 foot by 30 foot stretch of beach three feet deep with sand. And the entire Earth doesn't have enough beaches to represent the stars in the overall universe. Such a beach would continue for literally hundreds of millions of miles. Holy Stephen Hawking, that is a lot of stars. But he and other physicists now believe in a reality that is unimaginably bigger still. I mean, first of all, the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescopes are probably a minuscule fraction of the total. Space itself is expanding at an accelerating pace. The vast majority of the galaxies are separating from us so fast that light from them may never reach us. Still, our physical reality here on Earth is intimately connected to those distant, invisible galaxies. We can think of them as part of our universe. They make up a single, giant edifice, obeying the same physical laws and all made from the same types of atoms, electrons, protons, quarks, neutrinos that make up you and me. However, recent theories in physics, including one called string theory, are now telling us there could be countless other universes, built on different types of particles, with different properties, obeying different laws. Most of these universes could never support life, and might flash in and out of existence in a nanosecond, but nonetheless, combined they make up a vast multiverse of possible universes. in up to 11 dimensions, featuring wonders beyond our wildest imagination. And the leading version of string theory predicts a multiverse made of up to 10 to the 500 universes. That's a one followed by 500 zeroes, a number so vast that if every atom in our observable universe had its own universe and all of the atoms in all of those universes each had their own universe, and you repeated that for two more cycles, you'd still be at a tiny fraction of the total -- namely, one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillionth. But even that number is minuscule compared to another number: infinity. Some physicists think the space-time continuum is literally infinite, and that it contains an infinite number of so-called pocket universes with varying properties. How's your brain doing? But quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle. I mean, the theory's been proven true beyond all doubt, but interpreting it is baffling. And some physicists think you can only un-baffle it if you imagine that huge numbers of parallel universes are being spawned every moment, and many of these universes would actually be very like the world we're in, would include multiple copies of you. In one such universe, you'd graduate with honors and marry the person of your dreams. In another, not so much. There are still some scientists who would say, hogwash. The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universes there are is one, only one universe. And a few philosophers and mystics might argue that even our own universe is an illusion. So, as you can see, right now there is no agreement on this question, not even close. All we know is, the answer is somewhere between zero and infinity. Well, I guess we know one other thing: This is a pretty cool time to be studying physics. We just might be undergoing the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge that humanity has ever seen.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**None of the above**

However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content, although it does not match exactly.

**Question 1: What is the approximate number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy, if each star is the size of a single grain of sand?**

This question has a similar intent of asking about a large quantity, but it is not about the number of Earths that can fit inside the sun.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

**Question 3: If each galaxy is the size of a single grain of sand, how many galaxies would fit in a 30 foot by 30 foot stretch of beach three feet deep?**

However, this question is still not about the number of Earths that can fit inside the sun.

Since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly, I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ more closely.

If I had to provide an index, I would say:

**Index: None**

However, if I had to choose an index from the existing generated MCQs, I would say:

**Index: 3 (with a note that it's not a perfect match)**

**Transcript**:
(Music) Sometimes when I'm on a long plane flight, I gaze out at all those mountains and deserts and try to get my head around how vast our Earth is. And then I remember that there's an object we see every day that would literally fit one million Earths inside it. The sun seems impossibly big, but in the great scheme of things, it's a pinprick, one of about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which you can see on a clear night as a pale, white mist 
stretched across the sky. And it gets worse. There are maybe 100 billion galaxies detectable by our telescopes, so if each star was the size of a single grain of sand, just the Milky Way has enough stars to fill a 30 foot by 30 foot stretch of beach three feet deep with sand. And the entire Earth doesn't have enough beaches to represent the stars in the overall universe. Such a beach would continue for literally hundreds of millions of miles. Holy Stephen Hawking, that is a lot of stars. But he and other physicists now believe in a reality that is unimaginably bigger still. I mean, first of all, the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescopes are probably a minuscule fraction of the total. Space itself is expanding at an accelerating pace. The vast majority of the galaxies are separating from us so fast that light from them may never reach us. Still, our physical reality here on Earth is intimately connected to those distant, invisible galaxies. We can think of them as part of our universe. They make up a single, giant edifice, obeying the same physical laws and all made from the same types of atoms, electrons, protons, quarks, neutrinos that make up you and me. However, recent theories in physics, including one called string theory, are now telling us there could be countless other universes, built on different types of particles, with different properties, obeying different laws. Most of these universes could never support life, and might flash in and out of existence in a nanosecond, but nonetheless, combined they make up a vast multiverse of possible universes. in up to 11 dimensions, featuring wonders beyond our wildest imagination. And the leading version of string theory predicts a multiverse made of up to 10 to the 500 universes. That's a one followed by 500 zeroes, a number so vast that if every atom in our observable universe had its own universe and all of the atoms in all of those universes each had their own universe, and you repeated that for two more cycles, you'd still be at a tiny fraction of the total -- namely, one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillionth. But even that number is minuscule compared to another number: infinity. Some physicists think the space-time continuum is literally infinite, and that it contains an infinite number of so-called pocket universes with varying properties. How's your brain doing? But quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle. I mean, the theory's been proven true beyond all doubt, but interpreting it is baffling. And some physicists think you can only un-baffle it if you imagine that huge numbers of parallel universes are being spawned every moment, and many of these universes would actually be very like the world we're in, would include multiple copies of you. In one such universe, you'd graduate with honors and marry the person of your dreams. In another, not so much. There are still some scientists who would say, hogwash. The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universes there are is one, only one universe. And a few philosophers and mystics might argue that even our own universe is an illusion. So, as you can see, right now there is no agreement on this question, not even close. All we know is, the answer is somewhere between zero and infinity. Well, I guess we know one other thing: This is a pretty cool time to be studying physics. We just might be undergoing the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge that humanity has ever seen.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that is most similar in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the term used to describe a reality made up of many universes. The most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 5 mentions the multiverse, which is the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ.

However, a closer look at the generated MCQs reveals that none of them directly ask about the term used to describe a reality made up of many universes. But Question 4 and Question 5 do mention the multiverse concept.

Considering the options and content, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar generated MCQ, but it's not a perfect match.

Translator: Jenny Zurawell One of the funny things
about owning a brain is that you have
no control over the things that it gathers and holds onto,
the facts and the stories. And as you get older, it only gets worse. Things stick around for years sometimes before you understand
why you're interested in them, before you understand their import to you. Here's three of mine. When Richard Feynman
was a young boy in Queens, he went for a walk with his dad
and his wagon and a ball. He noticed that when he pulled the wagon,
the ball went to the back of the wagon. He asked his dad, "Why does
the ball go to the back of the wagon?" And his dad said, "That's inertia." He said, "What's inertia?"
And his dad said, "Ah. Inertia is the name that scientists give to the phenomenon of the ball
going to the back of the wagon." (Laughter) "But in truth, nobody really knows." Feynman went on to earn degrees at MIT, Princeton, he solved
the Challenger disaster, he ended up winning
the Nobel Prize in Physics for his Feynman diagrams, describing
the movement of subatomic particles. And he credits that conversation
with his father as giving him a sense that the simplest questions could carry
you out to the edge of human knowledge, and that that's where he wanted to play. And play he did. Eratosthenes was the third librarian
at the great Library of Alexandria, and he made many contributions to science. But the one he is most remembered for began in a letter that he received
as the librarian, from the town of Swenet,
which was south of Alexandria. The letter included this fact
that stuck in Eratosthenes' mind, and the fact was that the writer said, at noon on the solstice,
when he looked down this deep well, he could see his reflection at the bottom, and he could also see
that his head was blocking the sun. I should tell you -- the idea
that Christopher Columbus discovered that the world
is spherical is total bull. It's not true at all. In fact, everyone who was educated
understood that the world was spherical since Aristotle's time. Aristotle had proved it
with a simple observation. He noticed that every time you saw
the Earth's shadow on the Moon, it was circular, and the only shape that constantly
creates a circular shadow is a sphere, Q.E.D. the Earth is round. But nobody knew how big it was until Eratosthenes got
this letter with this fact. So he understood that the sun
was directly above the city of Swenet, because looking down a well,
it was a straight line all the way down the well,
right past the guy's head up to the sun. Eratosthenes knew another fact. He knew that a stick stuck
in the ground in Alexandria at the same time
and the same day, at noon, the sun's zenith, on the solstice, the sun cast a shadow that showed
that it was 7.2 degrees off-axis. If you know the circumference of a circle,
and you have two points on it, all you need to know is the distance
between those two points, and you can extrapolate the circumference. 360 degrees divided by 7.2 equals 50. I know it's a little bit
of a round number, and it makes me suspicious
of this story too, but it's a good story,
so we'll continue with it. He needed to know the distance
between Swenet and Alexandria, which is good because Eratosthenes
was good at geography. In fact, he invented the word geography. (Laughter) The road between Swenet and Alexandria
was a road of commerce, and commerce needed to know
how long it took to get there. It needed to know the exact distance,
so he knew very precisely that the distance between
the two cities was 500 miles. Multiply that times 50, you get 25,000, which is within one percent
of the actual diameter of the Earth. He did this 2,200 years ago. Now, we live in an age where multi-billion-dollar pieces of machinery
are looking for the Higgs boson. We're discovering particles that may travel faster
than the speed of light, and all of these discoveries
are made possible by technology that's been developed
in the last few decades. But for most of human history, we had to discover these things using
our eyes and our ears and our minds. Armand Fizeau was
an experimental physicist in Paris. His specialty was actually refining
and confirming other people's results, and this might sound
like a bit of an also-ran, but in fact, this is the soul of science, because there is no such thing as a fact
that cannot be independently corroborated. And he was familiar
with Galileo's experiments in trying to determine
whether or not light had a speed. Galileo had worked out this
really wonderful experiment where he and his assistant had a lamp,
each one of them was holding a lamp. Galileo would open his lamp,
and his assistant would open his. They got the timing down really good. They just knew their timing. And then they stood at two hilltops, two miles distant,
and they did the same thing, on the assumption from Galileo
that if light had a discernible speed, he'd notice a delay in the light
coming back from his assistant's lamp. But light was too fast for Galileo. He was off by several orders
of magnitude when he assumed that light was roughly ten times
as fast as the speed of sound. Fizeau was aware of this experiment. He lived in Paris, and he set up
two experimental stations, roughly 5.5 miles distant, in Paris. And he solved this problem of Galileo's, and he did it with a really relatively
trivial piece of equipment. He did it with one of these. I'm going to put away
the clicker for a second because I want to engage
your brains in this. So this is a toothed wheel. It's got a bunch of notches
and it's got a bunch of teeth. This was Fizeau's solution
to sending discrete pulses of light. He put a beam behind one of these notches. If I point a beam
through this notch at a mirror, five miles away, that beam
is bouncing off the mirror and coming back to me through this notch. But something interesting happens
as he spins the wheel faster. He notices that it seems
like a door is starting to close on the light beam
that's coming back to his eye. Why is that? It's because the pulse
of light is not coming back through the same notch. It's actually hitting a tooth. And he spins the wheel fast enough
and he fully occludes the light. And then, based on the distance
between the two stations and the speed of his wheel
and the number of notches in the wheel, he calculates the speed of light
to within two percent of its actual value. And he does this in 1849. This is what really gets me
going about science. Whenever I'm having trouble
understanding a concept, I go back and I research
the people that discovered that concept. I look at the story of how
they came to understand it. What happens when you look at what the discoverers
were thinking about when they made their discoveries, is you understand that
they are not so different from us. We are all bags of meat and water.
We all start with the same tools. I love the idea that different branches
of science are called fields of study. Most people think of science
as a closed, black box, when in fact it is an open field. And we are all explorers. The people that made these discoveries
just thought a little bit harder about what they were looking at,
and they were a little bit more curious. And their curiosity changed the way
people thought about the world, and thus it changed the world. They changed the world, and so can you. Thank you. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 6: What was the main contribution of Eratosthenes to science?**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that specifically asks about what prompted Eratosthenes to contemplate the circumference of the Earth.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one that is closest in terms of content and intent, I would choose:

**Question 3: According to Eratosthenes, what was the circumference of the Earth?**

This question is related to Eratosthenes' contribution to science, but it does not specifically ask about what prompted him to contemplate the circumference of the Earth.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is **Question 3**, although it is not a perfect match.

However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new question that specifically asks about what prompted Eratosthenes to contemplate the circumference of the Earth would be a better match.

Here is an example of a new question that would be a better match:

**Question: What prompted Eratosthenes to calculate the circumference of the Earth?**
Options: A. A letter he received from a resident of the city of Swenet, B. A dream his wife had, C. A lunar eclipse, D. His correspondence with Archimedes

This new question exactly matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent.

Translator: Jenny Zurawell One of the funny things
about owning a brain is that you have
no control over the things that it gathers and holds onto,
the facts and the stories. And as you get older, it only gets worse. Things stick around for years sometimes before you understand
why you're interested in them, before you understand their import to you. Here's three of mine. When Richard Feynman
was a young boy in Queens, he went for a walk with his dad
and his wagon and a ball. He noticed that when he pulled the wagon,
the ball went to the back of the wagon. He asked his dad, "Why does
the ball go to the back of the wagon?" And his dad said, "That's inertia." He said, "What's inertia?"
And his dad said, "Ah. Inertia is the name that scientists give to the phenomenon of the ball
going to the back of the wagon." (Laughter) "But in truth, nobody really knows." Feynman went on to earn degrees at MIT, Princeton, he solved
the Challenger disaster, he ended up winning
the Nobel Prize in Physics for his Feynman diagrams, describing
the movement of subatomic particles. And he credits that conversation
with his father as giving him a sense that the simplest questions could carry
you out to the edge of human knowledge, and that that's where he wanted to play. And play he did. Eratosthenes was the third librarian
at the great Library of Alexandria, and he made many contributions to science. But the one he is most remembered for began in a letter that he received
as the librarian, from the town of Swenet,
which was south of Alexandria. The letter included this fact
that stuck in Eratosthenes' mind, and the fact was that the writer said, at noon on the solstice,
when he looked down this deep well, he could see his reflection at the bottom, and he could also see
that his head was blocking the sun. I should tell you -- the idea
that Christopher Columbus discovered that the world
is spherical is total bull. It's not true at all. In fact, everyone who was educated
understood that the world was spherical since Aristotle's time. Aristotle had proved it
with a simple observation. He noticed that every time you saw
the Earth's shadow on the Moon, it was circular, and the only shape that constantly
creates a circular shadow is a sphere, Q.E.D. the Earth is round. But nobody knew how big it was until Eratosthenes got
this letter with this fact. So he understood that the sun
was directly above the city of Swenet, because looking down a well,
it was a straight line all the way down the well,
right past the guy's head up to the sun. Eratosthenes knew another fact. He knew that a stick stuck
in the ground in Alexandria at the same time
and the same day, at noon, the sun's zenith, on the solstice, the sun cast a shadow that showed
that it was 7.2 degrees off-axis. If you know the circumference of a circle,
and you have two points on it, all you need to know is the distance
between those two points, and you can extrapolate the circumference. 360 degrees divided by 7.2 equals 50. I know it's a little bit
of a round number, and it makes me suspicious
of this story too, but it's a good story,
so we'll continue with it. He needed to know the distance
between Swenet and Alexandria, which is good because Eratosthenes
was good at geography. In fact, he invented the word geography. (Laughter) The road between Swenet and Alexandria
was a road of commerce, and commerce needed to know
how long it took to get there. It needed to know the exact distance,
so he knew very precisely that the distance between
the two cities was 500 miles. Multiply that times 50, you get 25,000, which is within one percent
of the actual diameter of the Earth. He did this 2,200 years ago. Now, we live in an age where multi-billion-dollar pieces of machinery
are looking for the Higgs boson. We're discovering particles that may travel faster
than the speed of light, and all of these discoveries
are made possible by technology that's been developed
in the last few decades. But for most of human history, we had to discover these things using
our eyes and our ears and our minds. Armand Fizeau was
an experimental physicist in Paris. His specialty was actually refining
and confirming other people's results, and this might sound
like a bit of an also-ran, but in fact, this is the soul of science, because there is no such thing as a fact
that cannot be independently corroborated. And he was familiar
with Galileo's experiments in trying to determine
whether or not light had a speed. Galileo had worked out this
really wonderful experiment where he and his assistant had a lamp,
each one of them was holding a lamp. Galileo would open his lamp,
and his assistant would open his. They got the timing down really good. They just knew their timing. And then they stood at two hilltops, two miles distant,
and they did the same thing, on the assumption from Galileo
that if light had a discernible speed, he'd notice a delay in the light
coming back from his assistant's lamp. But light was too fast for Galileo. He was off by several orders
of magnitude when he assumed that light was roughly ten times
as fast as the speed of sound. Fizeau was aware of this experiment. He lived in Paris, and he set up
two experimental stations, roughly 5.5 miles distant, in Paris. And he solved this problem of Galileo's, and he did it with a really relatively
trivial piece of equipment. He did it with one of these. I'm going to put away
the clicker for a second because I want to engage
your brains in this. So this is a toothed wheel. It's got a bunch of notches
and it's got a bunch of teeth. This was Fizeau's solution
to sending discrete pulses of light. He put a beam behind one of these notches. If I point a beam
through this notch at a mirror, five miles away, that beam
is bouncing off the mirror and coming back to me through this notch. But something interesting happens
as he spins the wheel faster. He notices that it seems
like a door is starting to close on the light beam
that's coming back to his eye. Why is that? It's because the pulse
of light is not coming back through the same notch. It's actually hitting a tooth. And he spins the wheel fast enough
and he fully occludes the light. And then, based on the distance
between the two stations and the speed of his wheel
and the number of notches in the wheel, he calculates the speed of light
to within two percent of its actual value. And he does this in 1849. This is what really gets me
going about science. Whenever I'm having trouble
understanding a concept, I go back and I research
the people that discovered that concept. I look at the story of how
they came to understand it. What happens when you look at what the discoverers
were thinking about when they made their discoveries, is you understand that
they are not so different from us. We are all bags of meat and water.
We all start with the same tools. I love the idea that different branches
of science are called fields of study. Most people think of science
as a closed, black box, when in fact it is an open field. And we are all explorers. The people that made these discoveries
just thought a little bit harder about what they were looking at,
and they were a little bit more curious. And their curiosity changed the way
people thought about the world, and thus it changed the world. They changed the world, and so can you. Thank you. (Applause)

of light is not coming back through the same notch. It's actually hitting a tooth. And he spins the wheel fast enough
and he fully occludes the light. And then, based on the distance
between the two stations and the speed of his wheel
and the number of notches in the wheel, he calculates the speed of light
to within two percent of its actual value. And he does this in 1849. This is what really gets me
going about science. Whenever I'm having trouble
understanding a concept, I go back and I research
the people that discovered that concept. I look at the story of how
they came to understand it. What happens when you look at what the discoverers
were thinking about when they made their discoveries, is you understand that
they are not so different from us. We are all bags of meat and water.
We all start with the same tools. I love the idea that different branches
of science are called fields of study. Most people think of science
as a closed, black box, when in fact it is an open field. And we are all explorers. The people that made these discoveries
just thought a little bit harder about what they were looking at,
and they were a little bit more curious. And their curiosity changed the way
people thought about the world, and thus it changed the world. They changed the world, and so can you. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So I'm here today to encourage
you to think about New York City, and not just as one
of humanity's greatest achievements, but as home to native wildlife that are subject to a grand
evolutionary experiment. So take this forested hillside
in Northern Manhattan, for example. This is one of the last areas
left in the city where there's clean spring water
seeping out of the ground. You could drink this
out of your hands and you'd be OK. These tiny little areas of seeping water contain huge populations
of northern dusky salamanders. These guys were common in the city
maybe 60 years ago, but now they're just stuck
on this single hillside and a few places in Staten Island. Not only do they suffer the indignity
of being stuck on this hillside, but we divided the hillside in two on two different occasions with bridges crossing
from the Bronx into Manhattan. But they're still there,
on either side of the bridges, where you see the red arrows --
about 180th Street, 167th Street. My lab has found that if you just take
a few segments of DNA from salamanders in those two locations, you can tell which side
of the bridge they came from. We built this single piece
of infrastructure that's changed their evolutionary history. We can go study these guys,
we just go to the hillside we know where they are,
we flip over rocks so we can catch them. There are a lot of other things
in New York City, though, that are not that easy to capture,
such as this guy, a coyote. We caught him on an automatic camera trap
in an undisclosed location; I'm not allowed to talk about it yet. But they're moving into New York City
for the first time. They're very flexible,
intelligent animals. This is one of this year's pups
checking out one of our cameras. And my colleagues and I
are very interested in understanding how they're going to spread
through the area, how they're going to survive here
and maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming
to a neighborhood near you, if they're not already there. Some things are too fast
to be caught by hand. We can't pick them up on the cameras, so we set up traps
around New York City and the parks. This is one of our most common activities. Here's some of my students
and collaborators getting the traps out and ready. This guy, we catch in almost
every forested area in New York City. This is the white-footed mouse -- not the mouse you find
running around your apartment. This is a native species,
been here long before humans. You find them in forests and meadows. Because they're so common
in forested areas in the city, we're using them as a model
to understand how species are adapting to urban environments. So if you think back 400 years ago, the five boroughs would've been covered
in forests and other types of vegetation. This mouse would've been everywhere
[in] huge populations that showed few genetic differences
across the landscape. But if you look at the situation today, they're just stuck in these little islands
of forest scattered around the city. Just using 18 short segments of DNA,
we can pretty much take a mouse somebody could give us a mouse,
not tell us where it was from, and we could determine
what park it came from. That's how different they've become. You'll notice in the middle
of this figure, there are some mixed-up colors. There are a few parks in the city
that are still connected to each other with strips of forest,
so the mice can run back and forth and spread their genes,
so they don't become different. But throughout the city, they're mostly
becoming different in the parks. So I'm telling you they're different,
but what does that mean? What's changing about their biology? To answer this question, we're sequencing thousands
of genes from our city mice and comparing those to thousands
of genes from the country mice, so, their ancestors
outside of New York City in these big, more wilderness areas. Now, genes are short segments of DNA
that code for amino acids. And amino acids are
the building blocks of proteins. If a single base pair changes in a gene, you can get a different amino acid, which will then change the shape
and structure of the protein. If you change the structure of a protein, you often change something
about what it does in the organism. Now if that change leads to a longer
life or more babies for a mouse, something evolutionary
biologists call fitness, then that single base-pair change
will spread quickly in an urban population. So this crazy figure
is called a Manhattan plot, because it kind of looks like a skyline. Each dot represents one gene, and the higher the dot is in the plot, the more different it is
between city and country mice. The ones kind of at the tips
of the skyscrapers are the most different, especially those above the red line. And these genes encode for things
like immune response to disease, because there might be more disease
in very dense, urban populations; metabolism, how the mice use energy; and heavy-metal tolerance. You guys can probably predict that New York City soils
are pretty contaminated with lead and chromium
and that sort of thing. And now our hard work is really starting. We're going back into the wilds
of New York City parks, following the lives of individual mice and seeing exactly
what these genes are doing for them. And I would encourage you guys
to try to look at your parks in a new way. I'm not going to be
the next Charles Darwin, but one of you guys might be,
so just keep your eyes open. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So I'm here today to encourage
you to think about New York City, and not just as one
of humanity's greatest achievements, but as home to native wildlife that are subject to a grand
evolutionary experiment. So take this forested hillside
in Northern Manhattan, for example. This is one of the last areas
left in the city where there's clean spring water
seeping out of the ground. You could drink this
out of your hands and you'd be OK. These tiny little areas of seeping water contain huge populations
of northern dusky salamanders. These guys were common in the city
maybe 60 years ago, but now they're just stuck
on this single hillside and a few places in Staten Island. Not only do they suffer the indignity
of being stuck on this hillside, but we divided the hillside in two on two different occasions with bridges crossing
from the Bronx into Manhattan. But they're still there,
on either side of the bridges, where you see the red arrows --
about 180th Street, 167th Street. My lab has found that if you just take
a few segments of DNA from salamanders in those two locations, you can tell which side
of the bridge they came from. We built this single piece
of infrastructure that's changed their evolutionary history. We can go study these guys,
we just go to the hillside we know where they are,
we flip over rocks so we can catch them. There are a lot of other things
in New York City, though, that are not that easy to capture,
such as this guy, a coyote. We caught him on an automatic camera trap
in an undisclosed location; I'm not allowed to talk about it yet. But they're moving into New York City
for the first time. They're very flexible,
intelligent animals. This is one of this year's pups
checking out one of our cameras. And my colleagues and I
are very interested in understanding how they're going to spread
through the area, how they're going to survive here
and maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming
to a neighborhood near you, if they're not already there. Some things are too fast
to be caught by hand. We can't pick them up on the cameras, so we set up traps
around New York City and the parks. This is one of our most common activities. Here's some of my students
and collaborators getting the traps out and ready. This guy, we catch in almost
every forested area in New York City. This is the white-footed mouse -- not the mouse you find
running around your apartment. This is a native species,
been here long before humans. You find them in forests and meadows. Because they're so common
in forested areas in the city, we're using them as a model
to understand how species are adapting to urban environments. So if you think back 400 years ago, the five boroughs would've been covered
in forests and other types of vegetation. This mouse would've been everywhere
[in] huge populations that showed few genetic differences
across the landscape. But if you look at the situation today, they're just stuck in these little islands
of forest scattered around the city. Just using 18 short segments of DNA,
we can pretty much take a mouse somebody could give us a mouse,
not tell us where it was from, and we could determine
what park it came from. That's how different they've become. You'll notice in the middle
of this figure, there are some mixed-up colors. There are a few parks in the city
that are still connected to each other with strips of forest,
so the mice can run back and forth and spread their genes,
so they don't become different. But throughout the city, they're mostly
becoming different in the parks. So I'm telling you they're different,
but what does that mean? What's changing about their biology? To answer this question, we're sequencing thousands
of genes from our city mice and comparing those to thousands
of genes from the country mice, so, their ancestors
outside of New York City in these big, more wilderness areas. Now, genes are short segments of DNA
that code for amino acids. And amino acids are
the building blocks of proteins. If a single base pair changes in a gene, you can get a different amino acid, which will then change the shape
and structure of the protein. If you change the structure of a protein, you often change something
about what it does in the organism. Now if that change leads to a longer
life or more babies for a mouse, something evolutionary
biologists call fitness, then that single base-pair change
will spread quickly in an urban population. So this crazy figure
is called a Manhattan plot, because it kind of looks like a skyline. Each dot represents one gene, and the higher the dot is in the plot, the more different it is
between city and country mice. The ones kind of at the tips
of the skyscrapers are the most different, especially those above the red line. And these genes encode for things
like immune response to disease, because there might be more disease
in very dense, urban populations; metabolism, how the mice use energy; and heavy-metal tolerance. You guys can probably predict that New York City soils
are pretty contaminated with lead and chromium
and that sort of thing. And now our hard work is really starting. We're going back into the wilds
of New York City parks, following the lives of individual mice and seeing exactly
what these genes are doing for them. And I would encourage you guys
to try to look at your parks in a new way. I'm not going to be
the next Charles Darwin, but one of you guys might be,
so just keep your eyes open. Thank you. (Applause)

(Music) Everything is everywhere these days. Check out the supermarket -- orange
juice from China, nuts from India, swordfish from Japan,
lagers from Czechoslovakia, scores of European cheeses. You name it, it's there.
Not when I was growing up. You'd never taste a range
of French cheeses or Bohemian lager beer. At least, you couldn't
unless you were very rich and could go anywhere when the fancy
took you. All that has changed. But it's not just foods. Got an iPhone? Everyone knows it was invented
and designed at Cupertino in California, but who knows where the complex bits and pieces of its
innards are made or assembled? Apple doesn't say. The industry credits China,
Japan, Germany, South Korea and, of course, the United States itself. Just think for a moment
of the trillions of parts and finished goods moving
cheaply around the world every second, a small portion by air, but most by sea. We call it globalization, but the man who basically made
globalization a reality in our lives is too little known. This is his story. The story of the man who makes your day. In the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of Americans were
out of work, worse than now, Malcolm McLean was a 24-year-old
truck driver. He got a job to take cotton bales from Fayetteville in North
Carolina all the way to a pier in Hoboken, New
Jersey for shipping overseas. He was glad of the work,
but when he arrived he got bored out of his mind,
sitting in his truck waiting and waiting
and waiting on the docks as the worker ants muscled crates
and bundles off other trucks and into slings that lifted the goods
into the hold of the ship. On board the ship itself, with much yelling and arm waving, the stevedores then unloaded each sling and saw its contents placed
in a designated position in the hold. Malcolm wasn't just bored, he was fuming. His income depended on getting
back to North Carolina to pick up more loads in his truck. Out of the frustration,
inspiration struck. Wouldn't it be great, he thought, if my trailer could be lifted and placed on the ship without its cotton bales being touched.
Yes, it would be great. It would be revolutionary. For centuries, general non-bulk cargo had been shipped
in the process he watched. It was called break bulk shipping. Boxes, bales, crates
handled piece by piece. What Malcolm envisaged
would have saved him only a day, but it would have saved everyone else something like two weeks
in loading and unloading the ship. On average, it was eight days to haul and distribute break
bulk shipments in the hold, plus another eight days at the other end to retrieve and distribute. All that time would have been saved if Malcolm McLean could have just
driven his truck onto the ship and at the other end, driven it off. Well, today that concept is a reality. The concept that occurred to Malcolm is known as containerization. It has done more than just
save a great deal of time. It's the reason why we have
a thriving global marketplace, offering us that infinite
variety of things, and it's the reason we can move cargo from remote parts
of the world at minimal cost. Malcolm had his idea in 1937. The 24-year-old truck driver
sitting in his truck in Hoboken was 40 before he did anything about it. By then, he'd built his one truck into a big trucking company.
He borrowed money from an enterprising vice president
at Citibank in New York, and set about designing the steel
boxes and the decks of the ships to carry them stacked
one on top of another. A lot of people thought he was crazy. Inventors always attract
armies of naysayers who can never remember
how critical they were. For our part, we should
remember Malcolm McLean. His first container ship, the Ideal X, sailed from Shed 154 at Marsh Street, Port Newark with 58 well-filled boxes. It was the beginning of the container era, shrinking our world and enlarging human choice.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
(Music) Everything is everywhere these days. Check out the supermarket -- orange
juice from China, nuts from India, swordfish from Japan,
lagers from Czechoslovakia, scores of European cheeses. You name it, it's there.
Not when I was growing up. You'd never taste a range
of French cheeses or Bohemian lager beer. At least, you couldn't
unless you were very rich and could go anywhere when the fancy
took you. All that has changed. But it's not just foods. Got an iPhone? Everyone knows it was invented
and designed at Cupertino in California, but who knows where the complex bits and pieces of its
innards are made or assembled? Apple doesn't say. The industry credits China,
Japan, Germany, South Korea and, of course, the United States itself. Just think for a moment
of the trillions of parts and finished goods moving
cheaply around the world every second, a small portion by air, but most by sea. We call it globalization, but the man who basically made
globalization a reality in our lives is too little known. This is his story. The story of the man who makes your day. In the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of Americans were
out of work, worse than now, Malcolm McLean was a 24-year-old
truck driver. He got a job to take cotton bales from Fayetteville in North
Carolina all the way to a pier in Hoboken, New
Jersey for shipping overseas. He was glad of the work,
but when he arrived he got bored out of his mind,
sitting in his truck waiting and waiting
and waiting on the docks as the worker ants muscled crates
and bundles off other trucks and into slings that lifted the goods
into the hold of the ship. On board the ship itself, with much yelling and arm waving, the stevedores then unloaded each sling and saw its contents placed
in a designated position in the hold. Malcolm wasn't just bored, he was fuming. His income depended on getting
back to North Carolina to pick up more loads in his truck. Out of the frustration,
inspiration struck. Wouldn't it be great, he thought, if my trailer could be lifted and placed on the ship without its cotton bales being touched.
Yes, it would be great. It would be revolutionary. For centuries, general non-bulk cargo had been shipped
in the process he watched. It was called break bulk shipping. Boxes, bales, crates
handled piece by piece. What Malcolm envisaged
would have saved him only a day, but it would have saved everyone else something like two weeks
in loading and unloading the ship. On average, it was eight days to haul and distribute break
bulk shipments in the hold, plus another eight days at the other end to retrieve and distribute. All that time would have been saved if Malcolm McLean could have just
driven his truck onto the ship and at the other end, driven it off. Well, today that concept is a reality. The concept that occurred to Malcolm is known as containerization. It has done more than just
save a great deal of time. It's the reason why we have
a thriving global marketplace, offering us that infinite
variety of things, and it's the reason we can move cargo from remote parts
of the world at minimal cost. Malcolm had his idea in 1937. The 24-year-old truck driver
sitting in his truck in Hoboken was 40 before he did anything about it. By then, he'd built his one truck into a big trucking company.
He borrowed money from an enterprising vice president
at Citibank in New York, and set about designing the steel
boxes and the decks of the ships to carry them stacked
one on top of another. A lot of people thought he was crazy. Inventors always attract
armies of naysayers who can never remember
how critical they were. For our part, we should
remember Malcolm McLean. His first container ship, the Ideal X, sailed from Shed 154 at Marsh Street, Port Newark with 58 well-filled boxes. It was the beginning of the container era, shrinking our world and enlarging human choice.

Give us enough to get by but not enough to provide for ourselves. Keep us psychologically feeble so we lose our purpose in the process. Stop thieving our aspirations out of our sleep. Don't call it financial aid if you're not helping anyone with it. We have fought. We have fought way too hard to let green paper build a barricade in front of our futures.

There is no other option. There is no other way. Just, please, put the money in the bag. Put the money in the bag. I just want to go to school, man. I just want to get my education. I just want to learn. I just want to grow. Put the money in the bag, please. Just put the money in the bag.

We all know the scene: Dorothy closes her eyes, and repeats the Good Witch's mantra, "No coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile." Only Dorothy doesn't say that. She says five one-syllable words, "There's no place like home." Each a word you probably learned in your first year of speaking, each perfectly concise. It's not that L. Frank Baum didn't have a thesaurus, it's that in most cases $10 words fail. Would Aerosmith have had a hit with "Ambulate This Direction?" Probably not. Would Patrick Henry have ignited a revolution by saying, "Provide me with liberty or bestow upon me fatality?" Unlikely. When it comes to words, bigger isn't always better. Ten-dollar words are rendered worthless if they're not understood. That's not to say every piece of literature should be written at a fourth-grade reading level, but it is important to know your audience. If you're a novelist, your audience is probably expecting 300 pages of vivid descriptors. At the very least, they're expecting you won't use the same 50 words to fill those pages. But most of us don't have the luxury of a captive audience. We're competing against a whole world of distractions and we're fighting for space in an attention span that continues to shrink across generations. So get to the point already. Variety may be the spice of life, but brevity is its bread and butter. So when it comes to $10 words, save your money and buy a Scrabble board.

**Transcript**:
Are you familiar with the word symbiosis? It's a fancy term for a partnership
between two different species, such as bees and flowers. In a symbiosis, both species
depend on each other. I want to tell you
about a remarkable symbiosis between a little bird,
the Clark's nutcracker, and a big tree, the whitebark pine. Whitebark grow in the mountains
of Wyoming, Montana and other western states. They have huge canopies
and lots of needles, which provide cover and shelter
for other plants and animals, and whitebark feed the forest. Their cones are packed with protein. Squirrels gnaw the cones
from the upper branches so they fall to the ground, and then race down to bury them
in piles, or middens. But they don't get to keep all of them; grizzlies and black bears
love finding middens. But there's more to a symbiosis
than one species feeding another. In the case of the Clark's nutcracker,
this bird gives back. While gathering its seeds,
it also replants the trees. Here's how it works:
using her powerful beak, the nutcracker picks apart
a cone in a treetop, pulling out the seeds. She can store up to 80 of them
in a pouch in her throat. Then she flies through the forest looking for a place to cache the seeds an inch under the soil
in piles of up to eight seeds. Nutcrackers can gather
up to 90,000 seeds in the autumn, which they return for
in the winter and spring. And these birds are smart. They remember where all those seeds are. They even use landmarks
on the landscape -- trees, stumps, rocks -- to triangulate to caches
buried deep under the snow. What they don't go back and get,
those seeds become whitebark. This symbiosis is
so important to both species that they've changed,
or evolved, to suit each other. Nutcrackers have developed
long, tough beaks for extracting seeds from cones, and whitebarks' branches all sweep upwards with the cones at the very ends, so they can offer them
to the nutcrackers as they fly by. That's a symbiosis: Two species cooperating to help
each other for the benefit of all.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What’s a simple definition of symbiosis?
Options: A. Two or more species occupying the same habitat who “specialize” and thus avoid competing with one another for resources, B. It’s what results from convergent evolution, C.

**Transcript**:
Are you familiar with the word symbiosis? It's a fancy term for a partnership
between two different species, such as bees and flowers. In a symbiosis, both species
depend on each other. I want to tell you
about a remarkable symbiosis between a little bird,
the Clark's nutcracker, and a big tree, the whitebark pine. Whitebark grow in the mountains
of Wyoming, Montana and other western states. They have huge canopies
and lots of needles, which provide cover and shelter
for other plants and animals, and whitebark feed the forest. Their cones are packed with protein. Squirrels gnaw the cones
from the upper branches so they fall to the ground, and then race down to bury them
in piles, or middens. But they don't get to keep all of them; grizzlies and black bears
love finding middens. But there's more to a symbiosis
than one species feeding another. In the case of the Clark's nutcracker,
this bird gives back. While gathering its seeds,
it also replants the trees. Here's how it works:
using her powerful beak, the nutcracker picks apart
a cone in a treetop, pulling out the seeds. She can store up to 80 of them
in a pouch in her throat. Then she flies through the forest looking for a place to cache the seeds an inch under the soil
in piles of up to eight seeds. Nutcrackers can gather
up to 90,000 seeds in the autumn, which they return for
in the winter and spring. And these birds are smart. They remember where all those seeds are. They even use landmarks
on the landscape -- trees, stumps, rocks -- to triangulate to caches
buried deep under the snow. What they don't go back and get,
those seeds become whitebark. This symbiosis is
so important to both species that they've changed,
or evolved, to suit each other. Nutcrackers have developed
long, tough beaks for extracting seeds from cones, and whitebarks' branches all sweep upwards with the cones at the very ends, so they can offer them
to the nutcrackers as they fly by. That's a symbiosis: Two species cooperating to help
each other for the benefit of all.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How does the Whitebark Pine benefit from its association with the Clark’s Nutcracker?

**Transcript**:
(Music) Sometimes when I'm on a long plane flight, I gaze out at all those mountains and deserts and try to get my head around how vast our Earth is. And then I remember that there's an object we see every day that would literally fit one million Earths inside it. The sun seems impossibly big, but in the great scheme of things, it's a pinprick, one of about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which you can see on a clear night as a pale, white mist 
stretched across the sky. And it gets worse. There are maybe 100 billion galaxies detectable by our telescopes, so if each star was the size of a single grain of sand, just the Milky Way has enough stars to fill a 30 foot by 30 foot stretch of beach three feet deep with sand. And the entire Earth doesn't have enough beaches to represent the stars in the overall universe. Such a beach would continue for literally hundreds of millions of miles. Holy Stephen Hawking, that is a lot of stars. But he and other physicists now believe in a reality that is unimaginably bigger still. I mean, first of all, the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescopes are probably a minuscule fraction of the total. Space itself is expanding at an accelerating pace. The vast majority of the galaxies are separating from us so fast that light from them may never reach us. Still, our physical reality here on Earth is intimately connected to those distant, invisible galaxies. We can think of them as part of our universe. They make up a single, giant edifice, obeying the same physical laws and all made from the same types of atoms, electrons, protons, quarks, neutrinos that make up you and me. However, recent theories in physics, including one called string theory, are now telling us there could be countless other universes, built on different types of particles, with different properties, obeying different laws. Most of these universes could never support life, and might flash in and out of existence in a nanosecond, but nonetheless, combined they make up a vast multiverse of possible universes. in up to 11 dimensions, featuring wonders beyond our wildest imagination. And the leading version of string theory predicts a multiverse made of up to 10 to the 500 universes. That's a one followed by 500 zeroes, a number so vast that if every atom in our observable universe had its own universe and all of the atoms in all of those universes each had their own universe, and you repeated that for two more cycles, you'd still be at a tiny fraction of the total -- namely, one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillionth. But even that number is minuscule compared to another number: infinity. Some physicists think the space-time continuum is literally infinite, and that it contains an infinite number of so-called pocket universes with varying properties. How's your brain doing? But quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle. I mean, the theory's been proven true beyond all doubt, but interpreting it is baffling. And some physicists think you can only un-baffle it if you imagine that huge numbers of parallel universes are being spawned every moment, and many of these universes would actually be very like the world we're in, would include multiple copies of you. In one such universe, you'd graduate with honors and marry the person of your dreams. In another, not so much. There are still some scientists who would say, hogwash. The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universes there are is one, only one universe. And a few philosophers and mystics might argue that even our own universe is an illusion. So, as you can see, right now there is no agreement on this question, not even close. All we know is, the answer is somewhere between zero and infinity. Well, I guess we know one other thing: This is a pretty cool time to be studying physics. We just might be undergoing the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge that humanity has ever seen.

**Transcript**:
(Music) Sometimes when I'm on a long plane flight, I gaze out at all those mountains and deserts and try to get my head around how vast our Earth is. And then I remember that there's an object we see every day that would literally fit one million Earths inside it. The sun seems impossibly big, but in the great scheme of things, it's a pinprick, one of about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which you can see on a clear night as a pale, white mist 
stretched across the sky. And it gets worse. There are maybe 100 billion galaxies detectable by our telescopes, so if each star was the size of a single grain of sand, just the Milky Way has enough stars to fill a 30 foot by 30 foot stretch of beach three feet deep with sand. And the entire Earth doesn't have enough beaches to represent the stars in the overall universe. Such a beach would continue for literally hundreds of millions of miles. Holy Stephen Hawking, that is a lot of stars. But he and other physicists now believe in a reality that is unimaginably bigger still. I mean, first of all, the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescopes are probably a minuscule fraction of the total. Space itself is expanding at an accelerating pace. The vast majority of the galaxies are separating from us so fast that light from them may never reach us. Still, our physical reality here on Earth is intimately connected to those distant, invisible galaxies. We can think of them as part of our universe. They make up a single, giant edifice, obeying the same physical laws and all made from the same types of atoms, electrons, protons, quarks, neutrinos that make up you and me. However, recent theories in physics, including one called string theory, are now telling us there could be countless other universes, built on different types of particles, with different properties, obeying different laws. Most of these universes could never support life, and might flash in and out of existence in a nanosecond, but nonetheless, combined they make up a vast multiverse of possible universes. in up to 11 dimensions, featuring wonders beyond our wildest imagination. And the leading version of string theory predicts a multiverse made of up to 10 to the 500 universes. That's a one followed by 500 zeroes, a number so vast that if every atom in our observable universe had its own universe and all of the atoms in all of those universes each had their own universe, and you repeated that for two more cycles, you'd still be at a tiny fraction of the total -- namely, one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillionth. But even that number is minuscule compared to another number: infinity. Some physicists think the space-time continuum is literally infinite, and that it contains an infinite number of so-called pocket universes with varying properties. How's your brain doing? But quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle. I mean, the theory's been proven true beyond all doubt, but interpreting it is baffling. And some physicists think you can only un-baffle it if you imagine that huge numbers of parallel universes are being spawned every moment, and many of these universes would actually be very like the world we're in, would include multiple copies of you. In one such universe, you'd graduate with honors and marry the person of your dreams. In another, not so much. There are still some scientists who would say, hogwash. The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universes there are is one, only one universe. And a few philosophers and mystics might argue that even our own universe is an illusion. So, as you can see, right now there is no agreement on this question, not even close. All we know is, the answer is somewhere between zero and infinity. Well, I guess we know one other thing: This is a pretty cool time to be studying physics. We just might be undergoing the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge that humanity has ever seen.

Translator: Jenny Zurawell One of the funny things
about owning a brain is that you have
no control over the things that it gathers and holds onto,
the facts and the stories. And as you get older, it only gets worse. Things stick around for years sometimes before you understand
why you're interested in them, before you understand their import to you. Here's three of mine. When Richard Feynman
was a young boy in Queens, he went for a walk with his dad
and his wagon and a ball. He noticed that when he pulled the wagon,
the ball went to the back of the wagon. He asked his dad, "Why does
the ball go to the back of the wagon?" And his dad said, "That's inertia." He said, "What's inertia?"
And his dad said, "Ah. Inertia is the name that scientists give to the phenomenon of the ball
going to the back of the wagon." (Laughter) "But in truth, nobody really knows." Feynman went on to earn degrees at MIT, Princeton, he solved
the Challenger disaster, he ended up winning
the Nobel Prize in Physics for his Feynman diagrams, describing
the movement of subatomic particles. And he credits that conversation
with his father as giving him a sense that the simplest questions could carry
you out to the edge of human knowledge, and that that's where he wanted to play. And play he did. Eratosthenes was the third librarian
at the great Library of Alexandria, and he made many contributions to science. But the one he is most remembered for began in a letter that he received
as the librarian, from the town of Swenet,
which was south of Alexandria. The letter included this fact
that stuck in Eratosthenes' mind, and the fact was that the writer said, at noon on the solstice,
when he looked down this deep well, he could see his reflection at the bottom, and he could also see
that his head was blocking the sun. I should tell you -- the idea
that Christopher Columbus discovered that the world
is spherical is total bull. It's not true at all. In fact, everyone who was educated
understood that the world was spherical since Aristotle's time. Aristotle had proved it
with a simple observation. He noticed that every time you saw
the Earth's shadow on the Moon, it was circular, and the only shape that constantly
creates a circular shadow is a sphere, Q.E.D. the Earth is round. But nobody knew how big it was until Eratosthenes got
this letter with this fact. So he understood that the sun
was directly above the city of Swenet, because looking down a well,
it was a straight line all the way down the well,
right past the guy's head up to the sun. Eratosthenes knew another fact. He knew that a stick stuck
in the ground in Alexandria at the same time
and the same day, at noon, the sun's zenith, on the solstice, the sun cast a shadow that showed
that it was 7.2 degrees off-axis. If you know the circumference of a circle,
and you have two points on it, all you need to know is the distance
between those two points, and you can extrapolate the circumference. 360 degrees divided by 7.2 equals 50. I know it's a little bit
of a round number, and it makes me suspicious
of this story too, but it's a good story,
so we'll continue with it. He needed to know the distance
between Swenet and Alexandria, which is good because Eratosthenes
was good at geography. In fact, he invented the word geography. (Laughter) The road between Swenet and Alexandria
was a road of commerce, and commerce needed to know
how long it took to get there. It needed to know the exact distance,
so he knew very precisely that the distance between
the two cities was 500 miles. Multiply that times 50, you get 25,000, which is within one percent
of the actual diameter of the Earth. He did this 2,200 years ago. Now, we live in an age where multi-billion-dollar pieces of machinery
are looking for the Higgs boson. We're discovering particles that may travel faster
than the speed of light, and all of these discoveries
are made possible by technology that's been developed
in the last few decades. But for most of human history, we had to discover these things using
our eyes and our ears and our minds. Armand Fizeau was
an experimental physicist in Paris. His specialty was actually refining
and confirming other people's results, and this might sound
like a bit of an also-ran, but in fact, this is the soul of science, because there is no such thing as a fact
that cannot be independently corroborated. And he was familiar
with Galileo's experiments in trying to determine
whether or not light had a speed. Galileo had worked out this
really wonderful experiment where he and his assistant had a lamp,
each one of them was holding a lamp. Galileo would open his lamp,
and his assistant would open his. They got the timing down really good. They just knew their timing. And then they stood at two hilltops, two miles distant,
and they did the same thing, on the assumption from Galileo
that if light had a discernible speed, he'd notice a delay in the light
coming back from his assistant's lamp. But light was too fast for Galileo. He was off by several orders
of magnitude when he assumed that light was roughly ten times
as fast as the speed of sound. Fizeau was aware of this experiment. He lived in Paris, and he set up
two experimental stations, roughly 5.5 miles distant, in Paris. And he solved this problem of Galileo's, and he did it with a really relatively
trivial piece of equipment. He did it with one of these. I'm going to put away
the clicker for a second because I want to engage
your brains in this. So this is a toothed wheel. It's got a bunch of notches
and it's got a bunch of teeth. This was Fizeau's solution
to sending discrete pulses of light. He put a beam behind one of these notches. If I point a beam
through this notch at a mirror, five miles away, that beam
is bouncing off the mirror and coming back to me through this notch. But something interesting happens
as he spins the wheel faster. He notices that it seems
like a door is starting to close on the light beam
that's coming back to his eye. Why is that? It's because the pulse
of light is not coming back through the same notch. It's actually hitting a tooth. And he spins the wheel fast enough
and he fully occludes the light. And then, based on the distance
between the two stations and the speed of his wheel
and the number of notches in the wheel, he calculates the speed of light
to within two percent of its actual value. And he does this in 1849. This is what really gets me
going about science. Whenever I'm having trouble
understanding a concept, I go back and I research
the people that discovered that concept. I look at the story of how
they came to understand it. What happens when you look at what the discoverers
were thinking about when they made their discoveries, is you understand that
they are not so different from us. We are all bags of meat and water.
We all start with the same tools. I love the idea that different branches
of science are called fields of study. Most people think of science
as a closed, black box, when in fact it is an open field. And we are all explorers. The people that made these discoveries
just thought a little bit harder about what they were looking at,
and they were a little bit more curious. And their curiosity changed the way
people thought about the world, and thus it changed the world. They changed the world, and so can you. Thank you. (Applause)

Translator: Jenny Zurawell One of the funny things
about owning a brain is that you have
no control over the things that it gathers and holds onto,
the facts and the stories. And as you get older, it only gets worse. Things stick around for years sometimes before you understand
why you're interested in them, before you understand their import to you. Here's three of mine. When Richard Feynman
was a young boy in Queens, he went for a walk with his dad
and his wagon and a ball. He noticed that when he pulled the wagon,
the ball went to the back of the wagon. He asked his dad, "Why does
the ball go to the back of the wagon?" And his dad said, "That's inertia." He said, "What's inertia?"
And his dad said, "Ah. Inertia is the name that scientists give to the phenomenon of the ball
going to the back of the wagon." (Laughter) "But in truth, nobody really knows." Feynman went on to earn degrees at MIT, Princeton, he solved
the Challenger disaster, he ended up winning
the Nobel Prize in Physics for his Feynman diagrams, describing
the movement of subatomic particles. And he credits that conversation
with his father as giving him a sense that the simplest questions could carry
you out to the edge of human knowledge, and that that's where he wanted to play. And play he did. Eratosthenes was the third librarian

And his dad said, "Ah. Inertia is the name that scientists give to the phenomenon of the ball
going to the back of the wagon." (Laughter) "But in truth, nobody really knows." Feynman went on to earn degrees at MIT, Princeton, he solved
the Challenger disaster, he ended up winning
the Nobel Prize in Physics for his Feynman diagrams, describing
the movement of subatomic particles. And he credits that conversation
with his father as giving him a sense that the simplest questions could carry
you out to the edge of human knowledge, and that that's where he wanted to play. And play he did. Eratosthenes was the third librarian
at the great Library of Alexandria, and he made many contributions to science. But the one he is most remembered for began in a letter that he received
as the librarian, from the town of Swenet,
which was south of Alexandria. The letter included this fact
that stuck in Eratosthenes' mind, and the fact was that the writer said, at noon on the solstice,
when he looked down this deep well, he could see his reflection at the bottom, and he could also see
that his head was blocking the sun. I should tell you -- the idea
that Christopher Columbus discovered that the world
is spherical is total bull. It's not true at all. In fact, everyone who was educated
understood that the world was spherical since Aristotle's time. Aristotle had proved it
with a simple observation. He noticed that every time you saw
the Earth's shadow on the Moon, it was circular, and the only shape that constantly
creates a circular shadow is a sphere, Q.E.D. the Earth is round. But nobody knew how big it was until Eratosthenes got
this letter with this fact. So he understood that the sun
was directly above the city of Swenet, because looking down a well,
it was a straight line all the way down the well,
right past the guy's head up to the sun. Eratosthenes knew another fact. He knew that a stick stuck
in the ground in Alexandria at the same time
and the same day, at noon, the sun's zenith, on the solstice, the sun cast a shadow that showed
that it was 7.2 degrees off-axis. If you know the circumference of a circle,
and you have two points on it, all you need to know is the distance
between those two points, and you can extrapolate the circumference. 360 degrees divided by 7.2 equals 50. I know it's a little bit
of a round number, and it makes me suspicious
of this story too, but it's a good story,
so we'll continue with it. He needed to know the distance
between Swenet and Alexandria, which is good because Eratosthenes
was good at geography. In fact, he invented the word geography. (Laughter) The road between Swenet and Alexandria
was a road of commerce, and commerce needed to know
how long it took to get there. It needed to know the exact distance,
so he knew very precisely that the distance between
the two cities was 500 miles. Multiply that times 50, you get 25,000, which is within one percent
of the actual diameter of the Earth. He did this 2,200 years ago. Now, we live in an age where multi-billion-dollar pieces of machinery
are looking for the Higgs boson. We're discovering particles that may travel faster
than the speed of light, and all of these discoveries
are made possible by technology that's been developed
in the last few decades. But for most of human history, we had to discover these things using
our eyes and our ears and our minds. Armand Fizeau was
an experimental physicist in Paris. His specialty was actually refining
and confirming other people's results, and this might sound
like a bit of an also-ran, but in fact, this is the soul of science, because there is no such thing as a fact
that cannot be independently corroborated. And he was familiar
with Galileo's experiments in trying to determine
whether or not light had a speed. Galileo had worked out this
really wonderful experiment where he and his assistant had a lamp,
each one of them was holding a lamp. Galileo would open his lamp,
and his assistant would open his. They got the timing down really good. They just knew their timing. And then they stood at two hilltops, two miles distant,
and they did the same thing, on the assumption from Galileo
that if light had a discernible speed, he'd notice a delay in the light
coming back from his assistant's lamp. But light was too fast for Galileo. He was off by several orders
of magnitude when he assumed that light was roughly ten times
as fast as the speed of sound. Fizeau was aware of this experiment. He lived in Paris, and he set up
two experimental stations, roughly 5.5 miles distant, in Paris. And he solved this problem of Galileo's, and he did it with a really relatively
trivial piece of equipment. He did it with one of these. I'm going to put away
the clicker for a second because I want to engage
your brains in this. So this is a toothed wheel. It's got a bunch of notches
and it's got a bunch of teeth. This was Fizeau's solution
to sending discrete pulses of light. He put a beam behind one of these notches. If I point a beam
through this notch at a mirror, five miles away, that beam
is bouncing off the mirror and coming back to me through this notch. But something interesting happens
as he spins the wheel faster. He notices that it seems
like a door is starting to close on the light beam
that's coming back to his eye. Why is that? It's because the pulse
of light is not coming back through the same notch. It's actually hitting a tooth. And he spins the wheel fast enough
and he fully occludes the light. And then, based on the distance
between the two stations and the speed of his wheel
and the number of notches in the wheel, he calculates the speed of light
to within two percent of its actual value. And he does this in 1849. This is what really gets me
going about science. Whenever I'm having trouble
understanding a concept, I go back and I research
the people that discovered that concept. I look at the story of how
they came to understand it. What happens when you look at what the discoverers
were thinking about when they made their discoveries, is you understand that
they are not so different from us. We are all bags of meat and water.
We all start with the same tools. I love the idea that different branches
of science are called fields of study. Most people think of science
as a closed, black box, when in fact it is an open field. And we are all explorers. The people that made these discoveries
just thought a little bit harder about what they were looking at,
and they were a little bit more curious. And their curiosity changed the way
people thought about the world, and thus it changed the world. They changed the world, and so can you. Thank you. (Applause)

Translator: Jenny Zurawell One of the funny things
about owning a brain is that you have
no control over the things that it gathers and holds onto,
the facts and the stories. And as you get older, it only gets worse. Things stick around for years sometimes before you understand
why you're interested in them, before you understand their import to you. Here's three of mine. When Richard Feynman
was a young boy in Queens, he went for a walk with his dad
and his wagon and a ball. He noticed that when he pulled the wagon,
the ball went to the back of the wagon. He asked his dad, "Why does
the ball go to the back of the wagon?" And his dad said, "That's inertia." He said, "What's inertia?"
