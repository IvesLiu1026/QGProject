**Transcript**:
Feldspar mineral...From the Ytterby Quarry.
How many elements does it contain? Shall we take it home? So terbium, just like europium, is often used
in television screens and various types of displays and where it comes
in is that it gives green and yellow colours, which in contrast to the red
and blue which europium gives you, gives you the full selection that
you need to give colour images. So Ytterby Gruva, Ytterby Mine, what a great
place, the snow is falling. This is designated Ytterby Mine, a historical
landmark for the discovery of four periodic elements: yttrium, terbium,
erbium, and ytterbium. Terbium was eventually discovered or eventually
isolated by the chemist Mosander in 1843. It was from an earth called
itrea which was originated in this quarry where we are right now in Ytterby
in Sweden. Terbium is a really unusual element. It’s a metal; moderate
abundance. It’s called a rare earth element, which is really quite
ironic because it’s not as rare as its name would suggest. The abundance is something
like 20 to 30 times that of silver, so I don’t think it’s
really rare. It doesn’t really have much biological activity but we do find terbium
within the bones in the human body and in animals but also within the kidneys
so you do find small concentrations but it doesn’t really have
a perceived biological activity. Terbium is also used in certain magnetic devices
and when you include it in certain alloys it forms magnetic devices
which increase or decrease in size depending on the strength or type of
magnetic field which they are placed into which has various technological
applications. So terbium alloys are really quite interesting because
they have what’s called magnetostrictive behaviour. So what that means
is that the size of the crystal or the size of the structure of the
alloy itself gets either larger or smaller when it’s exposed to a large or
strong magnetic field. So, there’s much research going into these terbium alloys
for small motors or small switches perhaps and also to use as strain
gauges and other types of really quite elaborate instruments. So these
may well provide us a lot of new research in the areas of nano-science
and nano-machines. Also, because of its fluorescence nature it’s
often used as a marker in biochemistry so if you want to stain cells
and determine whether certain types are present then you can use it for
that too. So in terms of day-to-day life, where do we
find terbium? Well we find it in unusual devices like energy-saving light-bulbs
because it stimulates or it increases the yield of light in the mercury
discharge that we use to run fluorescent strips. So we found it around
us in shops and houses, in factories, street-lighting, everywhere. But
what I think is a really quite nice and important application of terbium
is the fact that it’s used to make phosphorescent materials. So these are
materials which generate light or allow us to develop pictures if we
irradiate them with something like an x-ray. And, in fact, terbium is used
to make very, very high light yielding phosphors for use in screens and
visualisation screens for x- rays. So what this means is that if I go into
the hospital for diagnostic x- ray I no longer have to be exposed to long
periods of x-rays because the terbium screen allows the generation of
the pictures at much, much lower dose of x-ray. So it’s really quite
a significant advance. It’s really quite nice chemistry as well.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest the generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the use of antimony in creating harder bullets made of an alloy with a soft metal. The closest generated MCQ is not directly related to this topic, but Question 10 mentions a characteristic of antimony that makes it useful in electronics, which is its silvery metal property.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, I would suggest Question 6, which is about a mixture of antimony and indium used to make a semiconductor material. Although this question is not directly related to the use of antimony in creating harder bullets, it does mention the use of antimony in an alloy, which is similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 6

Please note that this is not a direct match, and the generated MCQs do not cover the specific topic of the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is related to the topic of strontium and its properties.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the color that strontium carbonate and other salts of this element give to fireworks. While none of the generated MCQs ask this specific question, Question 3 mentions the potential concern about strontium 90, and in the transcript, it is mentioned that strontium gives a "lovely red color" when it reacts with a combustion mixture.

Although this is not a direct match, the closest generated MCQ that relates to the properties of strontium is not available. However, I can suggest that Question 3 is the closest in terms of relevance to the topic, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that there is no direct match, but the closest related MCQ is Question 3, which is not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
So this is manganese metal. You know, very
often in chemistry we use manganese in the form of permanganate as an oxidizing agent
but this is manganese metal. Manganese is right in the middle of the row
of transition metals and it has 5 electrons, which can give it a really very rich chemistry. So here you can see it is a brand new sample
although the bottle looks very, very old, it is 100grams. So I am going to pour a small
amount of manganese out, so that we can have a closer look. One of the main uses of manganese at the moment
is as a catalyst for making the plastic which you find in plastic water bottles. You can
see my big display of water bottles up there. And manganese is a key catalyst in the reaction
between xylene, which is the raw material which you get from crude oil to make terephthalic
acid which is one of the components in this plastic. And the reason it is important is
that manganese can add and lose electrons which help in the reaction between xylene
and oxygen. There is some paper on the top. Manganese is also important in old batteries,
the older batteries that you used in torches, the sort that leaked, contained manganese
dioxide. So here we have the manganese and we are going
to pour a small amount out so that we can have a look at this element. And you can see
how the colour refracts off the top, really a quite lovely sample of the manganese metal
itself. So we are looking at manganese crystals growing from the surface because this material
would have been made from a high temperature, crystal growing-type process. So you can see
the manganese is growing and seeding new crystallites of the surface - seeding off in every direction.
It’s cool.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Manganese has a very rich chemistry. What are its oxidation states?
Options: A. 0, +2, +3, +4, +6, B. 0, +2, +3, +6, C. 0, +2, +3, +4, +6, +7
Correct Option: C

It helps to add and lose electrons in the battery reaction, C. It is a component of the battery's electrolyte, D. It is a component of the battery's anode Correct Option: B
Question 4: What is the significance of manganese's ability to add and lose electrons in the reaction between xylene and oxygen? Options: A. It helps to increase the temperature of the reaction, B. It helps to increase the rate of the reaction, C. It facilitates the reaction between xylene and oxygen, D. It has no significance in the reaction Correct Option: C
Question 5: What type of process is used to produce the manganese metal sample? Options: A. A high-temperature, high-temperature crystal growing-type process, B. A low-temperature crystal growing-type process, C. A chemical reaction process, D. A physical process Correct Option: A
Question 6: How can manganese be used to make new insights or solutions? Options: A. By combining it with other elements to create new compounds, B. By using it as a catalyst in different chemical reactions, C. By using it to add and lose electrons in different reactions, D. By using it to create new batteries Correct Option: B
Question 7: What is the primary advantage of using manganese as a catalyst in the production of plastic water bottles? Options: A. It increases the cost of production, B. It decreases the rate of the reaction, C. It facilitates the reaction between xylene and oxygen, D. It has no advantage Correct Option: C
Question 8: What is the significance of the color of the manganese metal sample? Options: A. It indicates the purity of the sample, B. It indicates the temperature at which the sample was produced, C. It indicates the crystal structure of the sample, D. It has no significance Correct Option: C
Question 9: What is the role of xylene in the production of plastic water bottles? Options: A. It is a component of the plastic, B. It is a raw material used to make terephthalic acid, C. It is a catalyst used in the reaction, D. It has no role Correct Option: B

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the oxidation states of manganese, while the generated MCQs cover various other topics related to manganese.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of manganese and its properties, I would select Question 2: "According to the transcript, how many electrons does manganese have?" This question is related to the properties of manganese, but it does not directly address the oxidation states.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 2. Please note that this is not a direct match, and the generated MCQs do not cover the specific topic of oxidation states.

dioxide. So here we have the manganese and we are going
to pour a small amount out so that we can have a look at this element. And you can see
how the colour refracts off the top, really a quite lovely sample of the manganese metal
itself. So we are looking at manganese crystals growing from the surface because this material
would have been made from a high temperature, crystal growing-type process. So you can see
the manganese is growing and seeding new crystallites of the surface - seeding off in every direction.
It’s cool.

So this is manganese metal. You know, very
often in chemistry we use manganese in the form of permanganate as an oxidizing agent
but this is manganese metal. Manganese is right in the middle of the row
of transition metals and it has 5 electrons, which can give it a really very rich chemistry. So here you can see it is a brand new sample
although the bottle looks very, very old, it is 100grams. So I am going to pour a small
amount of manganese out, so that we can have a closer look. One of the main uses of manganese at the moment
is as a catalyst for making the plastic which you find in plastic water bottles. You can
see my big display of water bottles up there. And manganese is a key catalyst in the reaction
between xylene, which is the raw material which you get from crude oil to make terephthalic
acid which is one of the components in this plastic. And the reason it is important is
that manganese can add and lose electrons which help in the reaction between xylene
and oxygen. There is some paper on the top. Manganese is also important in old batteries,
the older batteries that you used in torches, the sort that leaked, contained manganese
dioxide. So here we have the manganese and we are going
to pour a small amount out so that we can have a look at this element. And you can see

You might just want to sneak up so you don’t
sprinkle any dirt at the bottom of this place where we turned it over. Yeah ok. Look at that soil, it is all cake looking. Yeah it is. Where are we? Look up yonder. To the left Oh wow! Ok, let me get the soil before you start whacking
ok? Oh yeah. Salt blast covered. Here we can see evidence of the mining. Now
this mine closed, many years ago. The bottom is glass-covered Houston. Yeah, white glass. So if we look into the quarry in the normal
daylight in the absence of the snow it would look a bit like a lunar landscape. No the black stuff that is that stuff is crystal,
that is the crystal in rocks, Now I say that for one specific reason because
during the Apollo programme the astronauts  , they came back from the moon with bucket
loads and bucket loads of moon rock and dust. That part of it is. Very good. And upon analysis they were really, really
surprised to find that there were a number of elements including Yttrium which existed
at a much much higher abundance on the moon Which happens to be the deepest penetration
that bowler made. So we are in Ytterby in Sweden and it’s
a really nice day and we have come to the Ytterby Quarry, or Ytterby Groover, which
is actually the birthplace for 4 of the elements and really the one we are going to talk about
now is this one right here yttrium. It was first discovered in this quarry from a really
horrible black lump of mineral which people thought was coal. And over a period of 40
years from the late 1700s on, some scientists over in Arbo did a lot of work in refining
this material and they found a new earth or yttria. Ok this was yttrium and oxygen and
they couldn’t get the oxygen out by using traditional reductive methods, metal making
methods like burning with carbon and charcoal. So the yttria survived and it was known for
about 40 years before the German scientist Volla, decided to react the yttria with a
much more reactive element, potassium. The potassium wrestled and ripped out the oxygen
and he made yttrium metal for the first time. Yttrium its used in a whole range of different
things, it’s used in semi conductors, where there is yttrium, barium, copper oxides, the
1-2-3 complexes that we know of and it’s used for a whole range of applications. It’s
used in laser technologies to make very intense pulses of light, for technologies like CDs
and LEDs etc., etc., but a massive, massive area. Another activity of another use for yttrium
is actually in the use of yttrium oxisulphide which is used as an additive in glass it makes
glass really tough, like bullet proof glass it makes it very shock resistant and very
very resistant towards temperature changes, so it is a very useful additive in glasses
and glassy materials. Make sure you don’t fall over the rock So yttrium itself is a really quite nice lustrous
soft metal from group 3 of the periodic table, it burns really readily in an oxygen rich
atmosphere and reacts quite well with water in the atmosphere as well. So you have to
be very careful with yttrium because it oxidises and it is really quite easy to destroy. That’s Yttrium metal, just as turnings.
So we have to handle this under nitrogen because generally it will form an oxide layer and
then you would not be able to do any chemistry with it. Yttrium is an element which is not again particularly
widely studied in chemistry, much less so than its neighbour zirconium, and but again
it’s an area where chemists now are starting to focus rather more. If it is really finely divided then it might
burst into flames, in fact, all metals if they are finely divided they are quite likely
to spontaneously combust.

So, I think all good
tornado talks need to start with an awesome tornado shot. And this is not that awesome tornado shot. That was the first tornado I ever saw,
it was really cool, really scary, and I'm showing it to you guys because that's why I got
into the field in the first place. So even though it's a bad photograph, it was really cool
to be out there the first time. But now I'm taking real tornado footage. Fast forward a few years. This is a few years ago,
during a field project called VORTEX2, where myself and a bunch
of other scientists were out there, surrounding tornadoes
with different types of instrumentation and trying to figure out
how tornadoes form. It's a big question
we're trying to answer. It sounds like a very basic one, but it's something
we're still trying to figure out. We're also still trying to figure out
what the winds are like near the surface. We know what the winds are like
above building level, but we really don't know
what they're like at the surface and how that relates
to what we're seeing above building level. Most tornadoes form from what we call
supercell thunderstorms. Supercell thunderstorms
are what you commonly think of as tornado-raising storms. They're big, rotating thunderstorms that happen a lot of times
in the midsection of the United States. But the problem is that even though
they're rotating up above, it doesn't mean they're rotating
at the surface. And when we look at these storms and at these pictures
and at the data we have, they all kind of look the same. And it's really problematic if we're trying to make
tornado forecasts or warnings, because we only want to warn
or forecast about the storms that are going to actually make a tornado. One of the big, critical distinguishing
features, we think, between these storms, is something about
the rear-flank downdraft. So these big rotating thunderstorms
have this downdraft that wraps around the rear edge of it, hence the "rear-flank" downdraft. But we think how warm that is,
how buoyant that air is, and then also how strong
the updraft it's wrapping into, makes a big difference on whether or not
it's going to make a tornado. There's a lot more that goes into it -- I'll tell you about that in a second. Once you actually get a tornado,
again, the problem that we have is getting measurements near the surface. It's really hard to get measurements
near the surface -- most people don't want
to drive into tornadoes. There are a few exceptions;
you might have seen them on TV shows. But most people don't want to do that. Even getting instrumentation in the path
of the tornado is pretty tricky, too. Because, again, you don't want
to be that close to a tornado because sometimes the winds
around the tornado are strong as well. So getting information,
that critical location, is key for us because,
again, we don't know if the winds that we're seeing
above ground level, way above building level, actually map to the surface, if they're stronger, weaker,
or about the same as what we're seeing above buildings. The way we get at answering
a lot of these questions -- and I'm an observationalist;
I love to get out in the field, and collect data on tornadoes -- we compile a lot of observations. I work with this group
who operates mobile radars, and they're exactly
what they say -- basically, a radar on the back of a big blue truck, and we drive up really close
to tornadoes to map out the winds. We map out the precipitation. We map out all these
different things that are going on in order to better understand
the processes in these storms. And that bottom there,
that's what a tornado looks like when you're looking at it
with a mobile radar, and really close. Also, what we do is a lot of modeling, so we do a lot of computer
models and simulations, because the atmosphere
is governed by the laws of physics. So we can model the laws of physics and see where the tornado might go, where the storm might go, how strong the winds are near the surface and not actually have
to go out in the field. But of course, we want to have
both observations and modeling to move forward with the science. So, I showed you that video earlier
that went real quick, too. This is what it looks like,
looking at it with a radar. So you saw it visually, but this is what I get really excited
about when I see now in the field, stuff that looks like this. The really exciting thing
about looking at stuff like this is that we caught this storm
from when it didn't make a tornado to when it made a tornado and intensified and when it dissipated. This is the one of the rare data sets
that we have out there that were able to study
the entire life cycle of a tornado. I talked about how we think
that rear-flank downdraft is important because it tilts, there's a lot
of spin in the atmosphere, but the problem with
all this spin in the atmosphere is it needs to be oriented vertically, because that's what tornadoes are doing, and it needs to orientated
vertically near the ground. So we think this rear-flank
downdraft just pulses. And these pulses in this
rear-flank downdraft, we think, are very important
for converging that rotation, but also getting that rotation
into the right place. Other things we've learned is that we have gotten
a bunch of fortuitous measurements in the path of the tornadoes
and very near the surface. And we found out that the winds near the surface
are actually pretty comparable to what we're seeing 30, 40 meters
above ground level. So there's not a big reduction
in what we're seeing above the surface to what we're seeing at house level. And that was a pretty
surprising finding for us, because we kind of assumed
that the winds decrease pretty substantially near the surface. I'm going to end with this real quick. And this is not my last
tornado I ever saw, but I really like this image, because this was taken with one of those
mobile radars I was talking about. This is a tornado, not a hurricane, and this is what it looks like
when you're really close to it. And I find this amazing, that we can actually take technology
this close to these types of storms and see these inner workings. And for those of you who look
at tornado images often, you can see there's a lot going on --
there's rain spiraling, and you can actually see the debris cloud
associated with this tornado. I look forward to the future
and future technologies and being able to learn
a lot more about these storms, as the world advances, as you guys contribute to the science and we're able to really learn
more about how tornadoes form. Thank you. (Applause)

what they say -- basically, a radar on the back of a big blue truck, and we drive up really close
to tornadoes to map out the winds. We map out the precipitation. We map out all these
different things that are going on in order to better understand
the processes in these storms. And that bottom there,
that's what a tornado looks like when you're looking at it
with a mobile radar, and really close. Also, what we do is a lot of modeling, so we do a lot of computer
models and simulations, because the atmosphere
is governed by the laws of physics. So we can model the laws of physics and see where the tornado might go, where the storm might go, how strong the winds are near the surface and not actually have
to go out in the field. But of course, we want to have
both observations and modeling to move forward with the science. So, I showed you that video earlier
that went real quick, too. This is what it looks like,
looking at it with a radar. So you saw it visually, but this is what I get really excited
about when I see now in the field, stuff that looks like this. The really exciting thing
about looking at stuff like this is that we caught this storm
from when it didn't make a tornado to when it made a tornado and intensified and when it dissipated. This is the one of the rare data sets
that we have out there that were able to study
the entire life cycle of a tornado. I talked about how we think
that rear-flank downdraft is important because it tilts, there's a lot
of spin in the atmosphere, but the problem with
all this spin in the atmosphere is it needs to be oriented vertically, because that's what tornadoes are doing, and it needs to orientated
vertically near the ground. So we think this rear-flank
downdraft just pulses. And these pulses in this
rear-flank downdraft, we think, are very important
for converging that rotation, but also getting that rotation
into the right place. Other things we've learned is that we have gotten
a bunch of fortuitous measurements in the path of the tornadoes
and very near the surface. And we found out that the winds near the surface
are actually pretty comparable to what we're seeing 30, 40 meters
above ground level. So there's not a big reduction
in what we're seeing above the surface to what we're seeing at house level. And that was a pretty
surprising finding for us, because we kind of assumed
that the winds decrease pretty substantially near the surface. I'm going to end with this real quick. And this is not my last
tornado I ever saw, but I really like this image, because this was taken with one of those
mobile radars I was talking about. This is a tornado, not a hurricane, and this is what it looks like
when you're really close to it. And I find this amazing, that we can actually take technology
this close to these types of storms and see these inner workings. And for those of you who look
at tornado images often, you can see there's a lot going on --
there's rain spiraling, and you can actually see the debris cloud
associated with this tornado. I look forward to the future
and future technologies and being able to learn
a lot more about these storms, as the world advances, as you guys contribute to the science and we're able to really learn
more about how tornadoes form. Thank you. (Applause)

So, I think all good
tornado talks need to start with an awesome tornado shot. And this is not that awesome tornado shot. That was the first tornado I ever saw,
it was really cool, really scary, and I'm showing it to you guys because that's why I got
into the field in the first place. So even though it's a bad photograph, it was really cool
to be out there the first time. But now I'm taking real tornado footage. Fast forward a few years. This is a few years ago,
during a field project called VORTEX2, where myself and a bunch
of other scientists were out there, surrounding tornadoes
with different types of instrumentation and trying to figure out
how tornadoes form. It's a big question
we're trying to answer. It sounds like a very basic one, but it's something
we're still trying to figure out. We're also still trying to figure out
what the winds are like near the surface. We know what the winds are like
above building level, but we really don't know
what they're like at the surface and how that relates
to what we're seeing above building level. Most tornadoes form from what we call
supercell thunderstorms. Supercell thunderstorms
are what you commonly think of as tornado-raising storms. They're big, rotating thunderstorms that happen a lot of times
in the midsection of the United States. But the problem is that even though
they're rotating up above, it doesn't mean they're rotating
at the surface. And when we look at these storms and at these pictures
and at the data we have, they all kind of look the same. And it's really problematic if we're trying to make
tornado forecasts or warnings, because we only want to warn
or forecast about the storms that are going to actually make a tornado. One of the big, critical distinguishing
features, we think, between these storms, is something about
the rear-flank downdraft. So these big rotating thunderstorms
have this downdraft that wraps around the rear edge of it, hence the "rear-flank" downdraft. But we think how warm that is,
how buoyant that air is, and then also how strong
the updraft it's wrapping into, makes a big difference on whether or not
it's going to make a tornado. There's a lot more that goes into it -- I'll tell you about that in a second. Once you actually get a tornado,
again, the problem that we have is getting measurements near the surface. It's really hard to get measurements
near the surface -- most people don't want
to drive into tornadoes. There are a few exceptions;
you might have seen them on TV shows. But most people don't want to do that. Even getting instrumentation in the path
of the tornado is pretty tricky, too. Because, again, you don't want
to be that close to a tornado because sometimes the winds
around the tornado are strong as well. So getting information,
that critical location, is key for us because,
again, we don't know if the winds that we're seeing
above ground level, way above building level, actually map to the surface, if they're stronger, weaker,
or about the same as what we're seeing above buildings. The way we get at answering
a lot of these questions -- and I'm an observationalist;
I love to get out in the field, and collect data on tornadoes -- we compile a lot of observations. I work with this group
who operates mobile radars, and they're exactly

above ground level, way above building level, actually map to the surface, if they're stronger, weaker,
or about the same as what we're seeing above buildings. The way we get at answering
a lot of these questions -- and I'm an observationalist;
I love to get out in the field, and collect data on tornadoes -- we compile a lot of observations. I work with this group
who operates mobile radars, and they're exactly
what they say -- basically, a radar on the back of a big blue truck, and we drive up really close
to tornadoes to map out the winds. We map out the precipitation. We map out all these
different things that are going on in order to better understand
the processes in these storms. And that bottom there,
that's what a tornado looks like when you're looking at it
with a mobile radar, and really close. Also, what we do is a lot of modeling, so we do a lot of computer
models and simulations, because the atmosphere
is governed by the laws of physics. So we can model the laws of physics and see where the tornado might go, where the storm might go, how strong the winds are near the surface and not actually have
to go out in the field. But of course, we want to have
both observations and modeling to move forward with the science. So, I showed you that video earlier
that went real quick, too. This is what it looks like,
looking at it with a radar. So you saw it visually, but this is what I get really excited
about when I see now in the field, stuff that looks like this. The really exciting thing
about looking at stuff like this is that we caught this storm
from when it didn't make a tornado to when it made a tornado and intensified and when it dissipated. This is the one of the rare data sets
that we have out there that were able to study
the entire life cycle of a tornado. I talked about how we think
that rear-flank downdraft is important because it tilts, there's a lot
of spin in the atmosphere, but the problem with
all this spin in the atmosphere is it needs to be oriented vertically, because that's what tornadoes are doing, and it needs to orientated
vertically near the ground. So we think this rear-flank
downdraft just pulses. And these pulses in this
rear-flank downdraft, we think, are very important
for converging that rotation, but also getting that rotation
into the right place. Other things we've learned is that we have gotten
a bunch of fortuitous measurements in the path of the tornadoes
and very near the surface. And we found out that the winds near the surface
are actually pretty comparable to what we're seeing 30, 40 meters
above ground level. So there's not a big reduction
in what we're seeing above the surface to what we're seeing at house level. And that was a pretty
surprising finding for us, because we kind of assumed
that the winds decrease pretty substantially near the surface. I'm going to end with this real quick. And this is not my last
tornado I ever saw, but I really like this image, because this was taken with one of those
mobile radars I was talking about. This is a tornado, not a hurricane, and this is what it looks like
when you're really close to it. And I find this amazing, that we can actually take technology
this close to these types of storms and see these inner workings. And for those of you who look
at tornado images often, you can see there's a lot going on --
there's rain spiraling, and you can actually see the debris cloud
associated with this tornado. I look forward to the future
and future technologies and being able to learn
a lot more about these storms, as the world advances, as you guys contribute to the science and we're able to really learn
more about how tornadoes form. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see a blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task until now hello my name is Dennis Hong and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired so before I talk about this car foot of line let me briefly tell you about another project I worked on called the DARPA urban challenge now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself you press Start and nobody touches anything and can reach his destination fully autonomously so in 2007 our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition so about that time the National Federation of the blind or NFB challenged the research community about who can do up a car that said blind person drive safely and independently we decided to give it a try because we thought hey how hard could it be we just have a already autonomous vehicle we just put a blind person in it and we're done right we could have been more wrong what nfe wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive so I had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch so to test this crazy idea we drove a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the Ofili and in the summer of 2009 we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and give them a chance to give it for a spin it was an absolutely amazing experience but the problem of this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment and a flat closed up parking lot even the lane is defined by red traffic cones so with this success we decide to take the next big step to develop a real car that can be driven on the real roads so how does it work well it's a rather complex system but let me try to explain that make it simplified so we have three steps we have perception computation and non-visual interfaces now obviously the driver cannot see so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver for that we use a inertial measurement unit so it measures acceleration angular acts operation like a human ear inner ear we fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car we also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road and we also used three laser rangefinders the laser scan the environment to detect obstacles car approaching from the front the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads and the obstacles around the vehicle so all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer and the computer can do two things one is first of all process this information to have an understanding of the environment these are the lanes of the road there's an obstacles and convey this information to the driver the system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car so we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle but the problem is this how do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate off so he can drive so for this we developed many different type of non visual user interface technologies so starting from a three dimensional pinging sound system of vibrating vests click wheel with voice commands a leg strip even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot but today we're going to talk about three of these non visual user interfaces now the first interface is called a drive grip so these are a pair of gloves that has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so it can convey instructions about how to steer at the direction and the intensity another device is called speed strip so this is a chair as a matter of fact actually a massage chair we got it out and we rearrange these arriving elements and different patterns and we actuate them to convey information about the speed and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal so over here you can see how the computer understands the environments and because you cannot see the vibration we actually put red LEDs on the drive grip so you can actually see what's happening this is the sensory data and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer so these two devices drive grip and speed strip are very effective but the problem is these are instructional cue devices so this is not really freedom right the computer tells you how to drive turn left turn right speed up stop we call this the backseat driver problem right so we're moving away from these instructional cue devices and now focusing more on the informational devices a good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called air picks so think of it as a monitor for the blind so it's a small tablet has many holes in it and compressed air comes out so it can actually draw images so even though you're blind put your hand over it you can see the lanes of the road on obstacles this actually can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperatures it's actually multi-dimensional user interface so here you can see in the left camera on the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and says that information to the air picks for this we're showing a simulator a blind person driving using the air picks the simulator was also very useful for training the mind drivers and also quickly testing different type of ideas for a different type of non visual user interfaces so basically that's how it works so just a month ago in January 29th we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public at the world-famous Daytona International Speedway during the Rolex 24 racing event we also had some surprises let's take a look their first box and now let's see if Mark avoid he does he passes it on the right there's boxes out the fourth boxes out and he's perfectly making this play to continue Mark's gonna give me a ride back to the hotel so since we start this project will be getting hundreds of letters emails phone calls from people from all around the world letters thanking us but sometimes they also get funny letters like this one now understand there where there's Braille on a drive of ATM machine but sometimes but sometimes I also do get you know I wouldn't call it hate mail but letters of really strong concerns dr. Hong are you insane try to put blight people on the road you must be out of your mind but this vehicle is a prototype vehicle and it's not gonna be on the road until it's proven safe as or safer than today's vehicle and I truly believe this can't be happen but still with the society would they accept such a radical idea how we're going to handle insurance how are you going to issue a driving license there's many of these kind of different hurdles besides technology challenges that we to address before these firms in reality of course the main goal of this projects to develop a car for the blind but potentially more important than this is the the tremendous value of the spin-up technology that can come from this project the sensors that use can see through the dark the fog and rain and together it is new a new type of interfaces we can use these technologies that apply to safer cars for sighted people or for the blind everyday home appliances in the educational setting in the office setting just imagine in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what's written and reusing these non-visual interfaces this is priceless so today the things I've showed you today is just the beginning thank you very much

**Transcript**:
If I were to distill the 20 years of elephant research that I've done into one sentence, what would it be? What could I tell you? I would say that elephants are just like us! And what do I mean by that? It takes a lot of patience to be out there in the field and trying to figure out patterns of these very slow and intelligent animals. But over time, it is true they are very similar to us. And you think, "Well, how can I say that? Look, they have huge ears, they have really long noses. What do you mean they're like us?" Well, in fact, their families are very similar to ours. And family is extremely important to elephants. They grow up in very tight-knit families and they have extended families. And it's just like our family reunions where you have all the aunts gathering around with all the food they're going to bring and plan, and all the boys are thinking, "Are we going to play our video games together? Are we going to spar?" It's very, very similar, and it's jubilant, and screaming, yelling, it's really amazing to see. But, as soon as you get that family gathering, it's just like a wedding or anything else, all of the sudden the family politics come out, and the lower-ranking individuals in this scene, you see the arrow off to the back, the lower-ranking individuals already know their station, they're going to drink at the muddiest part of the pan because the whole family's here and we can't drink at the best water because that's reserved for the top-ranking family. What's also very similar is that you have elders in the group that everyone reveres. This is the matriarch, and the other female is reaching over and doing what's called a trunk to mouth placing her trunk in the mouth, and it's a sign of respect, it's kind of like a handshake, but it's also like a salute. And this salute is learned at a very young age. Now, ritual and bonding within the family also facilitates coordinated activities. So, here's a young female whose calf has fallen into the trough and she doesn't know what to do and she panics. Well, the older female, that's the matriarch, she says, "No problem here," she just scoops the baby out. Now, that's not true for a lot of different families, they can't coordinate very well, the younger females don't really know what to do, but the older ones will just get down, kneel down together and pick the baby out. Another thing that's very similar is the coming of age of teenage boys. Male elephants at the age of about 12 to 15. The biggest elephant in this photograph here is an elephant who's about the leave the family. He gets too big, he gets a little fresh, the adult females had enough of him, but he also is independent, he wants to go out and play with the guys. So what happens then is that you have this all male society, very ritual male society. Greg is our main dominant bull here, you can see him in the middle. He's got a huge posse, his following reveres him. And it's very interesting how very good leaders, very good dominant individuals know how to titrate the carrot and the stick. This guy's a master at it, and there's other bullies out there that want to kind of want to create their own little following, but they can't do it because they're too agressive. And so when he's not around they try and sweet talk the underlings to come into their fold, and they actually become less agressive. So it's very interesting to see how politics play out in these male and female societies. Now back to the ladies here. In a core family group you'll have a mother, maybe even a grandmother, her daughters and all of their offspring, the male and female calves. And what's very interesting here is that how character makes a difference. So each matriarch has a very different character. These two characters are kind of curious, they're uncertain, whereas these other two characters are really agressive. "We're going to charge first, ask questions later." But then there are also matriarchs that say, "Forget it! I'm going to run first and then figure it out when we're in the bush and it's safe." But the wisest matriarch, the matriarchs that succeed best in all of the studies that have been done, is the one that assesses the danger and decides is this worth running away from or is this not a big deal at all. Now being social is super important for elephants and of course right at the beginning, just like early childhood development, socialization is very important. Bathing together, eating together, playing together, rough housing, this is all very important for social development. And who hasn't tried to beat their sibling to the head of the line coming into the water hole? And these relationships from the beginning is just like best friends forever for real. These females are going to live together for life. Now if it's a male, female they might know each other for life, but it's really important to develop those bonds early on. Those are the relationships that are going to save you later. I'll show you a little schoolyard scenario here. Where, I think if you just focus on what's happening here you can see that we have the bully, he's pulling on the trunk of this baby calf, and then we have the diplomat who's reaching over and saying, "No, don't do that! Stop doing that!" And then, of course, we have the bystander. And how do you get these three different characters within the family? It's kind of fascinating to think that elephants really are just like us. And so I got curious about this and I thought, "Well, what if you measure the difference in character of a dominant female's calf versus a lower-ranking female's calf, and see what happens in their growing up." And so we started doing this. And you can see this little guy with his ears out, really charging at you. The difference between that character and the character who holds back, wants to touch mom, isn't so certain about what's going on here. But the other one's charging ahead all confident. Well, we started measuring how far away a calf will stray from mom, how often do they touch others, how often do they initiate play, and then look at the dominance of the females, of their mothers. And what we found is that socializing with the dominant calves actually socialize more significantly more than the lower-ranking calves. And what it looks like is it's not that the lower-ranking calves don't want to play, they're actually not allowed to interact with the higher-ranking calves. They get swatted away from the dominant females. and so this is kind of the downside of, okay we are very much like elephants, elephants are as much like us, but it's kind of for better or for worse because I can also see this happening in humans and maybe we should take a lesson from that. One last thing that we found is that the males will be the risk-takers, they're more independent and they're more likely to spend more time away from mom. And that's very true in human societies and with other social animals. So I hope I've convinced you that we have very similar lives to elephants and that elephants have very individual, durable characters that we've measured across years. The bully always tends to be the bully unless there's some kind of social upset, and he decides he better be a softy or else he's not going to gain favor at all. And then you have the gentle giants that are always going to be gentle. The young males really need mentoring from the elders, and those gentle giants are very good at doing that, soliciting them. Leaving family is a really hard things for the males, but they survive and they figure out who to hang out with. So, just to end here, I just wanted to say that since they are so similar to us, and have these characters, I hope when you see them on TV or you go out and you're lucky enough to see them in the wild, that maybe you'll think of them as individual characters deserving of our attention, and also deserving of our protection. Thank you.

**Transcript**:
If I were to distill the 20 years of elephant research that I've done into one sentence, what would it be? What could I tell you? I would say that elephants are just like us! And what do I mean by that? It takes a lot of patience to be out there in the field and trying to figure out patterns of these very slow and intelligent animals. But over time, it is true they are very similar to us. And you think, "Well, how can I say that? Look, they have huge ears, they have really long noses. What do you mean they're like us?" Well, in fact, their families are very similar to ours. And family is extremely important to elephants. They grow up in very tight-knit families and they have extended families. And it's just like our family reunions where you have all the aunts gathering around with all the food they're going to bring and plan, and all the boys are thinking, "Are we going to play our video games together? Are we going to spar?" It's very, very similar, and it's jubilant, and screaming, yelling, it's really amazing to see. But, as soon as you get that family gathering, it's just like a wedding or anything else, all of the sudden the family politics come out, and the lower-ranking individuals in this scene, you see the arrow off to the back, the lower-ranking individuals already know their station, they're going to drink at the muddiest part of the pan because the whole family's here and we can't drink at the best water because that's reserved for the top-ranking family. What's also very similar is that you have elders in the group that everyone reveres. This is the matriarch, and the other female is reaching over and doing what's called a trunk to mouth placing her trunk in the mouth, and it's a sign of respect, it's kind of like a handshake, but it's also like a salute. And this salute is learned at a very young age. Now, ritual and bonding within the family also facilitates coordinated activities. So, here's a young female whose calf has fallen into the trough and she doesn't know what to do and she panics. Well, the older female, that's the matriarch, she says, "No problem here," she just scoops the baby out. Now, that's not true for a lot of different families, they can't coordinate very well, the younger females don't really know what to do, but the older ones will just get down, kneel down together and pick the baby out. Another thing that's very similar is the coming of age of teenage boys. Male elephants at the age of about 12 to 15. The biggest elephant in this photograph here is an elephant who's about the leave the family. He gets too big, he gets a little fresh, the adult females had enough of him, but he also is independent, he wants to go out and play with the guys. So what happens then is that you have this all male society, very ritual male society. Greg is our main dominant bull here, you can see him in the middle. He's got a huge posse, his following reveres him. And it's very interesting how very good leaders, very good dominant individuals know how to titrate the carrot and the stick. This guy's a master at it, and there's other bullies out there that want to kind of want to create their own little following, but they can't do it because they're too agressive. And so when he's not around they try and sweet talk the underlings to come into their fold, and they actually become less agressive. So it's very interesting to see how politics play out in these male and female societies. Now back to the ladies here. In a core family group you'll have a mother, maybe even a grandmother, her daughters and all of their offspring, the male and female calves.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, I must note that the options in Question 6 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that describes the behavior of an extended family group of elephants meeting up at a waterhole.

Since none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that is closest in terms of question intent and content. In this case, I would recommend generating new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match, but with a low confidence score.

**Transcript**:
If I were to distill the 20 years of elephant research that I've done into one sentence, what would it be? What could I tell you? I would say that elephants are just like us! And what do I mean by that? It takes a lot of patience to be out there in the field and trying to figure out patterns of these very slow and intelligent animals. But over time, it is true they are very similar to us. And you think, "Well, how can I say that? Look, they have huge ears, they have really long noses. What do you mean they're like us?" Well, in fact, their families are very similar to ours. And family is extremely important to elephants. They grow up in very tight-knit families and they have extended families. And it's just like our family reunions where you have all the aunts gathering around with all the food they're going to bring and plan, and all the boys are thinking, "Are we going to play our video games together? Are we going to spar?" It's very, very similar, and it's jubilant, and screaming, yelling, it's really amazing to see. But, as soon as you get that family gathering, it's just like a wedding or anything else, all of the sudden the family politics come out, and the lower-ranking individuals in this scene, you see the arrow off to the back, the lower-ranking individuals already know their station, they're going to drink at the muddiest part of the pan because the whole family's here and we can't drink at the best water because that's reserved for the top-ranking family. What's also very similar is that you have elders in the group that everyone reveres. This is the matriarch, and the other female is reaching over and doing what's called a trunk to mouth placing her trunk in the mouth, and it's a sign of respect, it's kind of like a handshake, but it's also like a salute. And this salute is learned at a very young age. Now, ritual and bonding within the family also facilitates coordinated activities. So, here's a young female whose calf has fallen into the trough and she doesn't know what to do and she panics. Well, the older female, that's the matriarch, she says, "No problem here," she just scoops the baby out. Now, that's not true for a lot of different families, they can't coordinate very well, the younger females don't really know what to do, but the older ones will just get down, kneel down together and pick the baby out. Another thing that's very similar is the coming of age of teenage boys. Male elephants at the age of about 12 to 15. The biggest elephant in this photograph here is an elephant who's about the leave the family. He gets too big, he gets a little fresh, the adult females had enough of him, but he also is independent, he wants to go out and play with the guys. So what happens then is that you have this all male society, very ritual male society. Greg is our main dominant bull here, you can see him in the middle. He's got a huge posse, his following reveres him. And it's very interesting how very good leaders, very good dominant individuals know how to titrate the carrot and the stick. This guy's a master at it, and there's other bullies out there that want to kind of want to create their own little following, but they can't do it because they're too agressive. And so when he's not around they try and sweet talk the underlings to come into their fold, and they actually become less agressive. So it's very interesting to see how politics play out in these male and female societies. Now back to the ladies here. In a core family group you'll have a mother, maybe even a grandmother, her daughters and all of their offspring, the male and female calves. And what's very interesting here is that how character makes a difference. So each matriarch has a very different character. These two characters are kind of curious, they're uncertain, whereas these other two characters are really agressive. "We're going to charge first, ask questions later." But then there are also matriarchs that say, "Forget it! I'm going to run first and then figure it out when we're in the bush and it's safe." But the wisest matriarch, the matriarchs that succeed best in all of the studies that have been done, is the one that assesses the danger and decides is this worth running away from or is this not a big deal at all. Now being social is super important for elephants and of course right at the beginning, just like early childhood development, socialization is very important. Bathing together, eating together, playing together, rough housing, this is all very important for social development. And who hasn't tried to beat their sibling to the head of the line coming into the water hole? And these relationships from the beginning is just like best friends forever for real. These females are going to live together for life. Now if it's a male, female they might know each other for life, but it's really important to develop those bonds early on. Those are the relationships that are going to save you later. I'll show you a little schoolyard scenario here. Where, I think if you just focus on what's happening here you can see that we have the bully, he's pulling on the trunk of this baby calf, and then we have the diplomat who's reaching over and saying, "No, don't do that! Stop doing that!" And then, of course, we have the bystander. And how do you get these three different characters within the family? It's kind of fascinating to think that elephants really are just like us. And so I got curious about this and I thought, "Well, what if you measure the difference in character of a dominant female's calf versus a lower-ranking female's calf, and see what happens in their growing up." And so we started doing this. And you can see this little guy with his ears out, really charging at you. The difference between that character and the character who holds back, wants to touch mom, isn't so certain about what's going on here. But the other one's charging ahead all confident. Well, we started measuring how far away a calf will stray from mom, how often do they touch others, how often do they initiate play, and then look at the dominance of the females, of their mothers. And what we found is that socializing with the dominant calves actually socialize more significantly more than the lower-ranking calves. And what it looks like is it's not that the lower-ranking calves don't want to play, they're actually not allowed to interact with the higher-ranking calves. They get swatted away from the dominant females. and so this is kind of the downside of, okay we are very much like elephants, elephants are as much like us, but it's kind of for better or for worse because I can also see this happening in humans and maybe we should take a lesson from that. One last thing that we found is that the males will be the risk-takers, they're more independent and they're more likely to spend more time away from mom. And that's very true in human societies and with other social animals. So I hope I've convinced you that we have very similar lives to elephants and that elephants have very individual, durable characters that we've measured across years. The bully always tends to be the bully unless there's some kind of social upset, and he decides he better be a softy or else he's not going to gain favor at all. And then you have the gentle giants that are always going to be gentle. The young males really need mentoring from the elders, and those gentle giants are very good at doing that, soliciting them. Leaving family is a really hard things for the males, but they survive and they figure out who to hang out with. So, just to end here, I just wanted to say that since they are so similar to us, and have these characters, I hope when you see them on TV or you go out and you're lucky enough to see them in the wild, that maybe you'll think of them as individual characters deserving of our attention, and also deserving of our protection. Thank you.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although the wording of the questions is different, the intent and content of Question 5 are similar to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions discuss the relationship between a mother's status and her calf's behavior or character in elephant society. However, it's worth noting that the options in Question 5 do not directly address the transfer of status from mother to calf.

A more suitable generated MCQ would directly address the relationship between a mother's status and her calf's status or treatment in the family. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, Question 5 is the closest match based on the available options.

**Transcript**:
I was walking my mountain the other day, and I was feeling really at home with the forest. And I was so grateful to it for showing me that forests are built on relationships which form networks, like these beautiful river networks. And I thought, "Wow, forests are just like human families." And I was so taken by the beauty of this idea that I fell and I crashed down on the ground, and I hit my head on this new stump. And I was so angry! Then, I was so heartbroken because there was a whole family of trees cut down. Thing is, where I'm from in Western Canada, there's clearcuts like this hidden everywhere, and it wasn't until Google Earth starting sending images, like this, that we realized the whole world was wiping its noses on our old-growth forests. Did you know that deforestation like this around the world causes more greenhouse gas emissions than all the trains, planes and automobiles combined? Yeah, I'm really upset about this, but I'm also really hopeful because I've also discovered in my research that forest networks are organized in the same way as our own neural networks and our social networks. And I believe that if we can learn to integrate these into a whole that we can change this dangerous pathway of global warming because I believe we are wired for healing. So, here's the science: The most ancient of these networks is this below-ground fungal network, or mushroom network. And it evolved over a billion years ago to allow organisms to migrate from the ocean onto the land. And eventually, they got together with plants in this symbiosis. And this allowed plants to photosynthesize, pulling CO2, which is our biggest greenhouse gas, out of the atmosphere and giving off oxygen, which allows us to breathe and actually allowed humans to eventually evolve. Now, we call this symbiosis a mycorrhiza, myco for fungus, rrhiza for root. So, the fungus and root get together, and they trade for mutual benefit. Now, all trees in all forests all over the world depend on these mycorrhizas for their very survival. They can't live without them. And the way it works is that a seed falls on the forest floor, it germinates, it sends a root down into the soil, and it starts sending out chemical signals to the fungi to grow towards the root. And the fungus communicates back with its own signals, and it says to the root, 'You need to grow towards me and branch and soften.' And so by this communication, they grow together into this magical symbiosis. And the way that symbiosis works is the plant takes its hard-earned carbon from photosynthesis and brings it to the fungus because the fungus can't photosynthesize. And the fungus takes nutrients and water it gathers from the soil, where plant roots can't grow, and they give it to the plant. And so they're both benefiting in this cooperation. Now, as the fungus grows through the soil, it starts linking plant and plant and tree and tree together until the whole forest is linked together. Did you know that a single tree can be literally linked up to hundreds of other trees as far as the eye can see? And as you're walking through the forest, what you see, the trees, the roots, the mushrooms, are just the tip of the iceberg. Under a single footstep, there are 300 miles of fungal cells stacked end on end moving stuff around. And if you could look down into the ground, it would be like this super highway with cars going everywhere. Now, all networks are made of nodes and links. In forests, those nodes would be trees and the links fungi. It's kind of like in your Facebook network, where nodes would be friends and links would be your friendships. Now, we all know that some of those nodes, or friends, are busier than others, like that friend who is always sending out group messages. Well, it's the same in forests, and these nodes in forests, we call them hubs, they're the big trees in the forests with roots going everywhere. Now, we also have learned that the systems organized around these hubs, these big old trees, so in forests, that's where the regeneration occurs. In your Facebook network, that might be how parties are organized, around that hub that's always sending out the group messages. We call those hubs in forests mother trees; they're the big old trees in the forest. And they fix the carbon in their leaves, and they send it down through their massive trunks and into the networks all around them that are linked up to all the other trees and seedlings, the young ones, and they start sending that carbon everywhere. The more those seedlings are stressed out, maybe from drought or shade, the more the mother tree sends to them. It's kind of like in your families, where if you're kind of stressed out, mom and dad kick in and help you out a bit more, right? Well, it's the same in forests. The other thing that we've recently discovered is that mother trees will preferentially send more signals to her own kids, her own children. And then, this way she helps them do better, and then they survive more, and then they can pass their genes on to future generations. So, how natural selection works. Now, the way these forests are organized makes them both resilient and vulnerable. They're resilient because there's many mother trees, and there's many fungal species linking them together. And that network is really hard to break. It's pretty darn tough. But of course, we humans have figured out how to do that. And what we do is we take out the mother trees. And maybe taking one out won't make much difference but when you take more and more and more and clearcut and more and more and more that it can cause the system to collapse and fall down, like dominoes. And we can cross tipping points and cause more forest death and more global warming, and we're doing that. So what we do, our choices we make, can lead us towards global heatlh or global sickness. We do have choices. And I'm going to leave you with four ideas that I think are worth spreading. First one: To love the forest you have to go spend time in it. Go be in the forest, connect with it. And then you'll fight hard enough to protect them. Second: Learn how they work. Learn how those networks link things together in organized forests. And to do that, you gotta go out there take risks, make mistakes. Third: Protect forests. They need you to do that because they can't do it themselves. They're stuck in one spot. They can't run away from humans, and they can't run away from global warming. They need you. And finally, and most importantly, use your own very clever, brilliant, neural and social networks to create amazing messages, and spread the word that forests are worth saving because you're worth saving, and I believe that together we're all wired for healing.

**Transcript**:
I was walking my mountain the other day, and I was feeling really at home with the forest. And I was so grateful to it for showing me that forests are built on relationships which form networks, like these beautiful river networks. And I thought, "Wow, forests are just like human families." And I was so taken by the beauty of this idea that I fell and I crashed down on the ground, and I hit my head on this new stump. And I was so angry! Then, I was so heartbroken because there was a whole family of trees cut down. Thing is, where I'm from in Western Canada, there's clearcuts like this hidden everywhere, and it wasn't until Google Earth starting sending images, like this, that we realized the whole world was wiping its noses on our old-growth forests. Did you know that deforestation like this around the world causes more greenhouse gas emissions than all the trains, planes and automobiles combined? Yeah, I'm really upset about this, but I'm also really hopeful because I've also discovered in my research that forest networks are organized in the same way as our own neural networks and our social networks. And I believe that if we can learn to integrate these into a whole that we can change this dangerous pathway of global warming because I believe we are wired for healing. So, here's the science: The most ancient of these networks is this below-ground fungal network, or mushroom network. And it evolved over a billion years ago to allow organisms to migrate from the ocean onto the land. And eventually, they got together with plants in this symbiosis. And this allowed plants to photosynthesize, pulling CO2, which is our biggest greenhouse gas, out of the atmosphere and giving off oxygen, which allows us to breathe and actually allowed humans to eventually evolve. Now, we call this symbiosis a mycorrhiza, myco for fungus, rrhiza for root. So, the fungus and root get together, and they trade for mutual benefit. Now, all trees in all forests all over the world depend on these mycorrhizas for their very survival. They can't live without them. And the way it works is that a seed falls on the forest floor, it germinates, it sends a root down into the soil, and it starts sending out chemical signals to the fungi to grow towards the root. And the fungus communicates back with its own signals, and it says to the root, 'You need to grow towards me and branch and soften.' And so by this communication, they grow together into this magical symbiosis. And the way that symbiosis works is the plant takes its hard-earned carbon from photosynthesis and brings it to the fungus because the fungus can't photosynthesize. And the fungus takes nutrients and water it gathers from the soil, where plant roots can't grow, and they give it to the plant. And so they're both benefiting in this cooperation. Now, as the fungus grows through the soil, it starts linking plant and plant and tree and tree together until the whole forest is linked together. Did you know that a single tree can be literally linked up to hundreds of other trees as far as the eye can see? And as you're walking through the forest, what you see, the trees, the roots, the mushrooms, are just the tip of the iceberg. Under a single footstep, there are 300 miles of fungal cells stacked end on end moving stuff around. And if you could look down into the ground, it would be like this super highway with cars going everywhere. Now, all networks are made of nodes and links. In forests, those nodes would be trees and the links fungi. It's kind of like in your Facebook network, where nodes would be friends and links would be your friendships. Now, we all know that some of those nodes, or friends, are busier than others, like that friend who is always sending out group messages. Well, it's the same in forests, and these nodes in forests, we call them hubs, they're the big trees in the forests with roots going everywhere. Now, we also have learned that the systems organized around these hubs, these big old trees, so in forests, that's where the regeneration occurs. In your Facebook network, that might be how parties are organized, around that hub that's always sending out the group messages. We call those hubs in forests mother trees; they're the big old trees in the forest. And they fix the carbon in their leaves, and they send it down through their massive trunks and into the networks all around them that are linked up to all the other trees and seedlings, the young ones, and they start sending that carbon everywhere. The more those seedlings are stressed out, maybe from drought or shade, the more the mother tree sends to them. It's kind of like in your families, where if you're kind of stressed out, mom and dad kick in and help you out a bit more, right? Well, it's the same in forests. The other thing that we've recently discovered is that mother trees will preferentially send more signals to her own kids, her own children. And then, this way she helps them do better, and then they survive more, and then they can pass their genes on to future generations. So, how natural selection works.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about photosynthesis, which is mentioned in the transcript as a process where plants pull CO2 out of the atmosphere and give off oxygen.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 4, which talks about the communication between fungi and plant roots in the symbiotic relationship. While it doesn't directly ask about photosynthesis, it does relate to the process of how plants and fungi interact, which is relevant to the context of photosynthesis.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest that there is no direct match. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 3 is the closest, as it talks about the symbiotic relationship between fungi and plants, which is related to the process of photosynthesis.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3 (Note: This is not a direct match, but rather a suggestion of a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.)

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content of the transcript, I can identify a related question.

The ground truth MCQ is about the number of trees a single tree can be linked to. In the transcript, it is mentioned that "a single tree can be literally linked up to hundreds of other trees as far as the eye can see." 

Although there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 5 talks about mother trees serving as hubs for the fungal network, which is related to the concept of tree connections.

However, if I had to choose the most similar question based on the content, I would suggest that a new question that directly matches the ground truth MCQ should be generated. 

But if I really had to pick one from the existing options, I would say that Question 5 is the closest in terms of relevance to the topic, although it doesn't directly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
I was walking my mountain the other day, and I was feeling really at home with the forest. And I was so grateful to it for showing me that forests are built on relationships which form networks, like these beautiful river networks. And I thought, "Wow, forests are just like human families." And I was so taken by the beauty of this idea that I fell and I crashed down on the ground, and I hit my head on this new stump. And I was so angry! Then, I was so heartbroken because there was a whole family of trees cut down. Thing is, where I'm from in Western Canada, there's clearcuts like this hidden everywhere, and it wasn't until Google Earth starting sending images, like this, that we realized the whole world was wiping its noses on our old-growth forests. Did you know that deforestation like this around the world causes more greenhouse gas emissions than all the trains, planes and automobiles combined? Yeah, I'm really upset about this, but I'm also really hopeful because I've also discovered in my research that forest networks are organized in the same way as our own neural networks and our social networks. And I believe that if we can learn to integrate these into a whole that we can change this dangerous pathway of global warming because I believe we are wired for healing. So, here's the science: The most ancient of these networks is this below-ground fungal network, or mushroom network. And it evolved over a billion years ago to allow organisms to migrate from the ocean onto the land. And eventually, they got together with plants in this symbiosis. And this allowed plants to photosynthesize, pulling CO2, which is our biggest greenhouse gas, out of the atmosphere and giving off oxygen, which allows us to breathe and actually allowed humans to eventually evolve. Now, we call this symbiosis a mycorrhiza, myco for fungus, rrhiza for root. So, the fungus and root get together, and they trade for mutual benefit. Now, all trees in all forests all over the world depend on these mycorrhizas for their very survival. They can't live without them. And the way it works is that a seed falls on the forest floor, it germinates, it sends a root down into the soil, and it starts sending out chemical signals to the fungi to grow towards the root. And the fungus communicates back with its own signals, and it says to the root, 'You need to grow towards me and branch and soften.' And so by this communication, they grow together into this magical symbiosis. And the way that symbiosis works is the plant takes its hard-earned carbon from photosynthesis and brings it to the fungus because the fungus can't photosynthesize. And the fungus takes nutrients and water it gathers from the soil, where plant roots can't grow, and they give it to the plant. And so they're both benefiting in this cooperation. Now, as the fungus grows through the soil, it starts linking plant and plant and tree and tree together until the whole forest is linked together. Did you know that a single tree can be literally linked up to hundreds of other trees as far as the eye can see? And as you're walking through the forest, what you see, the trees, the roots, the mushrooms, are just the tip of the iceberg. Under a single footstep, there are 300 miles of fungal cells stacked end on end moving stuff around. And if you could look down into the ground, it would be like this super highway with cars going everywhere. Now, all networks are made of nodes and links. In forests, those nodes would be trees and the links fungi. It's kind of like in your Facebook network, where nodes would be friends and links would be your friendships. Now, we all know that some of those nodes, or friends, are busier than others, like that friend who is always sending out group messages. Well, it's the same in forests, and these nodes in forests, we call them hubs, they're the big trees in the forests with roots going everywhere. Now, we also have learned that the systems organized around these hubs, these big old trees, so in forests, that's where the regeneration occurs. In your Facebook network, that might be how parties are organized, around that hub that's always sending out the group messages. We call those hubs in forests mother trees; they're the big old trees in the forest. And they fix the carbon in their leaves, and they send it down through their massive trunks and into the networks all around them that are linked up to all the other trees and seedlings, the young ones, and they start sending that carbon everywhere. The more those seedlings are stressed out, maybe from drought or shade, the more the mother tree sends to them. It's kind of like in your families, where if you're kind of stressed out, mom and dad kick in and help you out a bit more, right? Well, it's the same in forests. The other thing that we've recently discovered is that mother trees will preferentially send more signals to her own kids, her own children. And then, this way she helps them do better, and then they survive more, and then they can pass their genes on to future generations. So, how natural selection works. Now, the way these forests are organized makes them both resilient and vulnerable. They're resilient because there's many mother trees, and there's many fungal species linking them together. And that network is really hard to break. It's pretty darn tough. But of course, we humans have figured out how to do that. And what we do is we take out the mother trees. And maybe taking one out won't make much difference but when you take more and more and more and clearcut and more and more and more that it can cause the system to collapse and fall down, like dominoes. And we can cross tipping points and cause more forest death and more global warming, and we're doing that. So what we do, our choices we make, can lead us towards global heatlh or global sickness. We do have choices. And I'm going to leave you with four ideas that I think are worth spreading. First one: To love the forest you have to go spend time in it. Go be in the forest, connect with it. And then you'll fight hard enough to protect them. Second: Learn how they work. Learn how those networks link things together in organized forests. And to do that, you gotta go out there take risks, make mistakes. Third: Protect forests. They need you to do that because they can't do it themselves. They're stuck in one spot. They can't run away from humans, and they can't run away from global warming. They need you. And finally, and most importantly, use your own very clever, brilliant, neural and social networks to create amazing messages, and spread the word that forests are worth saving because you're worth saving, and I believe that together we're all wired for healing.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 3: What is the symbiotic relationship between fungi and plants in forests called? Options: A. Mycorrhiza, B. Symbiosis, C. Mutualism, D. Parasitism Correct Option: A

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ would be one that asks about the extent or quantity of fungal networks in forests. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this criteria.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ, but if I had to pick one that is vaguely related, I would say Question 3 (index 3) is the closest, although it's not a good match.

It would be more accurate to say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and a new question should be generated to match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It was much more exciting than I thought.
You see the flames. Our first video of fluorine was a bit disappointing.
There wasn’t any, just a few bits of glassware and some funny stories.
So at the moment I’m in the office of Professor Eric Hope who is one
of the Country’s specialists in fluorine chemistry. He knows how to handle
this terrific element safely. I have no idea what to do. I’m quite excited
to see what happens. One of the things you said in that original
video was, on Youtube, was that fluorine was one of the few elements
that you hadn’t seen so I thought there are actually relatively few
chemists who have seen fluorine. So what I want to do is produce
and show you elemental fluorine. Fluorine is slowly released; you
see the pressure slowly going up. The reason that people know about fluorine
is that it is one of the really reactive elements. It will react with all
the elements of the periodic table, except neon and helium. It will react with
gold, it’ll react with silver, it’ll react with platinum. Platinum hexafluoride
is bright red as it’s a gas. Ok so fluorine is going into the apparatus,
it’s going into this tube. Martyn, you can’t see anything can you? I can’t see anything at all. You can’t see anything at all, and that’s
because there’s only a little under 2 atmospheres of fluorine in there.
It’s a very pale yellow colour as a gas. A bit disappointed but I suppose it’s like
oxygen or nitrogen, you can’t really see it. But perhaps if we condense
it as a liquid then I’ll see it properly. Ok so now I’m going to cool this down with
liquid nitrogen to -196oC. I’m going to do it slowly. It will take a little
while. Ok Martyn, do you want to help me with this? Yep. So what I want to do is for you to take that
flask away and I’ll slide this one in. So if you slide it away and back up
again. And there we have, oh maybe two inches of liquid fluorine. You can
go right up that, there’s no problem with that if you want to. Just, clear
a bit of condensation off there. Yeah I’m really surprised I thought it would
be pale green and its dark yellow. If I’d been shown it I’d thought
it was liquid chlorine. But I’ve never seen liquid chlorine either. I’m quite pleased with that. So, basically
I’ve got another fluorine cylinder filled up from the roof with about
5 atmospheres of fluorine in it. So this is now going to release the fluorine.
And what I’ve got in this demonstration here is just a scouring pad.
It’s a metal scouring pad, iron wool. It burnt a hole right through the iron wool.
It’s extraordinary. The iron looks as if it’s rusted but the rusty colour
is actually iron fluoride or maybe a bit of iron oxide from the hot iron
reacting with the oxygen in the air. Well the reason that fluorine makes such strong
bonds is because it is a small atom and the nucleus is relatively highly
charged because it’s right on the right-hand side of the periodic table
but the electrons don’t shield this nucleus. So it is very, so-called, electronegative.
It attracts electrons to itself from other elements. I’ve changed the prop now for some just
normal barbeque briquettes which is pure carbon. So we haven’t done anything. This is cold
charcoal and cold gas, and the gas just touching it is enough to start the
fire. Think of that: just the cold gas setting things on fire. Most chemists
are really too frightened to work with fluorine. You can’t use it in glass
vessels. It doesn’t attack glass but if the glass is a tiny bit wet and most glass
has moisture absorbed into it, then the fluorine form hydrogen fluoride and
it reacts with the water and the hydrogen fluoride just eats through the
glass. So you need to use equipment made out of metal, usually nickel,
and the fluorine reacts with the surface of the nickel, the first time
you use it and then you get a layer on the surface that protects the rest
of the metal. So this is again fluorine with sulphur. So
you are going to oxidise the sulphur, probably to sulphur tetrafluoride
or sulphur hexafluoride. Fluorine has this reputation for being very
reactive and very dangerous and something to be careful about. But aren’t
their fluorine atoms in my toothpaste? Your toothpaste contains fluoride and, just
in the same way that you can eat sodium chloride, table salt which contains
chlorine, you can use fluorides and once the fluorine has got an
extra electron, for example from the tin in tin fluoride, which is often
used in toothpaste or sodium fluoride. It’s got what it wants and it’s
not very reactive. And the way it works with teeth is that the enamel of your
teeth is a compound of calcium called appetite, which normally the
appetite in your teeth can dissolve quite easily in acid. For example,
if you eat sweets or drink some fizzy drinks then you have enough acid
to start dissolving the surface of your teeth. But if you brush your
teeth with fluoride, some of the appetite, which contains OH groups, some
of these are replaced with fluoride and you make a material called fluoral
appetite which is much less soluble in acid so it can’t attacked
so easily, so you don’t get holes in your teeth.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: What is the purpose of using equipment made of metal when working with fluorine?

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it addresses the same topic of the material used to store or handle fluorine. Although the question phrasing is not identical, the intent and content are similar. The correct option in Question 5 (B. To allow fluorine to react with the equipment and form a protective layer) also provides additional context that is relevant to the ground truth MCQ, which mentions that the containers used to store fluorine are made from metal (usually nickel).

However, an even more similar question would be one that directly asks about the material used to store fluorine. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
It was much more exciting than I thought.
You see the flames. Our first video of fluorine was a bit disappointing.
There wasn’t any, just a few bits of glassware and some funny stories.
So at the moment I’m in the office of Professor Eric Hope who is one
of the Country’s specialists in fluorine chemistry. He knows how to handle
this terrific element safely. I have no idea what to do. I’m quite excited
to see what happens. One of the things you said in that original
video was, on Youtube, was that fluorine was one of the few elements
that you hadn’t seen so I thought there are actually relatively few
chemists who have seen fluorine. So what I want to do is produce
and show you elemental fluorine. Fluorine is slowly released; you
see the pressure slowly going up. The reason that people know about fluorine
is that it is one of the really reactive elements. It will react with all
the elements of the periodic table, except neon and helium. It will react with
gold, it’ll react with silver, it’ll react with platinum. Platinum hexafluoride
is bright red as it’s a gas. Ok so fluorine is going into the apparatus,
it’s going into this tube. Martyn, you can’t see anything can you? I can’t see anything at all. You can’t see anything at all, and that’s
because there’s only a little under 2 atmospheres of fluorine in there.
It’s a very pale yellow colour as a gas. A bit disappointed but I suppose it’s like
oxygen or nitrogen, you can’t really see it. But perhaps if we condense
it as a liquid then I’ll see it properly. Ok so now I’m going to cool this down with
liquid nitrogen to -196oC. I’m going to do it slowly. It will take a little
while. Ok Martyn, do you want to help me with this? Yep. So what I want to do is for you to take that
flask away and I’ll slide this one in. So if you slide it away and back up
again. And there we have, oh maybe two inches of liquid fluorine. You can
go right up that, there’s no problem with that if you want to. Just, clear
a bit of condensation off there. Yeah I’m really surprised I thought it would
be pale green and its dark yellow. If I’d been shown it I’d thought
it was liquid chlorine. But I’ve never seen liquid chlorine either. I’m quite pleased with that. So, basically
I’ve got another fluorine cylinder filled up from the roof with about
5 atmospheres of fluorine in it. So this is now going to release the fluorine.
And what I’ve got in this demonstration here is just a scouring pad.
It’s a metal scouring pad, iron wool. It burnt a hole right through the iron wool.
It’s extraordinary. The iron looks as if it’s rusted but the rusty colour
is actually iron fluoride or maybe a bit of iron oxide from the hot iron
reacting with the oxygen in the air. Well the reason that fluorine makes such strong
bonds is because it is a small atom and the nucleus is relatively highly
charged because it’s right on the right-hand side of the periodic table
but the electrons don’t shield this nucleus. So it is very, so-called, electronegative.
It attracts electrons to itself from other elements. I’ve changed the prop now for some just
normal barbeque briquettes which is pure carbon. So we haven’t done anything. This is cold
charcoal and cold gas, and the gas just touching it is enough to start the
fire. Think of that: just the cold gas setting things on fire. Most chemists
are really too frightened to work with fluorine. You can’t use it in glass
vessels. It doesn’t attack glass but if the glass is a tiny bit wet and most glass
has moisture absorbed into it, then the fluorine form hydrogen fluoride and
it reacts with the water and the hydrogen fluoride just eats through the
glass. So you need to use equipment made out of metal, usually nickel,
and the fluorine reacts with the surface of the nickel, the first time
you use it and then you get a layer on the surface that protects the rest
of the metal. So this is again fluorine with sulphur. So
you are going to oxidise the sulphur, probably to sulphur tetrafluoride
or sulphur hexafluoride. Fluorine has this reputation for being very
reactive and very dangerous and something to be careful about. But aren’t
their fluorine atoms in my toothpaste? Your toothpaste contains fluoride and, just
in the same way that you can eat sodium chloride, table salt which contains
chlorine, you can use fluorides and once the fluorine has got an
extra electron, for example from the tin in tin fluoride, which is often
used in toothpaste or sodium fluoride. It’s got what it wants and it’s
not very reactive. And the way it works with teeth is that the enamel of your
teeth is a compound of calcium called appetite, which normally the
appetite in your teeth can dissolve quite easily in acid. For example,
if you eat sweets or drink some fizzy drinks then you have enough acid
to start dissolving the surface of your teeth. But if you brush your
teeth with fluoride, some of the appetite, which contains OH groups, some
of these are replaced with fluoride and you make a material called fluoral
appetite which is much less soluble in acid so it can’t attacked
so easily, so you don’t get holes in your teeth.

So in the bottom we see neon and this is a
small glass discharge tube which has got a very low pressure of neon
inside it. It’s generally used for lots of signs and things like that. You
might see ‘Fish and Chips’ or perhaps a ‘disco’ or something like that. So Neon is an inert gas like helium and it
doesn’t really form any compounds at all. Most of you have probably
seen neon because it’s used in these so-called neon signs where you
take a glass tube and put a high voltage and it produces a red light. So you can see that, again, a discharge, a
high potential discharge is going across this tube and it’s exciting
all of the neon molecules inside, such that we get this exciting, really vivid
red colouration. And skilled glass-blowers can blow this into
glass shapes of signs saying ‘pizza’ or whatever on shops. You can
freeze neon at very low temperatures about 10 degrees absolute and
early on in my scientific career I did do an experiment in solid neon.
It produced a great result with an iron compound and I’m still quite
proud of it several years on. But it’s not really very important in terms
of absolute chemistry. So this is just a simple pocket spectroscope
and it allows us to analyse the wavelengths of light that each of these
individual light sources is giving off. So each individual atom as it’s
excited in its emission zone can give rise to different lines or different
frequencies of radiation or light and we can use this little device to analyse
which elements are in each of these different elements of light. So we
put it up to our eyes and we look through, and we look at the different
colours of the lines in the different gases.

frequencies of radiation or light and we can use this little device to analyse
which elements are in each of these different elements of light. So we
put it up to our eyes and we look through, and we look at the different
colours of the lines in the different gases.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about how to obtain blue, green, and yellow neon signs when neon only emits a reddish color. The correct answer is by adding other noble gases such as krypton.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is the closest match, but it doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ. Question 3 asks what happens when a high voltage is applied to a glass tube containing neon, and the correct answer is that the neon molecules are excited, producing a red light.

However, I noticed that Question 9 has a similar intent, as it asks about the relationship between the excited neon molecules and the production of light. Although it doesn't directly address the question of how to obtain different colors, it is related to the concept of light production in neon signs.

But since none of the questions directly address the question asked in the ground truth MCQ, I will not be able to provide an index for a matching question.

If I had to choose a question that could be a starting point for creating a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3 or Question 9.

So in the bottom we see neon and this is a
small glass discharge tube which has got a very low pressure of neon
inside it. It’s generally used for lots of signs and things like that. You
might see ‘Fish and Chips’ or perhaps a ‘disco’ or something like that. So Neon is an inert gas like helium and it
doesn’t really form any compounds at all. Most of you have probably
seen neon because it’s used in these so-called neon signs where you
take a glass tube and put a high voltage and it produces a red light. So you can see that, again, a discharge, a
high potential discharge is going across this tube and it’s exciting
all of the neon molecules inside, such that we get this exciting, really vivid
red colouration. And skilled glass-blowers can blow this into
glass shapes of signs saying ‘pizza’ or whatever on shops. You can
freeze neon at very low temperatures about 10 degrees absolute and
early on in my scientific career I did do an experiment in solid neon.
It produced a great result with an iron compound and I’m still quite
proud of it several years on. But it’s not really very important in terms
of absolute chemistry. So this is just a simple pocket spectroscope
and it allows us to analyse the wavelengths of light that each of these
individual light sources is giving off. So each individual atom as it’s
excited in its emission zone can give rise to different lines or different
frequencies of radiation or light and we can use this little device to analyse
which elements are in each of these different elements of light. So we
put it up to our eyes and we look through, and we look at the different
colours of the lines in the different gases.

So, we’re braving the elements Brady, to
repeat the experiment that we did quite some time ago, so you will remember that we had
a very small balloon of hydrogen Match on a stick to hydrogen, big bang coming! Are you ready? Yep! Here we go! And the fact that we’ve come outside, might
actually give you an idea of what we are going to do, cause we are going to make it a little
bit bigger, so let’s go and fill a balloon. Alright, cool. Well, hydrogen, I think is very important
because, it is the simplest atom, it’s the atom, consists of a positively charged proton
which is relatively large and a negatively charged electron, that goes round it. Electric match? I think an electric match will go well on
that. Yep. Oh, look at the tension on the balloon! Hold it, I’ve really gone for it and blown
that one up. The tension! What happens is that hydrogen is reacting
with oxygen and H2 plus O2 reacts to form H2O and an oxygen atom and then that oxygen
atom goes on to react with another hydrogen molecule to make more water and the reaction
generates a lot of heat and that heat, heats up more gas to make it react faster, so you
generate more and more heat, so the reaction that begins quite slowly with the first few
molecules, runs away and that is why you get the explosion. So here we have a rather large balloon of
hydrogen, Neil is just preparing our electric match which we are going to attach to the
side of this balloon. And some of the biggest explosions in the
20th century, the Chernobyl reactor, the space shuttle that blew up when it was taking off,
were in fact explosions caused by hydrogen and oxygen. So we’ve filled up a balloon of hydrogen,
and I think if you look at the hydrogen balloon you will see that it is slightly larger than
those we have attempted before. Now we are going to try to detonate it or burn the hydrogen,
in the air by giving it a match and the match we are going to use is again an electric match,
which is connected to our detonator box. If you stick a pin in the balloon, the balloon
will burst because the rubber will break, but the hydrogen will come out and it won’t
react with the oxygen because the hydrogen is cool, it’s at the same temperature as
the air, but the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen like many reactions involves so called
activation energy, you have to put in a certain amount of energy to get it going. But once
you get it going, you get more heat coming out, than you put in to start it off. So, let’s arm the circuit, 5-4-3-2-1. That was more like it. Lovely! When Pete puts the match to the balloon, first
of all the match burns a hole in the balloon, and then the heat gets the hydrogen and oxygen
near the outside of the balloon and they start reacting and the heat then spreads through
the volume of the hydrogen and oxygen, faster probably than the balloon is bursting and
as it spreads through the temperature builds up and up and up because you are generating
so much heat. The reason that you hear a noise, is because,
it causes a rise in pressure which sends a pressure wave out through the air and it hits
your ears or the microphone on your camera. I honestly don’t know why you see any colour.
I suspect that the colour may actually be caused by the burning balloon which contains
carbon and is really like the flame on a candle. Because normally when you have a hydrogen/oxygen
flame you don’t see any colour at all. Alternatively, it may be some impurities in the gas, but
I suspect that what you are seeing in the fire ball is just the burning of the balloon.
The other thing which is really quite exciting about hydrogen is that in principle if you
heat hydrogen to really high temperatures, you can get two hydrogen atoms to fuse together,
or rather, it will not work with hydrogen, but it will work with a heavier form of hydrogen
which is know as deuterium where instead of a proton and an electron, you have a proton
and a neutron, which is a neutral particle, and an electron, and two molecules of deuterium
can fuse together to make one atom of helium which has two protons, two neutrons, and two
electrons and this produces a lot of energy. It is the basis of the so-called hydrogen
bombs, which are like super atomic bombs, but which require an enormously high temperature
to get the reaction to go. You can probably hear it hitting and fizzing
into the bottle there. There is great hope that in the end much of
the world’s energy crisis can be solved by doing this so called nuclear fusion of
deuterium to make helium which would produce energy extremely cleanly. So here, we’ll just tie it off, if my Welsh
hands can actually tie a knot on a balloon, ‘cause, you know we are all a little bit
bizarre. Deuterium gas, in all its properties, will
be very similar to that of hydrogen, of course it is denser, because it has a neutron as
well as a proton but it is still much lighter than air so a deuterium balloon will still
float up to the ceiling and make Pete look just as stupid as the hydrogen one. You’ve got to keep hold of it. Or you lose it Or you lose it, you know! I was thinking more of fusing it, that sounds
like a really big explosion we could do out the back. No! Fusing reactors are way beyond what Pete
can do unless he is a lot cleverer than I think. I got a balloon! I had a balloon of hydrogen! That is the second time you have done that! Now it’s going to go up there eventually
anyway!

you get it going, you get more heat coming out, than you put in to start it off. So, let’s arm the circuit, 5-4-3-2-1. That was more like it. Lovely! When Pete puts the match to the balloon, first
of all the match burns a hole in the balloon, and then the heat gets the hydrogen and oxygen
near the outside of the balloon and they start reacting and the heat then spreads through
the volume of the hydrogen and oxygen, faster probably than the balloon is bursting and
as it spreads through the temperature builds up and up and up because you are generating
so much heat. The reason that you hear a noise, is because,
it causes a rise in pressure which sends a pressure wave out through the air and it hits
your ears or the microphone on your camera. I honestly don’t know why you see any colour.
I suspect that the colour may actually be caused by the burning balloon which contains
carbon and is really like the flame on a candle. Because normally when you have a hydrogen/oxygen
flame you don’t see any colour at all. Alternatively, it may be some impurities in the gas, but
I suspect that what you are seeing in the fire ball is just the burning of the balloon.
The other thing which is really quite exciting about hydrogen is that in principle if you
heat hydrogen to really high temperatures, you can get two hydrogen atoms to fuse together,
or rather, it will not work with hydrogen, but it will work with a heavier form of hydrogen
which is know as deuterium where instead of a proton and an electron, you have a proton
and a neutron, which is a neutral particle, and an electron, and two molecules of deuterium
can fuse together to make one atom of helium which has two protons, two neutrons, and two
electrons and this produces a lot of energy. It is the basis of the so-called hydrogen
bombs, which are like super atomic bombs, but which require an enormously high temperature
to get the reaction to go. You can probably hear it hitting and fizzing
into the bottle there. There is great hope that in the end much of
the world’s energy crisis can be solved by doing this so called nuclear fusion of
deuterium to make helium which would produce energy extremely cleanly. So here, we’ll just tie it off, if my Welsh
hands can actually tie a knot on a balloon, ‘cause, you know we are all a little bit
bizarre. Deuterium gas, in all its properties, will
be very similar to that of hydrogen, of course it is denser, because it has a neutron as
well as a proton but it is still much lighter than air so a deuterium balloon will still
float up to the ceiling and make Pete look just as stupid as the hydrogen one. You’ve got to keep hold of it. Or you lose it Or you lose it, you know! I was thinking more of fusing it, that sounds
like a really big explosion we could do out the back. No! Fusing reactors are way beyond what Pete
can do unless he is a lot cleverer than I think. I got a balloon! I had a balloon of hydrogen! That is the second time you have done that! Now it’s going to go up there eventually
anyway!

**Transcript**:
It should be alright! There it goes! Aww,
actually that’s quite spectacular at the end. And in my second-year, I think I love boron
far too much I think, ‘cause I talk about it too much. You love boron? I love boron! No, I used to do lots of chemistry
with boron, I kind of moved away a little bit from boron
now but I really like it. Boron is an interesting element. It is one
of the few that I have actually made myself when I was at school. Boron sits on top of the group 13. Its atomic
number is 5, so it is a metalloid, so elemental boron is a
metalloid which basically means that it has some of the properties
of a non metal and some of the properties of a metal. I mixed an oxide of boron with magnesium,
heated it up and then, it is a really dramatic reaction when
you add water at the end to try and destroy the magnesium boride
that has formed because you get puffs of gas coming
off which burst into flames rather like little anti-aircraft
guns. But boron itself was rather disappointing; it’s a sort of
brown powder. I mean there is a more of a powdery brown
boron, there are several crystalline sort of types of alatropes
of boron. There is one actually that is really, really hard,
so the black crystalline boron is actually very, very hard. It’s
just below diamond on Mohs scale of hardness, so I believe. And
actually in America, there is a town called Boron. It’s in California,
it’s got a population of around 2000 which actually was
set up around the world’s biggest borax mine which is
in California. Well it used to be transported on trains of
mules and the company that produced it used to have as their
trademark a train of 20 mules sort of going along. Of great interest to us chemists, well over
the last sort of 50, maybe sort of 60-70 years, have been the boron
hydrides or borades. So boron hydrides are basically clusters
of borons with hydrogens around them. And one of particular
use and interest in the 50s was one called pentaborane,
which basically: penta, five, it’s got five borons
in it. And Pentaborate was investigated during the cold
war or in the early part of the cold war as being a rocket
fuel. It actually burns with a green flame. They actually called
it the ‘green dragon’ because it burns with a very, very
hot green flame and also because it is pretty toxic, which
I can actually show you if I … It is probably not going to be
spectacular. And boron complexes or borax compounds are
used in a variety of things. It is not a particularly
expensive material. It is used in washing powder, particularly perborate
which when you heat it up in the washing machine when
the water gets to 60 degrees centigrade it turns into hydrogen
peroxide which can then bleach the clothes and this is why
the famous washing powder is called Persil, because the
‘per’ stands for perborate and the ‘sil’ stands for silicate
so it is really a mixture of perborate and silicate. Ok so this isn’t pentaborane because pentaborane
spontaneously combusts in the air. This is just benzene
boronic acid. It’s an organic compound with some boron in it.
So hopefully we can see, we should be able to see, if I can
get some at the end of my spatula, that it should be able to
burn with some sort of green flame. Hey, there it is. You can
also see a bit of yellow which is the organic bit going as well.
It should be alright! There it goes! Aww, actually that was
quite spectacular at the end. Ok.

boron, there are several crystalline sort of types of alatropes
of boron. There is one actually that is really, really hard,
so the black crystalline boron is actually very, very hard. It’s
just below diamond on Mohs scale of hardness, so I believe. And
actually in America, there is a town called Boron. It’s in California,
it’s got a population of around 2000 which actually was
set up around the world’s biggest borax mine which is
in California. Well it used to be transported on trains of
mules and the company that produced it used to have as their
trademark a train of 20 mules sort of going along. Of great interest to us chemists, well over
the last sort of 50, maybe sort of 60-70 years, have been the boron
hydrides or borades. So boron hydrides are basically clusters
of borons with hydrogens around them. And one of particular
use and interest in the 50s was one called pentaborane,
which basically: penta, five, it’s got five borons
in it. And Pentaborate was investigated during the cold
war or in the early part of the cold war as being a rocket
fuel. It actually burns with a green flame. They actually called
it the ‘green dragon’ because it burns with a very, very
hot green flame and also because it is pretty toxic, which
I can actually show you if I … It is probably not going to be
spectacular. And boron complexes or borax compounds are
used in a variety of things. It is not a particularly
expensive material. It is used in washing powder, particularly perborate
which when you heat it up in the washing machine when
the water gets to 60 degrees centigrade it turns into hydrogen
peroxide which can then bleach the clothes and this is why
the famous washing powder is called Persil, because the
‘per’ stands for perborate and the ‘sil’ stands for silicate
so it is really a mixture of perborate and silicate. Ok so this isn’t pentaborane because pentaborane
spontaneously combusts in the air. This is just benzene
boronic acid. It’s an organic compound with some boron in it.
So hopefully we can see, we should be able to see, if I can
get some at the end of my spatula, that it should be able to
burn with some sort of green flame. Hey, there it is. You can
also see a bit of yellow which is the organic bit going as well.
It should be alright! There it goes! Aww, actually that was
quite spectacular at the end. Ok.

So you can see on the front of this instrument
is a dome shaped device. That dome is a special vessel which is made so we can control the
atmosphere inside and it is fabricated from beryllium metal. This is the beryllium which I don’t really
want to get out. Why not? Well, because it is a toxic chemical, a toxic
metal. Beryllium is an interesting element because
most chemists don’t really know about it very much at all. So beryllium is a fantastic metal, it is really,
really interesting, it’s got really lots of strange metallic properties, but one of
the most important to me is that it is transparent to x-rays. So I can shine x-rays straight
through the beryllium and the beryllium does not absorb it at all which most other metals
especially those with higher molecular weights do. Beryllium-laden dust has been shown to cause
berylliosis which is actually an industrial lung disease which causes the formation of
swollen nodules in the lungs called granulomas which is a bit gross, so I don’t really
want to open up the jar. It’s near the beginning of the periodic
table, but we rarely come across it. So at the moment we are at Matt’s lab and
we are doing some x-ray experiments on a really, really quite sensitive compound. So X-rays
themselves are absorbed by everything, ok, so when we shoot it through the air it is
absorbed by the air, so to measure the x-ray absorption of our compound which is sensitive
to the air we need to be able to remove the air and encase it so we use beryllium to make
a magic box around our sample, that the x-rays can come into, interact with our sample, and
then exit without interacting with the material around them. So you can see on the front of
this instrument, there is a dome shaped device, that dome, is a special vessel which is made
so that we could control the atmosphere inside and it is fabricated from beryllium metal. I talk about in my lectures, I explain that
beryllium chloride the molecule that has three atoms, two chlorine atoms and one beryllium
atom, has the three atoms arranged in the row, so it is a straight molecule so called
linear molecule. I have never seen beryllium chloride. Chemists use it on x-ray defractometers because
actually it is so lightweight it is actually got atomic number 4. The beryllium allows the x-rays to come in
and out without interacting at all. It is a fantastic device it is really useful for
really sensitive chemistry, it is a really beautiful application. The cost of that beryllium
though, that is significant, that small beryllium sample cost 15,000 Euros. It only has four protons and a number of neutrons
so if x-rays fall on atoms of beryllium they are not scattered very much so it’s like
the difference between shining light through a glass window and if you made it out of a
heavy material it would be like, shining through paper, it would be scattered you wouldn’t
get a good image. I’m hoping to actually do some chemistry
with beryllium which is why I’ve bought it. It is pretty toxic so we are going to
have to be very, very careful. You can’t actually breathe in the dust at all, cause
even actually one exposure has shown with some people one exposure is enough to cause
this sort of sensitive reaction. But beryllium is very poisonous so if you
do use these beryllium windows, you have to be careful not to lick your fingers. Well
good chemists shouldn’t lick their fingers anyway.

**Transcript**:
So comrades, welcome to the lecture. What
I am going to do now, we’re going to begin with an experiment
to illustrate this point that the oxygen molecule, O2, has
unpaired electrons. Now we’re outside just to show you the reactivity
of this lovely stuff here, liquid oxygen. So you can
see wonderful liquid oxygen is a nice blue colour. So over
here on the table we’ve got a tin tray which we’re going
to use to contain the experiment that I’m going to show you next.
So we’ve got our favourite liquid oxygen. Strongly oxidising;
very, very reactive, and here I’ve got some cotton
wool. So this is the same stuff we use to take make-up off, perhaps
our partners or our girlfriends or our wives, and this
is the same stuff we use to wipe our babies’ bums. Oxygen is an interesting element because it
exists in two forms: the taught form which we breathe all
the time is O2, two oxygen atoms joined together; and there’s
another form called ozone, and which has three atoms arranged
like the letter V, or letter V this way up. Oxygen has unpaired electrons within the molecular
orbitals, in the atomic orbitals around the structure,
and these unpaired electrons give rise to colour and
that colour is blue. So blue is often perceived to be the colour
of solvated or unpaired electrons, and you can see here the
lovely blue colour. Now lots of chemists are really scared
when they see the blue of liquid oxygen, because liquid
oxygen is very, very reactive. Generally you only make liquid oxygen
by mistake. Not like today when we’re making some on
purpose. And if you’ve made it by mistake in an uncontrolled
way, where there might be organic molecules perhaps simple
organic chemicals like hydrocarbons, grease or perhaps
a highly elaborate compound then, they tend to detonate
and they tend to cause very energetic experiments. Yeah it’s very fluffy it’s not very reactive.
It doesn’t really burn, it cinders, might smoulder. But here
we go, we’re going to pop it in the tray. So we begin with Neil’s very high-tech piece
of equipment, which is a test-tube on a piece of string.
What we’re going to do is to put some liquid nitrogen in here.
You can see liquid nitrogen – well you may not see – is colourless.
Ok? So this is liquid nitrogen, and what I hope you can see
is that this magnet, which is a pretty good magnet. Let
me just show you here with my keys, that they stick pretty
strongly to the magnet. The magnet has absolutely no affect
at all on the liquid nitrogen. I can pull the magnet and
nothing happens. And then we’re going to fill up all of the
void space, so all of the space in the cotton particles with oxygen.
So you might want to stand back after this bit Brady. So
here we go, here’s our liquid oxygen. Do you want to come in
and zoom in on me? It’s ok, I’ve got it zoomed nicely. Ok, so here you can see the lovely blue liquid
oxygen colour, going into the cotton wool particles. Let’s try the same thing with liquid oxygen.
Careful of my shoes… So here we have a match on a stick, and I
think you can see its probably alight, so we have our fire,
we have our oxygen, and we have our fuel. Now let’s see what
happens when we put them all together. The liquid oxygen is a very nice blue colour
today. So now let’s try, here’s the magnet again, and
if I take the liquid oxygen you can see I can pull it right up
here. It’s not as magnetic as my keys, but you can see there’s
a really big difference. It sticks to the magnet. So you
can see it really is magnetic. You ready? Ok. Woohoo and there she blows! And ozone is much more reactive than oxygen.
So near the earth’s surface, where you and I are at
the moment, ozone is really quite dangerous because if you breathe
it in it can start reacting with any sort of molecule that has
bonds between carbon. But in the upper atmosphere, ozone
is extremely important because it absorbs ultra-violet
light that comes from the sun and stops this ultra-violet light
attacking the molecules in biological species on the surface.
If it wasn’t for the ozone in the upper atmosphere all of us
would be, if not dead, certainly very much less comfortable
than we are at the moment. So Neil’s now connecting up a piece of tube
to oxygen cylinder and he is going to fill up this gas
jar with oxygen and we are going to do a really classic experiment:
the one that everyone learns at school and tests for oxygen,
which is to relight a glowing splint. So we have a traditional
gas jar full of oxygen. So here you can see we are burning
a splint. Ok, so this is the wood burning in excess oxygen
around us, ok. So what we are going to do is we are going to
take the splint out so it is just glowing. And if I blow on this
splint you can see it gets brighter. Now we are going to try and
relight that splint by putting it into a very oxygen-rich atmosphere.
So we’ll move over to the jar and we’ll put in our
glowing splint and you can see the flame comes back to life.
So that’s a test that everyone learns for an oxygen-rich environment. What happened? What made that happen? Well the increased oxygen content/concentration
reignites and reinitiates that oxidation of the wood or
the burning of the wood. So we’ll do that again. So there we
go: flame again.

**Question 2: According to the transcript, what is the primary use of liquid oxygen? Options: A. To make-up off, B. To wipe babies' bums, C. As a fuel for rockets, D. As a strongly oxidizing agent Correct Option: D**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses the fear of organic chemists regarding liquid oxygen.

A closer match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the reactivity of liquid oxygen and its potential to cause explosions when it comes in contact with organic compounds.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would suggest:

**Question 6: What would happen if you breathed in ozone near the Earth's surface? Options: A. You would feel a slight tickle in your throat, B. You would experience a brief coughing fit, C. You would start reacting with any molecule that has bonds between carbon, D. You would feel no effect at all Correct Option: C**

This question is related to the reactivity of ozone, which is mentioned in the ground truth MCQ as a reason why organic chemists fear liquid oxygen. However, it does not directly address the fear of liquid oxygen.

If I had to provide an index, I would suggest **Question 6** as the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not a perfect match.

To create a perfect match, I would suggest generating a new MCQ that directly addresses the fear of organic chemists regarding liquid oxygen, such as:

**Question: Why do organic chemists fear liquid oxygen? Options: A. Because it is extremely toxic, B. Because it is extremely radioactive, C. Because it is extremely reactive and can cause an explosion when it comes in contact with organic compounds, D. Because it is extremely expensive Correct Option: C**

**Transcript**:
So comrades, welcome to the lecture. What
I am going to do now, we’re going to begin with an experiment
to illustrate this point that the oxygen molecule, O2, has
unpaired electrons. Now we’re outside just to show you the reactivity
of this lovely stuff here, liquid oxygen. So you can
see wonderful liquid oxygen is a nice blue colour. So over
here on the table we’ve got a tin tray which we’re going
to use to contain the experiment that I’m going to show you next.
So we’ve got our favourite liquid oxygen. Strongly oxidising;
very, very reactive, and here I’ve got some cotton
wool. So this is the same stuff we use to take make-up off, perhaps
our partners or our girlfriends or our wives, and this
is the same stuff we use to wipe our babies’ bums. Oxygen is an interesting element because it
exists in two forms: the taught form which we breathe all
the time is O2, two oxygen atoms joined together; and there’s
another form called ozone, and which has three atoms arranged
like the letter V, or letter V this way up. Oxygen has unpaired electrons within the molecular
orbitals, in the atomic orbitals around the structure,
and these unpaired electrons give rise to colour and
that colour is blue. So blue is often perceived to be the colour
of solvated or unpaired electrons, and you can see here the
lovely blue colour. Now lots of chemists are really scared
when they see the blue of liquid oxygen, because liquid
oxygen is very, very reactive. Generally you only make liquid oxygen
by mistake. Not like today when we’re making some on
purpose. And if you’ve made it by mistake in an uncontrolled
way, where there might be organic molecules perhaps simple
organic chemicals like hydrocarbons, grease or perhaps
a highly elaborate compound then, they tend to detonate
and they tend to cause very energetic experiments. Yeah it’s very fluffy it’s not very reactive.
It doesn’t really burn, it cinders, might smoulder. But here
we go, we’re going to pop it in the tray. So we begin with Neil’s very high-tech piece
of equipment, which is a test-tube on a piece of string.
What we’re going to do is to put some liquid nitrogen in here.
You can see liquid nitrogen – well you may not see – is colourless.
Ok? So this is liquid nitrogen, and what I hope you can see
is that this magnet, which is a pretty good magnet. Let
me just show you here with my keys, that they stick pretty
strongly to the magnet. The magnet has absolutely no affect
at all on the liquid nitrogen. I can pull the magnet and
nothing happens. And then we’re going to fill up all of the
void space, so all of the space in the cotton particles with oxygen.
So you might want to stand back after this bit Brady. So
here we go, here’s our liquid oxygen. Do you want to come in
and zoom in on me? It’s ok, I’ve got it zoomed nicely. Ok, so here you can see the lovely blue liquid
oxygen colour, going into the cotton wool particles. Let’s try the same thing with liquid oxygen.
Careful of my shoes… So here we have a match on a stick, and I
think you can see its probably alight, so we have our fire,
we have our oxygen, and we have our fuel. Now let’s see what
happens when we put them all together. The liquid oxygen is a very nice blue colour
today. So now let’s try, here’s the magnet again, and
if I take the liquid oxygen you can see I can pull it right up
here. It’s not as magnetic as my keys, but you can see there’s
a really big difference. It sticks to the magnet. So you
can see it really is magnetic. You ready? Ok. Woohoo and there she blows! And ozone is much more reactive than oxygen.
So near the earth’s surface, where you and I are at
the moment, ozone is really quite dangerous because if you breathe
it in it can start reacting with any sort of molecule that has
bonds between carbon. But in the upper atmosphere, ozone
is extremely important because it absorbs ultra-violet
light that comes from the sun and stops this ultra-violet light
attacking the molecules in biological species on the surface.
If it wasn’t for the ozone in the upper atmosphere all of us
would be, if not dead, certainly very much less comfortable
than we are at the moment. So Neil’s now connecting up a piece of tube
to oxygen cylinder and he is going to fill up this gas
jar with oxygen and we are going to do a really classic experiment:
the one that everyone learns at school and tests for oxygen,
which is to relight a glowing splint. So we have a traditional

take the splint out so it is just glowing. And if I blow on this
splint you can see it gets brighter. Now we are going to try and
relight that splint by putting it into a very oxygen-rich atmosphere.
So we’ll move over to the jar and we’ll put in our
glowing splint and you can see the flame comes back to life.
So that’s a test that everyone learns for an oxygen-rich environment. What happened? What made that happen? Well the increased oxygen content/concentration
reignites and reinitiates that oxidation of the wood or
the burning of the wood. So we’ll do that again. So there we
go: flame again.

**Transcript**:
so here we have a sample of titanium wire titanium is a really quite fantastic metal it's very very lightweight and very very strong it's used in construction materials very low concentrations and as additives for Alloys titanium is a very interesting element and it's interesting because it's very abundant on the planet it's not the most abundant metal but it's still pretty abundant this is a periodic table where the area of each of the elements here represents the relative amount of this material that is found on the earth as you can see there's a lot of oxygen a lot of carbon quite a lot of boron Debb's favorite element some aluminium again a lot and here titanium is quite a reasonable amount nearly as much as potassium so it's a very common element so going to open it now and we'll hopefully see the titanium wire around the spindle so you can see it's a really quite beautiful dark coloration you can find large deposits of titanium dioxide in various places across the world we've just had a visitor from South Africa who said not far from where he works in East London along the coast their large deposits of titanium dioxide the problem is that it is really quite hard to make titanium metal out of the oxide because titanium atoms bond strongly to the oxygen and it's difficult to get them apart and get the metal and the reason why people want to get the metal is because it's very light here I've got a piece of titanium and it's quite light you can see I can shake it around in my hands without behaving as as if it was a really heavy bar often used as well in the construction of aerospatial sort of capsules and components to go into space because it's light and strong being light by itself is not much use sodium is light the great thing about titanium is that it is light and it's strong and also it doesn't react with water you couldn't make a car out of sodium the first rainstorm and boom but titanium is light it is strong so if you're making a vehicle out of it the vehicle isn't very heavy so you don't need nearly as much fuel than if you're making the vehicle out of steel usually people make the vehicle out of aluminium which is lighter than steel but is not nearly as strong and the great thing about titanium is it's fantastically strong once you get the metal so the problem getting the metal is from titanium dioxide titanium dioxide is a white powder in fact you can see it around you if you look around the room you're in almost certainly the walls are white with titanium dioxide it's a very cheap white pigment normally what happens in the process for making titanium metal is that first of all it is converted to Titanium tetrachloride TI cl4 and if you just leave it as titanium tetrachloride in the air it will react with the air with water in the air and go back to titanium dioxide you haven't achieved anything in fact one of my colleagues Rich born showed Brady earlier what happens with this reaction I've never seen it but I had to stay in my office and work however you can take titanium tetrachloride and convert it to the metal and once you've got the metal it's pretty unreactive provided that you keep it cold if you put titanium at high temperatures in oxygen it will burn so there are some processes where you would like to use the strength of titanium but because there's oxygen there it's not safe but cars and most airlanes don't get hot enough for the burning in oxygen to be a problem so it is a fantastic material and if we could solve the pro problem of how to make titanium metal cheaply in terms of the energy needed to convert the oxide into the metal then we could have cars that were far more fuele efficient and cheaper to run so it's a really good goal tianium is used at the moment in applications where strength and lightness is more important than cost if you're building fighter aircraft where of course cost is important you but you need it to be pretty light or you can't can't get to the speeds that you need to shoot down the enemy and so on then they will use titanium Alloys if those are best you often use titanium for very high pressure applications when chemists want to do experiments at high pressure they will often use titanium because again it is very light and again strong it is also has a great advantage that it's non-magnetic and when you want to for example do experiments in a high magnetic field when you need something strong you can't use steel because your apparatus will be pulled away by the magnet and nothing will work so titanium has a very special applications which can be very useful but they could be so much more useful if we could apply it more widely it's used where you really need strength and where money is not terribly important is in hip implants in your hip you want to have something that's very strong and very light each time you move your leg you don't want to be moving a cannonball or something really heavy but you want it to be really strong and so again very often hip implants will be made out of titanium the piece that goes into your leg is made out of titanium and ends in a ball and the part that goes into your pelvis is often made of polythene plastic so that you get the ball and socket effect well one of the most interesting applications of titanium is as a catalyst for making polythene polyethylene the material material that is used particularly for plastic buckets and other plastic objects and ethylene was first polymerized turned into plastic some people call it ethine rather ethylene was turned into plastic before the second world war with a very high press reaction that produced a material that was rather soft and you couldn't for example use for making buckets and then in the 1950s um a German chemist called Zigler he discovered partly also working with Italian chemist called NATA that if you take a titanium compound and an aluminium compound together this was a really good Catalyst and by really good I mean one gram of this Catalyst could produce a ton of plastic so that because titanium is relatively cheap it means you don't even have to get the Catalyst out of the plastic because there's so little of it in the plastic you can just afford to sell it when your plastic bucket without losing much money does that mean there's probably a little bit of titanium in my plastic bucket at home yes and there's probably more titanium from the fact that you cleaned your paintbrush when you were painting your kitchen or bedroom with white paint so there's titanium

This is a balloon of Helium, and Helium is a very small gas. we use in this case to find leaks in high pressure in high vacuum operators, because it's very very small, finds the smallest, smallest holes. But just like Hydrogen, it's also very very light. And you know, in the past we used Hydrogen to fill balloons, for transport, and now you see the Goodyear Blimp, sporting occasions, filled with Helium.  So Helium is probably the most unreactive of the elements. It has a mass of 4, so it weighs four times as much as a Hydrogen atom, but Hydrogen is an H2 molecule, whereas Helium exists as isolated atoms, so that the a Helium molecule weighs twice as much as Hydrogen. See here, we have a Helium filled balloon, and it's extremely light, so I'm not gonna let it go right now so I will lose it to the ceiling. So I'm just gonna put on a piece of string. tie a lead around it again. Helium can not be synthesized in nature because it is just an element. It is found as a component of natural gas in some places, particularly in the United States, because it is formed by the radioactive decay of minerals underground, and these form Helium, which is trapped with the natural gas. So here we have a Helium balloon floating, because it's displacing its volume of air, and it'll float quite nicely. It's actually quite hard to contain, so the piece of string and the heavy stand is there holding it down, because we don't really wanna lose it. If we take a balloon of another light gas, and that's Hydrogen, and we add a match to it or we set it on fire, it will burn really really quickly, and really energetically, because it makes for lots and lots of water, Hydrogen plus Oxygen.  We're gonna do the same experiment now, but we're gonna do it with a Helium filled balloon, and see if that'll burn. So here we have a technical match on a stick, and we're gonna offer it out to our floating balloon of Helium. Let's see what happens this time.  A little bit of a bang, but that's just bang of the gas escaping, it didn't burn. Yep, it's unreactive, it's an inert gas. The molecule is very light, so once it is in the atmosphere it will eventually go out into outer space. So that we are, in theory at least, likely to run out of Helium in eventual future. If it is just released to the atmosphere.  So what I got here is a balloon of Helium, and it's really really light, and it's displacing a lot of volume, so if I let go of it it's gonna fly like a balloon. So what we're gonna do is I'm gonna hold it down here, and Neil is gonna cool it for me using some liquid Nitrogen. Now you can see Neil is using gloves, because it's very very cold. Okay, so as he cools the balloon the gasses inside are slowing down, and they take up much much less volume as we slow them down, and now you can see it's displacing less volume, so the balloon is quite happy to sit on the table. If we stop pouring the liquid Nitrogen onto it now, and watch what happens as the balloon starts to warm up again. Because the gases are gaining more energy, and they are occupying more space, and becoming more bouyant, so the Helium comes back to the ceiling, where it really wants to be.  The Helium has a whole series of useful properties because it's a very light gas, if you breathe in Helium, you then start speaking like Donald Duck, in a very squeaky voice.  Helium. Fantastic element. Very light, very fun. Because the speed of sound is much greater in Helium than it is in ordinary gases. It is also very useful as a liquid. It only liquifies at very low temperature. Its boiling point is -269 degrees centigrade. But if you cool things with liquid Helium, you get very strange properties, for example, some materials lose their electrical resistance. So liquid Helium is used for magnets when you need very powerful magnets, and for example, they're used magnets from magnetic resonance imaging in hospitals. If you use a vacuum pump to pump hard on the Helium, the boiling point will go even lower, and you can go to nearly two degrees absolute. And so Helium is very important for all sorts of refrigiration. Captions by www.SubPLY.com

**None of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest a related MCQ.**

The ground truth MCQ asks why helium substituted hydrogen as the gas of choice in party balloons and airships. The correct answer is that helium is inert and hydrogen is dangerously reactive.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 discusses the molecular structure of Helium compared to Hydrogen, but it does not directly address the reason for the substitution.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

**Question 2**

This question does not directly ask about the substitution, but it does discuss a key difference between Helium and Hydrogen, which is related to the reason for the substitution.

Please note that this is not an exact match, and a new generated MCQ that directly addresses the ground truth MCQ would be more accurate.

If you would like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
So the last time we tried to film chlorine
experiments we found that the chlorine cylinder itself had
a slight problem, it was seized here. But the Stig
has acquired another cylinder of chlorine. So you know
what this means, it means that we feel duty-bound to
increase the intensity of our chlorine video and show you
some chemistry with chlorine. Chlorine is an element that many people have
heard of. It’s a greenish-yellow gas which consists
of, the gas consists of two chlorine atoms bonded together
so it’s Cl2 and it’s much heavier than air. Incredibly reactive, incredibly poisonous,
not a very nice compound at all. Ok so Neil is about to open
the cylinder of chlorine to allow some of the chlorine
gas to leak through the pipe into the, to the flask in
the fume hood. Chlorine sits in the right-hand side of the
periodic table in the halogens in group, well, some people
say seven, some people say seventeen. Really what that
says is that chlorine wants another electron to get
that noble gas configuration and it will move heaven
and earth to get that electron! So during the First World War it was used
as a chemical weapon. The gas could spread across the battlefields
and when it came to the trenches, which were holes in
the ground, it would fall into the trenches and fill them
up. You can see the yellow colour against the
white background on the paper, so now we’re starting
to fill that flask with chlorine; it’s quite dense,
so it will stick to the bottom of the flask it’s not like
a light gas like hydrogen or helium, it won’t come upwards.
So now you can see the colour in that chlorine is really
quite intense. It wasn’t a terribly good weapon because
it could quite easily, if the wind changed direction, it
could blow the gas back to the people who were letting it
out. So we’ll just put a stopper in to contain
the gas while we prepare the rest of the experiment. Chlorine is quite corrosive, it reacts with
water to make an acid, HCl, hydrochloric acid which can
attack people’s lungs. The lungs generate fluid, they fill
up with fluid and quickly the person drowns in their own fluid.
It also corrodes things very easily so all the metal
fittings on people’s battle dress, the brass buttons,
brass buckles, all went green as well. But it’s not a terribly
effective weapon but when people weren’t expecting
any sort of chemical weapon it must have been terrifying. Ok so we have a small amount of aluminium
here which we put on the end of a wire. We’re gonna
heat the aluminium in that flame and then we’re gonna
put the hot aluminium into the flask of chlorine,
then hopefully we’ll see, the chlorine will react with
the aluminium and we’ll get very rapid formation of aluminium
trichloride, AlCl3. The British Army created whole regiments of
gas soldiers who were all trained chemists, who
were sent out to handle these cylinders of gas. And
on the German side in the First World War, Fritz Haber,
the inventor of the Haber process to make ammonia became very
keen on chemical weapons and he was the chief proponent.
His wife was really furious about this and in fact shot
herself with his revolver, killed herself, the day before
he was due to go back to the front. And he, it was said
that this was because she objected to his work on
chemical weapons. Though at the same time there were
rumours that he was having an affair with another
woman, so there may have been other factors at play as
well. So, let’s heat up our aluminium. Ok, so
it’s nice and warm, all over. And then we’ll drop it or
add it into the chlorine glass. Now instantly we are seeing
aluminium trichloride coming out of the top and reacting
with moisture in the air. So now you can see the
reaction is getting very intense and we are seeing a flame
in the bottom. So the aluminium is being consumed
as it’s reacting, oxidising strongly in that chlorine-rich
air. Chlorine is found all over the world, the
sea contains sodium chloride, and there are huge deposits
of sodium chloride in salt lakes where lakes have dried
out, such as in some parts of the States, where you,
United States, where you have salt lakes where people
can race cars and things across the flat surface
and in other parts of the world. All of the aluminium has been consumed now
by the chlorine: a very, very rapid reaction. There are many areas, such as in the north
of England, in the county of Cheshire and also in Salzburg
in Austria, where there are prehistoric deposits of salt
from prehistoric salt lakes, which can now be mined
really quite easily, and there, so salt and chlorine
is a very common element. It’s made from sodium chloride
solution by electrolysis, by passing an electric current,
and it’s a very energy intensive process. One percent of
the UK’s electricity was used, at one time, for making
chlorine from sodium chloride, and the chlorine is used
particularly for making the plastic PVC. While we got chlorine here, we thought we’d
do a couple of reactions. So we’ve got some chlorine
in this flask and you can see the nice yellow colour and
I thought what we’d try and do now is do a competition
reaction again or a reaction with iron. So now the
iron, we’re gonna heat the iron, this is iron wool which
you might use for treating wood, and we’re gonna heat
that until it’s warm and put it in the chlorine, the
chlorine will oxidise it to iron chloride. Chlorine will react with all sorts of metals.
You can make salt by burning the metal sodium in chlorine,
and if you put in other metals like aluminium or iron
they will also react. Aluminium reacts to form aluminium
trichloride which is the salt of aluminium and iron will
similarly react to form iron chloride, and most metals
but not all of them will react with chlorine: lead will
not for example. But it is really quite a reactive
gas. So really rapid reaction there as the hot
iron starts to react with the chlorine to form iron chloride.
Very, very exothermic again and I think, yes this is
very hot, we might have to move it off the paper. So what happens in all of these reactions
is that the chlorine removes an electron from the metal
to make the chloride ion Cl-, and the chloride ion
is perfectly innocuous, you can drink, you can eat chloride,
whereas chlorine itself is very poisonous. Oh it’s warm, it’s not too hot to touch
its like picking up a mug of warm tea or warm coffee. But you
can see again the products of the chemical reaction
have precipitated out across the flask, and now
if I remove the…wire again I can see that all of the
iron has been consumed again instantly. The moment that
it got into that chlorine-rich flask; very, very rapid
reaction, very, very reactive with chlorine.

Question 5: What is the reaction between aluminium and chlorine? Options: A. Aluminium + chlorine → aluminium chloride, B. Aluminium + chlorine → aluminium trichloride, C. Aluminium + chlorine → aluminium oxide, D. Aluminium nitride Correct Option: B

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the reaction between sodium and chlorine.

A question that is more similar to the ground truth MCQ is not present in the list of generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose:

None of the questions perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one based on the content and the chemical reaction, I would choose Question 5, but replacing aluminium with sodium.

Since this question is not present in the list, I will choose the one that is most similar based on the chemical reaction, even though it's not the same element:

 Question 5 (as the most similar based on chemical reaction, but it's not the correct element)

However, I must note that the correct answer for the ground truth MCQ (sodium chloride) is present as an option in Question 1, but the question is asking about the chemical formula for chlorine, not the reaction between sodium and chlorine.

If I really have to choose an index from the options, I would say that the most similar question (although not very similar) is:

 Question 1 (but this is a very weak match)

**Transcript**:
So the last time we tried to film chlorine
experiments we found that the chlorine cylinder itself had
a slight problem, it was seized here. But the Stig
has acquired another cylinder of chlorine. So you know
what this means, it means that we feel duty-bound to
increase the intensity of our chlorine video and show you
some chemistry with chlorine. Chlorine is an element that many people have
heard of. It’s a greenish-yellow gas which consists
of, the gas consists of two chlorine atoms bonded together
so it’s Cl2 and it’s much heavier than air. Incredibly reactive, incredibly poisonous,
not a very nice compound at all. Ok so Neil is about to open
the cylinder of chlorine to allow some of the chlorine
gas to leak through the pipe into the, to the flask in
the fume hood. Chlorine sits in the right-hand side of the
periodic table in the halogens in group, well, some people
say seven, some people say seventeen. Really what that
says is that chlorine wants another electron to get
that noble gas configuration and it will move heaven
and earth to get that electron! So during the First World War it was used
as a chemical weapon. The gas could spread across the battlefields
and when it came to the trenches, which were holes in
the ground, it would fall into the trenches and fill them
up. You can see the yellow colour against the
white background on the paper, so now we’re starting
to fill that flask with chlorine; it’s quite dense,
so it will stick to the bottom of the flask it’s not like
a light gas like hydrogen or helium, it won’t come upwards.
So now you can see the colour in that chlorine is really
quite intense. It wasn’t a terribly good weapon because
it could quite easily, if the wind changed direction, it
could blow the gas back to the people who were letting it
out. So we’ll just put a stopper in to contain
the gas while we prepare the rest of the experiment. Chlorine is quite corrosive, it reacts with
water to make an acid, HCl, hydrochloric acid which can
attack people’s lungs. The lungs generate fluid, they fill
up with fluid and quickly the person drowns in their own fluid.
It also corrodes things very easily so all the metal
fittings on people’s battle dress, the brass buttons,
brass buckles, all went green as well. But it’s not a terribly
effective weapon but when people weren’t expecting
any sort of chemical weapon it must have been terrifying. Ok so we have a small amount of aluminium
here which we put on the end of a wire. We’re gonna
heat the aluminium in that flame and then we’re gonna
put the hot aluminium into the flask of chlorine,
then hopefully we’ll see, the chlorine will react with
the aluminium and we’ll get very rapid formation of aluminium
trichloride, AlCl3. The British Army created whole regiments of
gas soldiers who were all trained chemists, who
were sent out to handle these cylinders of gas. And
on the German side in the First World War, Fritz Haber,
the inventor of the Haber process to make ammonia became very
keen on chemical weapons and he was the chief proponent.
His wife was really furious about this and in fact shot
herself with his revolver, killed herself, the day before
he was due to go back to the front. And he, it was said
that this was because she objected to his work on
chemical weapons. Though at the same time there were
rumours that he was having an affair with another
woman, so there may have been other factors at play as
well. So, let’s heat up our aluminium. Ok, so
it’s nice and warm, all over. And then we’ll drop it or
add it into the chlorine glass. Now instantly we are seeing
aluminium trichloride coming out of the top and reacting
with moisture in the air. So now you can see the
reaction is getting very intense and we are seeing a flame
in the bottom. So the aluminium is being consumed
as it’s reacting, oxidising strongly in that chlorine-rich
air. Chlorine is found all over the world, the
sea contains sodium chloride, and there are huge deposits
of sodium chloride in salt lakes where lakes have dried
out, such as in some parts of the States, where you,
United States, where you have salt lakes where people
can race cars and things across the flat surface
and in other parts of the world. All of the aluminium has been consumed now
by the chlorine: a very, very rapid reaction. There are many areas, such as in the north
of England, in the county of Cheshire and also in Salzburg
in Austria, where there are prehistoric deposits of salt
from prehistoric salt lakes, which can now be mined
really quite easily, and there, so salt and chlorine
is a very common element. It’s made from sodium chloride
solution by electrolysis, by passing an electric current,
and it’s a very energy intensive process. One percent of
the UK’s electricity was used, at one time, for making
chlorine from sodium chloride, and the chlorine is used
particularly for making the plastic PVC. While we got chlorine here, we thought we’d
do a couple of reactions. So we’ve got some chlorine
in this flask and you can see the nice yellow colour and
I thought what we’d try and do now is do a competition
reaction again or a reaction with iron. So now the
iron, we’re gonna heat the iron, this is iron wool which
you might use for treating wood, and we’re gonna heat
that until it’s warm and put it in the chlorine, the
chlorine will oxidise it to iron chloride. Chlorine will react with all sorts of metals.
You can make salt by burning the metal sodium in chlorine,
and if you put in other metals like aluminium or iron
they will also react. Aluminium reacts to form aluminium
trichloride which is the salt of aluminium and iron will
similarly react to form iron chloride, and most metals
but not all of them will react with chlorine: lead will
not for example. But it is really quite a reactive
gas. So really rapid reaction there as the hot
iron starts to react with the chlorine to form iron chloride.
Very, very exothermic again and I think, yes this is
very hot, we might have to move it off the paper. So what happens in all of these reactions
is that the chlorine removes an electron from the metal
to make the chloride ion Cl-, and the chloride ion
is perfectly innocuous, you can drink, you can eat chloride,
whereas chlorine itself is very poisonous. Oh it’s warm, it’s not too hot to touch

can see again the products of the chemical reaction
have precipitated out across the flask, and now
if I remove the…wire again I can see that all of the
iron has been consumed again instantly. The moment that
it got into that chlorine-rich flask; very, very rapid

**Transcript**:
I'm in my hotel room in Sydney Australia where I'm staying for a conference before I start my lecture tour going around various cities in Australia and I've just read the paper which I think so exciting that I thought I should tell you about it before we make a bigger video when the results of the paper are fully known the papers in the journal science and it's about looking for new super-heavy elements though the current state of play is that there is some evidence for all the elements up to an including 118 now the evidence for the last few is not equally good so elements 114 now and 116 are about to be named and 113 115 and we're still waiting for confirmation but essentially the whole of the periodic table is more or less known in some of my videos the ones about 118 I said that I thought there was no chance of ever seeing elements beyond 118 and the point about this paper is that it says that scientists are looking for and believed they might find element 120 now what they're saying is they may be able to start finding elements in this part in the next row as you will have seen people have predicted how the periodic table might appear lower down here right up to element 172 what has happened is that chemists and physicists have predicted that if you make heavier elements that there may be a few arrangements of neutrons and protons which are much more stable than these very unstable elements over here and they call this the island of stability it's because if you plot out as they have done in picture here the numbers of protons and neutrons you can get areas which appear like an island where the elements are stable and then there are other combinations which are not stable what people are doing is trying to make these elements in the same way that they've done before where you take a heavy element with a heavy nucleus and bombard it with lighter elements and you choose the combination so that the mass of the light element and the heavy element makes the one you're trying to synthesize so in this case the experiments described in this paper are taking titanium which has atomic number 22 and californium which has atomic number 98 and if you add 22 plus 98 you get a hundred and twenty so the experiment consists of accelerating nuclei of titanium atoms at enormous ly high speed a fraction of the speed of light and letting it bang in to the sample of californium and most of the time the titanium just bounces off in some random direction but what they hope is that every so often and it hasn't happened yet but every so often one of these titanium nuclei will hit the californium in such a way that it will go inside and you can see it's quite a hard process but it can go inside so you then have the combined nucleus with mass 120 + this nucleus then shoots out of the back of the target and towards your detector but there's all sorts of fragments of atoms being knocked out to the back of the target so the key is that you have to have a really good separator based on magnetic fields so if you make a nucleus of 120 element 120 it will whiz out and hit the detector without most of the other junk once it gets to the detector as with previous super-heavy elements it will all being will stick into the detector and then once it's there it will begin decaying and out of the nucleus will come smaller fragments what the point of the experiment is that people can predict fairly accurately what would come out of a nucleus of element 120 if it was made so if they see those bits they can recognize they've made element 120 so far they haven't seen anything at all the experiments that were described in this paper are being done in the Institute in dumb start where we visited a few months ago to look at elements like Boreum and hassium where they were synthesized the reason why the experiments get difficult is each time the nucleus you're trying to make gets heavier the chances of your accelerated atom and the target fusing together get smaller and smaller and smaller so the experiment gets more and more difficult to do you have to understand the titanium atoms are coming a billions every second and they're running the experiments for weeks if not months in the hope of just seeing one atom coming out so the probability is pretty small the reason why they're trying to make 120 rather than 119 which would be the next atom in the periodic table after 118 so you've got one hundred and eighteen hundred nineteen hundred and twenty but already it becomes clear it's become clear that elements that have an even number of protons that's one hundred fourteen hundred 1618 are more stable than the ones with odd numbers so it makes sense to look for 120 before trying to find 119 I don't know but it is connected with the fact that the neutrons and the protons in the nucleus form shells rather in the same way that you get shells of electrons in the atoms though exactly how they form the shells I don't know the hope is that perhaps some of these super-heavy elements really may be much more stable than anything they've seen before after all the targets they're using californium wasn't known when I was born and now you can make enough californium to have a metal target made out of it so I doubt whether you will be able to have lumps of element 120 or one of the high ones but you might be able to and whatever happens you'll have a much better understanding of what it is that makes atoms form and what are the limitations what are the rules that hold them together so this is not the sort of experiment that will necessarily give you new iPhone tomorrow but on the other hand it will give us a lot of scientific understanding so it's well worth doing well I think that will be quite fun

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the group of the periodic table where element 120 would be placed, with options related to alkali metals, alkali earths, and transition metals.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is the most relevant, as it discusses the properties of element 120, specifically why scientists are looking for element 120 rather than element 119. Although it does not directly ask about the group of the periodic table, it mentions the even number of protons in element 120, which is related to its position in the periodic table.

However, I must emphasize that Question 7 is not a direct match to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **7**

Please note that this is not an exact match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be needed to fully match the ground truth MCQ.

[ music ] A Tetrad of Lunar Eclipses – presented by Science@NASA For people in the United States, an extraordinary series of lunar eclipses is about to begin. The action starts on April 15th when the full Moon passes through the amber shadow of Earth, producing a midnight eclipse visible across North America. That night marks the beginning of a lunar eclipse tetrad a series of 4 consecutive total eclipses occurring at six month intervals. The total eclipse of April 15, 2014, will be followed by another on Oct. 8, 2014, and another on April 4, 2015, and another on Sept. 28 2015. 'The most unique thing about the 2014-2015 tetrad is that all of them are visible for all or parts of the USA,' says longtime NASA eclipse expert Fred Espenak. On average, lunar eclipses occur about twice a year, but not all of them are total. There are three types: A penumbral eclipse is when the Moon passes through the pale outskirts of Earth's shadow. It's so subtle, sky watchers often don't notice an eclipse is underway. A partial eclipse is more dramatic. The Moon dips into the core of Earth's shadow, but not all the way, so only a fraction of Moon is darkened. A total eclipse, when the entire Moon is shadowed, is best of all. The face of the Moon turns sunset-red for up to an hour or more as the eclipse slowly unfolds. Usually, lunar eclipses come in no particular order. A partial can be followed by a total, followed by a penumbral, and so on. Anything goes. Occasionally, though, the sequence is more orderly. When four consecutive lunar eclipses are all total, the series is called a tetrad. 'During the 21st century, there are 9 sets of tetrads, so I would describe tetrads as a frequent occurrence in the current pattern of lunar eclipses,' says Espenak. 'But this has not always been the case. During the three hundred year interval from 1600 to 1900, for instance, there were no tetrads at all.' The April 15th eclipse begins at 2 AM Eastern time when the edge of the Moon first enters the amber core of Earth's shadow. Totality occurs during a 78 minute interval beginning around 3 o'clock in the morning on the east coast, midnight on the west coast. Weather permitting, the red Moon will be easy to see across the entirety of North America. Why red? A quick trip to the Moon provides the answer: Imagine yourself standing on a dusty lunar plain looking up at the sky. Overhead hangs Earth, nightside down, completely hiding the sun behind it. The eclipse is underway. You might expect Earth seen in this way to be utterly dark, but it's not. The rim of the planet seems to be on fire! As you scan your eye around Earth's circumference, you're seeing every sunrise and every sunset in the world, all of them, all at once. This incredible light beams into the heart of Earth's shadow, filling it with a coppery glow and transforming the Moon into a great red orb. Mark your calendar for April 15th, and let the tetrad begin! For more rare occurrences in the night's sky, stay tuned to science.nasa.gov

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] I want to share with you over the next 18 minutes um a pretty incredible idea actually it's a really big idea but to get us started I I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world now I bet in this audience you're thinking of some really incredible technology some stuff that I I I haven't even heard of them absolutely sure but I'm also sure pretty sure that absolutely nobody is thinking of this this is a polio vaccine and it's a great thing actually that nobody's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted this is a great technology we can take it completely for granted but it wasn't always that way even here in California if we were to go back just a few years it was a very different story people were terrified of this disease they were terrified of polio and it would cause public panic and it was because of scenes like this in this scene people are living in an iron lung these are people who were perfectly healthy 2 or 3 days before and then 2 days later they can no longer breathe and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs but also their breathing muscles and they were going to spend the rest of their lives usually in this iron lung to breathe for them this disease was terrifying there was no cure and there was no vaccine the disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary National effort to find a way to stop it 20 years later they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine it was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s finally a vaccine that could stop this awful disease and here in the United States it had an incredible impact as you can see the virus stopped and it stopped very very fast but this wasn't the case everywhere in the world and it happen so fast in the United States however that even just last month John Stewart said this is polio still active because I was I I thought that that had been eradicated in the way that small pox had been eradicated oops John Poli has almost been eradicated but the reality is that polio still exists today we made this map for John to try and show him exactly where polio still exists this is the picture there's not very much left in the world but the reason there's not very much left is because there's been an extraordinary public private partnership working behind the scenes almost unknown I'm sure to most of you here today it's been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease and it's got it down to this few cases that you can see here on this graphic but just last year we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio and this is the reason in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade on opposite sides of the globe there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks hundreds of people were paralyzed hundreds of people died children as well as adults and in both cases we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries they had come from thousands of miles away and in one case it originated on another continent and not only that but when they came into these countries then they got on Commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even further other places like Russia where for the first time in over a decade last year children were crippled and Paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you these are under control now and it looks like they uh they'll probably stop very very quickly but the message was very clear polio is still a devastating explosive disease it's just happening in another part of the world and our big idea is that the scientific Miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis so I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership the polio partnership is trying to do we're not trying to control polio we're not trying to get it down to just a few cases because this disease is like a root fire it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely so what we're looking for is a permanent solution we want a world in which every child just like you guys can take for granted a polio free world so we're looking for a permanent solution and this is where we get lucky this is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try and do something truly extraordinary this virus can only survive in people it can't live for a very long time in people it doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all and we've got pretty good vaccines as I just showed you so we are trying to wipe out this virus completely what the poo eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on earth now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this to eradicating diseases it's been tried six times in the last century and it's been successful exactly once and this is because disease eradication is still the venture capital of Public Health the risks are massive but the payoff economic humanitarian motivational it's absolutely huge one Congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the US put into small poox eradication pays itself off every 26 days in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs and if we can finish polio eradication the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone so those are the kind of stakes that we're after but small poox eradication was hard it was very very hard and polio eradication in many ways is even tougher and there's a few reasons for that the first is that when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with small pox and there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries so it was a massive effort the Second Challenge we had was in contrast to the small poox vaccine which was very stable and a single dose protected you for life the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile AG it deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put the special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child it's not potent it's not going to protect them even then kids need many doses of the vaccine but the third challenge we have and probably even bigger one the biggest challenge is that in contrast to small pox where you could always see your enemy every single person almost who is infected with small poox had this Telltale rash so you could get around the disease you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off polio it's almost completely different the vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease so you can't see the enemy most of the time and as a result we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with small poox we've had to create one of the largest social move movements in history there's over 10 million people probably 20 million people largely volunteers who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now uh been called the largest internationally coordinated operation in peacetime these people these 20 million people vaccinate over 500 million children every single year multiple times at the peak of our operations now giving the polio vaccine is simple just two drops like that but reaching 500 million people is much much tougher and these vaccinators these volunteers they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest densest Urban slums in the world they've got to track under sweltering Suns to some of the most remote difficult to reach places in the world and they also have to dodge bullets because we have got to operate during shaky ceasefires and trues to try and vaccinate children even in areas affected by conflict one reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about 5 years ago a place which has eradicated polio not once but twice because they got reinfected he was sitting on the side of the road watching one of these polio campaigns unfold and a few months later he wrote this is foreign aid at its most heroic and these Heroes they come from every Walk of Life all sorts of backgrounds but one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International this is a group whose million strong Army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years the right at the center of the whole thing now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication more than 15 years much longer than it should have but once it was built the results Were Striking within a couple of years every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses with the exception of four countries that you see here and it was in each of those was only part of the country and then by 1999 one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide proof of concept and then today there's been a 99% reduction greater than 99% reduction in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease when we started over 20 years ago 1,000 children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus last year it was 1,000 and at the same time the polio eradication program has been working to help in a lot of other areas it's been working to help control pandemic flu SARS for example it's also been trying to save children by doing other things giving vitamin A drops giving measel shots giving uh bed Nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us the International Community to reach every single child every single Community the most vulnerable people in the world with the most basic of Health Services irrespective of geography poverty culture and even conflict so things were looking very exciting and then about 5 years ago this virus this ancient virus started to fight back the first problem we ran into was that in these last four countries the strongholds of this virus we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out and then to make the matters even worse the virus started to spread out of these four places especially Northern India and Northern Nigeria into much of Africa Asia and even into Europe causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades and then in one of the most important tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have in conditions like this the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to now at that time there was a great as you can imagine frustration let's call it frustration it started to grow very very quickly and all of a sudden some very important voices in the world of Public Health started to say say hang on we should abandon this idea of eradication let's settle for control that's good enough now as seductive as the idea of control sounds it's a false premise the brutal truth is if we don't have the will or the skill or even the money that we need to reach children the most vulnerable children in the world with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine then pretty soon more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year there's absolutely no question these are children like Umar Umar is seven years old and he's from northern Nigeria he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters Umar also has polio Umar was paralyzed for Life his right leg was paralyzed in 2004 this leg his right leg now takes an awful beating because he has to half crawl because it's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends keep up with his brothers and sisters than to get up on his crutches and walk but um is a fantastic student he's an incredible kid as uh you you probably can't see the detail here but this is his report card and you'll see he's get perfect scores he got 100% in all the important things um like nursery rhymes for example there but um you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with with polio these days but it's not true Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances the reality of polio today is something very different polio strikes the poorest communities in the world it leaves their children paralyzed and it drags their families deeper into poverty because they're desperately searching and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have trying in vain to find a cure for their children we think children deserve better and so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago when people were saying that we should call it off the polio partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find Innovative new Solutions new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again in Northern India we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this so that we could guide our investments in vaccinator shelters so we could get to the millions of children on the coy River Basin where there were no other health services in Northern Nigeria the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and Community confidence and now they've even started using these devices speaking of cool technology these little devices little GIS trackers like this which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccin and then they can track them and at the end of the day they look and see did these guys get to every single Street every single house this is the kind of commitment now we're seeing to try and reach all of the children we'd been missing and in Afghanistan we're trying new approaches access negotiators working closely with the international Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child but as we tried these extraordinary things as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics we went back to the vaccine it's a 50-year-old vaccine and we thought surely we can make a better vaccine so that when they finally get to these kids we can have a better bang for our buck and this started an incredible collaboration with industry and within six months we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted just two years ago the last two types of polio in the world and on June the 9th 200 2009 we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine and it turned out to be a GameChanger danger the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had and we immediately started using this well in a couple of months we had to get it out of production and it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world and we didn't start with the easy places the first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from new technologies like this now here at T over the last couple of days I've I've seen people um challenging the audience again and again to uh to to believe in the impossible so um this morning at about 7 o'clock we decided that we try and drive Chris and the production crew here at berserk by um downloading all of our data from India again so that you could see something that's just unfolding today which proves that The Impossible Is Possible and only two years ago people were saying that this is imposs possible now remember Northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio utar Pradesh and bear 500,000 children every single month sanitation is terrible and our old vaccine you remember worked half as well as it should have and yet The Impossible is happening today marks exactly 6 months and for the first time in history not a single child has been paralyzed in utar Pradesh or Bear India is not unique in umar's home country of Nigeria a 95% reduction in the number of children Paralyzed by polio last year and in the last 6 months we've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history ladies and gentlemen with a combination of smart people smart technology and smart Investments polio can now be eradicated anywhere we have major challenges you can imagine to finish this job but as you've also seen it's doable it has great secondary benefits and polio eradication is a great buy and as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus it's a stark reminder that we are failing as a society to reach children with the most basic of services and for that reason polio eradication it's the ultimate in equity and it's the ultimate in social justice the huge social movement that's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children it's ready to reach them with bed nets with other things but capitalizing on their enthusiasm capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago finishing polio is a smart thing to do and it's the right thing to do now we're in tough times economically but as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio there's never a wrong time to do the right thing finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do and we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last 20 years we have a new vaccine we have new resolve and we have new tactics we have the chance to write an entirely new polio free chapter in human history but if we blink now we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease here's a great idea to spread and polio now help us tell the story help us build the momentum so that very soon every child every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio free life forever thank you well Bruce where do you think the toughest places are going to be where would you say we need to be the smartest the four places where where you saw that we've never stopped Northern Nigeria Northern India Southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan they're going to be the uh the toughest but the interesting thing is of those three India is looking real good as you just saw in the data and Afghanistan Afghanistan we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly it keeps getting reinfected so the tough ones are going to get top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished they're going to be the tough ones and what about the money give us a sense of of how much the campaign costs a year and is it easy uh to raise that money and what what's going to be like the next couple of years it's interesting we spend right now about $750 million to $800 million a year that's what it costs to reach 500 million children it sounds like a lot of money it is a lot of money but when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times 20 30 cents to reach a child that's not very much money but right now we don't have enough of that we have a big gap in that money we're cutting corners and every time we cut Corners more places get infected that shouldn't have and just slows us down and that great buy costs us a little bit more well hopefully we'll uh get the word out and the the governments will keep their generosity up so uh good luck we're all in this with you thank you thank [Applause] you

[Music] [Music] [Applause] I want to share with you over the next 18 minutes um a pretty incredible idea actually it's a really big idea but to get us started I I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world now I bet in this audience you're thinking of some really incredible technology some stuff that I I I haven't even heard of them absolutely sure but I'm also sure pretty sure that absolutely nobody is thinking of this this is a polio vaccine and it's a great thing actually that nobody's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted this is a great technology we can take it completely for granted but it wasn't always that way even here in California if we were to go back just a few years it was a very different story people were terrified of this disease they were terrified of polio and it would cause public panic and it was because of scenes like this in this scene people are living in an iron lung these are people who were perfectly healthy 2 or 3 days before and then 2 days later they can no longer breathe and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs but also their breathing muscles and they were going to spend the rest of their lives usually in this iron lung to breathe for them this disease was terrifying there was no cure and there was no vaccine the disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary National effort to find a way to stop it 20 years later they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine it was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s finally a vaccine that could stop this awful disease and here in the United States it had an incredible impact as you can see the virus stopped and it stopped very very fast but this wasn't the case everywhere in the world and it happen so fast in the United States however that even just last month John Stewart said this is polio still active because I was I I thought that that had been eradicated in the way that small pox had been eradicated oops John Poli has almost been eradicated but the reality is that polio still exists today we made this map for John to try and show him exactly where polio still exists this is the picture there's not very much left in the world but the reason there's not very much left is because there's been an extraordinary public private partnership working behind the scenes almost unknown I'm sure to most of you here today it's been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease and it's got it down to this few cases that you can see here on this graphic but just last year we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio and this is the reason in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade on opposite sides of the globe there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks hundreds of people were paralyzed hundreds of people died children as well as adults and in both cases we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries they had come from thousands of miles away and in one case it originated on another continent and not only that but when they came into these countries then they got on Commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even further other places like Russia where for the first time in over a decade last year children were crippled and Paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you these are under control now and it looks like they uh they'll probably stop very very quickly but the message was very clear polio is still a devastating explosive disease it's just happening in another part of the world and our big idea is that the scientific Miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis so I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership the polio partnership is trying to do we're not trying to control polio we're not trying to get it down to just a few cases because this disease is like a root fire it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely so what we're looking for is a permanent solution we want a world in which every child just like you guys can take for granted a polio free world so we're looking for a permanent solution and this is where we get lucky this is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try and do something truly extraordinary this virus can only survive in people it can't live for a very long time in people it doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all and we've got pretty good vaccines as I just showed you so we are trying to wipe out this virus completely what the poo eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on earth now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this to eradicating diseases it's been tried six times in the last century and it's been successful exactly once and this is because disease eradication is still the venture capital of Public Health the risks are massive but the payoff economic humanitarian motivational it's absolutely huge one Congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the US put into small poox eradication pays itself off every 26 days in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs and if we can finish polio eradication the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone so those are the kind of stakes that we're after but small poox eradication was hard it was very very hard and polio eradication in many ways is even tougher and there's a few reasons for that the first is that when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with small pox and there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries so it was a massive effort the Second Challenge we had was in contrast to the small poox vaccine which was very stable and a single dose protected you for life the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile AG it deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put the special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child it's not potent it's not going to protect them even then kids need many doses of the vaccine but the third challenge we have and probably even bigger one the biggest challenge is that in contrast to small pox where you could always see your enemy every single person almost who is infected with small poox had this Telltale rash so you could get around the disease you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off polio it's almost completely different the vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease so you can't see the enemy most of the time and as a result we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with small poox we've had to create one of the largest social move movements in history there's over 10 million people probably 20 million people largely volunteers who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now uh been called the largest internationally coordinated operation in peacetime these people these 20 million people vaccinate over 500 million children every single year multiple times at the peak of our operations now giving the polio vaccine is simple just two drops like that but reaching 500 million people is much much tougher and these vaccinators these volunteers they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest densest Urban slums in the world they've got to track under sweltering Suns to some of the most remote difficult to reach places in the world and they also have to dodge bullets because we have got to operate during shaky ceasefires and trues to try and vaccinate children even in areas affected by conflict one reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about 5 years ago a place which has eradicated polio not once but twice because they got reinfected he was sitting on the side of the road watching one of these polio campaigns unfold and a few months later he wrote this is foreign aid at its most heroic and these Heroes they come from every Walk of Life all sorts of backgrounds but one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International this is a group whose million strong Army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years the right at the center of the whole thing now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication more than 15 years much longer than it should have but once it was built the results Were Striking within a couple of years every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses with the exception of four countries that you see here and it was in each of those was only part of the country and then by 1999 one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide proof of concept and then today there's been a 99% reduction greater than 99% reduction in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease when we started over 20 years ago 1,000 children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus last year it was 1,000 and at the same time the polio eradication program has been working to help in a lot of other areas it's been working to help control pandemic flu SARS for example it's also been trying to save children by doing other things giving vitamin A drops giving measel shots giving uh bed Nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us the International Community to reach every single child every single Community the most vulnerable people in the world with the most basic of Health Services irrespective of geography poverty culture and even conflict so things were looking very exciting and then about 5 years ago this virus this ancient virus started to fight back the first problem we ran into was that in these last four countries the strongholds of this virus we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out and then to make the matters even worse the virus started to spread out of these four places especially Northern India and Northern Nigeria into much of Africa Asia and even into Europe causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades and then in one of the most important tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have in conditions like this the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to now at that time there was a great as you can imagine frustration let's call it frustration it started to grow very very quickly and all of a sudden some very important voices in the world of Public Health started to say say hang on we should abandon this idea of eradication let's settle for control that's good enough now as seductive as the idea of control sounds it's a false premise the brutal truth is if we don't have the will or the skill or even the money that we need to reach children the most vulnerable children in the world with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine then pretty soon more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year there's absolutely no question these are children like Umar Umar is seven years old and he's from northern Nigeria he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters Umar also has polio Umar was paralyzed for Life his right leg was paralyzed in 2004 this leg his right leg now takes an awful beating because he has to half crawl because it's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends keep up with his brothers and sisters than to get up on his crutches and walk but um is a fantastic student he's an incredible kid as uh you you probably can't see the detail here but this is his report card and you'll see he's get perfect scores he got 100% in all the important things um like nursery rhymes for example there but um you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with with polio these days but it's not true Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances the reality of polio today is something very different polio strikes the poorest communities in the world it leaves their children paralyzed and it drags their families deeper into poverty because they're desperately searching and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have trying in vain to find a cure for their children we think children deserve better and so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago when people were saying that we should call it off the polio partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find Innovative new Solutions new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again in Northern India we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this so that we could guide our investments in vaccinator shelters so we could get to the millions of children on the coy River Basin where there were no other health services in Northern Nigeria the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and Community confidence and now they've even started using these devices speaking of cool technology these little devices little GIS trackers like this which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccin and then they can track them and at the end of the day they look and see did these guys get to every single Street every single house this is the kind of commitment now we're seeing to try and reach all of the children we'd been missing and in Afghanistan we're trying new approaches access negotiators working closely with the international Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child but as we tried these extraordinary things as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics we went back to the vaccine it's a 50-year-old vaccine and we thought surely we can make a better vaccine so that when they finally get to these kids we can have a better bang for our buck and this started an incredible collaboration with industry and within six months we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted just two years ago the last two types of polio in the world and on June the 9th 200 2009 we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine and it turned out to be a GameChanger danger the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had and we immediately started using this well in a couple of months we had to get it out of production and it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world and we didn't start with the easy places the first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from new technologies like this now here at T over the last couple of days I've I've seen people um challenging the audience again and again to uh to to believe in the impossible so um this morning at about 7 o'clock we decided that we try and drive Chris and the production crew here at berserk by um downloading all of our data from India again so that you could see something that's just unfolding today which proves that The Impossible Is Possible and only two years ago people were saying that this is imposs possible now remember Northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio utar Pradesh and bear 500,000 children every single month sanitation is terrible and our old vaccine you remember worked half as well as it should have and yet The Impossible is happening today marks exactly 6 months and for the first time in history not a single child has been paralyzed in utar Pradesh or Bear India is not unique in umar's home country of Nigeria a 95% reduction in the number of children Paralyzed by polio last year and in the last 6 months we've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history ladies and gentlemen with a combination of smart people smart technology and smart Investments polio can now be eradicated anywhere we have major challenges you can imagine to finish this job but as you've also seen it's doable it has great secondary benefits and polio eradication is a great buy and as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus it's a stark reminder that we are failing as a society to reach children with the most basic of services and for that reason polio eradication it's the ultimate in equity and it's the ultimate in social justice the huge social movement that's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children it's ready to reach them with bed nets with other things but capitalizing on their enthusiasm capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago finishing polio is a smart thing to do and it's the right thing to do now we're in tough times economically but as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio there's never a wrong time to do the right thing finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do and we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last 20 years we have a new vaccine we have new resolve and we have new tactics we have the chance to write an entirely new polio free chapter in human history but if we blink now we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease here's a great idea to spread and polio now help us tell the story help us build the momentum so that very soon every child every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio free life forever thank you well Bruce where do you think the toughest places are going to be where would you say we need to be the smartest the four places where where you saw that we've never stopped Northern Nigeria Northern India Southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan they're going to be the uh the toughest but the interesting thing is of those three India is looking real good as you just saw in the data and Afghanistan Afghanistan we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly it keeps getting reinfected so the tough ones are going to get top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished they're going to be the tough ones and what about the money give us a sense of of how much the campaign costs a year and is it easy uh to raise that money and what what's going to be like the next couple of years it's interesting we spend right now about $750 million to $800 million a year that's what it costs to reach 500 million children it sounds like a lot of money it is a lot of money but when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times 20 30 cents to reach a child that's not very much money but right now we don't have enough of that we have a big gap in that money we're cutting corners and every time we cut Corners more places get infected that shouldn't have and just slows us down and that great buy costs us a little bit more well hopefully we'll uh get the word out and the the governments will keep their generosity up so uh good luck we're all in this with you thank you thank [Applause] you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the US President who launched a campaign to find the cure for polio. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask about a specific US President or a campaign to find the cure for polio.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of polio eradication efforts, I would suggest:

**Generated MCQ 3**: What is the name of the program trying to eradicate polio? Options: A. The Polio Eradication Program, B. The Polio Partnership, C. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative, D. The Rotary International Polio Eradication Program

This generated MCQ is related to the topic of polio eradication efforts, but it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: **3** (Generated MCQ 3)

Please note that this is not a direct match, and the generated MCQs do not contain a question that directly asks about a US President launching a campaign to find the cure for polio.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] I want to share with you over the next 18 minutes um a pretty incredible idea actually it's a really big idea but to get us started I I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world now I bet in this audience you're thinking of some really incredible technology some stuff that I I I haven't even heard of them absolutely sure but I'm also sure pretty sure that absolutely nobody is thinking of this this is a polio vaccine and it's a great thing actually that nobody's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted this is a great technology we can take it completely for granted but it wasn't always that way even here in California if we were to go back just a few years it was a very different story people were terrified of this disease they were terrified of polio and it would cause public panic and it was because of scenes like this in this scene people are living in an iron lung these are people who were perfectly healthy 2 or 3 days before and then 2 days later they can no longer breathe and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs but also their breathing muscles and they were going to spend the rest of their lives usually in this iron lung to breathe for them this disease was terrifying there was no cure and there was no vaccine the disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary National effort to find a way to stop it 20 years later they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine it was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s finally a vaccine that could stop this awful disease and here in the United States it had an incredible impact as you can see the virus stopped and it stopped very very fast but this wasn't the case everywhere in the world and it happen so fast in the United States however that even just last month John Stewart said this is polio still active because I was I I thought that that had been eradicated in the way that small pox had been eradicated oops John Poli has almost been eradicated but the reality is that polio still exists today we made this map for John to try and show him exactly where polio still exists this is the picture there's not very much left in the world but the reason there's not very much left is because there's been an extraordinary public private partnership working behind the scenes almost unknown I'm sure to most of you here today it's been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease and it's got it down to this few cases that you can see here on this graphic but just last year we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio and this is the reason in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade on opposite sides of the globe there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks hundreds of people were paralyzed hundreds of people died children as well as adults and in both cases we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries they had come from thousands of miles away and in one case it originated on another continent and not only that but when they came into these countries then they got on Commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even further other places like Russia where for the first time in over a decade last year children were crippled and Paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you these are under control now and it looks like they uh they'll probably stop very very quickly but the message was very clear polio is still a devastating explosive disease it's just happening in another part of the world and our big idea is that the scientific Miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis so I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership the polio partnership is trying to do we're not trying to control polio we're not trying to get it down to just a few cases because this disease is like a root fire it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely so what we're looking for is a permanent solution we want a world in which every child just like you guys can take for granted a polio free world so we're looking for a permanent solution and this is where we get lucky this is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try and do something truly extraordinary this virus can only survive in people it can't live for a very long time in people it doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all and we've got pretty good vaccines as I just showed you so we are trying to wipe out this virus completely what the poo eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on earth now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this to eradicating diseases it's been tried six times in the last century and it's been successful exactly once and this is because disease eradication is still the venture capital of Public Health the risks are massive but the payoff economic humanitarian motivational it's absolutely huge one Congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the US put into small poox eradication pays itself off every 26 days in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs and if we can finish polio eradication the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone so those are the kind of stakes that we're after but small poox eradication was hard it was very very hard and polio eradication in many ways is even tougher and there's a few reasons for that the first is that when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with small pox and there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries so it was a massive effort the Second Challenge we had was in contrast to the small poox vaccine which was very stable and a single dose protected you for life the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile AG it deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put the special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child it's not potent it's not going to protect them even then kids need many doses of the vaccine but the third challenge we have and probably even bigger one the biggest challenge is that in contrast to small pox where you could always see your enemy every single person almost who is infected with small poox had this Telltale rash so you could get around the disease you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off polio it's almost completely different the vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease so you can't see the enemy most of the time and as a result we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with small poox we've had to create one of the largest social move movements in history there's over 10 million people probably 20 million people largely volunteers who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now uh been called the largest internationally coordinated operation in peacetime these people these 20 million people vaccinate over 500 million children every single year multiple times at the peak of our operations now giving the polio vaccine is simple just two drops like that but reaching 500 million people is much much tougher and these vaccinators these volunteers they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest densest Urban slums in the world they've got to track under sweltering Suns to some of the most remote difficult to reach places in the world and they also have to dodge bullets because we have got to operate during shaky ceasefires and trues to try and vaccinate children even in areas affected by conflict one reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about 5 years ago a place which has eradicated polio not once but twice because they got reinfected he was sitting on the side of the road watching one of these polio campaigns unfold and a few months later he wrote this is foreign aid at its most heroic and these Heroes they come from every Walk of Life all sorts of backgrounds but one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International this is a group whose million strong Army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years the right at the center of the whole thing now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication more than 15 years much longer than it should have but once it was built the results Were Striking within a couple of years every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses with the exception of four countries that you see here and it was in each of those was only part of the country and then by 1999 one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide proof of concept and then today there's been a 99% reduction greater than 99% reduction in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease when we started over 20 years ago 1,000 children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus last year it was 1,000 and at the same time the polio eradication program has been working to help in a lot of other areas it's been working to help control pandemic flu SARS for example it's also been trying to save children by doing other things giving vitamin A drops giving measel shots giving uh bed Nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us the International Community to reach every single child every single Community the most vulnerable people in the world with the most basic of Health Services irrespective of geography poverty culture and even conflict so things were looking very exciting and then about 5 years ago this virus this ancient virus started to fight back the first problem we ran into was that in these last four countries the strongholds of this virus we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out and then to make the matters even worse the virus started to spread out of these four places especially Northern India and Northern Nigeria into much of Africa Asia and even into Europe causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades and then in one of the most important tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have in conditions like this the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to now at that time there was a great as you can imagine frustration let's call it frustration it started to grow very very quickly and all of a sudden some very important voices in the world of Public Health started to say say hang on we should abandon this idea of eradication let's settle for control that's good enough now as seductive as the idea of control sounds it's a false premise the brutal truth is if we don't have the will or the skill or even the money that we need to reach children the most vulnerable children in the world with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine then pretty soon more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year there's absolutely no question these are children like Umar Umar is seven years old and he's from northern Nigeria he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters Umar also has polio Umar was paralyzed for Life his right leg was paralyzed in 2004 this leg his right leg now takes an awful beating because he has to half crawl because it's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends keep up with his brothers and sisters than to get up on his crutches and walk but um is a fantastic student he's an incredible kid as uh you you probably can't see the detail here but this is his report card and you'll see he's get perfect scores he got 100% in all the important things um like nursery rhymes for example there but um you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with with polio these days but it's not true Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances the reality of polio today is something very different polio strikes the poorest communities in the world it leaves their children paralyzed and it drags their families deeper into poverty because they're desperately searching and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have trying in vain to find a cure for their children we think children deserve better and so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago when people were saying that we should call it off the polio partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find Innovative new Solutions new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again in Northern India we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this so that we could guide our investments in vaccinator shelters so we could get to the millions of children on the coy River Basin where there were no other health services in Northern Nigeria the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and Community confidence and now they've even started using these devices speaking of cool technology these little devices little GIS trackers like this which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccin and then they can track them and at the end of the day they look and see did these guys get to every single Street every single house this is the kind of commitment now we're seeing to try and reach all of the children we'd been missing and in Afghanistan we're trying new approaches access negotiators working closely with the international Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child but as we tried these extraordinary things as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics we went back to the vaccine it's a 50-year-old vaccine and we thought surely we can make a better vaccine so that when they finally get to these kids we can have a better bang for our buck and this started an incredible collaboration with industry and within six months we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted just two years ago the last two types of polio in the world and on June the 9th 200 2009 we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine and it turned out to be a GameChanger danger the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had and we immediately started using this well in a couple of months we had to get it out of production and it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world and we didn't start with the easy places the first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from new technologies like this now here at T over the last couple of days I've I've seen people um challenging the audience again and again to uh to to believe in the impossible so um this morning at about 7 o'clock we decided that we try and drive Chris and the production crew here at berserk by um downloading all of our data from India again so that you could see something that's just unfolding today which proves that The Impossible Is Possible and only two years ago people were saying that this is imposs possible now remember Northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio utar Pradesh and bear 500,000 children every single month sanitation is terrible and our old vaccine you remember worked half as well as it should have and yet The Impossible is happening today marks exactly 6 months and for the first time in history not a single child has been paralyzed in utar Pradesh or Bear India is not unique in umar's home country of Nigeria a 95% reduction in the number of children Paralyzed by polio last year and in the last 6 months we've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history ladies and gentlemen with a combination of smart people smart technology and smart Investments polio can now be eradicated anywhere we have major challenges you can imagine to finish this job but as you've also seen it's doable it has great secondary benefits and polio eradication is a great buy and as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus it's a stark reminder that we are failing as a society to reach children with the most basic of services and for that reason polio eradication it's the ultimate in equity and it's the ultimate in social justice the huge social movement that's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children it's ready to reach them with bed nets with other things but capitalizing on their enthusiasm capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago finishing polio is a smart thing to do and it's the right thing to do now we're in tough times economically but as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio there's never a wrong time to do the right thing finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do and we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last 20 years we have a new vaccine we have new resolve and we have new tactics we have the chance to write an entirely new polio free chapter in human history but if we blink now we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease here's a great idea to spread and polio now help us tell the story help us build the momentum so that very soon every child every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio free life forever thank you well Bruce where do you think the toughest places are going to be where would you say we need to be the smartest the four places where where you saw that we've never stopped Northern Nigeria Northern India Southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan they're going to be the uh the toughest but the interesting thing is of those three India is looking real good as you just saw in the data and Afghanistan Afghanistan we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly it keeps getting reinfected so the tough ones are going to get top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished they're going to be the tough ones and what about the money give us a sense of of how much the campaign costs a year and is it easy uh to raise that money and what what's going to be like the next couple of years it's interesting we spend right now about $750 million to $800 million a year that's what it costs to reach 500 million children it sounds like a lot of money it is a lot of money but when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times 20 30 cents to reach a child that's not very much money but right now we don't have enough of that we have a big gap in that money we're cutting corners and every time we cut Corners more places get infected that shouldn't have and just slows us down and that great buy costs us a little bit more well hopefully we'll uh get the word out and the the governments will keep their generosity up so uh good luck we're all in this with you thank you thank [Applause] you

the most important tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have in conditions like this the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to now at that time there was a great as you can imagine frustration let's call it frustration it started to grow very very quickly and all of a sudden some very important voices in the world of Public Health started to say say hang on we should abandon this idea of eradication let's settle for control that's good enough now as seductive as the idea of control sounds it's a false premise the brutal truth is if we don't have the will or the skill or even the money that we need to reach children the most vulnerable children in the world with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine then pretty soon more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year there's absolutely no question these are children like Umar Umar is seven years old and he's from northern Nigeria he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters Umar also has polio Umar was paralyzed for Life his right leg was paralyzed in 2004 this leg his right leg now takes an awful beating because he has to half crawl because it's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends keep up with his brothers and sisters than to get up on his crutches and walk but um is a fantastic student he's an incredible kid as uh you you probably can't see the detail here but this is his report card and you'll see he's get perfect scores he got 100% in all the important things um like nursery rhymes for example there but um you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with with polio these days but it's not true Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances the reality of polio today is something very different polio strikes the poorest communities in the world it leaves their children paralyzed and it drags their families deeper into poverty because they're desperately searching and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have trying in vain to find a cure for their children we think children deserve better and so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago when people were saying that we should call it off the polio partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find Innovative new Solutions new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again in Northern India we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this so that we could guide our investments in vaccinator shelters so we could get to the millions of children on the coy River Basin where there were no other health services in Northern Nigeria the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and Community confidence and now they've even started using these devices speaking of cool technology these little devices little GIS trackers like this which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccin and then they can track them and at the end of the day they look and see did these guys get to every single Street every single house this is the kind of commitment now we're seeing to try and reach all of the children we'd been missing and in Afghanistan we're trying new approaches access negotiators working closely with the international Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child but as we tried these extraordinary things as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics we went back to the vaccine it's a 50-year-old vaccine and we thought surely we can make a better vaccine so that when they finally get to these kids we can have a better bang for our buck and this started an incredible collaboration with industry and within six months we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted just two years ago the last two types of polio in the world and on June the 9th 200 2009 we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine and it turned out to be a GameChanger danger the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had and we immediately started using this well in a couple of months we had to get it out of production and it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world and we didn't start with the easy places the first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from new technologies like this now here at T over the last couple of days I've I've seen people um challenging the audience again and again to uh to to believe in the impossible so um this morning at about 7 o'clock we decided that we try and drive Chris and the production crew here at berserk by um downloading all of our data from India again so that you could see something that's just unfolding today which proves that The Impossible Is Possible and only two years ago people were saying that this is imposs possible now remember Northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio utar Pradesh and bear 500,000 children every single month sanitation is terrible and our old vaccine you remember worked half as well as it should have and yet The Impossible is happening today marks exactly 6 months and for the first time in history not a single child has been paralyzed in utar Pradesh or Bear India is not unique in umar's home country of Nigeria a 95% reduction in the number of children Paralyzed by polio last year and in the last 6 months we've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history ladies and gentlemen with a combination of smart people smart technology and smart Investments polio can now be eradicated anywhere we have major challenges you can imagine to finish this job but as you've also seen it's doable it has great secondary benefits and polio eradication is a great buy and as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus it's a stark reminder that we are failing as a society to reach children with the most basic of services and for that reason polio eradication it's the ultimate in equity and it's the ultimate in social justice the huge social movement that's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children it's ready to reach them with bed nets with other things but capitalizing on their enthusiasm capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago finishing polio is a smart thing to do and it's the right thing to do now we're in tough times economically but as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio there's never a wrong time to do the right thing finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do and we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last 20 years we have a new vaccine we have new resolve and we have new tactics we have the chance to write an entirely new polio free chapter in human history but if we blink now we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease here's a great idea to spread and polio now help us tell the story help us build the momentum so that very soon every child every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio free life forever thank you well Bruce where do you think the toughest places are going to be where would you say we need to be the smartest the four places where where you saw that we've never stopped Northern Nigeria Northern India Southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan they're going to be the uh the toughest but the interesting thing is of those three India is looking real good as you just saw in the data and Afghanistan Afghanistan we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly it keeps getting reinfected so the tough ones are going to get top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished they're going to be the tough ones and what about the money give us a sense of of how much the campaign costs a year and is it easy uh to raise that money and what what's going to be like the next couple of years it's interesting we spend right now about $750 million to $800 million a year that's what it costs to reach 500 million children it sounds like a lot of money it is a lot of money but when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times 20 30 cents to reach a child that's not very much money but right now we don't have enough of that we have a big gap in that money we're cutting corners and every time we cut Corners more places get infected that shouldn't have and just slows us down and that great buy costs us a little bit more well hopefully we'll uh get the word out and the the governments will keep their generosity up so uh good luck we're all in this with you thank you thank [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
Hi, everybody! I am a comparative anatomist. A comparative anatomist is someone
who studies the structure of the body of lots of different animals. And my favorite animals are whales. I like to study whales
because they're so interesting. They've adapted to a unique environment
of living in the water. And what I'm going to tell you
about is how whales make sounds by basically farting with their face. You know that they do this farting thing
with their blowhole; they blow out air like that, but they also use air
in lots of other ways. They use it for sound production,
which is what I'll focus on, but I also study other things
they do with air, like keep it out of their bloodstream
so they don't get bubbles, which is what happens
to human scuba divers when they get decompression sickness. But I'd like to start with the story of how these animals make
these farting noises, and that story begins with understanding
how hard it is to look at whales, because they live underwater
and they're really big, so they're hard animals to study. And in this picture --
you see that animal in the middle? That's a baby whale
and it's already the size of a bus! When you look at whales,
start with the top of their head because their nose
is on the top of their head, kind of like a built-in snorkel. They breathe through that
because they're mammals and mammals breathe air. Their nose can be opened and closed, as if you were to pinch it like this. You can see it's open in the bottom frame,
where the red arrows are. But not all whales have two nostrils. Whales include the groups
of dolphins and porpoises, and dolphins and porpoises,
the small whales, have only one nostril
on the top of their head, and they open and close that nostril by taking what is essentially
an upper lip, like this, and turning it back
over their nose, like this. That's how they open and close their nose. So when they make sounds, what they're basically
doing is a raspberry, (Makes raspberry sound)
which is kind of like a fart, right? Or up in New York,
we call it a Bronx cheer. And the way they do that is by taking that big,
fatty structure of a big fat lip, which, as you can see
here in this picture, which is a cut through the middle
of a dolphin's head, that big fat lip is that big
yellow portion there, and they roll it back and forth
over the top of their nose so that they vibrate it, kind of like when you let
the air out of a balloon and it makes that weird vibration sound. So this is what it sounds like
when they make their noise: (Vibration noise) Hear it? He'll do it again
when he faces the camera. (Vibration noise) Sounds like it's farting underwater. What that dolphin is actually doing,
though, is echolocation, which is making these series of pulses, and it uses it like a bat uses sonar. Well, a bat uses radar,
but when it's underwater it's sonar, so this animal is using sonar
to see its world in sound. Trying to understand how this works,
you have to look at it as if you were looking at the amplifier
speakers of a sound system. The small-toothed whales
are basically the "tweeters," and the sound is coming
from that little nose that's moving back and forth
and coming out of their forehead. But the big whales
are kind of like the "woofers," the big speakers that you have
in an amplifier system. And what's happening is their sound
is coming out of the throat. So if you tried to make
sound like a whale -- make a sound right now, and go, "ahhhhhh." OK, now put your hand on your throat,
on your Adam's apple. You feel that vibration right there? That is lost energy for you, because that's not
how you communicate to everybody. You do it out of the mouth. But if you open your mouth underwater,
no one will hear you. You have to be able to take this energy
and amplify it through the water. That's what whales do. And when you hear their sound -- (Squeaking sound) it's kind of like when you squeak
the air out of a balloon. So they get a lot of squeaky noises, but they also have this sound: (Vibrating sound) It sounds like it's farting, doesn't it? It's like it's got this giant
whoopee cushion in its throat. So, how do you know
that's what a whale is doing? Well, we study whales that come
to us from strandings. These are animals that die on the beach. Small whales like dolphins
and porpoises are easy; we can take them to the lab. But the big whales -- we've got
to bring the lab to the whale. And this is what that looks like. I'm the one in the middle
with the red hat. I'm not a very tall person, so you can see how big
this whale was compared to me. The whale is 65 feet long. And my scalpel is this little tool
on the side here. It basically looks like a hockey stick
with a blade on the end of it. And doing a dissection of a whale
is a very difficult process. You literally have to get into your work. It's kind of like a giant
bloody construction zone. You're wearing a hard hat, you're working with heavy machinery. In this case, by the way, that's just the voice box of a blue whale. Just the voice box. I'm only five feet tall --
you can see it's like 12 feet long. How do we know what's going on? Well, we look at the voice box, or larynx, and we see -- this is from a baby
whale so it's much smaller. You see this little u-shaped thing
I've outlined in blue. That's the part that's vibrating. It's kind of like our vocal folds. When I put my hand in there,
where that blue sleeve is, you can see there's a sack underneath it. That's the whoopee cushion. That's the air bubble or the balloon. So what these animals are doing -- and you can see, there's this big
black balloon in the throat, where the digestive tract,
which is in blue, meets the breathing tract,
which is in light blue, and right in the middle
is that black sack. These animals are using
that sack to make these sounds. And so they vibrate that and send it out. Small-toothed whales also have air sacks;
they're all over their heads, so it's like they're airheads. They use this to capture
as much air as they can to take down with them
when they're diving, because when you dive, pressures increase, and that decreases the volume
of air you have available. But more importantly, having that sack allows them
to recycle the air that they're using, because air is a precious commodity. You don't want to have to go
back up to the surface to get more. So when you make a sound underwater,
if you're a whale -- let's hear you start making
a sound, go "ahhhh." But whales keep their mouths
closed, so go "ahhhmm." (Audience makes noise) You're all humming, right? But whales keep their nose
closed and go, "mmmm." (Makes noise) What happened? You can't make the sound anymore
once you close your nose because you've pressurized the system. Whales, by having air sacks, keep
themselves from pressurizing the system, which means the air continues to flow, and so if you had a bag
on the end of your nose, you'd be able to make
air continue to flow. So I hope you've enjoyed that. That's what a comparative anatomist
does for a living. We study the structure of these animals. We try to mimic it; we apply it
back to the human situation, maybe making new technologies
for protective devices or maybe even making
new treatments for medicines for people's diseases who mimic
these weird environments. So I hope you enjoyed that. Thank you. (Applause)

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: How do dolphins and porpoises open and close their nose? Options: A. By moving their upper lip back and forth., B. By pinching it like a human nose., C. By blowing air through it., D. By using their mouth. Correct Option: A.

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it deals with the same topic of how dolphins (toothed whales) produce sound. The ground truth MCQ asks about the specific fatty structure used for echolocation, while the generated MCQ asks about the mechanism of opening and closing the nose, which is related to the same fatty structure (the upper lip). 

However, there is an even more similar question that could be generated based on the content, which would ask about the specific structure used for echolocation, as in the ground truth MCQ.

Since the provided generated MCQs do not have an exact match for the ground truth MCQ, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of topic and content, I will provide its index.

**Transcript**:
Hi, everybody! I am a comparative anatomist. A comparative anatomist is someone
who studies the structure of the body of lots of different animals. And my favorite animals are whales. I like to study whales
because they're so interesting. They've adapted to a unique environment
of living in the water. And what I'm going to tell you
about is how whales make sounds by basically farting with their face. You know that they do this farting thing
with their blowhole; they blow out air like that, but they also use air
in lots of other ways. They use it for sound production,
which is what I'll focus on, but I also study other things
they do with air, like keep it out of their bloodstream
so they don't get bubbles, which is what happens
to human scuba divers when they get decompression sickness. But I'd like to start with the story of how these animals make
these farting noises, and that story begins with understanding
how hard it is to look at whales, because they live underwater
and they're really big, so they're hard animals to study. And in this picture --
you see that animal in the middle? That's a baby whale
and it's already the size of a bus! When you look at whales,
start with the top of their head because their nose
is on the top of their head, kind of like a built-in snorkel. They breathe through that
because they're mammals and mammals breathe air. Their nose can be opened and closed, as if you were to pinch it like this. You can see it's open in the bottom frame,
where the red arrows are. But not all whales have two nostrils. Whales include the groups
of dolphins and porpoises, and dolphins and porpoises,
the small whales, have only one nostril
on the top of their head, and they open and close that nostril by taking what is essentially
an upper lip, like this, and turning it back
over their nose, like this. That's how they open and close their nose. So when they make sounds, what they're basically
doing is a raspberry, (Makes raspberry sound)
which is kind of like a fart, right? Or up in New York,
we call it a Bronx cheer. And the way they do that is by taking that big,
fatty structure of a big fat lip, which, as you can see
here in this picture, which is a cut through the middle
of a dolphin's head, that big fat lip is that big
yellow portion there, and they roll it back and forth
over the top of their nose so that they vibrate it, kind of like when you let
the air out of a balloon and it makes that weird vibration sound. So this is what it sounds like
when they make their noise: (Vibration noise) Hear it? He'll do it again
when he faces the camera. (Vibration noise) Sounds like it's farting underwater. What that dolphin is actually doing,
though, is echolocation, which is making these series of pulses, and it uses it like a bat uses sonar. Well, a bat uses radar,
but when it's underwater it's sonar, so this animal is using sonar
to see its world in sound. Trying to understand how this works,
you have to look at it as if you were looking at the amplifier
speakers of a sound system. The small-toothed whales
are basically the "tweeters," and the sound is coming
from that little nose that's moving back and forth
and coming out of their forehead. But the big whales
are kind of like the "woofers," the big speakers that you have
in an amplifier system. And what's happening is their sound
is coming out of the throat. So if you tried to make
sound like a whale -- make a sound right now, and go, "ahhhhhh." OK, now put your hand on your throat,
on your Adam's apple. You feel that vibration right there? That is lost energy for you, because that's not
how you communicate to everybody. You do it out of the mouth. But if you open your mouth underwater,
no one will hear you. You have to be able to take this energy
and amplify it through the water. That's what whales do. And when you hear their sound -- (Squeaking sound) it's kind of like when you squeak
the air out of a balloon. So they get a lot of squeaky noises, but they also have this sound: (Vibrating sound) It sounds like it's farting, doesn't it? It's like it's got this giant
whoopee cushion in its throat. So, how do you know
that's what a whale is doing? Well, we study whales that come
to us from strandings. These are animals that die on the beach. Small whales like dolphins
and porpoises are easy; we can take them to the lab. But the big whales -- we've got
to bring the lab to the whale. And this is what that looks like. I'm the one in the middle
with the red hat. I'm not a very tall person, so you can see how big
this whale was compared to me. The whale is 65 feet long. And my scalpel is this little tool
on the side here. It basically looks like a hockey stick
with a blade on the end of it. And doing a dissection of a whale
is a very difficult process. You literally have to get into your work. It's kind of like a giant
bloody construction zone. You're wearing a hard hat, you're working with heavy machinery. In this case, by the way, that's just the voice box of a blue whale. Just the voice box. I'm only five feet tall --
you can see it's like 12 feet long. How do we know what's going on? Well, we look at the voice box, or larynx, and we see -- this is from a baby
whale so it's much smaller. You see this little u-shaped thing
I've outlined in blue. That's the part that's vibrating. It's kind of like our vocal folds. When I put my hand in there,
where that blue sleeve is, you can see there's a sack underneath it. That's the whoopee cushion. That's the air bubble or the balloon. So what these animals are doing -- and you can see, there's this big
black balloon in the throat, where the digestive tract,
which is in blue, meets the breathing tract,
which is in light blue, and right in the middle
is that black sack. These animals are using
that sack to make these sounds. And so they vibrate that and send it out. Small-toothed whales also have air sacks;
they're all over their heads, so it's like they're airheads. They use this to capture
as much air as they can to take down with them
when they're diving, because when you dive, pressures increase, and that decreases the volume
of air you have available. But more importantly, having that sack allows them
to recycle the air that they're using, because air is a precious commodity. You don't want to have to go
back up to the surface to get more. So when you make a sound underwater,
if you're a whale -- let's hear you start making
a sound, go "ahhhh." But whales keep their mouths
closed, so go "ahhhmm." (Audience makes noise) You're all humming, right? But whales keep their nose
closed and go, "mmmm." (Makes noise) What happened? You can't make the sound anymore
once you close your nose because you've pressurized the system. Whales, by having air sacks, keep
themselves from pressurizing the system, which means the air continues to flow, and so if you had a bag
on the end of your nose, you'd be able to make
air continue to flow. So I hope you've enjoyed that. That's what a comparative anatomist
does for a living. We study the structure of these animals. We try to mimic it; we apply it
back to the human situation, maybe making new technologies
for protective devices or maybe even making
new treatments for medicines for people's diseases who mimic
these weird environments. So I hope you enjoyed that. Thank you. (Applause)

with the red hat. I'm not a very tall person, so you can see how big
this whale was compared to me. The whale is 65 feet long. And my scalpel is this little tool
on the side here. It basically looks like a hockey stick
with a blade on the end of it. And doing a dissection of a whale
is a very difficult process. You literally have to get into your work. It's kind of like a giant
bloody construction zone. You're wearing a hard hat, you're working with heavy machinery. In this case, by the way, that's just the voice box of a blue whale. Just the voice box. I'm only five feet tall --
you can see it's like 12 feet long. How do we know what's going on? Well, we look at the voice box, or larynx, and we see -- this is from a baby
whale so it's much smaller. You see this little u-shaped thing
I've outlined in blue. That's the part that's vibrating. It's kind of like our vocal folds. When I put my hand in there,
where that blue sleeve is, you can see there's a sack underneath it. That's the whoopee cushion. That's the air bubble or the balloon. So what these animals are doing -- and you can see, there's this big
black balloon in the throat, where the digestive tract,
which is in blue, meets the breathing tract,
which is in light blue, and right in the middle
is that black sack. These animals are using
that sack to make these sounds. And so they vibrate that and send it out. Small-toothed whales also have air sacks;
they're all over their heads, so it's like they're airheads. They use this to capture
as much air as they can to take down with them
when they're diving, because when you dive, pressures increase, and that decreases the volume
of air you have available. But more importantly, having that sack allows them
to recycle the air that they're using, because air is a precious commodity. You don't want to have to go
back up to the surface to get more. So when you make a sound underwater,
if you're a whale -- let's hear you start making
a sound, go "ahhhh." But whales keep their mouths
closed, so go "ahhhmm." (Audience makes noise) You're all humming, right? But whales keep their nose
closed and go, "mmmm." (Makes noise) What happened? You can't make the sound anymore
once you close your nose because you've pressurized the system. Whales, by having air sacks, keep
themselves from pressurizing the system, which means the air continues to flow, and so if you had a bag
on the end of your nose, you'd be able to make
air continue to flow. So I hope you've enjoyed that. That's what a comparative anatomist
does for a living. We study the structure of these animals. We try to mimic it; we apply it
back to the human situation, maybe making new technologies
for protective devices or maybe even making
new treatments for medicines for people's diseases who mimic
these weird environments. So I hope you enjoyed that. Thank you. (Applause)

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that Question 3: **Application** is the most similar.

Although Question 3 does not ask about the year the King Salmon began to disappear, it does relate to the information provided in the transcript about the King Salmon and subsistence fishing. 

However, if I had to choose a question that could potentially be modified to match the ground truth MCQ, I would say Question 1: **Knowledge** is the most similar in terms of question type and content.

But since none of the questions match the ground truth MCQ directly, I will not provide an index.

However, I can suggest a new question that could be added to the generated MCQs to match the ground truth MCQ:

Question 11: **Knowledge**: Since what year did the King Salmon begin to disappear?
Options: A. 1980, B. 1998, C. 2001, D. 2012

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 3: Application**: If you were a subsistence fisherman, how many kings could you take for personal use? Options: A. Five, B. Ten, C. Fifteen, D. Twenty Correct Option: B

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content. A more relevant question would be one that asks about the average weight of fish. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the average weight of fish.

But if we consider the context and intent of the ground truth MCQ, which is about the decline of the salmon population and its impact on the community, we can find a generated MCQ that is more relevant.

**Question 6: Evaluation**: What are the potential consequences of the decline of the salmon population? Options: A. The loss of a traditional food source., B. The decline of the fishing industry., C. The loss of a cultural practice., D. All of the above. Correct Option: D

However, this question still does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that is most relevant in terms of context and intent.

But, actually, **Question 3** has a sentence in the transcript that can give a correct answer for the ground truth MCQ: "Right now for subsistence, average person can take maybe ten kings and they're satisfied." is followed by "When I was young, average fish was like thirty pounds. [♪ music ♪] But now you're lucky if you get eighteen pounder, fifteen pound king." 

So the correct answer can be derived from a sentence that is related to **Question 3**.

**Transcript**:
Feldspar mineral...From the Ytterby Quarry.
How many elements does it contain? Shall we take it home? So terbium, just like europium, is often used
in television screens and various types of displays and where it comes
in is that it gives green and yellow colours, which in contrast to the red
and blue which europium gives you, gives you the full selection that
you need to give colour images. So Ytterby Gruva, Ytterby Mine, what a great
place, the snow is falling. This is designated Ytterby Mine, a historical
landmark for the discovery of four periodic elements: yttrium, terbium,
erbium, and ytterbium. Terbium was eventually discovered or eventually
isolated by the chemist Mosander in 1843. It was from an earth called
itrea which was originated in this quarry where we are right now in Ytterby
in Sweden. Terbium is a really unusual element. It’s a metal; moderate
abundance. It’s called a rare earth element, which is really quite
ironic because it’s not as rare as its name would suggest. The abundance is something
like 20 to 30 times that of silver, so I don’t think it’s
really rare. It doesn’t really have much biological activity but we do find terbium
within the bones in the human body and in animals but also within the kidneys
so you do find small concentrations but it doesn’t really have
a perceived biological activity. Terbium is also used in certain magnetic devices
and when you include it in certain alloys it forms magnetic devices
which increase or decrease in size depending on the strength or type of
magnetic field which they are placed into which has various technological
applications. So terbium alloys are really quite interesting because
they have what’s called magnetostrictive behaviour. So what that means
is that the size of the crystal or the size of the structure of the
alloy itself gets either larger or smaller when it’s exposed to a large or
strong magnetic field. So, there’s much research going into these terbium alloys
for small motors or small switches perhaps and also to use as strain
gauges and other types of really quite elaborate instruments. So these
may well provide us a lot of new research in the areas of nano-science
and nano-machines. Also, because of its fluorescence nature it’s
often used as a marker in biochemistry so if you want to stain cells
and determine whether certain types are present then you can use it for
that too. So in terms of day-to-day life, where do we
find terbium? Well we find it in unusual devices like energy-saving light-bulbs
because it stimulates or it increases the yield of light in the mercury
discharge that we use to run fluorescent strips. So we found it around
us in shops and houses, in factories, street-lighting, everywhere. But
what I think is a really quite nice and important application of terbium
is the fact that it’s used to make phosphorescent materials. So these are
materials which generate light or allow us to develop pictures if we
irradiate them with something like an x-ray. And, in fact, terbium is used
to make very, very high light yielding phosphors for use in screens and
visualisation screens for x- rays. So what this means is that if I go into
the hospital for diagnostic x- ray I no longer have to be exposed to long
periods of x-rays because the terbium screen allows the generation of
the pictures at much, much lower dose of x-ray. So it’s really quite
a significant advance. It’s really quite nice chemistry as well.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

place, the snow is falling. This is designated Ytterby Mine, a historical
landmark for the discovery of four periodic elements: yttrium, terbium,
erbium, and ytterbium. Terbium was eventually discovered or eventually
isolated by the chemist Mosander in 1843. It was from an earth called
itrea which was originated in this quarry where we are right now in Ytterby
in Sweden. Terbium is a really unusual element. It’s a metal; moderate
abundance. It’s called a rare earth element, which is really quite
ironic because it’s not as rare as its name would suggest. The abundance is something
like 20 to 30 times that of silver, so I don’t think it’s
really rare. It doesn’t really have much biological activity but we do find terbium
within the bones in the human body and in animals but also within the kidneys
so you do find small concentrations but it doesn’t really have
a perceived biological activity. Terbium is also used in certain magnetic devices
and when you include it in certain alloys it forms magnetic devices
which increase or decrease in size depending on the strength or type of
magnetic field which they are placed into which has various technological
applications. So terbium alloys are really quite interesting because
they have what’s called magnetostrictive behaviour. So what that means
is that the size of the crystal or the size of the structure of the
alloy itself gets either larger or smaller when it’s exposed to a large or
strong magnetic field. So, there’s much research going into these terbium alloys
for small motors or small switches perhaps and also to use as strain
gauges and other types of really quite elaborate instruments. So these
may well provide us a lot of new research in the areas of nano-science
and nano-machines. Also, because of its fluorescence nature it’s
often used as a marker in biochemistry so if you want to stain cells
and determine whether certain types are present then you can use it for
that too. So in terms of day-to-day life, where do we
find terbium? Well we find it in unusual devices like energy-saving light-bulbs
because it stimulates or it increases the yield of light in the mercury
discharge that we use to run fluorescent strips. So we found it around
us in shops and houses, in factories, street-lighting, everywhere. But
what I think is a really quite nice and important application of terbium
is the fact that it’s used to make phosphorescent materials. So these are
materials which generate light or allow us to develop pictures if we
irradiate them with something like an x-ray. And, in fact, terbium is used
to make very, very high light yielding phosphors for use in screens and
visualisation screens for x- rays. So what this means is that if I go into
the hospital for diagnostic x- ray I no longer have to be exposed to long
periods of x-rays because the terbium screen allows the generation of
the pictures at much, much lower dose of x-ray. So it’s really quite
a significant advance. It’s really quite nice chemistry as well.

strontium is unique in the periodic table because it's the only element that is named after somewhere in the United Kingdom there are lots of elements that have been discovered in the UK more than 10 it's not an obvious name like gallium of the France or germanium after Germany this one is named after a small village in Scotland called strontium I've never been there I hope we might make a field trip there sometime so here I am in strontium now you can see I'm on my own I'm not with the professor or anyone else but I have managed to find the address of a local history expert so I'm going to go and pay him a visit you know I've come to the right place because look over there as a rainbow in this village the first strontium salts were discovered at least the first ones where the element was identified so I have a sample of strontium metal so it's kind of granules as they're very big granules its large granules of strontium metal it's kind of in the middle of the group 2 metals it's relatively soft and so what we're going to try and do is file some strontium metal off of the granules I've never seen the element I've never seen any strontium and because of my particular age I when I grew up in the 1950s and 1960s when atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons took part place widely across the world strontium has always had a certain sinister feeling to it because when nuclear explosions take place when the uranium atom splits some of the fragments are strontium and they're not only strontium but they're a radioactive form of strontium known as strontium 90 there it goes the fourth atomic bomb has been successfully detonated this radioactive material because strontium is in the same group as calcium when it is floating around in the air could be absorbed by people and that incorporated into their bones or their teeth in place of calcium which you normally find in bone and tooth enamel people like me a radioactive doesn't explain my hair but on the other hand it was quite a serious problem so we need to take some strontium ions and in this case I've got a small amount of strontium nitrate okay now I'm going to take a small amount and put it into a test tube so that I can mix it with some of our combustion mixture Wow what a fantastic reaction really really energetic lots of energy given out lots of hot steam lots of hot co2 and importantly a lovely lovely red color from the strontium emission fantastic technically operationally and militarily Redwing may be summarized in one word success it's a radioactive element when radioactive elements decay they can damage the cells in the body that are close by if it's in the air or something like that the particles don't go far enough to cause any damage but if they're incorporated in your body there are cells very close by and these can cause mutation which eventually could cause cancer most important and the safety program was the ability to predict and hence predetermined radioactive fallout when atmospheric testing stopped the amount of strontium 90 that was distributed across the world decreased rapidly there's a bit of stron tonight we got this from the main entrant in well because albeit you can get strontium a all over the world but this is unique because this comes from strength Ian strontium is you know is useful as well it's you can make them very reactive compounds with strontium that's what people like me are interested in doing and seeing how they react and they might be as useful as their magnesium counterparts which are actually very useful in synthetic chemistry strontium itself is an element which I think may become more important because as some of the other elements become harder to mine because the supplies are running out I believe that chemists are going to discover new reactions of strontium in catalysts and things like that and will realize that it has much more value than we've thought up till now well we're going to go up to the mine and what we're going to do is well have a look at it what's left of it because unfortunately there's nine of all left now you can see straight ahead of you that a nurse garv there well that's part of an old wood that was used by the miners they were coming to -

**Transcript**:
strontium is unique in the periodic table because it's the only element that is named after somewhere in the United Kingdom there are lots of elements that have been discovered in the UK more than 10 it's not an obvious name like gallium of the France or germanium after Germany this one is named after a small village in Scotland called strontium I've never been there I hope we might make a field trip there sometime so here I am in strontium now you can see I'm on my own I'm not with the professor or anyone else but I have managed to find the address of a local history expert so I'm going to go and pay him a visit you know I've come to the right place because look over there as a rainbow in this village the first strontium salts were discovered at least the first ones where the element was identified so I have a sample of strontium metal so it's kind of granules as they're very big granules its large granules of strontium metal it's kind of in the middle of the group 2 metals it's relatively soft and so what we're going to try and do is file some strontium metal off of the granules I've never seen the element I've never seen any strontium and because of my particular age I when I grew up in the 1950s and 1960s when atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons took part place widely across the world strontium has always had a certain sinister feeling to it because when nuclear explosions take place when the uranium atom splits some of the fragments are strontium and they're not only strontium but they're a radioactive form of strontium known as strontium 90 there it goes the fourth atomic bomb has been successfully detonated this radioactive material because strontium is in the same group as calcium when it is floating around in the air could be absorbed by people and that incorporated into their bones or their teeth in place of calcium which you normally find in bone and tooth enamel people like me a radioactive doesn't explain my hair but on the other hand it was quite a serious problem so we need to take some strontium ions and in this case I've got a small amount of strontium nitrate okay now I'm going to take a small amount and put it into a test tube so that I can mix it with some of our combustion mixture Wow what a fantastic reaction really really energetic lots of energy given out lots of hot steam lots of hot co2 and importantly a lovely lovely red color from the strontium emission fantastic technically operationally and militarily Redwing may be summarized in one word success it's a radioactive element when radioactive elements decay they can damage the cells in the body that are close by if it's in the air or something like that the particles don't go far enough to cause any damage but if they're incorporated in your body there are cells very close by and these can cause mutation which eventually could cause cancer most important and the safety program was the ability to predict and hence predetermined radioactive fallout when atmospheric testing stopped the amount of strontium 90 that was distributed across the world decreased rapidly there's a bit of stron tonight we got this from the main entrant in well because albeit you can get strontium a all over the world but this is unique because this comes from strength Ian strontium is you know is useful as well it's you can make them very reactive compounds with strontium that's what people like me are interested in doing and seeing how they react and they might be as useful as their magnesium counterparts which are actually very useful in synthetic chemistry strontium itself is an element which I think may become more important because as some of the other elements become harder to mine because the supplies are running out I believe that chemists are going to discover new reactions of strontium in catalysts and things like that and will realize that it has much more value than we've thought up till now well we're going to go up to the mine and what we're going to do is well have a look at it what's left of it because unfortunately there's nine of all left now you can see straight ahead of you that a nurse garv there well that's part of an old wood that was used by the miners they were coming to - part of the late main I've trying to improve a educate people as to what happened in the area and like most people who collect historical data you become very very passionate about this sort of thing probably yeah I get so passionate that I'm probably a boring old fast or something you know so this is when the granules of strontium metal is kind of dark on the outside at the moment hopefully we can get rid of kind of that layer of tarnish by by foiling it is we have our strontium so you can see where we kind of sort of fighting off that tarnish become a very metallic luster it's quite pretty so this is it this is where the old LED mine was that they found a mineral that was a little bit strange and they called astron T and I T and then after more work they were able to extract from a new element and that of course became known as strontium and we have it now on the periodic table

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
So this is manganese metal. You know, very
often in chemistry we use manganese in the form of permanganate as an oxidizing agent
but this is manganese metal. Manganese is right in the middle of the row
of transition metals and it has 5 electrons, which can give it a really very rich chemistry. So here you can see it is a brand new sample
although the bottle looks very, very old, it is 100grams. So I am going to pour a small
amount of manganese out, so that we can have a closer look. One of the main uses of manganese at the moment
is as a catalyst for making the plastic which you find in plastic water bottles. You can
see my big display of water bottles up there. And manganese is a key catalyst in the reaction
between xylene, which is the raw material which you get from crude oil to make terephthalic
acid which is one of the components in this plastic. And the reason it is important is
that manganese can add and lose electrons which help in the reaction between xylene
and oxygen. There is some paper on the top. Manganese is also important in old batteries,
the older batteries that you used in torches, the sort that leaked, contained manganese
dioxide. So here we have the manganese and we are going
to pour a small amount out so that we can have a look at this element. And you can see
how the colour refracts off the top, really a quite lovely sample of the manganese metal
itself. So we are looking at manganese crystals growing from the surface because this material
would have been made from a high temperature, crystal growing-type process. So you can see
the manganese is growing and seeding new crystallites of the surface - seeding off in every direction.
It’s cool.

**Transcript**:
You might just want to sneak up so you don’t
sprinkle any dirt at the bottom of this place where we turned it over. Yeah ok. Look at that soil, it is all cake looking. Yeah it is. Where are we? Look up yonder. To the left Oh wow! Ok, let me get the soil before you start whacking
ok? Oh yeah. Salt blast covered. Here we can see evidence of the mining. Now
this mine closed, many years ago. The bottom is glass-covered Houston. Yeah, white glass. So if we look into the quarry in the normal
daylight in the absence of the snow it would look a bit like a lunar landscape. No the black stuff that is that stuff is crystal,
that is the crystal in rocks, Now I say that for one specific reason because
during the Apollo programme the astronauts  , they came back from the moon with bucket
loads and bucket loads of moon rock and dust. That part of it is. Very good. And upon analysis they were really, really
surprised to find that there were a number of elements including Yttrium which existed
at a much much higher abundance on the moon Which happens to be the deepest penetration
that bowler made. So we are in Ytterby in Sweden and it’s
a really nice day and we have come to the Ytterby Quarry, or Ytterby Groover, which
is actually the birthplace for 4 of the elements and really the one we are going to talk about
now is this one right here yttrium. It was first discovered in this quarry from a really
horrible black lump of mineral which people thought was coal. And over a period of 40
years from the late 1700s on, some scientists over in Arbo did a lot of work in refining
this material and they found a new earth or yttria. Ok this was yttrium and oxygen and
they couldn’t get the oxygen out by using traditional reductive methods, metal making
methods like burning with carbon and charcoal. So the yttria survived and it was known for
about 40 years before the German scientist Volla, decided to react the yttria with a
much more reactive element, potassium. The potassium wrestled and ripped out the oxygen
and he made yttrium metal for the first time. Yttrium its used in a whole range of different
things, it’s used in semi conductors, where there is yttrium, barium, copper oxides, the
1-2-3 complexes that we know of and it’s used for a whole range of applications. It’s
used in laser technologies to make very intense pulses of light, for technologies like CDs
and LEDs etc., etc., but a massive, massive area. Another activity of another use for yttrium
is actually in the use of yttrium oxisulphide which is used as an additive in glass it makes
glass really tough, like bullet proof glass it makes it very shock resistant and very
very resistant towards temperature changes, so it is a very useful additive in glasses
and glassy materials. Make sure you don’t fall over the rock So yttrium itself is a really quite nice lustrous
soft metal from group 3 of the periodic table, it burns really readily in an oxygen rich
atmosphere and reacts quite well with water in the atmosphere as well. So you have to
be very careful with yttrium because it oxidises and it is really quite easy to destroy. That’s Yttrium metal, just as turnings.
So we have to handle this under nitrogen because generally it will form an oxide layer and
then you would not be able to do any chemistry with it. Yttrium is an element which is not again particularly
widely studied in chemistry, much less so than its neighbour zirconium, and but again
it’s an area where chemists now are starting to focus rather more. If it is really finely divided then it might
burst into flames, in fact, all metals if they are finely divided they are quite likely
to spontaneously combust.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: In his excursion to Ytterby (Sweden), the land covered in snow, Pete visited a mine where yttrium was discovered, as well as 3 other elements. Which of these elements was not discovered in “the village of the four elements”?

**Transcript**:
So, I think all good
tornado talks need to start with an awesome tornado shot. And this is not that awesome tornado shot. That was the first tornado I ever saw,
it was really cool, really scary, and I'm showing it to you guys because that's why I got
into the field in the first place. So even though it's a bad photograph, it was really cool
to be out there the first time. But now I'm taking real tornado footage. Fast forward a few years. This is a few years ago,
during a field project called VORTEX2, where myself and a bunch
of other scientists were out there, surrounding tornadoes
with different types of instrumentation and trying to figure out
how tornadoes form. It's a big question
we're trying to answer. It sounds like a very basic one, but it's something
we're still trying to figure out. We're also still trying to figure out
what the winds are like near the surface. We know what the winds are like
above building level, but we really don't know
what they're like at the surface and how that relates
to what we're seeing above building level. Most tornadoes form from what we call
supercell thunderstorms. Supercell thunderstorms
are what you commonly think of as tornado-raising storms. They're big, rotating thunderstorms that happen a lot of times
in the midsection of the United States. But the problem is that even though
they're rotating up above, it doesn't mean they're rotating
at the surface. And when we look at these storms and at these pictures
and at the data we have, they all kind of look the same. And it's really problematic if we're trying to make
tornado forecasts or warnings, because we only want to warn
or forecast about the storms that are going to actually make a tornado. One of the big, critical distinguishing
features, we think, between these storms, is something about
the rear-flank downdraft. So these big rotating thunderstorms
have this downdraft that wraps around the rear edge of it, hence the "rear-flank" downdraft. But we think how warm that is,
how buoyant that air is, and then also how strong
the updraft it's wrapping into, makes a big difference on whether or not
it's going to make a tornado. There's a lot more that goes into it -- I'll tell you about that in a second. Once you actually get a tornado,
again, the problem that we have is getting measurements near the surface. It's really hard to get measurements
near the surface -- most people don't want
to drive into tornadoes. There are a few exceptions;
you might have seen them on TV shows. But most people don't want to do that. Even getting instrumentation in the path
of the tornado is pretty tricky, too. Because, again, you don't want
to be that close to a tornado because sometimes the winds
around the tornado are strong as well. So getting information,
that critical location, is key for us because,
again, we don't know if the winds that we're seeing
above ground level, way above building level, actually map to the surface, if they're stronger, weaker,
or about the same as what we're seeing above buildings. The way we get at answering
a lot of these questions -- and I'm an observationalist;
I love to get out in the field, and collect data on tornadoes -- we compile a lot of observations. I work with this group
who operates mobile radars, and they're exactly
what they say -- basically, a radar on the back of a big blue truck, and we drive up really close
to tornadoes to map out the winds. We map out the precipitation. We map out all these
different things that are going on in order to better understand
the processes in these storms. And that bottom there,
that's what a tornado looks like when you're looking at it
with a mobile radar, and really close. Also, what we do is a lot of modeling, so we do a lot of computer
models and simulations, because the atmosphere
is governed by the laws of physics. So we can model the laws of physics and see where the tornado might go, where the storm might go, how strong the winds are near the surface and not actually have
to go out in the field. But of course, we want to have
both observations and modeling to move forward with the science. So, I showed you that video earlier
that went real quick, too. This is what it looks like,
looking at it with a radar. So you saw it visually, but this is what I get really excited
about when I see now in the field, stuff that looks like this. The really exciting thing
about looking at stuff like this is that we caught this storm
from when it didn't make a tornado to when it made a tornado and intensified and when it dissipated. This is the one of the rare data sets
that we have out there that were able to study
the entire life cycle of a tornado. I talked about how we think
that rear-flank downdraft is important because it tilts, there's a lot
of spin in the atmosphere, but the problem with
all this spin in the atmosphere is it needs to be oriented vertically, because that's what tornadoes are doing, and it needs to orientated
vertically near the ground. So we think this rear-flank
downdraft just pulses. And these pulses in this
rear-flank downdraft, we think, are very important
for converging that rotation, but also getting that rotation
into the right place. Other things we've learned is that we have gotten
a bunch of fortuitous measurements in the path of the tornadoes
and very near the surface. And we found out that the winds near the surface
are actually pretty comparable to what we're seeing 30, 40 meters
above ground level. So there's not a big reduction
in what we're seeing above the surface to what we're seeing at house level. And that was a pretty
surprising finding for us, because we kind of assumed
that the winds decrease pretty substantially near the surface. I'm going to end with this real quick. And this is not my last
tornado I ever saw, but I really like this image, because this was taken with one of those
mobile radars I was talking about. This is a tornado, not a hurricane, and this is what it looks like
when you're really close to it. And I find this amazing, that we can actually take technology
this close to these types of storms and see these inner workings. And for those of you who look
at tornado images often, you can see there's a lot going on --
there's rain spiraling, and you can actually see the debris cloud
associated with this tornado. I look forward to the future
and future technologies and being able to learn
a lot more about these storms, as the world advances, as you guys contribute to the science and we're able to really learn
more about how tornadoes form. Thank you. (Applause)

what the winds are like near the surface. We know what the winds are like
above building level, but we really don't know
what they're like at the surface and how that relates
to what we're seeing above building level. Most tornadoes form from what we call
supercell thunderstorms. Supercell thunderstorms
are what you commonly think of as tornado-raising storms. They're big, rotating thunderstorms that happen a lot of times
in the midsection of the United States. But the problem is that even though
they're rotating up above, it doesn't mean they're rotating
at the surface. And when we look at these storms and at these pictures
and at the data we have, they all kind of look the same. And it's really problematic if we're trying to make
tornado forecasts or warnings, because we only want to warn
or forecast about the storms that are going to actually make a tornado. One of the big, critical distinguishing
features, we think, between these storms, is something about
the rear-flank downdraft. So these big rotating thunderstorms
have this downdraft that wraps around the rear edge of it, hence the "rear-flank" downdraft. But we think how warm that is,
how buoyant that air is, and then also how strong
the updraft it's wrapping into, makes a big difference on whether or not
it's going to make a tornado. There's a lot more that goes into it -- I'll tell you about that in a second. Once you actually get a tornado,
again, the problem that we have is getting measurements near the surface. It's really hard to get measurements
near the surface -- most people don't want
to drive into tornadoes. There are a few exceptions;
you might have seen them on TV shows. But most people don't want to do that. Even getting instrumentation in the path
of the tornado is pretty tricky, too. Because, again, you don't want
to be that close to a tornado because sometimes the winds
around the tornado are strong as well. So getting information,
that critical location, is key for us because,
again, we don't know if the winds that we're seeing
above ground level, way above building level, actually map to the surface, if they're stronger, weaker,
or about the same as what we're seeing above buildings. The way we get at answering
a lot of these questions -- and I'm an observationalist;
I love to get out in the field, and collect data on tornadoes -- we compile a lot of observations. I work with this group
who operates mobile radars, and they're exactly
what they say -- basically, a radar on the back of a big blue truck, and we drive up really close
to tornadoes to map out the winds. We map out the precipitation. We map out all these
different things that are going on in order to better understand
the processes in these storms. And that bottom there,
that's what a tornado looks like when you're looking at it
with a mobile radar, and really close. Also, what we do is a lot of modeling, so we do a lot of computer
models and simulations, because the atmosphere
is governed by the laws of physics. So we can model the laws of physics and see where the tornado might go, where the storm might go, how strong the winds are near the surface and not actually have
to go out in the field. But of course, we want to have
both observations and modeling to move forward with the science. So, I showed you that video earlier
that went real quick, too. This is what it looks like,
looking at it with a radar. So you saw it visually, but this is what I get really excited
about when I see now in the field, stuff that looks like this. The really exciting thing
about looking at stuff like this is that we caught this storm
from when it didn't make a tornado to when it made a tornado and intensified and when it dissipated. This is the one of the rare data sets
that we have out there that were able to study
the entire life cycle of a tornado. I talked about how we think
that rear-flank downdraft is important because it tilts, there's a lot
of spin in the atmosphere, but the problem with
all this spin in the atmosphere is it needs to be oriented vertically, because that's what tornadoes are doing, and it needs to orientated
vertically near the ground. So we think this rear-flank
downdraft just pulses. And these pulses in this
rear-flank downdraft, we think, are very important
for converging that rotation, but also getting that rotation
into the right place. Other things we've learned is that we have gotten
a bunch of fortuitous measurements in the path of the tornadoes
and very near the surface. And we found out that the winds near the surface
are actually pretty comparable to what we're seeing 30, 40 meters
above ground level. So there's not a big reduction
in what we're seeing above the surface to what we're seeing at house level. And that was a pretty
surprising finding for us, because we kind of assumed
that the winds decrease pretty substantially near the surface. I'm going to end with this real quick. And this is not my last
tornado I ever saw, but I really like this image, because this was taken with one of those
mobile radars I was talking about. This is a tornado, not a hurricane, and this is what it looks like
when you're really close to it. And I find this amazing, that we can actually take technology
this close to these types of storms and see these inner workings. And for those of you who look
at tornado images often, you can see there's a lot going on --
there's rain spiraling, and you can actually see the debris cloud
associated with this tornado. I look forward to the future
and future technologies and being able to learn
a lot more about these storms, as the world advances, as you guys contribute to the science and we're able to really learn
more about how tornadoes form. Thank you. (Applause)

So, I think all good
tornado talks need to start with an awesome tornado shot. And this is not that awesome tornado shot. That was the first tornado I ever saw,
it was really cool, really scary, and I'm showing it to you guys because that's why I got
into the field in the first place. So even though it's a bad photograph, it was really cool
to be out there the first time. But now I'm taking real tornado footage. Fast forward a few years. This is a few years ago,
during a field project called VORTEX2, where myself and a bunch
of other scientists were out there, surrounding tornadoes
with different types of instrumentation and trying to figure out
how tornadoes form. It's a big question
we're trying to answer. It sounds like a very basic one, but it's something

**Transcript**:
many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see a blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task until now hello my name is Dennis Hong and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired so before I talk about this car foot of line let me briefly tell you about another project I worked on called the DARPA urban challenge now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself you press Start and nobody touches anything and can reach his destination fully autonomously so in 2007 our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition so about that time the National Federation of the blind or NFB challenged the research community about who can do up a car that said blind person drive safely and independently we decided to give it a try because we thought hey how hard could it be we just have a already autonomous vehicle we just put a blind person in it and we're done right we could have been more wrong what nfe wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive so I had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch so to test this crazy idea we drove a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the Ofili and in the summer of 2009 we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and give them a chance to give it for a spin it was an absolutely amazing experience but the problem of this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment and a flat closed up parking lot even the lane is defined by red traffic cones so with this success we decide to take the next big step to develop a real car that can be driven on the real roads so how does it work well it's a rather complex system but let me try to explain that make it simplified so we have three steps we have perception computation and non-visual interfaces now obviously the driver cannot see so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver for that we use a inertial measurement unit so it measures acceleration angular acts operation like a human ear inner ear we fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car we also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road and we also used three laser rangefinders the laser scan the environment to detect obstacles car approaching from the front the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads and the obstacles around the vehicle so all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer and the computer can do two things one is first of all process this information to have an understanding of the environment these are the lanes of the road there's an obstacles and convey this information to the driver the system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car so we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle but the problem is this how do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate off so he can drive so for this we developed many different type of non visual user interface technologies so starting from a three dimensional pinging sound system of vibrating vests click wheel with voice commands a leg strip even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot but today we're going to talk about three of these non visual user interfaces now the first interface is called a drive grip so these are a pair of gloves that has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so it can convey instructions about how to steer at the direction and the intensity another device is called speed strip so this is a chair as a matter of fact actually a massage chair we got it out and we rearrange these arriving elements and different patterns and we actuate them to convey information about the speed and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal so over here you can see how the computer understands the environments and because you cannot see the vibration we actually put red LEDs on the drive grip so you can actually see what's happening this is the sensory data and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer so these two devices drive grip and speed strip are very effective but the problem is these are instructional cue devices so this is not really freedom right the computer tells you how to drive turn left turn right speed up stop we call this the backseat driver problem right so we're moving away from these instructional cue devices and now focusing more on the informational devices a good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called air picks so think of it as a monitor for the blind so it's a small tablet has many holes in it and compressed air comes out so it can actually draw images so even though you're blind put your hand over it you can see the lanes of the road on obstacles this actually can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperatures it's actually multi-dimensional user interface so here you can see in the left camera on the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and says that information to the air picks for this we're showing a simulator a blind person driving using the air picks the simulator was also very useful for training the mind drivers and also quickly testing different type of ideas for a different type of non visual user interfaces so basically that's how it works so just a month ago in January 29th we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public at the world-famous Daytona International Speedway during the Rolex 24 racing event we also had some surprises let's take a look their first box and now let's see if Mark avoid he does he passes it on the right there's boxes out the fourth boxes out and he's perfectly making this play to continue Mark's gonna give me a ride back to the hotel so since we start this project will be getting hundreds of letters emails phone calls from people from all around the world letters thanking us but sometimes they also get funny letters like this one now understand there where there's Braille on a drive of ATM machine but sometimes but sometimes I also do get you know I wouldn't call it hate mail but letters of really strong concerns dr. Hong are you insane try to put blight people on the road you must be out of your mind but this vehicle is a prototype vehicle and it's not gonna be on the road until it's proven safe as or safer than today's vehicle and I truly believe this can't be happen but still with the society would they accept such a radical idea how we're going to handle insurance how are you going to issue a driving license there's many of these kind of different hurdles besides technology challenges that we to address before these firms in reality of course the main goal of this projects to develop a car for the blind but potentially more important than this is the the tremendous value of the spin-up technology that can come from this project the sensors that use can see through the dark the fog and rain and together it is new a new type of interfaces we can use these technologies that apply to safer cars for sighted people or for the blind everyday home appliances in the educational setting in the office setting just imagine in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what's written and reusing these non-visual interfaces this is priceless so today the things I've showed you today is just the beginning thank you very much

so these two devices drive grip and speed strip are very effective but the problem is these are instructional cue devices so this is not really freedom right the computer tells you how to drive turn left turn right speed up stop we call this the backseat driver problem right so we're moving away from these instructional cue devices and now focusing more on the informational devices a good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called air picks so think of it as a monitor for the blind so it's a small tablet has many holes in it and compressed air comes out so it can actually draw images so even though you're blind put your hand over it you can see the lanes of the road on obstacles this actually can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperatures it's actually multi-dimensional user interface so here you can see in the left camera on the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and says that information to the air picks for this we're showing a simulator a blind person driving using the air picks the simulator was also very useful for training the mind drivers and also quickly testing different type of ideas for a different type of non visual user interfaces so basically that's how it works so just a month ago in January 29th we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public at the world-famous Daytona International Speedway during the Rolex 24 racing event we also had some surprises let's take a look their first box and now let's see if Mark avoid he does he passes it on the right there's boxes out the fourth boxes out and he's perfectly making this play to continue Mark's gonna give me a ride back to the hotel so since we start this project will be getting hundreds of letters emails phone calls from people from all around the world letters thanking us but sometimes they also get funny letters like this one now understand there where there's Braille on a drive of ATM machine but sometimes but sometimes I also do get you know I wouldn't call it hate mail but letters of really strong concerns dr. Hong are you insane try to put blight people on the road you must be out of your mind but this vehicle is a prototype vehicle and it's not gonna be on the road until it's proven safe as or safer than today's vehicle and I truly believe this can't be happen but still with the society would they accept such a radical idea how we're going to handle insurance how are you going to issue a driving license there's many of these kind of different hurdles besides technology challenges that we to address before these firms in reality of course the main goal of this projects to develop a car for the blind but potentially more important than this is the the tremendous value of the spin-up technology that can come from this project the sensors that use can see through the dark the fog and rain and together it is new a new type of interfaces we can use these technologies that apply to safer cars for sighted people or for the blind everyday home appliances in the educational setting in the office setting just imagine in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what's written and reusing these non-visual interfaces this is priceless so today the things I've showed you today is just the beginning thank you very much

**Transcript**:
If I were to distill the 20 years of elephant research that I've done into one sentence, what would it be? What could I tell you? I would say that elephants are just like us! And what do I mean by that? It takes a lot of patience to be out there in the field and trying to figure out patterns of these very slow and intelligent animals. But over time, it is true they are very similar to us. And you think, "Well, how can I say that? Look, they have huge ears, they have really long noses. What do you mean they're like us?" Well, in fact, their families are very similar to ours. And family is extremely important to elephants. They grow up in very tight-knit families and they have extended families. And it's just like our family reunions where you have all the aunts gathering around with all the food they're going to bring and plan, and all the boys are thinking, "Are we going to play our video games together? Are we going to spar?" It's very, very similar, and it's jubilant, and screaming, yelling, it's really amazing to see. But, as soon as you get that family gathering, it's just like a wedding or anything else, all of the sudden the family politics come out, and the lower-ranking individuals in this scene, you see the arrow off to the back, the lower-ranking individuals already know their station, they're going to drink at the muddiest part of the pan because the whole family's here and we can't drink at the best water because that's reserved for the top-ranking family. What's also very similar is that you have elders in the group that everyone reveres. This is the matriarch, and the other female is reaching over and doing what's called a trunk to mouth placing her trunk in the mouth, and it's a sign of respect, it's kind of like a handshake, but it's also like a salute. And this salute is learned at a very young age. Now, ritual and bonding within the family also facilitates coordinated activities. So, here's a young female whose calf has fallen into the trough and she doesn't know what to do and she panics. Well, the older female, that's the matriarch, she says, "No problem here," she just scoops the baby out. Now, that's not true for a lot of different families, they can't coordinate very well, the younger females don't really know what to do, but the older ones will just get down, kneel down together and pick the baby out. Another thing that's very similar is the coming of age of teenage boys. Male elephants at the age of about 12 to 15. The biggest elephant in this photograph here is an elephant who's about the leave the family. He gets too big, he gets a little fresh, the adult females had enough of him, but he also is independent, he wants to go out and play with the guys. So what happens then is that you have this all male society, very ritual male society. Greg is our main dominant bull here, you can see him in the middle. He's got a huge posse, his following reveres him. And it's very interesting how very good leaders, very good dominant individuals know how to titrate the carrot and the stick. This guy's a master at it, and there's other bullies out there that want to kind of want to create their own little following, but they can't do it because they're too agressive. And so when he's not around they try and sweet talk the underlings to come into their fold, and they actually become less agressive. So it's very interesting to see how politics play out in these male and female societies. Now back to the ladies here. In a core family group you'll have a mother, maybe even a grandmother, her daughters and all of their offspring, the male and female calves. And what's very interesting here is that how character makes a difference. So each matriarch has a very different character. These two characters are kind of curious, they're uncertain, whereas these other two characters are really agressive. "We're going to charge first, ask questions later." But then there are also matriarchs that say, "Forget it! I'm going to run first and then figure it out when we're in the bush and it's safe." But the wisest matriarch, the matriarchs that succeed best in all of the studies that have been done, is the one that assesses the danger and decides is this worth running away from or is this not a big deal at all. Now being social is super important for elephants and of course right at the beginning, just like early childhood development, socialization is very important. Bathing together, eating together, playing together, rough housing, this is all very important for social development. And who hasn't tried to beat their sibling to the head of the line coming into the water hole? And these relationships from the beginning is just like best friends forever for real. These females are going to live together for life. Now if it's a male, female they might know each other for life, but it's really important to develop those bonds early on. Those are the relationships that are going to save you later. I'll show you a little schoolyard scenario here. Where, I think if you just focus on what's happening here you can see that we have the bully, he's pulling on the trunk of this baby calf, and then we have the diplomat who's reaching over and saying, "No, don't do that! Stop doing that!" And then, of course, we have the bystander. And how do you get these three different characters within the family? It's kind of fascinating to think that elephants really are just like us. And so I got curious about this and I thought, "Well, what if you measure the difference in character of a dominant female's calf versus a lower-ranking female's calf, and see what happens in their growing up." And so we started doing this. And you can see this little guy with his ears out, really charging at you. The difference between that character and the character who holds back, wants to touch mom, isn't so certain about what's going on here. But the other one's charging ahead all confident. Well, we started measuring how far away a calf will stray from mom, how often do they touch others, how often do they initiate play, and then look at the dominance of the females, of their mothers. And what we found is that socializing with the dominant calves actually socialize more significantly more than the lower-ranking calves. And what it looks like is it's not that the lower-ranking calves don't want to play, they're actually not allowed to interact with the higher-ranking calves. They get swatted away from the dominant females. and so this is kind of the downside of, okay we are very much like elephants, elephants are as much like us, but it's kind of for better or for worse because I can also see this happening in humans and maybe we should take a lesson from that. One last thing that we found is that the males will be the risk-takers, they're more independent and they're more likely to spend more time away from mom. And that's very true in human societies and with other social animals. So I hope I've convinced you that we have very similar lives to elephants and that elephants have very individual, durable characters that we've measured across years. The bully always tends to be the bully unless there's some kind of social upset, and he decides he better be a softy or else he's not going to gain favor at all. And then you have the gentle giants that are always going to be gentle. The young males really need mentoring from the elders, and those gentle giants are very good at doing that, soliciting them. Leaving family is a really hard things for the males, but they survive and they figure out who to hang out with. So, just to end here, I just wanted to say that since they are so similar to us, and have these characters, I hope when you see them on TV or you go out and you're lucky enough to see them in the wild, that maybe you'll think of them as individual characters deserving of our attention, and also deserving of our protection. Thank you.

In a core family group you'll have a mother, maybe even a grandmother, her daughters and all of their offspring, the male and female calves. And what's very interesting here is that how character makes a difference. So each matriarch has a very different character. These two characters are kind of curious, they're uncertain, whereas these other two characters are really agressive. "We're going to charge first, ask questions later." But then there are also matriarchs that say, "Forget it! I'm going to run first and then figure it out when we're in the bush and it's safe." But the wisest matriarch, the matriarchs that succeed best in all of the studies that have been done, is the one that assesses the danger and decides is this worth running away from or is this not a big deal at all. Now being social is super important for elephants and of course right at the beginning, just like early childhood development, socialization is very important. Bathing together, eating together, playing together, rough housing, this is all very important for social development. And who hasn't tried to beat their sibling to the head of the line coming into the water hole? And these relationships from the beginning is just like best friends forever for real. These females are going to live together for life. Now if it's a male, female they might know each other for life, but it's really important to develop those bonds early on. Those are the relationships that are going to save you later. I'll show you a little schoolyard scenario here. Where, I think if you just focus on what's happening here you can see that we have the bully, he's pulling on the trunk of this baby calf, and then we have the diplomat who's reaching over and saying, "No, don't do that! Stop doing that!" And then, of course, we have the bystander. And how do you get these three different characters within the family? It's kind of fascinating to think that elephants really are just like us. And so I got curious about this and I thought, "Well, what if you measure the difference in character of a dominant female's calf versus a lower-ranking female's calf, and see what happens in their growing up." And so we started doing this. And you can see this little guy with his ears out, really charging at you. The difference between that character and the character who holds back, wants to touch mom, isn't so certain about what's going on here. But the other one's charging ahead all confident. Well, we started measuring how far away a calf will stray from mom, how often do they touch others, how often do they initiate play, and then look at the dominance of the females, of their mothers. And what we found is that socializing with the dominant calves actually socialize more significantly more than the lower-ranking calves. And what it looks like is it's not that the lower-ranking calves don't want to play, they're actually not allowed to interact with the higher-ranking calves. They get swatted away from the dominant females. and so this is kind of the downside of, okay we are very much like elephants, elephants are as much like us, but it's kind of for better or for worse because I can also see this happening in humans and maybe we should take a lesson from that. One last thing that we found is that the males will be the risk-takers, they're more independent and they're more likely to spend more time away from mom. And that's very true in human societies and with other social animals. So I hope I've convinced you that we have very similar lives to elephants and that elephants have very individual, durable characters that we've measured across years. The bully always tends to be the bully unless there's some kind of social upset, and he decides he better be a softy or else he's not going to gain favor at all. And then you have the gentle giants that are always going to be gentle. The young males really need mentoring from the elders, and those gentle giants are very good at doing that, soliciting them. Leaving family is a really hard things for the males, but they survive and they figure out who to hang out with. So, just to end here, I just wanted to say that since they are so similar to us, and have these characters, I hope when you see them on TV or you go out and you're lucky enough to see them in the wild, that maybe you'll think of them as individual characters deserving of our attention, and also deserving of our protection. Thank you.

**Transcript**:
If I were to distill the 20 years of elephant research that I've done into one sentence, what would it be? What could I tell you? I would say that elephants are just like us! And what do I mean by that? It takes a lot of patience to be out there in the field and trying to figure out patterns of these very slow and intelligent animals. But over time, it is true they are very similar to us. And you think, "Well, how can I say that? Look, they have huge ears, they have really long noses. What do you mean they're like us?" Well, in fact, their families are very similar to ours. And family is extremely important to elephants. They grow up in very tight-knit families and they have extended families. And it's just like our family reunions where you have all the aunts gathering around with all the food they're going to bring and plan, and all the boys are thinking, "Are we going to play our video games together? Are we going to spar?" It's very, very similar, and it's jubilant, and screaming, yelling, it's really amazing to see. But, as soon as you get that family gathering, it's just like a wedding or anything else, all of the sudden the family politics come out, and the lower-ranking individuals in this scene, you see the arrow off to the back, the lower-ranking individuals already know their station, they're going to drink at the muddiest part of the pan because the whole family's here and we can't drink at the best water because that's reserved for the top-ranking family. What's also very similar is that you have elders in the group that everyone reveres. This is the matriarch, and the other female is reaching over and doing what's called a trunk to mouth placing her trunk in the mouth, and it's a sign of respect, it's kind of like a handshake, but it's also like a salute. And this salute is learned at a very young age. Now, ritual and bonding within the family also facilitates coordinated activities. So, here's a young female whose calf has fallen into the trough and she doesn't know what to do and she panics. Well, the older female, that's the matriarch, she says, "No problem here," she just scoops the baby out. Now, that's not true for a lot of different families, they can't coordinate very well, the younger females don't really know what to do, but the older ones will just get down, kneel down together and pick the baby out. Another thing that's very similar is the coming of age of teenage boys. Male elephants at the age of about 12 to 15. The biggest elephant in this photograph here is an elephant who's about the leave the family. He gets too big, he gets a little fresh, the adult females had enough of him, but he also is independent, he wants to go out and play with the guys. So what happens then is that you have this all male society, very ritual male society. Greg is our main dominant bull here, you can see him in the middle. He's got a huge posse, his following reveres him. And it's very interesting how very good leaders, very good dominant individuals know how to titrate the carrot and the stick. This guy's a master at it, and there's other bullies out there that want to kind of want to create their own little following, but they can't do it because they're too agressive. And so when he's not around they try and sweet talk the underlings to come into their fold, and they actually become less agressive. So it's very interesting to see how politics play out in these male and female societies. Now back to the ladies here.

I was walking my mountain the other day, and I was feeling really at home with the forest. And I was so grateful to it for showing me that forests are built on relationships which form networks, like these beautiful river networks. And I thought, "Wow, forests are just like human families." And I was so taken by the beauty of this idea that I fell and I crashed down on the ground, and I hit my head on this new stump. And I was so angry! Then, I was so heartbroken because there was a whole family of trees cut down. Thing is, where I'm from in Western Canada, there's clearcuts like this hidden everywhere, and it wasn't until Google Earth starting sending images, like this, that we realized the whole world was wiping its noses on our old-growth forests. Did you know that deforestation like this around the world causes more greenhouse gas emissions than all the trains, planes and automobiles combined? Yeah, I'm really upset about this, but I'm also really hopeful because I've also discovered in my research that forest networks are organized in the same way as our own neural networks and our social networks. And I believe that if we can learn to integrate these into a whole that we can change this dangerous pathway of global warming because I believe we are wired for healing. So, here's the science: The most ancient of these networks is this below-ground fungal network, or mushroom network. And it evolved over a billion years ago to allow organisms to migrate from the ocean onto the land. And eventually, they got together with plants in this symbiosis. And this allowed plants to photosynthesize, pulling CO2, which is our biggest greenhouse gas, out of the atmosphere and giving off oxygen, which allows us to breathe and actually allowed humans to eventually evolve. Now, we call this symbiosis a mycorrhiza, myco for fungus, rrhiza for root. So, the fungus and root get together, and they trade for mutual benefit. Now, all trees in all forests all over the world depend on these mycorrhizas for their very survival. They can't live without them. And the way it works is that a seed falls on the forest floor, it germinates, it sends a root down into the soil, and it starts sending out chemical signals to the fungi to grow towards the root. And the fungus communicates back with its own signals, and it says to the root, 'You need to grow towards me and branch and soften.' And so by this communication, they grow together into this magical symbiosis. And the way that symbiosis works is the plant takes its hard-earned carbon from photosynthesis and brings it to the fungus because the fungus can't photosynthesize. And the fungus takes nutrients and water it gathers from the soil, where plant roots can't grow, and they give it to the plant. And so they're both benefiting in this cooperation. Now, as the fungus grows through the soil, it starts linking plant and plant and tree and tree together until the whole forest is linked together. Did you know that a single tree can be literally linked up to hundreds of other trees as far as the eye can see? And as you're walking through the forest, what you see, the trees, the roots, the mushrooms, are just the tip of the iceberg. Under a single footstep, there are 300 miles of fungal cells stacked end on end moving stuff around. And if you could look down into the ground, it would be like this super highway with cars going everywhere. Now, all networks are made of nodes and links. In forests, those nodes would be trees and the links fungi. It's kind of like in your Facebook network, where nodes would be friends and links would be your friendships. Now, we all know that some of those nodes, or friends, are busier than others, like that friend who is always sending out group messages. Well, it's the same in forests, and these nodes in forests, we call them hubs, they're the big trees in the forests with roots going everywhere. Now, we also have learned that the systems organized around these hubs, these big old trees, so in forests, that's where the regeneration occurs. In your Facebook network, that might be how parties are organized, around that hub that's always sending out the group messages. We call those hubs in forests mother trees; they're the big old trees in the forest. And they fix the carbon in their leaves, and they send it down through their massive trunks and into the networks all around them that are linked up to all the other trees and seedlings, the young ones, and they start sending that carbon everywhere. The more those seedlings are stressed out, maybe from drought or shade, the more the mother tree sends to them. It's kind of like in your families, where if you're kind of stressed out, mom and dad kick in and help you out a bit more, right? Well, it's the same in forests. The other thing that we've recently discovered is that mother trees will preferentially send more signals to her own kids, her own children. And then, this way she helps them do better, and then they survive more, and then they can pass their genes on to future generations. So, how natural selection works. Now, the way these forests are organized makes them both resilient and vulnerable. They're resilient because there's many mother trees, and there's many fungal species linking them together. And that network is really hard to break. It's pretty darn tough. But of course, we humans have figured out how to do that. And what we do is we take out the mother trees. And maybe taking one out won't make much difference but when you take more and more and more and clearcut and more and more and more that it can cause the system to collapse and fall down, like dominoes. And we can cross tipping points and cause more forest death and more global warming, and we're doing that. So what we do, our choices we make, can lead us towards global heatlh or global sickness. We do have choices. And I'm going to leave you with four ideas that I think are worth spreading. First one: To love the forest you have to go spend time in it. Go be in the forest, connect with it. And then you'll fight hard enough to protect them. Second: Learn how they work. Learn how those networks link things together in organized forests. And to do that, you gotta go out there take risks, make mistakes. Third: Protect forests. They need you to do that because they can't do it themselves. They're stuck in one spot. They can't run away from humans, and they can't run away from global warming. They need you. And finally, and most importantly, use your own very clever, brilliant, neural and social networks to create amazing messages, and spread the word that forests are worth saving because you're worth saving, and I believe that together we're all wired for healing.

Well, it's the same in forests, and these nodes in forests, we call them hubs, they're the big trees in the forests with roots going everywhere. Now, we also have learned that the systems organized around these hubs, these big old trees, so in forests, that's where the regeneration occurs. In your Facebook network, that might be how parties are organized, around that hub that's always sending out the group messages. We call those hubs in forests mother trees; they're the big old trees in the forest. And they fix the carbon in their leaves, and they send it down through their massive trunks and into the networks all around them that are linked up to all the other trees and seedlings, the young ones, and they start sending that carbon everywhere. The more those seedlings are stressed out, maybe from drought or shade, the more the mother tree sends to them. It's kind of like in your families, where if you're kind of stressed out, mom and dad kick in and help you out a bit more, right? Well, it's the same in forests. The other thing that we've recently discovered is that mother trees will preferentially send more signals to her own kids, her own children. And then, this way she helps them do better, and then they survive more, and then they can pass their genes on to future generations. So, how natural selection works. Now, the way these forests are organized makes them both resilient and vulnerable. They're resilient because there's many mother trees, and there's many fungal species linking them together. And that network is really hard to break. It's pretty darn tough. But of course, we humans have figured out how to do that. And what we do is we take out the mother trees. And maybe taking one out won't make much difference but when you take more and more and more and clearcut and more and more and more that it can cause the system to collapse and fall down, like dominoes. And we can cross tipping points and cause more forest death and more global warming, and we're doing that. So what we do, our choices we make, can lead us towards global heatlh or global sickness. We do have choices. And I'm going to leave you with four ideas that I think are worth spreading. First one: To love the forest you have to go spend time in it. Go be in the forest, connect with it. And then you'll fight hard enough to protect them. Second: Learn how they work. Learn how those networks link things together in organized forests. And to do that, you gotta go out there take risks, make mistakes. Third: Protect forests. They need you to do that because they can't do it themselves. They're stuck in one spot. They can't run away from humans, and they can't run away from global warming. They need you. And finally, and most importantly, use your own very clever, brilliant, neural and social networks to create amazing messages, and spread the word that forests are worth saving because you're worth saving, and I believe that together we're all wired for healing.

**Transcript**:
I was walking my mountain the other day, and I was feeling really at home with the forest. And I was so grateful to it for showing me that forests are built on relationships which form networks, like these beautiful river networks. And I thought, "Wow, forests are just like human families." And I was so taken by the beauty of this idea that I fell and I crashed down on the ground, and I hit my head on this new stump. And I was so angry! Then, I was so heartbroken because there was a whole family of trees cut down. Thing is, where I'm from in Western Canada, there's clearcuts like this hidden everywhere, and it wasn't until Google Earth starting sending images, like this, that we realized the whole world was wiping its noses on our old-growth forests. Did you know that deforestation like this around the world causes more greenhouse gas emissions than all the trains, planes and automobiles combined? Yeah, I'm really upset about this, but I'm also really hopeful because I've also discovered in my research that forest networks are organized in the same way as our own neural networks and our social networks. And I believe that if we can learn to integrate these into a whole that we can change this dangerous pathway of global warming because I believe we are wired for healing. So, here's the science: The most ancient of these networks is this below-ground fungal network, or mushroom network. And it evolved over a billion years ago to allow organisms to migrate from the ocean onto the land. And eventually, they got together with plants in this symbiosis. And this allowed plants to photosynthesize, pulling CO2, which is our biggest greenhouse gas, out of the atmosphere and giving off oxygen, which allows us to breathe and actually allowed humans to eventually evolve. Now, we call this symbiosis a mycorrhiza, myco for fungus, rrhiza for root. So, the fungus and root get together, and they trade for mutual benefit. Now, all trees in all forests all over the world depend on these mycorrhizas for their very survival. They can't live without them. And the way it works is that a seed falls on the forest floor, it germinates, it sends a root down into the soil, and it starts sending out chemical signals to the fungi to grow towards the root. And the fungus communicates back with its own signals, and it says to the root, 'You need to grow towards me and branch and soften.' And so by this communication, they grow together into this magical symbiosis. And the way that symbiosis works is the plant takes its hard-earned carbon from photosynthesis and brings it to the fungus because the fungus can't photosynthesize. And the fungus takes nutrients and water it gathers from the soil, where plant roots can't grow, and they give it to the plant. And so they're both benefiting in this cooperation. Now, as the fungus grows through the soil, it starts linking plant and plant and tree and tree together until the whole forest is linked together. Did you know that a single tree can be literally linked up to hundreds of other trees as far as the eye can see? And as you're walking through the forest, what you see, the trees, the roots, the mushrooms, are just the tip of the iceberg. Under a single footstep, there are 300 miles of fungal cells stacked end on end moving stuff around. And if you could look down into the ground, it would be like this super highway with cars going everywhere. Now, all networks are made of nodes and links. In forests, those nodes would be trees and the links fungi. It's kind of like in your Facebook network, where nodes would be friends and links would be your friendships. Now, we all know that some of those nodes, or friends, are busier than others, like that friend who is always sending out group messages. Well, it's the same in forests, and these nodes in forests, we call them hubs, they're the big trees in the forests with roots going everywhere.

It was much more exciting than I thought.
You see the flames. Our first video of fluorine was a bit disappointing.
There wasn’t any, just a few bits of glassware and some funny stories.
So at the moment I’m in the office of Professor Eric Hope who is one
of the Country’s specialists in fluorine chemistry. He knows how to handle
this terrific element safely. I have no idea what to do. I’m quite excited
to see what happens. One of the things you said in that original
video was, on Youtube, was that fluorine was one of the few elements
that you hadn’t seen so I thought there are actually relatively few
chemists who have seen fluorine. So what I want to do is produce
and show you elemental fluorine. Fluorine is slowly released; you
see the pressure slowly going up. The reason that people know about fluorine
is that it is one of the really reactive elements. It will react with all
the elements of the periodic table, except neon and helium. It will react with
gold, it’ll react with silver, it’ll react with platinum. Platinum hexafluoride
is bright red as it’s a gas. Ok so fluorine is going into the apparatus,
it’s going into this tube. Martyn, you can’t see anything can you? I can’t see anything at all. You can’t see anything at all, and that’s
because there’s only a little under 2 atmospheres of fluorine in there.
It’s a very pale yellow colour as a gas. A bit disappointed but I suppose it’s like
oxygen or nitrogen, you can’t really see it. But perhaps if we condense
it as a liquid then I’ll see it properly. Ok so now I’m going to cool this down with
liquid nitrogen to -196oC. I’m going to do it slowly. It will take a little
while. Ok Martyn, do you want to help me with this? Yep. So what I want to do is for you to take that
flask away and I’ll slide this one in. So if you slide it away and back up
again. And there we have, oh maybe two inches of liquid fluorine. You can
go right up that, there’s no problem with that if you want to. Just, clear
a bit of condensation off there. Yeah I’m really surprised I thought it would
be pale green and its dark yellow. If I’d been shown it I’d thought
it was liquid chlorine. But I’ve never seen liquid chlorine either. I’m quite pleased with that. So, basically
I’ve got another fluorine cylinder filled up from the roof with about
5 atmospheres of fluorine in it. So this is now going to release the fluorine.
And what I’ve got in this demonstration here is just a scouring pad.
It’s a metal scouring pad, iron wool. It burnt a hole right through the iron wool.
It’s extraordinary. The iron looks as if it’s rusted but the rusty colour
is actually iron fluoride or maybe a bit of iron oxide from the hot iron
reacting with the oxygen in the air. Well the reason that fluorine makes such strong
bonds is because it is a small atom and the nucleus is relatively highly
charged because it’s right on the right-hand side of the periodic table
but the electrons don’t shield this nucleus. So it is very, so-called, electronegative.
It attracts electrons to itself from other elements. I’ve changed the prop now for some just
normal barbeque briquettes which is pure carbon. So we haven’t done anything. This is cold
charcoal and cold gas, and the gas just touching it is enough to start the
fire. Think of that: just the cold gas setting things on fire. Most chemists
are really too frightened to work with fluorine. You can’t use it in glass
vessels. It doesn’t attack glass but if the glass is a tiny bit wet and most glass
has moisture absorbed into it, then the fluorine form hydrogen fluoride and
it reacts with the water and the hydrogen fluoride just eats through the
glass. So you need to use equipment made out of metal, usually nickel,
and the fluorine reacts with the surface of the nickel, the first time
you use it and then you get a layer on the surface that protects the rest
of the metal. So this is again fluorine with sulphur. So
you are going to oxidise the sulphur, probably to sulphur tetrafluoride
or sulphur hexafluoride. Fluorine has this reputation for being very
reactive and very dangerous and something to be careful about. But aren’t
their fluorine atoms in my toothpaste? Your toothpaste contains fluoride and, just
in the same way that you can eat sodium chloride, table salt which contains
chlorine, you can use fluorides and once the fluorine has got an
extra electron, for example from the tin in tin fluoride, which is often
used in toothpaste or sodium fluoride. It’s got what it wants and it’s
not very reactive. And the way it works with teeth is that the enamel of your
teeth is a compound of calcium called appetite, which normally the
appetite in your teeth can dissolve quite easily in acid. For example,
if you eat sweets or drink some fizzy drinks then you have enough acid
to start dissolving the surface of your teeth. But if you brush your
teeth with fluoride, some of the appetite, which contains OH groups, some
of these are replaced with fluoride and you make a material called fluoral
appetite which is much less soluble in acid so it can’t attacked
so easily, so you don’t get holes in your teeth.

**Transcript**:
It was much more exciting than I thought.
You see the flames. Our first video of fluorine was a bit disappointing.
There wasn’t any, just a few bits of glassware and some funny stories.
So at the moment I’m in the office of Professor Eric Hope who is one
of the Country’s specialists in fluorine chemistry. He knows how to handle
this terrific element safely. I have no idea what to do. I’m quite excited
to see what happens. One of the things you said in that original
video was, on Youtube, was that fluorine was one of the few elements
that you hadn’t seen so I thought there are actually relatively few
chemists who have seen fluorine. So what I want to do is produce
and show you elemental fluorine. Fluorine is slowly released; you
see the pressure slowly going up. The reason that people know about fluorine
is that it is one of the really reactive elements. It will react with all
the elements of the periodic table, except neon and helium. It will react with
gold, it’ll react with silver, it’ll react with platinum. Platinum hexafluoride
is bright red as it’s a gas. Ok so fluorine is going into the apparatus,
it’s going into this tube. Martyn, you can’t see anything can you? I can’t see anything at all. You can’t see anything at all, and that’s
because there’s only a little under 2 atmospheres of fluorine in there.
It’s a very pale yellow colour as a gas. A bit disappointed but I suppose it’s like
oxygen or nitrogen, you can’t really see it. But perhaps if we condense
it as a liquid then I’ll see it properly. Ok so now I’m going to cool this down with
liquid nitrogen to -196oC. I’m going to do it slowly. It will take a little
while. Ok Martyn, do you want to help me with this? Yep. So what I want to do is for you to take that
flask away and I’ll slide this one in. So if you slide it away and back up
again. And there we have, oh maybe two inches of liquid fluorine. You can
go right up that, there’s no problem with that if you want to. Just, clear
a bit of condensation off there. Yeah I’m really surprised I thought it would
be pale green and its dark yellow. If I’d been shown it I’d thought
it was liquid chlorine. But I’ve never seen liquid chlorine either. I’m quite pleased with that. So, basically
I’ve got another fluorine cylinder filled up from the roof with about
5 atmospheres of fluorine in it. So this is now going to release the fluorine.
And what I’ve got in this demonstration here is just a scouring pad.
It’s a metal scouring pad, iron wool. It burnt a hole right through the iron wool.
It’s extraordinary. The iron looks as if it’s rusted but the rusty colour
is actually iron fluoride or maybe a bit of iron oxide from the hot iron
reacting with the oxygen in the air. Well the reason that fluorine makes such strong
bonds is because it is a small atom and the nucleus is relatively highly
charged because it’s right on the right-hand side of the periodic table
but the electrons don’t shield this nucleus. So it is very, so-called, electronegative.
It attracts electrons to itself from other elements. I’ve changed the prop now for some just
normal barbeque briquettes which is pure carbon. So we haven’t done anything. This is cold
charcoal and cold gas, and the gas just touching it is enough to start the
fire. Think of that: just the cold gas setting things on fire. Most chemists
are really too frightened to work with fluorine. You can’t use it in glass
vessels. It doesn’t attack glass but if the glass is a tiny bit wet and most glass
has moisture absorbed into it, then the fluorine form hydrogen fluoride and
it reacts with the water and the hydrogen fluoride just eats through the
glass. So you need to use equipment made out of metal, usually nickel,
and the fluorine reacts with the surface of the nickel, the first time
you use it and then you get a layer on the surface that protects the rest
of the metal. So this is again fluorine with sulphur. So
you are going to oxidise the sulphur, probably to sulphur tetrafluoride
or sulphur hexafluoride. Fluorine has this reputation for being very
reactive and very dangerous and something to be careful about. But aren’t
their fluorine atoms in my toothpaste? Your toothpaste contains fluoride and, just
in the same way that you can eat sodium chloride, table salt which contains
chlorine, you can use fluorides and once the fluorine has got an
extra electron, for example from the tin in tin fluoride, which is often
used in toothpaste or sodium fluoride. It’s got what it wants and it’s
not very reactive. And the way it works with teeth is that the enamel of your
teeth is a compound of calcium called appetite, which normally the
appetite in your teeth can dissolve quite easily in acid. For example,
if you eat sweets or drink some fizzy drinks then you have enough acid
to start dissolving the surface of your teeth. But if you brush your
teeth with fluoride, some of the appetite, which contains OH groups, some
of these are replaced with fluoride and you make a material called fluoral
appetite which is much less soluble in acid so it can’t attacked
so easily, so you don’t get holes in your teeth.

So in the bottom we see neon and this is a
small glass discharge tube which has got a very low pressure of neon
inside it. It’s generally used for lots of signs and things like that. You
might see ‘Fish and Chips’ or perhaps a ‘disco’ or something like that. So Neon is an inert gas like helium and it
doesn’t really form any compounds at all. Most of you have probably
seen neon because it’s used in these so-called neon signs where you
take a glass tube and put a high voltage and it produces a red light. So you can see that, again, a discharge, a
high potential discharge is going across this tube and it’s exciting
all of the neon molecules inside, such that we get this exciting, really vivid
red colouration. And skilled glass-blowers can blow this into
glass shapes of signs saying ‘pizza’ or whatever on shops. You can
freeze neon at very low temperatures about 10 degrees absolute and
early on in my scientific career I did do an experiment in solid neon.
It produced a great result with an iron compound and I’m still quite
proud of it several years on. But it’s not really very important in terms
of absolute chemistry. So this is just a simple pocket spectroscope
and it allows us to analyse the wavelengths of light that each of these
individual light sources is giving off. So each individual atom as it’s
excited in its emission zone can give rise to different lines or different
frequencies of radiation or light and we can use this little device to analyse
which elements are in each of these different elements of light. So we
put it up to our eyes and we look through, and we look at the different

excited in its emission zone can give rise to different lines or different
frequencies of radiation or light and we can use this little device to analyse
which elements are in each of these different elements of light. So we
put it up to our eyes and we look through, and we look at the different
colours of the lines in the different gases.

**Transcript**:
So in the bottom we see neon and this is a
small glass discharge tube which has got a very low pressure of neon
inside it. It’s generally used for lots of signs and things like that. You
might see ‘Fish and Chips’ or perhaps a ‘disco’ or something like that. So Neon is an inert gas like helium and it
doesn’t really form any compounds at all. Most of you have probably
seen neon because it’s used in these so-called neon signs where you
take a glass tube and put a high voltage and it produces a red light. So you can see that, again, a discharge, a
high potential discharge is going across this tube and it’s exciting
all of the neon molecules inside, such that we get this exciting, really vivid
red colouration. And skilled glass-blowers can blow this into
glass shapes of signs saying ‘pizza’ or whatever on shops. You can
freeze neon at very low temperatures about 10 degrees absolute and
early on in my scientific career I did do an experiment in solid neon.
It produced a great result with an iron compound and I’m still quite
proud of it several years on. But it’s not really very important in terms
of absolute chemistry. So this is just a simple pocket spectroscope
and it allows us to analyse the wavelengths of light that each of these
individual light sources is giving off. So each individual atom as it’s
excited in its emission zone can give rise to different lines or different
frequencies of radiation or light and we can use this little device to analyse
which elements are in each of these different elements of light. So we
put it up to our eyes and we look through, and we look at the different
colours of the lines in the different gases.

**Transcript**:
So, we’re braving the elements Brady, to
repeat the experiment that we did quite some time ago, so you will remember that we had
a very small balloon of hydrogen Match on a stick to hydrogen, big bang coming! Are you ready? Yep! Here we go! And the fact that we’ve come outside, might
actually give you an idea of what we are going to do, cause we are going to make it a little
bit bigger, so let’s go and fill a balloon. Alright, cool. Well, hydrogen, I think is very important
because, it is the simplest atom, it’s the atom, consists of a positively charged proton
which is relatively large and a negatively charged electron, that goes round it. Electric match? I think an electric match will go well on
that. Yep. Oh, look at the tension on the balloon! Hold it, I’ve really gone for it and blown
that one up. The tension! What happens is that hydrogen is reacting
with oxygen and H2 plus O2 reacts to form H2O and an oxygen atom and then that oxygen
atom goes on to react with another hydrogen molecule to make more water and the reaction
generates a lot of heat and that heat, heats up more gas to make it react faster, so you
generate more and more heat, so the reaction that begins quite slowly with the first few
molecules, runs away and that is why you get the explosion. So here we have a rather large balloon of
hydrogen, Neil is just preparing our electric match which we are going to attach to the
side of this balloon. And some of the biggest explosions in the
20th century, the Chernobyl reactor, the space shuttle that blew up when it was taking off,
were in fact explosions caused by hydrogen and oxygen. So we’ve filled up a balloon of hydrogen,
and I think if you look at the hydrogen balloon you will see that it is slightly larger than
those we have attempted before. Now we are going to try to detonate it or burn the hydrogen,
in the air by giving it a match and the match we are going to use is again an electric match,
which is connected to our detonator box. If you stick a pin in the balloon, the balloon
will burst because the rubber will break, but the hydrogen will come out and it won’t
react with the oxygen because the hydrogen is cool, it’s at the same temperature as
the air, but the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen like many reactions involves so called
activation energy, you have to put in a certain amount of energy to get it going. But once
you get it going, you get more heat coming out, than you put in to start it off. So, let’s arm the circuit, 5-4-3-2-1. That was more like it. Lovely! When Pete puts the match to the balloon, first
of all the match burns a hole in the balloon, and then the heat gets the hydrogen and oxygen
near the outside of the balloon and they start reacting and the heat then spreads through
the volume of the hydrogen and oxygen, faster probably than the balloon is bursting and
as it spreads through the temperature builds up and up and up because you are generating
so much heat. The reason that you hear a noise, is because,
it causes a rise in pressure which sends a pressure wave out through the air and it hits
your ears or the microphone on your camera. I honestly don’t know why you see any colour.
I suspect that the colour may actually be caused by the burning balloon which contains
carbon and is really like the flame on a candle. Because normally when you have a hydrogen/oxygen
flame you don’t see any colour at all. Alternatively, it may be some impurities in the gas, but
I suspect that what you are seeing in the fire ball is just the burning of the balloon.
The other thing which is really quite exciting about hydrogen is that in principle if you
heat hydrogen to really high temperatures, you can get two hydrogen atoms to fuse together,
or rather, it will not work with hydrogen, but it will work with a heavier form of hydrogen
which is know as deuterium where instead of a proton and an electron, you have a proton
and a neutron, which is a neutral particle, and an electron, and two molecules of deuterium
can fuse together to make one atom of helium which has two protons, two neutrons, and two
electrons and this produces a lot of energy. It is the basis of the so-called hydrogen
bombs, which are like super atomic bombs, but which require an enormously high temperature
to get the reaction to go. You can probably hear it hitting and fizzing
into the bottle there. There is great hope that in the end much of
the world’s energy crisis can be solved by doing this so called nuclear fusion of
deuterium to make helium which would produce energy extremely cleanly. So here, we’ll just tie it off, if my Welsh
hands can actually tie a knot on a balloon, ‘cause, you know we are all a little bit
bizarre. Deuterium gas, in all its properties, will
be very similar to that of hydrogen, of course it is denser, because it has a neutron as
well as a proton but it is still much lighter than air so a deuterium balloon will still
float up to the ceiling and make Pete look just as stupid as the hydrogen one. You’ve got to keep hold of it. Or you lose it Or you lose it, you know! I was thinking more of fusing it, that sounds
like a really big explosion we could do out the back. No! Fusing reactors are way beyond what Pete
can do unless he is a lot cleverer than I think. I got a balloon! I had a balloon of hydrogen! That is the second time you have done that! Now it’s going to go up there eventually
anyway!

can do unless he is a lot cleverer than I think. I got a balloon! I had a balloon of hydrogen! That is the second time you have done that! Now it’s going to go up there eventually
anyway!

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It should be alright! There it goes! Aww,
actually that’s quite spectacular at the end. And in my second-year, I think I love boron
far too much I think, ‘cause I talk about it too much. You love boron? I love boron! No, I used to do lots of chemistry
with boron, I kind of moved away a little bit from boron
now but I really like it. Boron is an interesting element. It is one
of the few that I have actually made myself when I was at school. Boron sits on top of the group 13. Its atomic
number is 5, so it is a metalloid, so elemental boron is a
metalloid which basically means that it has some of the properties
of a non metal and some of the properties of a metal. I mixed an oxide of boron with magnesium,
heated it up and then, it is a really dramatic reaction when
you add water at the end to try and destroy the magnesium boride
that has formed because you get puffs of gas coming
off which burst into flames rather like little anti-aircraft
guns. But boron itself was rather disappointing; it’s a sort of
brown powder. I mean there is a more of a powdery brown
boron, there are several crystalline sort of types of alatropes
of boron. There is one actually that is really, really hard,
so the black crystalline boron is actually very, very hard. It’s
just below diamond on Mohs scale of hardness, so I believe. And
actually in America, there is a town called Boron. It’s in California,
it’s got a population of around 2000 which actually was
set up around the world’s biggest borax mine which is
in California. Well it used to be transported on trains of
mules and the company that produced it used to have as their
trademark a train of 20 mules sort of going along. Of great interest to us chemists, well over
the last sort of 50, maybe sort of 60-70 years, have been the boron
hydrides or borades. So boron hydrides are basically clusters
of borons with hydrogens around them. And one of particular
use and interest in the 50s was one called pentaborane,
which basically: penta, five, it’s got five borons
in it. And Pentaborate was investigated during the cold
war or in the early part of the cold war as being a rocket
fuel. It actually burns with a green flame. They actually called
it the ‘green dragon’ because it burns with a very, very
hot green flame and also because it is pretty toxic, which
I can actually show you if I … It is probably not going to be
spectacular. And boron complexes or borax compounds are
used in a variety of things. It is not a particularly
expensive material. It is used in washing powder, particularly perborate
which when you heat it up in the washing machine when
the water gets to 60 degrees centigrade it turns into hydrogen
peroxide which can then bleach the clothes and this is why
the famous washing powder is called Persil, because the
‘per’ stands for perborate and the ‘sil’ stands for silicate
so it is really a mixture of perborate and silicate. Ok so this isn’t pentaborane because pentaborane
spontaneously combusts in the air. This is just benzene
boronic acid. It’s an organic compound with some boron in it.
So hopefully we can see, we should be able to see, if I can
get some at the end of my spatula, that it should be able to
burn with some sort of green flame. Hey, there it is. You can
also see a bit of yellow which is the organic bit going as well.
It should be alright! There it goes! Aww, actually that was
quite spectacular at the end. Ok.

**Transcript**:
So you can see on the front of this instrument
is a dome shaped device. That dome is a special vessel which is made so we can control the
atmosphere inside and it is fabricated from beryllium metal. This is the beryllium which I don’t really
want to get out. Why not? Well, because it is a toxic chemical, a toxic
metal. Beryllium is an interesting element because
most chemists don’t really know about it very much at all. So beryllium is a fantastic metal, it is really,
really interesting, it’s got really lots of strange metallic properties, but one of
the most important to me is that it is transparent to x-rays. So I can shine x-rays straight
through the beryllium and the beryllium does not absorb it at all which most other metals
especially those with higher molecular weights do. Beryllium-laden dust has been shown to cause
berylliosis which is actually an industrial lung disease which causes the formation of
swollen nodules in the lungs called granulomas which is a bit gross, so I don’t really
want to open up the jar. It’s near the beginning of the periodic
table, but we rarely come across it. So at the moment we are at Matt’s lab and
we are doing some x-ray experiments on a really, really quite sensitive compound. So X-rays
themselves are absorbed by everything, ok, so when we shoot it through the air it is
absorbed by the air, so to measure the x-ray absorption of our compound which is sensitive
to the air we need to be able to remove the air and encase it so we use beryllium to make
a magic box around our sample, that the x-rays can come into, interact with our sample, and
then exit without interacting with the material around them. So you can see on the front of
this instrument, there is a dome shaped device, that dome, is a special vessel which is made
so that we could control the atmosphere inside and it is fabricated from beryllium metal. I talk about in my lectures, I explain that
beryllium chloride the molecule that has three atoms, two chlorine atoms and one beryllium
atom, has the three atoms arranged in the row, so it is a straight molecule so called
linear molecule. I have never seen beryllium chloride. Chemists use it on x-ray defractometers because
actually it is so lightweight it is actually got atomic number 4. The beryllium allows the x-rays to come in
and out without interacting at all. It is a fantastic device it is really useful for
really sensitive chemistry, it is a really beautiful application. The cost of that beryllium
though, that is significant, that small beryllium sample cost 15,000 Euros. It only has four protons and a number of neutrons
so if x-rays fall on atoms of beryllium they are not scattered very much so it’s like
the difference between shining light through a glass window and if you made it out of a
heavy material it would be like, shining through paper, it would be scattered you wouldn’t
get a good image. I’m hoping to actually do some chemistry
with beryllium which is why I’ve bought it. It is pretty toxic so we are going to
have to be very, very careful. You can’t actually breathe in the dust at all, cause
even actually one exposure has shown with some people one exposure is enough to cause
this sort of sensitive reaction. But beryllium is very poisonous so if you
do use these beryllium windows, you have to be careful not to lick your fingers. Well
good chemists shouldn’t lick their fingers anyway.

want to open up the jar. It’s near the beginning of the periodic
table, but we rarely come across it. So at the moment we are at Matt’s lab and
we are doing some x-ray experiments on a really, really quite sensitive compound. So X-rays
themselves are absorbed by everything, ok, so when we shoot it through the air it is
absorbed by the air, so to measure the x-ray absorption of our compound which is sensitive
to the air we need to be able to remove the air and encase it so we use beryllium to make
a magic box around our sample, that the x-rays can come into, interact with our sample, and
then exit without interacting with the material around them. So you can see on the front of
this instrument, there is a dome shaped device, that dome, is a special vessel which is made
so that we could control the atmosphere inside and it is fabricated from beryllium metal. I talk about in my lectures, I explain that
beryllium chloride the molecule that has three atoms, two chlorine atoms and one beryllium
atom, has the three atoms arranged in the row, so it is a straight molecule so called
linear molecule. I have never seen beryllium chloride. Chemists use it on x-ray defractometers because
actually it is so lightweight it is actually got atomic number 4. The beryllium allows the x-rays to come in
and out without interacting at all. It is a fantastic device it is really useful for
really sensitive chemistry, it is a really beautiful application. The cost of that beryllium
though, that is significant, that small beryllium sample cost 15,000 Euros. It only has four protons and a number of neutrons
so if x-rays fall on atoms of beryllium they are not scattered very much so it’s like
the difference between shining light through a glass window and if you made it out of a
heavy material it would be like, shining through paper, it would be scattered you wouldn’t
get a good image. I’m hoping to actually do some chemistry
with beryllium which is why I’ve bought it. It is pretty toxic so we are going to
have to be very, very careful. You can’t actually breathe in the dust at all, cause
even actually one exposure has shown with some people one exposure is enough to cause
this sort of sensitive reaction. But beryllium is very poisonous so if you
do use these beryllium windows, you have to be careful not to lick your fingers. Well
good chemists shouldn’t lick their fingers anyway.

So you can see on the front of this instrument
is a dome shaped device. That dome is a special vessel which is made so we can control the
atmosphere inside and it is fabricated from beryllium metal. This is the beryllium which I don’t really
want to get out. Why not? Well, because it is a toxic chemical, a toxic
metal. Beryllium is an interesting element because
most chemists don’t really know about it very much at all. So beryllium is a fantastic metal, it is really,
really interesting, it’s got really lots of strange metallic properties, but one of
the most important to me is that it is transparent to x-rays. So I can shine x-rays straight
through the beryllium and the beryllium does not absorb it at all which most other metals
especially those with higher molecular weights do. Beryllium-laden dust has been shown to cause
berylliosis which is actually an industrial lung disease which causes the formation of
swollen nodules in the lungs called granulomas which is a bit gross, so I don’t really

**Transcript**:
So comrades, welcome to the lecture. What
I am going to do now, we’re going to begin with an experiment
to illustrate this point that the oxygen molecule, O2, has
unpaired electrons. Now we’re outside just to show you the reactivity
of this lovely stuff here, liquid oxygen. So you can
see wonderful liquid oxygen is a nice blue colour. So over
here on the table we’ve got a tin tray which we’re going
to use to contain the experiment that I’m going to show you next.
So we’ve got our favourite liquid oxygen. Strongly oxidising;
very, very reactive, and here I’ve got some cotton
wool. So this is the same stuff we use to take make-up off, perhaps
our partners or our girlfriends or our wives, and this
is the same stuff we use to wipe our babies’ bums. Oxygen is an interesting element because it
exists in two forms: the taught form which we breathe all
the time is O2, two oxygen atoms joined together; and there’s
another form called ozone, and which has three atoms arranged
like the letter V, or letter V this way up. Oxygen has unpaired electrons within the molecular
orbitals, in the atomic orbitals around the structure,
and these unpaired electrons give rise to colour and
that colour is blue. So blue is often perceived to be the colour
of solvated or unpaired electrons, and you can see here the
lovely blue colour. Now lots of chemists are really scared
when they see the blue of liquid oxygen, because liquid
oxygen is very, very reactive. Generally you only make liquid oxygen
by mistake. Not like today when we’re making some on
purpose. And if you’ve made it by mistake in an uncontrolled
way, where there might be organic molecules perhaps simple
organic chemicals like hydrocarbons, grease or perhaps
a highly elaborate compound then, they tend to detonate
and they tend to cause very energetic experiments. Yeah it’s very fluffy it’s not very reactive.
It doesn’t really burn, it cinders, might smoulder. But here
we go, we’re going to pop it in the tray. So we begin with Neil’s very high-tech piece
of equipment, which is a test-tube on a piece of string.
What we’re going to do is to put some liquid nitrogen in here.
You can see liquid nitrogen – well you may not see – is colourless.
Ok? So this is liquid nitrogen, and what I hope you can see
is that this magnet, which is a pretty good magnet. Let
me just show you here with my keys, that they stick pretty
strongly to the magnet. The magnet has absolutely no affect
at all on the liquid nitrogen. I can pull the magnet and
nothing happens. And then we’re going to fill up all of the
void space, so all of the space in the cotton particles with oxygen.
So you might want to stand back after this bit Brady. So
here we go, here’s our liquid oxygen. Do you want to come in
and zoom in on me? It’s ok, I’ve got it zoomed nicely. Ok, so here you can see the lovely blue liquid
oxygen colour, going into the cotton wool particles. Let’s try the same thing with liquid oxygen.
Careful of my shoes… So here we have a match on a stick, and I
think you can see its probably alight, so we have our fire,
we have our oxygen, and we have our fuel. Now let’s see what
happens when we put them all together. The liquid oxygen is a very nice blue colour
today. So now let’s try, here’s the magnet again, and
if I take the liquid oxygen you can see I can pull it right up
here. It’s not as magnetic as my keys, but you can see there’s
a really big difference. It sticks to the magnet. So you
can see it really is magnetic. You ready? Ok. Woohoo and there she blows! And ozone is much more reactive than oxygen.
So near the earth’s surface, where you and I are at
the moment, ozone is really quite dangerous because if you breathe
it in it can start reacting with any sort of molecule that has
bonds between carbon. But in the upper atmosphere, ozone
is extremely important because it absorbs ultra-violet
light that comes from the sun and stops this ultra-violet light
attacking the molecules in biological species on the surface.
If it wasn’t for the ozone in the upper atmosphere all of us
would be, if not dead, certainly very much less comfortable
than we are at the moment. So Neil’s now connecting up a piece of tube
to oxygen cylinder and he is going to fill up this gas
jar with oxygen and we are going to do a really classic experiment:
the one that everyone learns at school and tests for oxygen,
which is to relight a glowing splint. So we have a traditional
gas jar full of oxygen. So here you can see we are burning
a splint. Ok, so this is the wood burning in excess oxygen
around us, ok. So what we are going to do is we are going to
take the splint out so it is just glowing. And if I blow on this
splint you can see it gets brighter. Now we are going to try and
relight that splint by putting it into a very oxygen-rich atmosphere.
So we’ll move over to the jar and we’ll put in our
glowing splint and you can see the flame comes back to life.
So that’s a test that everyone learns for an oxygen-rich environment. What happened? What made that happen? Well the increased oxygen content/concentration
reignites and reinitiates that oxidation of the wood or
the burning of the wood. So we’ll do that again. So there we
go: flame again.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: "Last night I had a horrible nightmare”, said the organic chemist to the theoretical one. “I could see the blue color of liquid oxygen!” Why is this beautiful liquid so feared by organic chemists?

so here we have a sample of titanium wire titanium is a really quite fantastic metal it's very very lightweight and very very strong it's used in construction materials very low concentrations and as additives for Alloys titanium is a very interesting element and it's interesting because it's very abundant on the planet it's not the most abundant metal but it's still pretty abundant this is a periodic table where the area of each of the elements here represents the relative amount of this material that is found on the earth as you can see there's a lot of oxygen a lot of carbon quite a lot of boron Debb's favorite element some aluminium again a lot and here titanium is quite a reasonable amount nearly as much as potassium so it's a very common element so going to open it now and we'll hopefully see the titanium wire around the spindle so you can see it's a really quite beautiful dark coloration you can find large deposits of titanium dioxide in various places across the world we've just had a visitor from South Africa who said not far from where he works in East London along the coast their large deposits of titanium dioxide the problem is that it is really quite hard to make titanium metal out of the oxide because titanium atoms bond strongly to the oxygen and it's difficult to get them apart and get the metal and the reason why people want to get the metal is because it's very light here I've got a piece of titanium and it's quite light you can see I can shake it around in my hands without behaving as as if it was a really heavy bar often used as well in the construction of aerospatial sort of capsules and components to go into space because it's light and strong being light by itself is not much use sodium is light the great thing about titanium is that it is light and it's strong and also it doesn't react with water you couldn't make a car out of sodium the first rainstorm and boom but titanium is light it is strong so if you're making a vehicle out of it the vehicle isn't very heavy so you don't need nearly as much fuel than if you're making the vehicle out of steel usually people make the vehicle out of aluminium which is lighter than steel but is not nearly as strong and the great thing about titanium is it's fantastically strong once you get the metal so the problem getting the metal is from titanium dioxide titanium dioxide is a white powder in fact you can see it around you if you look around the room you're in almost certainly the walls are white with titanium dioxide it's a very cheap white pigment normally what happens in the process for making titanium metal is that first of all it is converted to Titanium tetrachloride TI cl4 and if you just leave it as titanium tetrachloride in the air it will react with the air with water in the air and go back to titanium dioxide you haven't achieved anything in fact one of my colleagues Rich born showed Brady earlier what happens with this reaction I've never seen it but I had to stay in my office and work however you can take titanium tetrachloride and convert it to the metal and once you've got the metal it's pretty unreactive provided that you keep it cold if you put titanium at high temperatures in oxygen it will burn so there are some processes where you would like to use the strength of titanium but because there's oxygen there it's not safe but cars and most airlanes don't get hot enough for the burning in oxygen to be a problem so it is a fantastic material and if we could solve the pro problem of how to make titanium metal cheaply in terms of the energy needed to convert the oxide into the metal then we could have cars that were far more fuele efficient and cheaper to run so it's a really good goal tianium is used at the moment in applications where strength and lightness is more important than cost if you're building fighter aircraft where of course cost is important you but you need it to be pretty light or you can't can't get to the speeds that you need to shoot down the enemy and so on then they will use titanium Alloys if those are best you often use titanium for very high pressure applications when chemists want to do experiments at high pressure they will often use titanium because again it is very light and again strong it is also has a great advantage that it's non-magnetic and when you want to for example do experiments in a high magnetic field when you need something strong you can't use steel because your apparatus will be pulled away by the magnet and nothing will work so titanium has a very special applications which can be very useful but they could be so much more useful if we could apply it more widely it's used where you really need strength and where money is not terribly important is in hip implants in your hip you want to have something that's very strong and very light each time you move your leg you don't want to be moving a cannonball or something really heavy but you want it to be really strong and so again very often hip implants will be made out of titanium the piece that goes into your leg is made out of titanium and ends in a ball and the part that goes into your pelvis is often made of polythene plastic so that you get the ball and socket effect well one of the most interesting applications of titanium is as a catalyst for making polythene polyethylene the material material that is used particularly for plastic buckets and other plastic objects and ethylene was first polymerized turned into plastic some people call it ethine rather ethylene was turned into plastic before the second world war with a very high press reaction that produced a material that was rather soft and you couldn't for example use for making buckets and then in the 1950s um a German chemist called Zigler he discovered partly also working with Italian chemist called NATA that if you take a titanium compound and an aluminium compound together this was a really good Catalyst and by really good I mean one gram of this Catalyst could produce a ton of plastic so that because titanium is relatively cheap it means you don't even have to get the Catalyst out of the plastic because there's so little of it in the plastic you can just afford to sell it when your plastic bucket without losing much money does that mean there's probably a little bit of titanium in my plastic bucket at home yes and there's probably more titanium from the fact that you cleaned your paintbrush when you were painting your kitchen or bedroom with white paint so there's titanium

**Transcript**:
so here we have a sample of titanium wire titanium is a really quite fantastic metal it's very very lightweight and very very strong it's used in construction materials very low concentrations and as additives for Alloys titanium is a very interesting element and it's interesting because it's very abundant on the planet it's not the most abundant metal but it's still pretty abundant this is a periodic table where the area of each of the elements here represents the relative amount of this material that is found on the earth as you can see there's a lot of oxygen a lot of carbon quite a lot of boron Debb's favorite element some aluminium again a lot and here titanium is quite a reasonable amount nearly as much as potassium so it's a very common element so going to open it now and we'll hopefully see the titanium wire around the spindle so you can see it's a really quite beautiful dark coloration you can find large deposits of titanium dioxide in various places across the world we've just had a visitor from South Africa who said not far from where he works in East London along the coast their large deposits of titanium dioxide the problem is that it is really quite hard to make titanium metal out of the oxide because titanium atoms bond strongly to the oxygen and it's difficult to get them apart and get the metal and the reason why people want to get the metal is because it's very light here I've got a piece of titanium and it's quite light you can see I can shake it around in my hands without behaving as as if it was a really heavy bar often used as well in the construction of aerospatial sort of capsules and components to go into space because it's light and strong being light by itself is not much use sodium is light the great thing about titanium is that it is light and it's strong and also it doesn't react with water you couldn't make a car out of sodium the first rainstorm and boom but titanium is light it is strong so if you're making a vehicle out of it the vehicle isn't very heavy so you don't need nearly as much fuel than if you're making the vehicle out of steel usually people make the vehicle out of aluminium which is lighter than steel but is not nearly as strong and the great thing about titanium is it's fantastically strong once you get the metal so the problem getting the metal is from titanium dioxide titanium dioxide is a white powder in fact you can see it around you if you look around the room you're in almost certainly the walls are white with titanium dioxide it's a very cheap white pigment normally what happens in the

water in the air and go back to titanium dioxide you haven't achieved anything in fact one of my colleagues Rich born showed Brady earlier what happens with this reaction I've never seen it but I had

**Transcript**:
This is a balloon of Helium, and Helium is a very small gas. we use in this case to find leaks in high pressure in high vacuum operators, because it's very very small, finds the smallest, smallest holes. But just like Hydrogen, it's also very very light. And you know, in the past we used Hydrogen to fill balloons, for transport, and now you see the Goodyear Blimp, sporting occasions, filled with Helium.  So Helium is probably the most unreactive of the elements. It has a mass of 4, so it weighs four times as much as a Hydrogen atom, but Hydrogen is an H2 molecule, whereas Helium exists as isolated atoms, so that the a Helium molecule weighs twice as much as Hydrogen. See here, we have a Helium filled balloon, and it's extremely light, so I'm not gonna let it go right now so I will lose it to the ceiling. So I'm just gonna put on a piece of string. tie a lead around it again. Helium can not be synthesized in nature because it is just an element. It is found as a component of natural gas in some places, particularly in the United States, because it is formed by the radioactive decay of minerals underground, and these form Helium, which is trapped with the natural gas. So here we have a Helium balloon floating, because it's displacing its volume of air, and it'll float quite nicely. It's actually quite hard to contain, so the piece of string and the heavy stand is there holding it down, because we don't really wanna lose it. If we take a balloon of another light gas, and that's Hydrogen, and we add a match to it or we set it on fire, it will burn really really quickly, and really energetically, because it makes for lots and lots of water, Hydrogen plus Oxygen.  We're gonna do the same experiment now, but we're gonna do it with a Helium filled balloon, and see if that'll burn. So here we have a technical match on a stick, and we're gonna offer it out to our floating balloon of Helium. Let's see what happens this time.  A little bit of a bang, but that's just bang of the gas escaping, it didn't burn. Yep, it's unreactive, it's an inert gas. The molecule is very light, so once it is in the atmosphere it will eventually go out into outer space. So that we are, in theory at least, likely to run out of Helium in eventual future. If it is just released to the atmosphere.  So what I got here is a balloon of Helium, and it's really really light, and it's displacing a lot of volume, so if I let go of it it's gonna fly like a balloon. So what we're gonna do is I'm gonna hold it down here, and Neil is gonna cool it for me using some liquid Nitrogen. Now you can see Neil is using gloves, because it's very very cold. Okay, so as he cools the balloon the gasses inside are slowing down, and they take up much much less volume as we slow them down, and now you can see it's displacing less volume, so the balloon is quite happy to sit on the table. If we stop pouring the liquid Nitrogen onto it now, and watch what happens as the balloon starts to warm up again. Because the gases are gaining more energy, and they are occupying more space, and becoming more bouyant, so the Helium comes back to the ceiling, where it really wants to be.  The Helium has a whole series of useful properties because it's a very light gas, if you breathe in Helium, you then start speaking like Donald Duck, in a very squeaky voice.  Helium. Fantastic element. Very light, very fun. Because the speed of sound is much greater in Helium than it is in ordinary gases. It is also very useful as a liquid. It only liquifies at very low temperature. Its boiling point is -269 degrees centigrade. But if you cool things with liquid Helium, you get very strange properties, for example, some materials lose their electrical resistance. So liquid Helium is used for magnets when you need very powerful magnets, and for example, they're used magnets from magnetic resonance imaging in hospitals. If you use a vacuum pump to pump hard on the Helium, the boiling point will go even lower, and you can go to nearly two degrees absolute. And so Helium is very important for all sorts of refrigiration. Captions by www.SubPLY.com

**Transcript**:
This is a balloon of Helium, and Helium is a very small gas. we use in this case to find leaks in high pressure in high vacuum operators, because it's very very small, finds the smallest, smallest holes. But just like Hydrogen, it's also very very light. And you know, in the past we used Hydrogen to fill balloons, for transport, and now you see the Goodyear Blimp, sporting occasions, filled with Helium.  So Helium is probably the most unreactive of the elements. It has a mass of 4, so it weighs four times as much as a Hydrogen atom, but Hydrogen is an H2 molecule, whereas Helium exists as isolated atoms, so that the a Helium molecule weighs twice as much as Hydrogen. See here, we have a Helium filled balloon, and it's extremely light, so I'm not gonna let it go right now so I will lose it to the ceiling. So I'm just gonna put on a piece of string. tie a lead around it again. Helium can not be synthesized in nature because it is just an element. It is found as a component of natural gas in some places, particularly in the United States, because it is formed by the radioactive decay of minerals underground, and these form Helium, which is trapped with the natural gas. So here we have a Helium balloon floating, because it's displacing its volume of air, and it'll float quite nicely. It's actually quite hard to contain, so the piece of string and the heavy stand is there holding it down, because we don't really wanna lose it. If we take a balloon of another light gas, and that's Hydrogen, and we add a match to it or we set it on fire, it will burn really really quickly, and really energetically, because it makes for lots and lots of water, Hydrogen plus Oxygen.  We're gonna do the same experiment now, but we're gonna do it with a Helium filled balloon, and see if that'll burn. So here we have a technical match on a stick, and we're gonna offer it out to our floating balloon of Helium. Let's see what happens this time.  A little bit of a bang, but that's just bang of the gas escaping, it didn't burn. Yep, it's unreactive, it's an inert gas. The molecule is very light, so once it is in the atmosphere it will eventually go out into outer space. So that we are, in theory at least, likely to run out of Helium in eventual future. If it is just released to the atmosphere.  So what I got here is a balloon of Helium, and it's really really light, and it's displacing a lot of volume, so if I let go of it it's gonna fly like a balloon. So what we're gonna do is I'm gonna hold it down here, and Neil is gonna cool it for me using some liquid Nitrogen. Now you can see Neil is using gloves, because it's very very cold. Okay, so as he cools the balloon the gasses inside are slowing down, and they take up much much less volume as we slow them down, and now you can see it's displacing less volume, so the balloon is quite happy to sit on the table. If we stop pouring the liquid Nitrogen onto it now, and watch what happens as the balloon starts to warm up again. Because the gases are gaining more energy, and they are occupying more space, and becoming more bouyant, so the Helium comes back to the ceiling, where it really wants to be.  The Helium has a whole series of useful properties because it's a very light gas, if you breathe in Helium, you then start speaking like Donald Duck, in a very squeaky voice.  Helium. Fantastic element. Very light, very fun. Because the speed of sound is much greater in Helium than it is in ordinary gases. It is also very useful as a liquid. It only liquifies at very low temperature. Its boiling point is -269 degrees centigrade. But if you cool things with liquid Helium, you get very strange properties, for example, some materials lose their electrical resistance. So liquid Helium is used for magnets when you need very powerful magnets, and for example, they're used magnets from magnetic resonance imaging in hospitals. If you use a vacuum pump to pump hard on the Helium, the boiling point will go even lower, and you can go to nearly two degrees absolute. And so Helium is very important for all sorts of refrigiration. Captions by www.SubPLY.com

**Transcript**:
So the last time we tried to film chlorine
experiments we found that the chlorine cylinder itself had
a slight problem, it was seized here. But the Stig
has acquired another cylinder of chlorine. So you know
what this means, it means that we feel duty-bound to
increase the intensity of our chlorine video and show you
some chemistry with chlorine. Chlorine is an element that many people have
heard of. It’s a greenish-yellow gas which consists
of, the gas consists of two chlorine atoms bonded together
so it’s Cl2 and it’s much heavier than air. Incredibly reactive, incredibly poisonous,
not a very nice compound at all. Ok so Neil is about to open
the cylinder of chlorine to allow some of the chlorine
gas to leak through the pipe into the, to the flask in
the fume hood. Chlorine sits in the right-hand side of the
periodic table in the halogens in group, well, some people
say seven, some people say seventeen. Really what that
says is that chlorine wants another electron to get
that noble gas configuration and it will move heaven
and earth to get that electron! So during the First World War it was used
as a chemical weapon. The gas could spread across the battlefields
and when it came to the trenches, which were holes in
the ground, it would fall into the trenches and fill them
up. You can see the yellow colour against the
white background on the paper, so now we’re starting
to fill that flask with chlorine; it’s quite dense,
so it will stick to the bottom of the flask it’s not like
a light gas like hydrogen or helium, it won’t come upwards.
So now you can see the colour in that chlorine is really
quite intense. It wasn’t a terribly good weapon because
it could quite easily, if the wind changed direction, it
could blow the gas back to the people who were letting it
out. So we’ll just put a stopper in to contain
the gas while we prepare the rest of the experiment. Chlorine is quite corrosive, it reacts with
water to make an acid, HCl, hydrochloric acid which can
attack people’s lungs. The lungs generate fluid, they fill
up with fluid and quickly the person drowns in their own fluid.
It also corrodes things very easily so all the metal
fittings on people’s battle dress, the brass buttons,
brass buckles, all went green as well. But it’s not a terribly
effective weapon but when people weren’t expecting
any sort of chemical weapon it must have been terrifying. Ok so we have a small amount of aluminium
here which we put on the end of a wire. We’re gonna
heat the aluminium in that flame and then we’re gonna
put the hot aluminium into the flask of chlorine,
then hopefully we’ll see, the chlorine will react with
the aluminium and we’ll get very rapid formation of aluminium
trichloride, AlCl3. The British Army created whole regiments of
gas soldiers who were all trained chemists, who
were sent out to handle these cylinders of gas. And
on the German side in the First World War, Fritz Haber,
the inventor of the Haber process to make ammonia became very
keen on chemical weapons and he was the chief proponent.
His wife was really furious about this and in fact shot
herself with his revolver, killed herself, the day before
he was due to go back to the front. And he, it was said
that this was because she objected to his work on
chemical weapons. Though at the same time there were
rumours that he was having an affair with another
woman, so there may have been other factors at play as
well. So, let’s heat up our aluminium. Ok, so
it’s nice and warm, all over. And then we’ll drop it or
add it into the chlorine glass. Now instantly we are seeing
aluminium trichloride coming out of the top and reacting
with moisture in the air. So now you can see the
reaction is getting very intense and we are seeing a flame
in the bottom. So the aluminium is being consumed
as it’s reacting, oxidising strongly in that chlorine-rich
air. Chlorine is found all over the world, the
sea contains sodium chloride, and there are huge deposits
of sodium chloride in salt lakes where lakes have dried
out, such as in some parts of the States, where you,
United States, where you have salt lakes where people
can race cars and things across the flat surface
and in other parts of the world. All of the aluminium has been consumed now
by the chlorine: a very, very rapid reaction. There are many areas, such as in the north
of England, in the county of Cheshire and also in Salzburg
in Austria, where there are prehistoric deposits of salt
from prehistoric salt lakes, which can now be mined
really quite easily, and there, so salt and chlorine
is a very common element. It’s made from sodium chloride
solution by electrolysis, by passing an electric current,
and it’s a very energy intensive process. One percent of
the UK’s electricity was used, at one time, for making
chlorine from sodium chloride, and the chlorine is used
particularly for making the plastic PVC. While we got chlorine here, we thought we’d
do a couple of reactions. So we’ve got some chlorine
in this flask and you can see the nice yellow colour and
I thought what we’d try and do now is do a competition
reaction again or a reaction with iron. So now the
iron, we’re gonna heat the iron, this is iron wool which
you might use for treating wood, and we’re gonna heat
that until it’s warm and put it in the chlorine, the
chlorine will oxidise it to iron chloride. Chlorine will react with all sorts of metals.
You can make salt by burning the metal sodium in chlorine,
and if you put in other metals like aluminium or iron
they will also react. Aluminium reacts to form aluminium
trichloride which is the salt of aluminium and iron will
similarly react to form iron chloride, and most metals
but not all of them will react with chlorine: lead will
not for example. But it is really quite a reactive
gas. So really rapid reaction there as the hot
iron starts to react with the chlorine to form iron chloride.
Very, very exothermic again and I think, yes this is
very hot, we might have to move it off the paper. So what happens in all of these reactions
is that the chlorine removes an electron from the metal
to make the chloride ion Cl-, and the chloride ion
is perfectly innocuous, you can drink, you can eat chloride,
whereas chlorine itself is very poisonous. Oh it’s warm, it’s not too hot to touch
its like picking up a mug of warm tea or warm coffee. But you
can see again the products of the chemical reaction
have precipitated out across the flask, and now
if I remove the…wire again I can see that all of the
iron has been consumed again instantly. The moment that
it got into that chlorine-rich flask; very, very rapid
reaction, very, very reactive with chlorine.

**Transcript**:
I'm in my hotel room in Sydney Australia where I'm staying for a conference before I start my lecture tour going around various cities in Australia and I've just read the paper which I think so exciting that I thought I should tell you about it before we make a bigger video when the results of the paper are fully known the papers in the journal science and it's about looking for new super-heavy elements though the current state of play is that there is some evidence for all the elements up to an including 118 now the evidence for the last few is not equally good so elements 114 now and 116 are about to be named and 113 115 and we're still waiting for confirmation but essentially the whole of the periodic table is more or less known in some of my videos the ones about 118 I said that I thought there was no chance of ever seeing elements beyond 118 and the point about this paper is that it says that scientists are looking for and believed they might find element 120 now what they're saying is they may be able to start finding elements in this part in the next row as you will have seen people have predicted how the periodic table might appear lower down here right up to element 172 what has happened is that chemists and physicists have predicted that if you make heavier elements that there may be a few arrangements of neutrons and protons which are much more stable than these very unstable elements over here and they call this the island of stability it's because if you plot out as they have done in picture here the numbers of protons and neutrons you can get areas which appear like an island where the elements are stable and then there are other combinations which are not stable what people are doing is trying to make these elements in the same way that they've done before where you take a heavy element with a heavy nucleus and bombard it with lighter elements and you choose the combination so that the mass of the light element and the heavy element makes the one you're trying to synthesize so in this case the experiments described in this paper are taking titanium which has atomic number 22 and californium which has atomic number 98 and if you add 22 plus 98 you get a hundred and twenty so the experiment consists of accelerating nuclei of titanium atoms at enormous ly high speed a fraction of the speed of light and letting it bang in to the sample of californium and most of the time the titanium just bounces off in some random direction but what they hope is that every so often and it hasn't happened yet but every so often one of these titanium nuclei will hit the californium in such a way that it will go inside and you can see it's quite a hard process but it can go inside so you then have the combined nucleus with mass 120 + this nucleus then shoots out of the back of the target and towards your detector but there's all sorts of fragments of atoms being knocked out to the back of the target so the key is that you have to have a really good separator based on magnetic fields so if you make a nucleus of 120 element 120 it will whiz out and hit the detector without most of the other junk once it gets to the detector as with previous super-heavy elements it will all being will stick into the detector and then once it's there it will begin decaying and out of the nucleus will come smaller fragments what the point of the experiment is that people can predict fairly accurately what would come out of a nucleus of element 120 if it was made so if they see those bits they can recognize they've made element 120 so far they haven't seen anything at all the experiments that were described in this paper are being done in the Institute in dumb start where we visited a few months ago to look at elements like Boreum and hassium where they were synthesized the reason why the experiments get difficult is each time the nucleus you're trying to make gets heavier the chances of your accelerated atom and the target fusing together get smaller and smaller and smaller so the experiment gets more and more difficult to do you have to understand the titanium atoms are coming a billions every second and they're running the experiments for weeks if not months in the hope of just seeing one atom coming out so the probability is pretty small the reason why they're trying to make 120 rather than 119 which would be the next atom in the periodic table after 118 so you've got one hundred and eighteen hundred nineteen hundred and twenty but already it becomes clear it's become clear that elements that have an even number of protons that's one hundred fourteen hundred 1618 are more stable than the ones with odd numbers so it makes sense to look for 120 before trying to find 119 I don't know but it is connected with the fact that the neutrons and the protons in the nucleus form shells rather in the same way that you get shells of electrons in the atoms though exactly how they form the shells I don't know the hope is that perhaps some of these super-heavy elements really may be much more stable than anything they've seen before after all the targets they're using californium wasn't known when I was born and now you can make enough californium to have a metal target made out of it so I doubt whether you will be able to have lumps of element 120 or one of the high ones but you might be able to and whatever happens you'll have a much better understanding of what it is that makes atoms form and what are the limitations what are the rules that hold them together so this is not the sort of experiment that will necessarily give you new iPhone tomorrow but on the other hand it will give us a lot of scientific understanding so it's well worth doing well I think that will be quite fun

[ music ] A Tetrad of Lunar Eclipses – presented by Science@NASA For people in the United States, an extraordinary series of lunar eclipses is about to begin. The action starts on April 15th when the full Moon passes through the amber shadow of Earth, producing a midnight eclipse visible across North America. That night marks the beginning of a lunar eclipse tetrad a series of 4 consecutive total eclipses occurring at six month intervals. The total eclipse of April 15, 2014, will be followed by another on Oct. 8, 2014, and another on April 4, 2015, and another on Sept. 28 2015. 'The most unique thing about the 2014-2015 tetrad is that all of them are visible for all or parts of the USA,' says longtime NASA eclipse expert Fred Espenak. On average, lunar eclipses occur about twice a year, but not all of them are total. There are three types: A penumbral eclipse is when the Moon passes through the pale outskirts of Earth's shadow. It's so subtle, sky watchers often don't notice an eclipse is underway. A partial eclipse is more dramatic. The Moon dips into the core of Earth's shadow, but not all the way, so only a fraction of Moon is darkened. A total eclipse, when the entire Moon is shadowed, is best of all. The face of the Moon turns sunset-red for up to an hour or more as the eclipse slowly unfolds. Usually, lunar eclipses come in no particular order. A partial can be followed by a total, followed by a penumbral, and so on. Anything goes. Occasionally, though, the sequence is more orderly. When four consecutive lunar eclipses are all total, the series is called a tetrad. 'During the 21st century, there are 9 sets of tetrads, so I would describe tetrads as a frequent occurrence in the current pattern of lunar eclipses,' says Espenak. 'But this has not always been the case. During the three hundred year interval from 1600 to 1900, for instance, there were no tetrads at all.' The April 15th eclipse begins at 2 AM Eastern time when the edge of the Moon first enters the amber core of Earth's shadow. Totality occurs during a 78 minute interval beginning around 3 o'clock in the morning on the east coast, midnight on the west coast. Weather permitting, the red Moon will be easy to see across the entirety of North America. Why red? A quick trip to the Moon provides the answer: Imagine yourself standing on a dusty lunar plain looking up at the sky. Overhead hangs Earth, nightside down, completely hiding the sun behind it. The eclipse is underway. You might expect Earth seen in this way to be utterly dark, but it's not. The rim of the planet seems to be on fire! As you scan your eye around Earth's circumference, you're seeing every sunrise and every sunset in the world, all of them, all at once. This incredible light beams into the heart of Earth's shadow, filling it with a coppery glow and transforming the Moon into a great red orb. Mark your calendar for April 15th, and let the tetrad begin! For more rare occurrences in the night's sky, stay tuned to science.nasa.gov

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] I want to share with you over the next 18 minutes um a pretty incredible idea actually it's a really big idea but to get us started I I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world now I bet in this audience you're thinking of some really incredible technology some stuff that I I I haven't even heard of them absolutely sure but I'm also sure pretty sure that absolutely nobody is thinking of this this is a polio vaccine and it's a great thing actually that nobody's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted this is a great technology we can take it completely for granted but it wasn't always that way even here in California if we were to go back just a few years it was a very different story people were terrified of this disease they were terrified of polio and it would cause public panic and it was because of scenes like this in this scene people are living in an iron lung these are people who were perfectly healthy 2 or 3 days before and then 2 days later they can no longer breathe and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs but also their breathing muscles and they were going to spend the rest of their lives usually in this iron lung to breathe for them this disease was terrifying there was no cure and there was no vaccine the disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary National effort to find a way to stop it 20 years later they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine it was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s finally a vaccine that could stop this awful disease and here in the United States it had an incredible impact as you can see the virus stopped and it stopped very very fast but this wasn't the case everywhere in the world and it happen so fast in the United States however that even just last month John Stewart said this is polio still active because I was I I thought that that had been eradicated in the way that small pox had been eradicated oops John Poli has almost been eradicated but the reality is that polio still exists today we made this map for John to try and show him exactly where polio still exists this is the picture there's not very much left in the world but the reason there's not very much left is because there's been an extraordinary public private partnership working behind the scenes almost unknown I'm sure to most of you here today it's been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease and it's got it down to this few cases that you can see here on this graphic but just last year we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio and this is the reason in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade on opposite sides of the globe there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks hundreds of people were paralyzed hundreds of people died children as well as adults and in both cases we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries they had come from thousands of miles away and in one case it originated on another continent and not only that but when they came into these countries then they got on Commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even further other places like Russia where for the first time in over a decade last year children were crippled and Paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you these are under control now and it looks like they uh they'll probably stop very very quickly but the message was very clear polio is still a devastating explosive disease it's just happening in another part of the world and our big idea is that the scientific Miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis so I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership the polio partnership is trying to do we're not trying to control polio we're not trying to get it down to just a few cases because this disease is like a root fire it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely so what we're looking for is a permanent solution we want a world in which every child just like you guys can take for granted a polio free world so we're looking for a permanent solution and this is where we get lucky this is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try and do something truly extraordinary this virus can only survive in people it can't live for a very long time in people it doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all and we've got pretty good vaccines as I just showed you so we are trying to wipe out this virus completely what the poo eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on earth now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this to eradicating diseases it's been tried six times in the last century and it's been successful exactly once and this is because disease eradication is still the venture capital of Public Health the risks are massive but the payoff economic humanitarian motivational it's absolutely huge one Congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the US put into small poox eradication pays itself off every 26 days in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs and if we can finish polio eradication the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone so those are the kind of stakes that we're after but small poox eradication was hard it was very very hard and polio eradication in many ways is even tougher and there's a few reasons for that the first is that when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with small pox and there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries so it was a massive effort the Second Challenge we had was in contrast to the small poox vaccine which was very stable and a single dose protected you for life the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile AG it deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put the special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child it's not potent it's not going to protect them even then kids need many doses of the vaccine but the third challenge we have and probably even bigger one the biggest challenge is that in contrast to small pox where you could always see your enemy every single person almost who is infected with small poox had this Telltale rash so you could get around the disease you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off polio it's almost completely different the vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease so you can't see the enemy most of the time and as a result we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with small poox we've had to create one of the largest social move movements in history there's over 10 million people probably 20 million people largely volunteers who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now uh been called the largest internationally coordinated operation in peacetime these people these 20 million people vaccinate over 500 million children every single year multiple times at the peak of our operations now giving the polio vaccine is simple just two drops like that but reaching 500 million people is much much tougher and these vaccinators these volunteers they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest densest Urban slums in the world they've got to track under sweltering Suns to some of the most remote difficult to reach places in the world and they also have to dodge bullets because we have got to operate during shaky ceasefires and trues to try and vaccinate children even in areas affected by conflict one reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about 5 years ago a place which has eradicated polio not once but twice because they got reinfected he was sitting on the side of the road watching one of these polio campaigns unfold and a few months later he wrote this is foreign aid at its most heroic and these Heroes they come from every Walk of Life all sorts of backgrounds but one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International this is a group whose million strong Army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years the right at the center of the whole thing now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication more than 15 years much longer than it should have but once it was built the results Were Striking within a couple of years every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses with the exception of four countries that you see here and it was in each of those was only part of the country and then by 1999 one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide proof of concept and then today there's been a 99% reduction greater than 99% reduction in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease when we started over 20 years ago 1,000 children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus last year it was 1,000 and at the same time the polio eradication program has been working to help in a lot of other areas it's been working to help control pandemic flu SARS for example it's also been trying to save children by doing other things giving vitamin A drops giving measel shots giving uh bed Nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us the International Community to reach every single child every single Community the most vulnerable people in the world with the most basic of Health Services irrespective of geography poverty culture and even conflict so things were looking very exciting and then about 5 years ago this virus this ancient virus started to fight back the first problem we ran into was that in these last four countries the strongholds of this virus we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out and then to make the matters even worse the virus started to spread out of these four places especially Northern India and Northern Nigeria into much of Africa Asia and even into Europe causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades and then in one of the most important tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have in conditions like this the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to now at that time there was a great as you can imagine frustration let's call it frustration it started to grow very very quickly and all of a sudden some very important voices in the world of Public Health started to say say hang on we should abandon this idea of eradication let's settle for control that's good enough now as seductive as the idea of control sounds it's a false premise the brutal truth is if we don't have the will or the skill or even the money that we need to reach children the most vulnerable children in the world with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine then pretty soon more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year there's absolutely no question these are children like Umar Umar is seven years old and he's from northern Nigeria he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters Umar also has polio Umar was paralyzed for Life his right leg was paralyzed in 2004 this leg his right leg now takes an awful beating because he has to half crawl because it's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends keep up with his brothers and sisters than to get up on his crutches and walk but um is a fantastic student he's an incredible kid as uh you you probably can't see the detail here but this is his report card and you'll see he's get perfect scores he got 100% in all the important things um like nursery rhymes for example there but um you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with with polio these days but it's not true Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances the reality of polio today is something very different polio strikes the poorest communities in the world it leaves their children paralyzed and it drags their families deeper into poverty because they're desperately searching and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have trying in vain to find a cure for their children we think children deserve better and so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago when people were saying that we should call it off the polio partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find Innovative new Solutions new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again in Northern India we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this so that we could guide our investments in vaccinator shelters so we could get to the millions of children on the coy River Basin where there were no other health services in Northern Nigeria the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and Community confidence and now they've even started using these devices speaking of cool technology these little devices little GIS trackers like this which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccin and then they can track them and at the end of the day they look and see did these guys get to every single Street every single house this is the kind of commitment now we're seeing to try and reach all of the children we'd been missing and in Afghanistan we're trying new approaches access negotiators working closely with the international Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child but as we tried these extraordinary things as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics we went back to the vaccine it's a 50-year-old vaccine and we thought surely we can make a better vaccine so that when they finally get to these kids we can have a better bang for our buck and this started an incredible collaboration with industry and within six months we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted just two years ago the last two types of polio in the world and on June the 9th 200 2009 we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine and it turned out to be a GameChanger danger the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had and we immediately started using this well in a couple of months we had to get it out of production and it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world and we didn't start with the easy places the first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from new technologies like this now here at T over the last couple of days I've I've seen people um challenging the audience again and again to uh to to believe in the impossible so um this morning at about 7 o'clock we decided that we try and drive Chris and the production crew here at berserk by um downloading all of our data from India again so that you could see something that's just unfolding today which proves that The Impossible Is Possible and only two years ago people were saying that this is imposs possible now remember Northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio utar Pradesh and bear 500,000 children every single month sanitation is terrible and our old vaccine you remember worked half as well as it should have and yet The Impossible is happening today marks exactly 6 months and for the first time in history not a single child has been paralyzed in utar Pradesh or Bear India is not unique in umar's home country of Nigeria a 95% reduction in the number of children Paralyzed by polio last year and in the last 6 months we've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history ladies and gentlemen with a combination of smart people smart technology and smart Investments polio can now be eradicated anywhere we have major challenges you can imagine to finish this job but as you've also seen it's doable it has great secondary benefits and polio eradication is a great buy and as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus it's a stark reminder that we are failing as a society to reach children with the most basic of services and for that reason polio eradication it's the ultimate in equity and it's the ultimate in social justice the huge social movement that's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children it's ready to reach them with bed nets with other things but capitalizing on their enthusiasm capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago finishing polio is a smart thing to do and it's the right thing to do now we're in tough times economically but as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio there's never a wrong time to do the right thing finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do and we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last 20 years we have a new vaccine we have new resolve and we have new tactics we have the chance to write an entirely new polio free chapter in human history but if we blink now we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease here's a great idea to spread and polio now help us tell the story help us build the momentum so that very soon every child every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio free life forever thank you well Bruce where do you think the toughest places are going to be where would you say we need to be the smartest the four places where where you saw that we've never stopped Northern Nigeria Northern India Southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan they're going to be the uh the toughest but the interesting thing is of those three India is looking real good as you just saw in the data and Afghanistan Afghanistan we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly it keeps getting reinfected so the tough ones are going to get top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished they're going to be the tough ones and what about the money give us a sense of of how much the campaign costs a year and is it easy uh to raise that money and what what's going to be like the next couple of years it's interesting we spend right now about $750 million to $800 million a year that's what it costs to reach 500 million children it sounds like a lot of money it is a lot of money but when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times 20 30 cents to reach a child that's not very much money but right now we don't have enough of that we have a big gap in that money we're cutting corners and every time we cut Corners more places get infected that shouldn't have and just slows us down and that great buy costs us a little bit more well hopefully we'll uh get the word out and the the governments will keep their generosity up so uh good luck we're all in this with you thank you thank [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] I want to share with you over the next 18 minutes um a pretty incredible idea actually it's a really big idea but to get us started I I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world now I bet in this audience you're thinking of some really incredible technology some stuff that I I I haven't even heard of them absolutely sure but I'm also sure pretty sure that absolutely nobody is thinking of this this is a polio vaccine and it's a great thing actually that nobody's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted this is a great technology we can take it completely for granted but it wasn't always that way even here in California if we were to go back just a few years it was a very different story people were terrified of this disease they were terrified of polio and it would cause public panic and it was because of scenes like this in this scene people are living in an iron lung these are people who were perfectly healthy 2 or 3 days before and then 2 days later they can no longer breathe and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs but also their breathing muscles and they were going to spend the rest of their lives usually in this iron lung to breathe for them this disease was terrifying there was no cure and there was no vaccine the disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary National effort to find a way to stop it 20 years later they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine it was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s finally a vaccine that could stop this awful disease and here in the United States it had an incredible impact as you can see the virus stopped and it stopped very very fast but this wasn't the case everywhere in the world and it happen so fast in the United States however that even just last month John Stewart said this is polio still active because I was I I thought that that had been eradicated in the way that small pox had been eradicated oops John Poli has almost been eradicated but the reality is that polio still exists today we made this map for John to try and show him exactly where polio still exists this is the picture there's not very much left in the world but the reason there's not very much left is because there's been an extraordinary public private partnership working behind the scenes almost unknown I'm sure to most of you here today it's been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease and it's got it down to this few cases that you can see here on this graphic but just last year we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio and this is the reason in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade on opposite sides of the globe there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks hundreds of people were paralyzed hundreds of people died children as well as adults and in both cases we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries they had come from thousands of miles away and in one case it originated on another continent and not only that but when they came into these countries then they got on Commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even further other places like Russia where for the first time in over a decade last year children were crippled and Paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you these are under control now and it looks like they uh they'll probably stop very very quickly but the message was very clear polio is still a devastating explosive disease it's just happening in another part of the world and our big idea is that the scientific Miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis so I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership the polio partnership is trying to do we're not trying to control polio we're not trying to get it down to just a few cases because this disease is like a root fire it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely so what we're looking for is a permanent solution we want a world in which every child just like you guys can take for granted a polio free world so we're looking for a permanent solution and this is where we get lucky this is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try and do something truly extraordinary this virus can only survive in people it can't live for a very long time in people it doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all and we've got pretty good vaccines as I just showed you so we are trying to wipe out this virus completely what the poo eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on earth now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this to eradicating diseases it's been tried six times in the last century and it's been successful exactly once and this is because disease eradication is still the venture capital of Public Health the risks are massive but the payoff economic humanitarian motivational it's absolutely huge one Congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the US put into small poox eradication pays itself off every 26 days in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs and if we can finish polio eradication the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone so those are the kind of stakes that we're after but small poox eradication was hard it was very very hard and polio eradication in many ways is even tougher and there's a few reasons for that the first is that when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with small pox and there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries so it was a massive effort the Second Challenge we had was in contrast to the small poox vaccine which was very stable and a single dose protected you for life the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile AG it deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put the special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child it's not potent it's not going to protect them even then kids need many doses of the vaccine but the third challenge we have and probably even bigger one the biggest challenge is that in contrast to small pox where you could always see your enemy every single person almost who is infected with small poox had this Telltale rash so you could get around the disease you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off polio it's almost completely different the vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease so you can't see the enemy most of the time and as a result we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with small poox we've had to create one of the largest social move movements in history there's over 10 million people probably 20 million people largely volunteers who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now uh been called the largest internationally coordinated operation in peacetime these people these 20 million people vaccinate over 500 million children every single year multiple times at the peak of our operations now giving the polio vaccine is simple just two drops like that but reaching 500 million people is much much tougher and these vaccinators these volunteers they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest densest Urban slums in the world they've got to track under sweltering Suns to some of the most remote difficult to reach places in the world and they also have to dodge bullets because we have got to operate during shaky ceasefires and trues to try and vaccinate children even in areas affected by conflict one reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about 5 years ago a place which has eradicated polio not once but twice because they got reinfected he was sitting on the side of the road watching one of these polio campaigns unfold and a few months later he wrote this is foreign aid at its most heroic and these Heroes they come from every Walk of Life all sorts of backgrounds but one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International this is a group whose million strong Army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years the right at the center of the whole thing now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication more than 15 years much longer than it should have but once it was built the results Were Striking within a couple of years every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses with the exception of four countries that you see here and it was in each of those was only part of the country and then by 1999 one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide proof of concept and then today there's been a 99% reduction greater than 99% reduction in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease when we started over 20 years ago 1,000 children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus last year it was 1,000 and at the same time the polio eradication program has been working to help in a lot of other areas it's been working to help control pandemic flu SARS for example it's also been trying to save children by doing other things giving vitamin A drops giving measel shots giving uh bed Nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us the International Community to reach every single child every single Community the most vulnerable people in the world with the most basic of Health Services irrespective of geography poverty culture and even conflict so things were looking very exciting and then about 5 years ago this virus this ancient virus started to fight back the first problem we ran into was that in these last four countries the strongholds of this virus we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out and then to make the matters even worse the virus started to spread out of these four places especially Northern India and Northern Nigeria into much of Africa Asia and even into Europe causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades and then in one of the most important tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have in conditions like this the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to now at that time there was a great as you can imagine frustration let's call it frustration it started to grow very very quickly and all of a sudden some very important voices in the world of Public Health started to say say hang on we should abandon this idea of eradication let's settle for control that's good enough now as seductive as the idea of control sounds it's a false premise the brutal truth is if we don't have the will or the skill or even the money that we need to reach children the most vulnerable children in the world with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine then pretty soon more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year there's absolutely no question these are children like Umar Umar is seven years old and he's from northern Nigeria he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters Umar also has polio Umar was paralyzed for Life his right leg was paralyzed in 2004 this leg his right leg now takes an awful beating because he has to half crawl because it's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends keep up with his brothers and sisters than to get up on his crutches and walk but um is a fantastic student he's an incredible kid as uh you you probably can't see the detail here but this is his report card and you'll see he's get perfect scores he got 100% in all the important things um like nursery rhymes for example there but um you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with with polio these days but it's not true Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances the reality of polio today is something very different polio strikes the poorest communities in the world it leaves their children paralyzed and it drags their families deeper into poverty because they're desperately searching and they're desperately spending the little

commitment now we're seeing to try and reach all of the children we'd been missing and in Afghanistan we're trying new approaches access negotiators working closely with the international Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child but as we tried these extraordinary things as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics we went back to the vaccine it's a

has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs but also their breathing muscles and they were going to spend the rest of their lives usually in this iron lung to breathe for them this disease was terrifying there was no cure and there was no vaccine the disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary National effort to find a way to stop it 20 years later they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine it was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s finally a vaccine that could stop this awful disease and here in the United States it had an incredible impact as you can see the virus stopped and it stopped very very fast but this wasn't the case everywhere in the world and it happen so fast in the United States however that even just last month John Stewart said this is polio still active because I was I I thought that that had been eradicated in the way that small pox had been eradicated oops John Poli has almost been eradicated but the reality is that polio still exists today we made this map for John to try and show him exactly where polio still exists this is the picture there's not very much left in the world but the reason there's not very much left is because there's been an extraordinary public private partnership working behind the scenes almost unknown I'm sure to most of you here today it's been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease and it's got it down to this few cases that you can see here on this graphic but just last year we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio and this is the reason in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade on opposite sides of the globe there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks hundreds of people were paralyzed hundreds of people died children as well as adults and in both cases we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries they had come from thousands of miles away and in one case it originated on another continent and not only that but when they came into these countries then they got on Commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even further other places like Russia where for the first time in over a decade last year children were crippled and Paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you these are under control now and it looks like they uh they'll probably stop very very quickly but the message was very clear polio is still a devastating explosive disease it's just happening in another part of the world and our big idea is that the scientific Miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis so I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership the polio partnership is trying to do we're not trying to control polio we're not trying to get it down to just a few cases because this disease is like a root fire it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely so what we're looking for is a permanent solution we want a world in which every child just like you guys can take for granted a polio free world so we're looking for a permanent solution and this is where we get lucky this is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try and do something truly extraordinary this virus can only survive in people it can't live for a very long time in people it doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all and we've got pretty good vaccines as I just showed you so we are trying to wipe out this virus completely what the poo eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on earth now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this to eradicating diseases it's been tried six times in the last century and it's been successful exactly once and this is because disease eradication is still the venture capital of Public Health the risks are massive but the payoff economic humanitarian motivational it's absolutely huge one Congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the US put into small poox eradication pays itself off every 26 days in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs and if we can finish polio eradication the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone so those are the kind of stakes that we're after but small poox eradication was hard it was very very hard and polio eradication in many ways is even tougher and there's a few reasons for that the first is that when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with small pox and there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries so it was a massive effort the Second Challenge we had was in contrast to the small poox vaccine which was very stable and a single dose protected you for life the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile AG it deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put the special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child it's not potent it's not going to protect them even then kids need many doses of the vaccine but the third challenge we have and probably even bigger one the biggest challenge is that in contrast to small pox where you could always see your enemy every single person almost who is infected with small poox had this Telltale rash so you could get around the disease you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off polio it's almost completely different the vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease so you can't see the enemy most of the time and as a result we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with small poox we've had to create one of the largest social move movements in history there's over 10 million people probably 20 million people largely volunteers who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now uh been called the largest internationally coordinated operation in peacetime these people these 20 million people vaccinate over 500 million children every single year multiple times at the peak of our operations now giving the polio vaccine is simple just two drops like that but reaching 500 million people is much much tougher and these vaccinators these volunteers they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest densest Urban slums in the world they've got to track under sweltering Suns to some of the most remote difficult to reach places in the world and they also have to dodge bullets because we have got to operate during shaky ceasefires and trues to try and vaccinate children even in areas affected by conflict one reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about 5 years ago a place which has eradicated polio not once but twice because they got reinfected he was sitting on the side of the road watching one of these polio campaigns unfold and a few months later he wrote this is foreign aid at its most heroic and these Heroes they come from every Walk of Life all sorts of backgrounds but one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International this is a group whose million strong Army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years the right at the center of the whole thing now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication more than 15 years much longer than it should have but once it was built the results Were Striking within a couple of years every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses with the exception of four countries that you see here and it was in each of those was only part of the country and then by 1999 one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide proof of concept and then today there's been a 99% reduction greater than 99% reduction in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease when we started over 20 years ago 1,000 children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus last year it was 1,000 and at the same time the polio eradication program has been working to help in a lot of other areas it's been working to help control pandemic flu SARS for example it's also been trying to save children by doing other things giving vitamin A drops giving measel shots giving uh bed Nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us the International Community to reach every single child every single Community the most vulnerable people in the world with the most basic of Health Services irrespective of geography poverty culture and even conflict so things were looking very exciting and then about 5 years ago this virus this ancient virus started to fight back the first problem we ran into was that in these last four countries the strongholds of this virus we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out and then to make the matters even worse the virus started to spread out of these four places especially Northern India and Northern Nigeria into much of Africa Asia and even into Europe causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades and then in one of the most important tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have in conditions like this the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to now at that time there was a great as you can imagine frustration let's call it frustration it started to grow very very quickly and all of a sudden some very important voices in the world of Public Health started to say say hang on we should abandon this idea of eradication let's settle for control that's good enough now as seductive as the idea of control sounds it's a false premise the brutal truth is if we don't have the will or the skill or even the money that we need to reach children the most vulnerable children in the world with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine then pretty soon more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year there's absolutely no question these are children like Umar Umar is seven years old and he's from northern Nigeria he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters Umar also has polio Umar was paralyzed for Life his right leg was paralyzed in 2004 this leg his right leg now takes an awful beating because he has to half crawl because it's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends keep up with his brothers and sisters than to get up on his crutches and walk but um is a fantastic student he's an incredible kid as uh you you probably can't see the detail here but this is his report card and you'll see he's get perfect scores he got 100% in all the important things um like nursery rhymes for example there but um you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with with polio these days but it's not true Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances the reality of polio today is something very different polio strikes the poorest communities in the world it leaves their children paralyzed and it drags their families deeper into poverty because they're desperately searching and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have trying in vain to find a cure for their children we think children deserve better and so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago when people were saying that we should call it off the polio partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find Innovative new Solutions new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again in Northern India we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this so that we could guide our investments in vaccinator shelters so we could get to the millions of children on the coy River Basin where there were no other health services in Northern Nigeria the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and Community confidence and now they've even started using these devices speaking of cool technology these little devices little GIS trackers like this which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccin and then they can track them and at the end of the day they look and see did these guys get to every single Street every single house this is the kind of commitment now we're seeing to try and reach all of the children we'd been missing and in Afghanistan we're trying new approaches access negotiators working closely with the international Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child but as we tried these extraordinary things as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics we went back to the vaccine it's a 50-year-old vaccine and we thought surely we can make a better vaccine so that when they finally get to these kids we can have a better bang for our buck and this started an incredible collaboration with industry and within six months we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted just two years ago the last two types of polio in the world and on June the 9th 200 2009 we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine and it turned out to be a GameChanger danger the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had and we immediately started using this well in a couple of months we had to get it out of production and it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world and we didn't start with the easy places the first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from new technologies like this now here at T over the last couple of days I've I've seen people um challenging the audience again and again to uh to to believe in the impossible so um this morning at about 7 o'clock we decided that we try and drive Chris and the production crew here at berserk by um downloading all of our data from India again so that you could see something that's just unfolding today which proves that The Impossible Is Possible and only two years ago people were saying that this is imposs possible now remember Northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio utar Pradesh and bear 500,000 children every single month sanitation is terrible and our old vaccine you remember worked half as well as it should have and yet The Impossible is happening today marks exactly 6 months and for the first time in history not a single child has been paralyzed in utar Pradesh or Bear India is not unique in umar's home country of Nigeria a 95% reduction in the number of children Paralyzed by polio last year and in the last 6 months we've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history ladies and gentlemen with a combination of smart people smart technology and smart Investments polio can now be eradicated anywhere we have major challenges you can imagine to finish this job but as you've also seen it's doable it has great secondary benefits and polio eradication is a great buy and as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus it's a stark reminder that we are failing as a society to reach children with the most basic of services and for that reason polio eradication it's the ultimate in equity and it's the ultimate in social justice the huge social movement that's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children it's ready to reach them with bed nets with other things but capitalizing on their enthusiasm capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago finishing polio is a smart thing to do and it's the right thing to do now we're in tough times economically but as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio there's never a wrong time to do the right thing finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do and we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last 20 years we have a new vaccine we have new resolve and we have new tactics we have the chance to write an entirely new polio free chapter in human history but if we blink now we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease here's a great idea to spread and polio now help us tell the story help us build the momentum so that very soon every child every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio free life forever thank you well Bruce where do you think the toughest places are going to be where would you say we need to be the smartest the four places where where you saw that we've never stopped Northern Nigeria Northern India Southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan they're going to be the uh the toughest but the interesting thing is of those three India is looking real good as you just saw in the data and Afghanistan Afghanistan we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly it keeps getting reinfected so the tough ones are going to get top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished they're going to be the tough ones and what about the money give us a sense of of how much the campaign costs a year and is it easy uh to raise that money and what what's going to be like the next couple of years it's interesting we spend right now about $750 million to $800 million a year that's what it costs to reach 500 million children it sounds like a lot of money it is a lot of money but when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times 20 30 cents to reach a child that's not very much money but right now we don't have enough of that we have a big gap in that money we're cutting corners and every time we cut Corners more places get infected that shouldn't have and just slows us down and that great buy costs us a little bit more well hopefully we'll uh get the word out and the the governments will keep their generosity up so uh good luck we're all in this with you thank you thank [Applause] you

[Music] [Music] [Applause] I want to share with you over the next 18 minutes um a pretty incredible idea actually it's a really big idea but to get us started I I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world now I bet in this audience you're thinking of some really incredible technology some stuff that I I I haven't even heard of them absolutely sure but I'm also sure pretty sure that absolutely nobody is thinking of this this is a polio vaccine and it's a great thing actually that nobody's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted this is a great technology we can take it completely for granted but it wasn't always that way even here in California if we were to go back just a few years it was a very different story people were terrified of this disease they were terrified of polio and it would cause public panic and it was because of scenes like this in this scene people are living in an iron lung these are people who were perfectly healthy 2 or 3 days before and then 2 days later they can no longer breathe and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs but also their breathing muscles and they were going to spend the rest of their lives usually in this iron lung to breathe for them this disease was terrifying there was no cure and there was no vaccine the disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary National effort to find a way to stop it 20 years

an incredible impact as you can see the virus stopped and it stopped very very fast but this wasn't the case everywhere in the world and it happen so fast in the United States however that even just last month John Stewart said this is polio still active because I was I I thought that that had been eradicated in the way that small pox had been eradicated oops John Poli has almost been eradicated but the reality is that polio still exists today we made this map for John to try and show him exactly where polio still exists this is the picture there's not very much left in the world but the reason there's not very much left is because there's been an extraordinary public private partnership working behind the scenes almost unknown I'm sure to most of you here today it's been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease and it's got it down to this few cases that you can see here on this graphic but just last year we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just

but the message was very clear polio is still a devastating explosive disease it's just happening in another part of the world and our big idea is that the scientific Miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis so I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership the polio partnership is trying to do we're not trying to control polio we're not trying to get it down to just a few cases because this disease is like a root fire it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely so what we're looking for is a permanent solution we want a world in

kind of stakes that we're after but small poox eradication was hard it was very very hard and polio eradication in many ways is even tougher and there's a few reasons for that the first is that when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with small pox and there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries so it was a massive effort the Second Challenge we had was in contrast to the small poox vaccine which was very stable and a single dose protected you for life the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile AG it deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put the special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child it's not potent it's not going to protect them even then kids need many doses of the vaccine but the third challenge we have and probably even bigger one the biggest challenge is that in contrast to small pox where you could always see your enemy every single person almost who is infected with small poox had this Telltale rash so you could get around the disease you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off polio it's almost completely different the vast majority of people who are infected

control that's good enough now as seductive as the idea of control sounds it's a false premise the brutal truth is if we don't have the will or the skill or even the money that we need to reach children the most vulnerable children in the world with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine then pretty soon more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year there's absolutely no question these are children like Umar Umar is seven years old and he's from northern Nigeria he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters Umar also has polio Umar was paralyzed for Life his right leg was paralyzed in 2004 this leg his right leg now takes an awful beating because he has to half crawl because it's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends keep up with his brothers and sisters than to get up on his crutches and walk but um is a fantastic student he's an incredible kid as uh you you probably can't see the detail here but this is his report card and you'll see he's get perfect scores he got 100% in all the important things um like nursery rhymes for example there but um you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with with polio these days but it's not true Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances the reality of polio today is something very different polio strikes the

with the easy places the first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from new technologies like this now here at T over the last couple of days I've I've seen people um challenging the audience again and again to uh to to believe in the impossible so um this morning at about 7 o'clock we decided that we try and drive Chris and the production crew here at berserk by um downloading all of our data from India again so that you could see something that's just unfolding today which proves that The Impossible Is Possible and only two years ago people were saying that this is imposs possible now remember Northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio utar Pradesh and bear 500,000 children every single month sanitation is terrible and our old vaccine you remember worked half as well as it should have and yet The Impossible is happening today marks exactly 6 months and for the first time in history not a single child has been paralyzed in utar Pradesh or Bear India is not unique in umar's home country of Nigeria a 95% reduction in the number of children Paralyzed by polio last year and in the last 6 months we've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history ladies and gentlemen with a combination of smart people smart technology and smart Investments polio can now be eradicated anywhere we have major challenges you can imagine to finish this job but as you've also seen it's doable it has great secondary benefits and polio eradication is a great buy and as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus it's a stark reminder that we are failing as a society to reach children with the most basic of services and for that reason polio eradication it's the ultimate in equity and it's the ultimate in social justice the huge social movement that's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children it's ready to reach them with bed nets with other things but capitalizing on their enthusiasm capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago finishing polio is a smart thing to do and it's the right thing to do now we're in tough times economically but as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio there's never a wrong time to do the right thing finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do and we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last 20 years we have a new vaccine we have new resolve and we have new tactics we have the chance to write an entirely new polio free chapter in human history but if we blink now we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease here's a great idea to spread and polio now help us tell the story help us build the momentum so that very soon every child every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio free life forever thank you well Bruce where do you think the toughest places are going to be where would you say we need to be the smartest the four places where where you saw that we've never stopped Northern Nigeria Northern India Southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan they're going to be the uh the toughest but the interesting thing is of those three India is looking real good as you just saw in the data and Afghanistan Afghanistan we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly it keeps getting reinfected so the tough ones are going to get top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished they're going to be the tough ones and what about the money give us a sense of of how much the campaign costs a year and is it easy uh to raise that money and what what's going to be like the next couple of years it's interesting we spend right now about $750 million to $800 million a year that's what it costs to reach 500 million children it sounds like a lot of money it is a lot of money but when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times 20 30 cents to reach a child that's not very much money but right now we don't have enough of that we have a big gap in that money we're cutting corners and every time we cut Corners more places get infected that shouldn't have and just slows us down and that great buy costs us a little bit more well hopefully we'll uh get the word out and the the governments will keep their generosity up so uh good luck we're all in this with you thank you thank [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
Hi, everybody! I am a comparative anatomist. A comparative anatomist is someone
who studies the structure of the body of lots of different animals. And my favorite animals are whales. I like to study whales
because they're so interesting. They've adapted to a unique environment
of living in the water. And what I'm going to tell you
about is how whales make sounds by basically farting with their face. You know that they do this farting thing
with their blowhole; they blow out air like that, but they also use air
in lots of other ways. They use it for sound production,
which is what I'll focus on, but I also study other things
they do with air, like keep it out of their bloodstream
so they don't get bubbles, which is what happens
to human scuba divers when they get decompression sickness. But I'd like to start with the story of how these animals make
these farting noises, and that story begins with understanding
how hard it is to look at whales, because they live underwater
and they're really big, so they're hard animals to study. And in this picture --
you see that animal in the middle? That's a baby whale
and it's already the size of a bus! When you look at whales,
start with the top of their head because their nose
is on the top of their head, kind of like a built-in snorkel. They breathe through that
because they're mammals and mammals breathe air. Their nose can be opened and closed, as if you were to pinch it like this. You can see it's open in the bottom frame,
where the red arrows are. But not all whales have two nostrils. Whales include the groups
of dolphins and porpoises, and dolphins and porpoises,
the small whales, have only one nostril
on the top of their head, and they open and close that nostril by taking what is essentially
an upper lip, like this, and turning it back
over their nose, like this. That's how they open and close their nose. So when they make sounds, what they're basically
doing is a raspberry, (Makes raspberry sound)
which is kind of like a fart, right? Or up in New York,
we call it a Bronx cheer. And the way they do that is by taking that big,
fatty structure of a big fat lip, which, as you can see
here in this picture, which is a cut through the middle
of a dolphin's head, that big fat lip is that big
yellow portion there, and they roll it back and forth
over the top of their nose so that they vibrate it, kind of like when you let
the air out of a balloon and it makes that weird vibration sound. So this is what it sounds like
when they make their noise: (Vibration noise) Hear it? He'll do it again
when he faces the camera. (Vibration noise) Sounds like it's farting underwater. What that dolphin is actually doing,
though, is echolocation, which is making these series of pulses, and it uses it like a bat uses sonar. Well, a bat uses radar,
but when it's underwater it's sonar, so this animal is using sonar
to see its world in sound. Trying to understand how this works,
you have to look at it as if you were looking at the amplifier
speakers of a sound system. The small-toothed whales
are basically the "tweeters," and the sound is coming
from that little nose that's moving back and forth
and coming out of their forehead. But the big whales
are kind of like the "woofers," the big speakers that you have
in an amplifier system. And what's happening is their sound
is coming out of the throat. So if you tried to make
sound like a whale -- make a sound right now, and go, "ahhhhhh." OK, now put your hand on your throat,
on your Adam's apple. You feel that vibration right there? That is lost energy for you, because that's not
how you communicate to everybody. You do it out of the mouth. But if you open your mouth underwater,
no one will hear you. You have to be able to take this energy
and amplify it through the water. That's what whales do. And when you hear their sound -- (Squeaking sound) it's kind of like when you squeak
the air out of a balloon. So they get a lot of squeaky noises, but they also have this sound: (Vibrating sound) It sounds like it's farting, doesn't it? It's like it's got this giant
whoopee cushion in its throat. So, how do you know
that's what a whale is doing? Well, we study whales that come
to us from strandings. These are animals that die on the beach. Small whales like dolphins
and porpoises are easy; we can take them to the lab. But the big whales -- we've got
to bring the lab to the whale. And this is what that looks like. I'm the one in the middle
with the red hat. I'm not a very tall person, so you can see how big
this whale was compared to me. The whale is 65 feet long. And my scalpel is this little tool
on the side here. It basically looks like a hockey stick
with a blade on the end of it. And doing a dissection of a whale
is a very difficult process. You literally have to get into your work. It's kind of like a giant
bloody construction zone. You're wearing a hard hat, you're working with heavy machinery. In this case, by the way, that's just the voice box of a blue whale. Just the voice box. I'm only five feet tall --
you can see it's like 12 feet long. How do we know what's going on? Well, we look at the voice box, or larynx, and we see -- this is from a baby
whale so it's much smaller. You see this little u-shaped thing
I've outlined in blue. That's the part that's vibrating. It's kind of like our vocal folds. When I put my hand in there,
where that blue sleeve is, you can see there's a sack underneath it. That's the whoopee cushion. That's the air bubble or the balloon. So what these animals are doing -- and you can see, there's this big
black balloon in the throat, where the digestive tract,
which is in blue, meets the breathing tract,
which is in light blue, and right in the middle
is that black sack. These animals are using
that sack to make these sounds. And so they vibrate that and send it out. Small-toothed whales also have air sacks;
they're all over their heads, so it's like they're airheads. They use this to capture
as much air as they can to take down with them
when they're diving, because when you dive, pressures increase, and that decreases the volume
of air you have available. But more importantly, having that sack allows them
to recycle the air that they're using, because air is a precious commodity. You don't want to have to go
back up to the surface to get more. So when you make a sound underwater,
if you're a whale -- let's hear you start making
a sound, go "ahhhh." But whales keep their mouths
closed, so go "ahhhmm." (Audience makes noise) You're all humming, right? But whales keep their nose
closed and go, "mmmm." (Makes noise) What happened? You can't make the sound anymore
once you close your nose because you've pressurized the system. Whales, by having air sacks, keep
themselves from pressurizing the system, which means the air continues to flow, and so if you had a bag
on the end of your nose, you'd be able to make
air continue to flow. So I hope you've enjoyed that. That's what a comparative anatomist
does for a living. We study the structure of these animals. We try to mimic it; we apply it
back to the human situation, maybe making new technologies
for protective devices or maybe even making
new treatments for medicines for people's diseases who mimic
these weird environments. So I hope you enjoyed that. Thank you. (Applause)

the air out of a balloon and it makes that weird vibration sound. So this is what it sounds like
when they make their noise: (Vibration noise) Hear it? He'll do it again
when he faces the camera. (Vibration noise) Sounds like it's farting underwater. What that dolphin is actually doing,
though, is echolocation, which is making these series of pulses, and it uses it like a bat uses sonar. Well, a bat uses radar,
but when it's underwater it's sonar, so this animal is using sonar
to see its world in sound. Trying to understand how this works,
you have to look at it as if you were looking at the amplifier
speakers of a sound system. The small-toothed whales
are basically the "tweeters," and the sound is coming
from that little nose that's moving back and forth
and coming out of their forehead. But the big whales
are kind of like the "woofers," the big speakers that you have
in an amplifier system. And what's happening is their sound
is coming out of the throat. So if you tried to make
sound like a whale -- make a sound right now, and go, "ahhhhhh." OK, now put your hand on your throat,
on your Adam's apple. You feel that vibration right there? That is lost energy for you, because that's not
how you communicate to everybody. You do it out of the mouth. But if you open your mouth underwater,
no one will hear you. You have to be able to take this energy
and amplify it through the water. That's what whales do. And when you hear their sound -- (Squeaking sound) it's kind of like when you squeak
the air out of a balloon. So they get a lot of squeaky noises, but they also have this sound: (Vibrating sound) It sounds like it's farting, doesn't it? It's like it's got this giant
whoopee cushion in its throat. So, how do you know
that's what a whale is doing? Well, we study whales that come
to us from strandings. These are animals that die on the beach. Small whales like dolphins
and porpoises are easy; we can take them to the lab. But the big whales -- we've got
to bring the lab to the whale. And this is what that looks like. I'm the one in the middle
with the red hat. I'm not a very tall person, so you can see how big
this whale was compared to me. The whale is 65 feet long. And my scalpel is this little tool
on the side here. It basically looks like a hockey stick
with a blade on the end of it. And doing a dissection of a whale
is a very difficult process. You literally have to get into your work. It's kind of like a giant
bloody construction zone. You're wearing a hard hat, you're working with heavy machinery. In this case, by the way, that's just the voice box of a blue whale. Just the voice box. I'm only five feet tall --
you can see it's like 12 feet long. How do we know what's going on? Well, we look at the voice box, or larynx, and we see -- this is from a baby
whale so it's much smaller. You see this little u-shaped thing
I've outlined in blue. That's the part that's vibrating. It's kind of like our vocal folds. When I put my hand in there,
where that blue sleeve is, you can see there's a sack underneath it. That's the whoopee cushion. That's the air bubble or the balloon. So what these animals are doing -- and you can see, there's this big
black balloon in the throat, where the digestive tract,
which is in blue, meets the breathing tract,
which is in light blue, and right in the middle
is that black sack. These animals are using
that sack to make these sounds. And so they vibrate that and send it out. Small-toothed whales also have air sacks;
they're all over their heads, so it's like they're airheads. They use this to capture
as much air as they can to take down with them
when they're diving, because when you dive, pressures increase, and that decreases the volume
of air you have available. But more importantly, having that sack allows them
to recycle the air that they're using, because air is a precious commodity. You don't want to have to go
back up to the surface to get more. So when you make a sound underwater,
if you're a whale -- let's hear you start making
a sound, go "ahhhh." But whales keep their mouths
closed, so go "ahhhmm." (Audience makes noise) You're all humming, right? But whales keep their nose
closed and go, "mmmm." (Makes noise) What happened? You can't make the sound anymore
once you close your nose because you've pressurized the system. Whales, by having air sacks, keep
themselves from pressurizing the system, which means the air continues to flow, and so if you had a bag
on the end of your nose, you'd be able to make
air continue to flow. So I hope you've enjoyed that. That's what a comparative anatomist
does for a living. We study the structure of these animals. We try to mimic it; we apply it
back to the human situation, maybe making new technologies
for protective devices or maybe even making
new treatments for medicines for people's diseases who mimic
these weird environments. So I hope you enjoyed that. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Hi, everybody! I am a comparative anatomist. A comparative anatomist is someone
who studies the structure of the body of lots of different animals. And my favorite animals are whales. I like to study whales
because they're so interesting. They've adapted to a unique environment
of living in the water. And what I'm going to tell you
about is how whales make sounds by basically farting with their face. You know that they do this farting thing
with their blowhole; they blow out air like that, but they also use air
in lots of other ways. They use it for sound production,
which is what I'll focus on, but I also study other things
they do with air, like keep it out of their bloodstream
so they don't get bubbles, which is what happens
to human scuba divers when they get decompression sickness. But I'd like to start with the story of how these animals make
these farting noises, and that story begins with understanding
how hard it is to look at whales, because they live underwater
and they're really big, so they're hard animals to study. And in this picture --
you see that animal in the middle? That's a baby whale
and it's already the size of a bus! When you look at whales,
start with the top of their head because their nose
is on the top of their head, kind of like a built-in snorkel. They breathe through that
because they're mammals and mammals breathe air. Their nose can be opened and closed, as if you were to pinch it like this. You can see it's open in the bottom frame,
where the red arrows are. But not all whales have two nostrils. Whales include the groups
of dolphins and porpoises, and dolphins and porpoises,
the small whales, have only one nostril
on the top of their head, and they open and close that nostril by taking what is essentially
an upper lip, like this, and turning it back
over their nose, like this. That's how they open and close their nose. So when they make sounds, what they're basically
doing is a raspberry, (Makes raspberry sound)
which is kind of like a fart, right? Or up in New York,
we call it a Bronx cheer. And the way they do that is by taking that big,
fatty structure of a big fat lip, which, as you can see
here in this picture, which is a cut through the middle
of a dolphin's head, that big fat lip is that big
yellow portion there, and they roll it back and forth
over the top of their nose so that they vibrate it, kind of like when you let
the air out of a balloon and it makes that weird vibration sound. So this is what it sounds like
when they make their noise: (Vibration noise) Hear it? He'll do it again
when he faces the camera. (Vibration noise) Sounds like it's farting underwater. What that dolphin is actually doing,
