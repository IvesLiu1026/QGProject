**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] I'm a Sant or more precisely a high functioning autistic Sant it's a rare condition and uh where still when accompanied as in my case by self-awareness and a Mastery of language very often when I meet someone and they learn this about me there's a certain kind of awkwardness I can see it in their eyes they want to ask me something and in the end quite often the urge is stronger than they are and they blurted out if I give you my date of birth can you tell me what day of the week I was born on or they mention cube roots or um ask me to recite a long number or a long text I hope you'll forgive me if I don't perform a kind of one man Sant show for you today I uh am going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots a little deeper and a lot closer to my mind and work I want to talk to you briefly about perception when he was writing the plays and the short stories that would make his name Anton COV kept a notebook in which he noted down his observations of the world around him little details that other people seem to miss every time I recheck of and his unique vision of human life I'm reminded of why I too became a writer in my books I explore the nature of perception and how different kinds of perceiving create different kinds of knowing and understanding here are three questions drawn from my work rather than try to figure them out I'm going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your heart as you look at them for example the calculation can you feel where on a number line the solution is likely to fall or look at the foreign word and the sounds can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it's pointing you towards and in terms of the line of poetry why does the poet use the word hair rather than rabbit I'm asking you to do this because I believe that our personal perceptions you see are at the heart of how we acquire knowledge aesthetic judgments rather than abstract reasoning guide and shape the process by which we all come to know what we know I'm an extremist example of this my worlds of words and numbers blare with color emotion and personality as Juan said it's a condition that scientists call synesthesia an unusual cross talk between the senses here are the numbers 1 to 12 as I see them every number with its own shape and character one is is a flash of bright light six is a tiny and very sad black hole the sketches are in black and white here but in my mind they have colors three is green four is blue five is yellow I paint as well and here is one of my paintings it's a multiplication of two prime numbers three dimensional shapes and the space they create in the middle creates a new shape the answer to the sum what about bigger numbers well you can't get much bigger than Pi the mathematical constant it's an infinite number literally goes on forever in this painting that I made of the first 20 decimals of pi I take the colors And the emotions and the textures and I pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape but it's not only numbers that I see in colors words too for me have colors and emotions and textures and this is an opening phrase from the novel Lolita and narof was himself synesthetic and you can see here how my perception of the the sound L helps the alliteration to jump right out another example a little bit more mathematical and I wonder if some of you will notice the construction of the sentence from The Great Gatsby there is a procession of syllables wheat one prairies two lost swed towns three one 1 2 3 and this effect is very pleasant on the mind and it helps the sentence to feel right let's go back to the questions I posed you a moment ago um 64 multiplied by 75 if someone of you play chess you'll know that 64 is a square number and that's why chess boards 8 by 8 have 64 squares so that gives us a form that we can picture that we can perceive what about 75 well if 100 if we think of 100 as being like a square 75 would look like this so what we need to do now is put those two pictures together in our mind something like this 64 comes 6,400 and in the right hand corner you don't have to calculate anything four across four up and down it's 16 so what the sum is actually asking you to do is 16 16 16 that's a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do maths I'm sure it's uh 16 16 16 48 4800 4,8 00 the answer to the sum easier when you know how the second question was an Icelandic word I'm assuming there are not many people here who speak Icelandic so let me narrow the choices down to twoin is it a happy word or a sad word what do you say happy okay some people say it's happy most people a majority of people say sad and it actually mean sad why do statistically a majority of people say that a word is sad in this case heavy in other cases in my theory language evolves in such a way that sound match correspond with the subjective with the personal intuitive experience of The Listener let's have a look at the the third question it's a line from a poem by John Keat words like numbers Express fundamental relationships between objects and events and forces that constitute our world it stands to reason that we existing in this world should in the course of Our Lives absorb intuitively those relationships and Poets like other artists play with those intuitive understandings in the case of hair it's an ambiguous sound in English it can also mean the fibers that grow from our head and if we think of that we put the picture up the fibers represent vulnerability uh they yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion so um what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension the hair itself the animal not the cat not a dog a hair why a hair because think of the picture not the word the picture the overlong ears the overlarge feet helps us to picture to feel intuitively what it means to limp and to tremble so in these few minutes I hope I've been able to share a little bit of my vision of things and to show you that words can have colors and emotions numbers shapes and personalities the world is richer vaster than it too often seems to be I hope that that uh I've given you the desire to learn to see the world with new eyes thank you

**Transcript**:
We like to think of romantic feelings as spontaneous and indescribable
things that come from the heart. But it's actually your brain running a complex series of calculations
within a matter of seconds that's responsible
for determining attraction. Doesn't sound quite as poetic, does it? But just because the calculations
are happening in your brain doesn't mean those warm,
fuzzy feelings are all in your head. In fact, all five
of your senses play a role, each able to vote for,
or veto, a budding attraction. The eyes are the first
components in attraction. Many visual beauty standards vary
between cultures and eras, and signs of youth,
fertility and good health, such as long lustrous hair, or smooth, scar-free skin, are almost always in demand because they're associated
with reproductive fitness. And when the eyes spot
something they like, our instinct is to move closer so the other senses can investigate. The nose's contribution to romance is more than noticing perfume or cologne. It's able to pick up
on natural chemical signals known as pheromones. These not only convey important physical or genetic information
about their source but are able to activate a physiological
or behavioral response in the recipient. In one study, a group of women at different points
in their ovulation cycles wore the same T-shirts for three nights. After male volunteers
were randomly assigned to smell either one of the worn shirts,
or a new unworn one, saliva samples showed
an increase in testosterone in those who had smelled a shirt worn
by an ovulating woman. Such a testosterone boost may give a man the nudge to pursue a woman he might not have otherwise noticed. A woman's nose is particularly attuned to MHC molecules,
which are used to fight disease. In this case, opposites attract. When a study asked women to smell T-shirts
that had been worn by different men, they preferred the odors of those
whose MHC molecules differed from theirs. This makes sense. Genes that result in a greater
variety of immunities may give offspring
a major survival advantage. Our ears also determine attraction. Men prefer females
with high-pitched, breathy voices, and wide formant spacing,
correlated with smaller body size. While women prefer low-pitched voices
with a narrow formant spacing that suggest a larger body size. And not surprisingly, touch turns out to be crucial for romance. In this experiment,
not realizing the study had begun, participants were asked
to briefly hold the coffee, either hot or iced. Later, the participants read a story
about a hypothetical person, and were asked to rate their personality. Those who had held the hot cup of coffee perceived the person
in the story as happier, more social, more generous
and better-natured than those who had held
the cup of iced coffee, who rated the person as cold,
stoic, and unaffectionate. If a potential mate has managed
to pass all these tests, there's still one more: the infamous first kiss, a rich and complex exchange
of tactile and chemical cues, such as the smell of one's breath, and the taste of their mouth. This magical moment is so critical
that a majority of men and women have reported losing
their attraction to someone after a bad first kiss. Once attraction is confirmed,
your bloodstream is flooded with norepinephrine, activating your fight or flight system. Your heart beats faster, your pupils dilate, and your body releases glucose
for additional energy, not because you're in danger
but because your body is telling you that something important is happening. To help you focus, norepinephrine creates
a sort of tunnel vision, blocking out surrounding distractions, possibly even warping your sense of time, and enhancing your memory. This might explain why people
never forget their first kiss. The idea of so much of our attraction being influenced by chemicals
and evolutionary biology may seem cold and scientific
rather than romantic, but the next time
you see someone you like, try to appreciate how your entire body
is playing matchmaker to decide if that beautiful
stranger is right for you.

**Transcript**:
We like to think of romantic feelings as spontaneous and indescribable
things that come from the heart. But it's actually your brain running a complex series of calculations
within a matter of seconds that's responsible
for determining attraction. Doesn't sound quite as poetic, does it? But just because the calculations
are happening in your brain doesn't mean those warm,
fuzzy feelings are all in your head. In fact, all five
of your senses play a role, each able to vote for,
or veto, a budding attraction. The eyes are the first
components in attraction. Many visual beauty standards vary
between cultures and eras, and signs of youth,
fertility and good health, such as long lustrous hair, or smooth, scar-free skin, are almost always in demand because they're associated
with reproductive fitness. And when the eyes spot
something they like, our instinct is to move closer so the other senses can investigate. The nose's contribution to romance is more than noticing perfume or cologne. It's able to pick up
on natural chemical signals known as pheromones. These not only convey important physical or genetic information
about their source but are able to activate a physiological
or behavioral response in the recipient. In one study, a group of women at different points
in their ovulation cycles wore the same T-shirts for three nights. After male volunteers
were randomly assigned to smell either one of the worn shirts,
or a new unworn one, saliva samples showed
an increase in testosterone in those who had smelled a shirt worn
by an ovulating woman. Such a testosterone boost may give a man the nudge to pursue a woman he might not have otherwise noticed. A woman's nose is particularly attuned to MHC molecules,
which are used to fight disease. In this case, opposites attract. When a study asked women to smell T-shirts
that had been worn by different men, they preferred the odors of those
whose MHC molecules differed from theirs. This makes sense. Genes that result in a greater
variety of immunities may give offspring
a major survival advantage. Our ears also determine attraction. Men prefer females
with high-pitched, breathy voices, and wide formant spacing,
correlated with smaller body size. While women prefer low-pitched voices
with a narrow formant spacing that suggest a larger body size. And not surprisingly, touch turns out to be crucial for romance. In this experiment,
not realizing the study had begun, participants were asked
to briefly hold the coffee, either hot or iced. Later, the participants read a story
about a hypothetical person, and were asked to rate their personality. Those who had held the hot cup of coffee perceived the person
in the story as happier, more social, more generous
and better-natured than those who had held
the cup of iced coffee, who rated the person as cold,
stoic, and unaffectionate. If a potential mate has managed
to pass all these tests, there's still one more: the infamous first kiss, a rich and complex exchange
of tactile and chemical cues, such as the smell of one's breath, and the taste of their mouth. This magical moment is so critical
that a majority of men and women have reported losing
their attraction to someone after a bad first kiss. Once attraction is confirmed,
your bloodstream is flooded with norepinephrine, activating your fight or flight system. Your heart beats faster, your pupils dilate, and your body releases glucose
for additional energy, not because you're in danger
but because your body is telling you that something important is happening. To help you focus, norepinephrine creates
a sort of tunnel vision, blocking out surrounding distractions, possibly even warping your sense of time, and enhancing your memory. This might explain why people
never forget their first kiss. The idea of so much of our attraction being influenced by chemicals
and evolutionary biology may seem cold and scientific
rather than romantic, but the next time
you see someone you like, try to appreciate how your entire body
is playing matchmaker to decide if that beautiful
stranger is right for you.

**Transcript**:
I'm going to tell you a fable. A king, growing old, has two daughters and wants to partition his land. He goes to his counsellor and says 'Counsellor, I have four pieces of land and two daughters and I want to partition my land equally amongst my daughters. My surveyor says that the land masses I have are of this shape: I have one triangular piece of land and it has a square angle here. 'A right angle' says the counsellor, 'you have a right angled triangle.'
'Ahh a right angled triangle. And then I have a square piece of land whose edge is the side of the longest side of my triangle. And I have another whose edge is the side of this side of the triangle; and a third the side of this side of the triangle. The surveyor tells me they're all squares.' The counsellor says 
'Oh, no problem, don't be one of these foolish kings who gives away all your land. Keep that triangular piece for yourself, give the largest square to one of your daughters and the two small squares to the other daughter, it'll be perfectly even.' 'That's easy!' since the king and he's about to leave but then says
'Counsellor, I haven't told you anything about how long the sides of these squares are, or the shape of the triangle'
Counsellor says 'Don't worry. What we have here is three squares, one triangle. If the edges of these pieces of land are doubled all the areas get multiplied by four, if they're tripled all the areas get multiplied by nine, that's three squared. If you changed all the lengths of your figures by some factor the area is changed by the square of the factor and so the proportions are exactly the same.' Counsellor says 
'This is called scaling and similarity. If you scale your figures in this way you get similar figures, scaling a length by some factor scales the area by the square.' 
'Wonderful!' says the King. King walks away but even before he leaves the room he says 'But I didn't tell you what the angles were 
of the triangle.' Counsellor says 'Uh, that doesn't matter. What we have here is something called the Pythagorean theorem; it doesn't matter what the angles are as long as one of those angles is a right angle.' King leaves. Returns the next day distraught and says 'My surveyor tells me I don't have squares I have things that he called blobs! That is I have a triangle, a right angled triangle, I have three fields each landmass has one linear edge - the linear edge equal to the edge of the corresponding edge of the triangle - and he also tells me that my blobs are similar. If I scale any one of these blobs appropriately it will become any of the others. Now what do I do?' asks the King apprehensively and the counsellor says 'No problem. Do exactly as before. You keep your triangle, give the larger- largest blob mass to one of your daughters and the other two to the other daughter and it'll be even Steven.
The king is amazed. He says 'It doesn't matter what blob they are as long as they're similar?' 
Counsellor says yes. 'What do you call that?' 
says the King. 'Oh I call that the blob Pythagorean theorem.' 'For every blob there's a blob Pythagorean theorem?' says the King' 'Strange.' The counsellor says 
'Yes, and not only that but if you know the blob Pythagorean theorem for any blob you know it for every blob.' The king says 'How? How can that be?' 
Well the counsellor says 'Look, look at this: you have three blobs here, imagine that there's what I'll call a unit blob, that's to say a blob that's similar to it but its length is 1. Let us say the length of its straight edge is 1. 
Why then, if the length of this straight edge is c and the length of this straight edge is a and the length of this straight edge is b, then we know that whatever area this blob has - what do you call the
area of that blob? Capital A, the area 
of the unit blob. The area of this blob is the square of the factor that one needs in order to scale the unit blob to it, so the area will be c squared times A. The area of this will be a squared times A and the area this will be b squared times A. So if I prove to you that for some blob with some area A, this large blob is the sum in area of the areas of these two small ones, what I will have shown is c squared times A is equal to a squared times A plus b squared times A; and cancelling out the A's I have c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared and so if you give me any other blob I will get exactly the same result.' 'So one blob Pythagorean theorem implies Pythagorean theorem for all blobs?' says the King and he leaves sort of contented. King
comes in, day three, and he says 'It's wonderful what you've told me, what you've explained to me, but can you show me the blob Pythagorean theorem for some blob in which case I'll know it for all?' Counsellor says 'Oh well, for that you have to draw me a right-angled triangle.' And the counsellor says 'Ah well, so my job then would be to produce a blob with a linear side of length c, a blob with a linear side of length b, that blob being similar to the blob of length c, and a blob with length a similar for the other two; and then I will have to show you that the area of the larger- largest of these blobs is the sum of the area of the other two blobs.' The king says 'Well, yes, this might be quite a chore.' The counsellor
says 'Well, try this-' Counsellor draws a
single line which meets the large side in a right angle. And then steps back and says 
'There you are.' 'Where am I?' says the king. 
'The blob whose linear edge is c is the entire triangle. The blob whose linear edge is b is the triangle to the right. The blob whose linear edge is a is the triangle to the
left. All these triangles are right-angled triangles because one of their angles is a right angle. Each of these triangles have another angle in common; for example this large triangle has this angle in common with this one, and it has this angle in common with this one. All three right angle triangles are similar. So those are my three blobs and to see that the sum of the two small blobs is equal to the large blob is evident.' King says 'Ah.' Okay so now what's my moral? Can you
guess? (Brady: I dunno, that kings ask a
lot of questions?)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of daughters the king has, which is a specific detail mentioned in the transcript. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask about this specific detail.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 1. This question asks about the type of problem the king is trying to solve, which involves partitioning his land equally amongst his daughters. While this question does not directly ask about the number of daughters, it does mention the context of the king's problem, which involves his daughters.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 1

Please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about the number of daughters the king has.

**Transcript**:
I'd love to be the compassionate teacher; the tough, but fair teacher. But to my brilliant young minds, these scholars for whom I'd stand up at all costs, I'm the sweaty teacher. Not the compassionate teacher who, hey, by the way, happens to sweat, or even the teacher who sweats. No. The sweaty teacher. Adjective, sweaty purposefully coming before noun, teacher, as if to say, "This is Mr. Lamb. Do not define him by the profession he devotes his life to. Define him by the geysers he calls armpits." Every morning, I wake up in a cold... nevermind. The easy-going teacher says, "I shouldn't sweat it." The loud teacher says, "YEAH YOU SHOULDN'T SWEAT IT!" But even the empathetic teacher doesn't understand. I've got funny teacher potential. I used to pretend the notes I confiscated in class were thank you letters. Acknowledgements of my great teaching. "Oh ho ho, you shouldn't have!" Until I intercepted one about a Mr. Stank Pits. No, really. You shouldn't have. Ever since I've started developing quirky habits to deflect attention, to become someone new: the teacher who shrugs his shoulders really aggressively. The teacher who tucks his tie into his pants and pulls the end out his fly because he's so wacky. But it's no use. Because I had the sweaty teacher, too, for geography. And to this day I cannot remember the capital of Bulgaria, and the two bodies of water I know the most about sat below his shoulders. And now, I'm the one looking like I've got the Atlantic and Pacific in headlocks. The one being asked, "How was the dunk tank?" "There was no dunk tank! We live in New Orleans and it is humid!" is how I'd respond if I was the angry teacher. Instead, I look the kid in the eye as the sweat cascades down my nose, and splatters onto his blank paper below, and I say, "I sweat because I am working my tail off and I need you to do the same."

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not directly ask what everyone calls Mr. Lamb, its options and correct answer (B) provide insight into the significance of being the 'sweaty teacher', which is closely related to the ground truth MCQ. However, a more suitable match can be found.

A better match is not present in the list of generated MCQs in terms of question content. However, Question 1 has some similarity with the ground truth MCQ in terms of options. 

But the closest match in terms of question intent is Question 2.

However, upon re-examining the generated MCQs, it appears that none directly match the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, if we had to choose one, Question 1 would be the closest match in terms of question content.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 1.

**Transcript**:
I'd love to be the compassionate teacher; the tough, but fair teacher. But to my brilliant young minds, these scholars for whom I'd stand up at all costs, I'm the sweaty teacher. Not the compassionate teacher who, hey, by the way, happens to sweat, or even the teacher who sweats. No. The sweaty teacher. Adjective, sweaty purposefully coming before noun, teacher, as if to say, "This is Mr. Lamb. Do not define him by the profession he devotes his life to. Define him by the geysers he calls armpits." Every morning, I wake up in a cold... nevermind. The easy-going teacher says, "I shouldn't sweat it." The loud teacher says, "YEAH YOU SHOULDN'T SWEAT IT!" But even the empathetic teacher doesn't understand. I've got funny teacher potential. I used to pretend the notes I confiscated in class were thank you letters. Acknowledgements of my great teaching. "Oh ho ho, you shouldn't have!" Until I intercepted one about a Mr. Stank Pits. No, really. You shouldn't have. Ever since I've started developing quirky habits to deflect attention, to become someone new: the teacher who shrugs his shoulders really aggressively. The teacher who tucks his tie into his pants and pulls the end out his fly because he's so wacky. But it's no use. Because I had the sweaty teacher, too, for geography. And to this day I cannot remember the capital of Bulgaria, and the two bodies of water I know the most about sat below his shoulders. And now, I'm the one looking like I've got the Atlantic and Pacific in headlocks. The one being asked, "How was the dunk tank?" "There was no dunk tank! We live in New Orleans and it is humid!" is how I'd respond if I was the angry teacher. Instead, I look the kid in the eye as the sweat cascades down my nose, and splatters onto his blank paper below, and I say, "I sweat because I am working my tail off and I need you to do the same."

**Transcript**:
We are here in the basement of the Royal Society
in London, The Royal Society is the UK National Academy for Sciences and we are here because
there is an exhibition about Rutherford. We are interested in the element Rutherfordium
which is right here at the bottom of the periodic table number 104, and with these elements
only tiny amounts, relatively few atoms have been made so we can’t tell you about how
it is used in light bulbs or something like that because it has not been used for anything.
People are really excited if they make one or two atoms of it. So instead we are going
to tell you a bit about Rutherford after whom it’s named. And Rutherford is famous because
he did a whole series of experiments, or he and his co-workers, that really explained
the structure of atoms and so the periodic table for the first time really began to make
sense. Over here you can see there is a picture of Rutherford here in his lab with one of
his co-workers and this is a very famous picture. Rutherford, who came from New Zealand, had
a very loud voice and the experiments were rather sensitive, if you talked too loud the
apparatus started shaking and it did not work properly, so his students put up a big notice
in the lab saying talk softly please. But I am not sure that it stopped him and I use
this picture when I am talking to my students about safety, you’ve always got to be really
safe when you are working as a chemist. First of all you can see that Rutherford is smoking
in the lab and then he is not wearing safety glasses, nor is his colleague, and then they
have a whole series of wires and all sorts of things to trip over. So it is really surprising
that they managed to get their experiments to work without some sort of serious accident.
Perhaps they did break things and never told us about it. Anyway Rutherford’s work was
recognised by him winning the Nobel Prize and here, and it is quite exciting, there
is a replica of the Nobel Prize. The Nobel Prize is a gold medal but here they have shown
it as two half-medals, underneath there is nothing to see, so you can see both of the
sides. So on one side there is the portrait of Alfred Nobel, whose money and foundation,
still to this day, pays for prize money, when he received this it would have been presented
to him by the Swedish King in a huge ceremony in Stockholm. Now what I can’t remember
is whether he got the Nobel Prize for physics or chemistry. I have a feeling… Chemistry! Yes. I have a feeling that he got it for chemistry
which was particularly funny because Rutherford didn’t like chemistry. He said that there
is just physics and stamp collecting and he did not really respect chemistry so perhaps
the chemists got their revenge by giving him the Nobel Prize for chemistry. Now Rutherford had very strong views about
the hours his students should work and they were not allowed to work after 6 o’clock
at night in the lab and his chief technician would go round the lab at 6 o’clock and
switch off all the apparatus and chase everybody out of the lab. And even though they did this,
11 of his students won Nobel Prizes; this must be one of the records for any single
research group to this day. And of course when they went home having had dinner and
drank wine in the college then they started working writing papers. But it is very interesting
that if you read letters from visiting American scientists they could not understand how Rutherford’s
lab was so successful because the people came in at 10 o’clock in the morning they went
home at 6, and did not seem to do any work at all, but they discovered all these wonderful
things. What’s your policy on your students working
then? Well I always encourage my students to work
but I find that if I encourage them too hard, it has the opposite effect, just like parents
telling children to do their homework but by and large when people are enthusiastic
about their science it is difficult to stop them working too much. As part of this exhibition they have got some
postcards of Rutherford and this one has got, I think it is really terrific, shows Rutherford
in the sea. But I really like this because it shows that famous scientists sometimes
take time off and they don’t always behave like white-coated figures in labs, but they
do have a human side as well.

So we’re in the basement of the Royal Society
in London. This is the UK Academy of Sciences. They have exhibitions
here telling people about interesting things about science, and so we
have come here because there’s a really interesting exhibit relevant
to the work of Lawrence who was the person after whom the element Lawrencium
was named after. Lawrencium is another one of the elements
right at the bottom of the periodic table which are really heavy, very
radioactive. They fall to pieces very rapidly. So chemists are very,
and physicists are very lucky if they just make a few atoms of this. So
there’s nothing to tell you about the uses of lawrencium, because nobody’s
made enough lawrencium to use it for anything, except
as the subject of scientific papers and physical measurements. So instead
I want to show you here a piece of equipment which is very similar
to the sort of equipment that Lawrence used when he was doing his pioneering
work in Berkeley, California, close to San Francisco. So let’s
go along here. Lawrence was famous for inventing an instrument
called the Cyclotron which was for accelerating electrons to very
high speeds. It was in fact the precursor of the large Hadron Collider
which everybody’s now talking about. But he thought of it I think one day
in the library in Berkeley, and he imagined to begin with an instrument that
was literally as big as my two hands here, a few inches across, and his
idea was that if you made a vessel which was quite flat and circular
not very high and put in it a big magnetic field the electrons could go round
and round and round, and be accelerated to go faster and faster. The idea
was that he made one and demonstrated the principle and he patented
it and then he built bigger and bigger and bigger machines and as he made
them, not only did the disc get bigger, but at the same time the
magnet got bigger as well. And the final magnet that he made in Berkeley,
which was installed just before the Second World War, was so large
that a large part of his research group could sit between the poles
of the magnet and it’s so heavy that the magnet is still there to this
day. But come and look over here. This is a Cyclotron that was built in
Cambridge. The first thing that strikes you is that it doesn’t look very
exciting. It’s two copper discs, which are not actually connected together
and the voltage is switched between one disc and the other so as the electron
goes round when it gets to the end of one you switch the voltage
so it goes on being accelerated and it goes round and round, and
as it goes round in a magnetic field the faster it goes the bigger
the circle. So it goes round and round and round in a larger and larger
circle until the end it flies out of one of these tubes. I think again that
it is important to say that some of these historic physics experiments, which
are so important to both chemistry and physics, were done with equipment
that really looks surprisingly simple and it is the really clever
ideas that have been so important to physics and chemistry rather
than always having enormously complicated apparatus. Sometimes
to take these ideas to their full extreme you do need complicated
apparatus but that’s not the starting point. Well I’ve read quite a bit about him. He
was meant to be a very egotistical person and a real control freak,
but my father-in-law worked in Lawrence’s research group. When he was
an English undergraduate he was sent to America during the Second World
War to work in Lawrence’s group on the enrichment of uranium isotopes.
That is, concentrating Uranium-235, the less-common isotope which
was the basis for the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. So John Keane, my father-in-law, worked in
the research group, I don’t know exactly what he did, but it’s really
quite a sobering thought that during the Second World War some of the brightest
scientists had to work on these terrible projects really in
order to save their countries. And let us hope that these such things never

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of electrons in the outermost shell of a lawrencium atom, while the generated MCQs cover various topics related to Lawrence, the Cyclotron, and its applications.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of lawrencium, I would select:

**Question 1: What is the name of the element that was discovered by Lawrence and is named after him?**

Although this question does not ask about the number of electrons in the outermost shell of lawrencium, it is the only generated MCQ that mentions lawrencium explicitly. The other generated MCQs focus on the Cyclotron, its applications, and Lawrence's research group.

Please note that the similarity between the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs is limited, and a more accurate match would require generating new MCQs that specifically target the topic of lawrencium's atomic structure.

**Transcript**:
rhenium is in the same group as manganese in the periodic table but quite surprisingly it was only discovered in 1925 so my father was 15 years old when it was discovered so it's a very recent discovery compared to many of the other elements I think because it's quite rare and it is also quite hard to separate rhenium let's look at the rhenium looks like so this is a sample of rhenium okay this is a very very nice metal often used in catalysis from the middle of the transition metal group and here you see the very very dark black coloration of this very very fine wire of rhenium so I'd never seen a sample of metallic rhenium until about a month ago when I was given some as a present so here's the sample it's quite a nice silvery metal and what surprising is that it's really very heavy because elements low down on the periodic table are very dense and we can demonstrate this by weighing it let me compare the rhenium with the pile of five American 10 cent pieces five dimes so this is half a dollar and you can see this is bigger than that considerably so if we weigh the coins you can see it weighs just a bit more than 11 grams eleven point three grams which is quite reasonable because they're made out of copper and nickel and if we now take these off and put on the rhenium which is a smaller lump of metal you can see that it weighs more than 16 grams so it's a really very dense metal we give someone a little little shot of rhenium as a present so this comes from the managing director Nicoll Lippmann who make or supply rare metals and he came to give me an interview for a magazine and he gave me a sample of this element so I was really excited he gave it to me in this bag together with the analysis of the element and it's 99.9% pure and inside is a piece of paper with the complete analytical data I was really very excited and especially because I was not expecting a present we're always taught metals in the same group of the periodic table like manganese and rhenium are very similar so I was expecting that the salts of rhenium would be very similar to the salts of manganese but I was really surprised when I was told that the company also supplied a salt per renate so I already knew that the manganese salt permanganate had this terrific purple color so here you can see it dissolved in water and next to it you can see the solid that's almost black so these are manganese salts so I was expecting a terrific color from the rhenium salt and the rhenium salt is a really boring white this is per renate with rhenium in it and the reason why it's white which I understood afterwards is because the color comes from the energy of the electrons in the iron and in rhenium the difference in energy between the different levels for the electron is much bigger so instead of absorbing visible light and looking colored it absorbs ultraviolet light which we don't notice so big disappointment Perrine 8 is white rhenium in recent years has become an extremely important element for making aircraft engine particularly jet engines and aircraft and at the same time as giving me this sample of rhenium I was given this object here this is a turbine blade from the front end of a really quite sophisticated jet engine now it's a used turbine blade and you can see there's a large slot has been cut in it to stop people selling this used blade to be put back into jet engines so this is right in the middle of the engine just after the combustion chamber where the fuel has burnt so the temperature is very high and this is spinning round very fast so there are enormous stresses on this metal the temperature is probably about 1,600 degrees centigrade or even higher and most metals were just melt or they would become so floppy they would stretch as they spun round and this is made from a special alloy which has quite a lot of nickel in it but the magic ingredient is rhenium that makes it stronger but what I find particularly surprising about this is that this whole blade is a single crystal of metal because if you have a lump of metal the weak part is between the different crystals that make up the lump but if you grow a single crystal it has no weaknesses and it's very very much stronger so this is an amazing piece of engineering because if you look closely you can see it's Hollow so they have grown a single crystal which has a hole inside so they can blow air through it to keep it cool to stop it getting quite as hot as it might do otherwise and so the lamp of rhenium that I was given actually came from recycled turbine blades because really is quite a rare element and once you put them in the turbine blades when you service the engine you get the turbine blades back and you can recycle the rhenium metal and if we didn't do that it would soon run out because there aren't very large supplies of rhenium in the longer term rhenium may have quite useful applications in a variety of solar cells and perhaps as catalysts for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen but at the moment the major technical application is in making these special alloys it is called rhenium because it was discovered in Germany and the rhenium is derived from the name of the River Rhine which flows through Germany there are other rivers in Germany though wide the Rhine get I have no idea

rhenium is in the same group as manganese in the periodic table but quite surprisingly it was only discovered in 1925 so my father was 15 years old when it was discovered so it's a very recent discovery compared to many of the other elements I think because it's quite rare and it is also quite hard to separate rhenium let's look at the rhenium looks like so this is a sample of rhenium okay this is a very very nice metal often used in catalysis from the middle of the transition metal group and here you see the very very dark black coloration of this very very fine wire of rhenium so I'd never seen a sample of metallic rhenium until about a month ago when I was given some as a present so here's the sample it's quite a nice silvery metal and what surprising is that it's really very heavy because elements low down on the periodic table are very dense and we can demonstrate this by weighing it let me compare the rhenium with the pile of five American 10 cent pieces five dimes so this is half a dollar and you can see this is bigger than that considerably so if we weigh the coins you can see it weighs just a bit more than 11 grams eleven point three grams which is quite reasonable because they're made out of copper and nickel and if we now take these off and put on the rhenium which is a smaller lump of metal you can see that it weighs more than 16 grams so it's a really very dense metal we give someone a little little shot of rhenium as a present so this comes from the managing director Nicoll Lippmann who make or supply rare metals and he came to give me an interview for a magazine and he gave me a sample of this element so I was really excited he gave it to me in this bag together with the analysis of the element and it's 99.9% pure and inside is a piece of paper with the complete analytical data I was really very excited and especially because I was not expecting a present we're always taught metals in the same group of the periodic table like manganese and rhenium are very similar so I was expecting that the salts of rhenium would be very similar to the salts of manganese but I was really surprised when I was told that the company also supplied a salt per renate so I already knew that the manganese salt permanganate had this terrific purple color so here you can see it dissolved in water and next to it you can see the solid that's almost black so these are manganese salts so I was expecting a terrific color from the rhenium salt and the rhenium salt is a really boring white this is per renate with rhenium in it and the reason why it's white which I understood afterwards is because the color comes from the energy of the electrons in the iron and in rhenium the difference in energy between the different levels for the electron is much bigger so instead of absorbing visible light and looking colored it absorbs ultraviolet light which we don't notice so big disappointment Perrine 8 is white rhenium in recent years has become an extremely important element for making aircraft engine particularly jet engines and aircraft and at the same time as giving me this sample of rhenium I was given this object here this is a turbine blade from the front end of a really quite sophisticated jet engine now it's a used turbine blade and you can see there's a large slot has been cut in it to stop people selling this used blade to be put back into jet engines so this is right in the middle of the engine just after the combustion chamber where the fuel has burnt so the temperature is very high and this is spinning round very fast so there are enormous stresses on this metal the temperature is probably about 1,600 degrees centigrade or even higher and most metals were just melt or they would become so floppy they would stretch as they spun round and this is made from a special alloy which has quite a lot of nickel in it but the magic ingredient is rhenium that makes it stronger but what I find particularly surprising about this is that this whole blade is a single crystal of metal because if you have a lump of metal the weak part is between the different crystals that make up the lump but if you grow a single crystal it has no weaknesses and it's very very much stronger so this is an amazing piece of engineering because if you look closely you can see it's Hollow so they have grown a single crystal which has a hole inside so they can blow air through it to keep it cool to stop it getting quite as hot as it might do otherwise and so the lamp of rhenium that I was given actually came from recycled turbine blades because really is quite a rare element and once you put them in the turbine blades when you service the engine you get the turbine blades back and you can recycle the rhenium metal and if we didn't do that it would soon run out because there aren't very large supplies of rhenium in the longer term rhenium may have quite useful applications in a variety of solar cells and perhaps as catalysts for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen but at the moment the major technical application is in making these special alloys it is called rhenium because it was discovered in Germany and the rhenium is derived from the name of the River Rhine which flows through Germany there are other rivers in Germany though wide the Rhine get I have no idea

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the density of rhenium, which is demonstrated by the professor using a balance. Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 is the most related, as it asks why rhenium is very heavy. Although it does not directly ask about the density of rhenium, it is related to the concept of density.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 5.

Please note that the generated MCQs do not provide a direct match for the ground truth MCQ, and Question 5 is only a rough approximation. A more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about the density of rhenium and provides similar options.

This is tungsten, I think. Tungsten is a very hard and heavy element.
It has a number of very important uses. It is used in the filament of light bulbs, the
ordinary sort of light bulbs because it has more or less the highest boiling point of
any element and therefore you can use it as the filament and it can get very hot without
very much evaporation on to the walls. If you add iodine in the gas around the bulb
you can run it at even higher temperatures, the so called quartz halogen lamps and sometimes
you see these in up-market cars. Yes, it’s tungsten. So this is tungsten.
Tungsten is used as an element material to form the very, very fine wire that we may
have used in old-style electric light bulbs. It is a really quite wonderful metal and it
is actually used in nature. But here we have a really quite beautiful sample. This is a
single crystal of tungsten which is mounted. Tungsten carbide, the compound of tungsten
and carbon is used in the very tip, the balls in the tip of a biro pen or ball point pen. Really quite amazing. I have got some other
tungsten here somewhere and in fact here is a very fine wire of tungsten and this is precisely
the material which was used in the formation of very early electric light bulbs. A really
quite amazing metal. There is also quite a nice book by Oliver
Sacks, who is an Englishman who now lives in America, called Uncle Tungsten. There are
not many books that have chemical names in the title and this is a story of his childhood
and how chemistry really had a big effect on him. That’s lovely.

**Transcript**:
Ok, so thulium is a very expensive lanthanide.
It’s very expensive because it’s very hard to separate it from
its neighbours. The lanthanides from the left to right undergo this contraction
where they get smaller and smaller and over on the right-hand-side
at this point that they are all of a very similar size. Now we can separate
them now but it is quite difficult to do and therefore quite expensive,
so thulium is not used very often. However thulium, as well as being able
to obtain the plus-3 oxidation state, it is also one of those ones
which can obtain the plus-2 oxidation state, which means that chemists
are now beginning to find uses for it which they hadn’t expected before.
So you may see the use of thulium increase in years to come. Because
it’s very hard to isolate because it’s of a very similar size to its
neighbours, it took a guy called Charles James, in 1911, a famous 15,000 times
of recrystalization to isolate thulium in a pure, albeit as a chloride,
but a pure nonetheless, compound for the first time.

**Transcript**:
Lovely! I’ve just realised that erbium is the most
crucial element for the internet of all the elements on the periodic table,
and so I want to take you across to materials engineering where we can
see a demonstration which will explain to you why it’s so important,
and why without erbium many of you couldn’t be watching this video. Erbium is another lanthanide metal. It’s
soft, silvery, quite malleable, very reactive towards oxygen and water and,
I suppose, for us right now it’s quite significant, because it was originally
discovered from a mineral which was found in this quarry. So we’re
in a quarry in Sweden near Stockholm, called Ytterby Mine and some black
minerals that were found in this quarry actually were the birthplace
for four new chemical elements and erbium was one of them. Erbium is a photographic filter and it is
actually a nuclear poison. What that means is that it will kill dead any nuclear
fission process so it’s obviously got some applications there. It’s
an interesting element when you make compounds of it and dissolve it in
solution it often goes pink. Now this is some erbium trichloride. You’ll
notice it’s very slightly pink. I think this is one of the ones that, because
of its pink colourations, get’s used in jewellery and things like sunglasses
and things like that, if memory serves. More recently erbium is used as an amplifier
of light as it’s transmitted down optical fibres. So, the reason we are here, and why I’m
all dressed up, these are the fibres that transmit the signals for the internet.
Now the reason they use fibres is because copper cables which you
would normally use for electrical signals cannot carry nearly as
much information, as many YouTube viewings at once, as one of these
fibres. And the fibre is very strong, neither Brady nor I have managed to
break it, and the problem is that even with this fibre, with the light
beam going down it, eventually the light gets weaker and weaker and you lose
the signal. So every 50km, every 30 miles or so, down the fibre
when it’s under the sea you have to amplify the signal to get it back
up again so that our YouTube video can reach the other side of the Atlantic
or to India or wherever. And so the way you’ve got to do it you’ve
got to somehow amplify the light, make it more intense, and you can do
this with erbium because if you put erbium into the glass then if you
shine a light onto the erbium atoms they get excited and then as the light
comes in from the signal it interacts with the erbium atom and the erbium
atom loses its energy and gives out more light. So essentially the light
comes in and comes out twice as intense. It then keeps going another
30 miles and you repeat it. Here we’ve got the infrared laser, I used
to work with lasers, but I’ve rather given up now. So it’s quite nostalgic.
Is it switched on? And if you put this in the laser beam you can see there’s
a special screen here, which will actually take an infrared laser
beam which you can’t see and make it into visible light so you can see
it. We’ve got infrared light going into a piece of glass with erbium in it. Now,
what is happening here is the physics here is slightly different from what
happens in the amplifier, but is really quite fun because the light beam
that you can’t see is suddenly being changed into visible light, to green
light, which you can. Yes it’s very important, I had heard about
it in lectures but when we videoed our first video about erbium I had
completely forgotten about this, although without it nobody would have
seen any of our videos. Welders, people that join pieces of metal
together using either large electric fields or extreme temperatures have
special masks to protect their eyes from the very bright light which
is given out in the welding process. Welding goggles typically can include
erbium salts because they are intense and they absorb a massive amount
of the light so the eyes of the welder are not damaged at all. So, under the sea you have these fibres with
copper wires going next to it carrying the currents for the diodes that
excite the amplifiers all the way along and, apparently, the current going
down these wires is quite attractive to sharks and so in shallow water
sharks come along and see the cable and it seems attractive and they
start chewing it and, although Brady and I can’t break the fibres, a shark
in full spate can easily cut through it and so there have been quite alot
of problems with the optic fibres in shallow water being chewed to bits
by sharks.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the color of erbium compounds in solution, such as erbium trichloride. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the color of erbium compounds, Question 6 mentions the use of erbium in welding goggles to protect the welder's eyes from intense light, but it does not mention the color of erbium compounds.

Unfortunately, there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar enough to be considered a match.

However, if you would like me to choose the least dissimilar one, I would say Question 6 is the least dissimilar, but only because it mentions erbium being used in a context where color might be relevant (absorbing light), but it's still a very weak connection.

Index: 6 (with the caveat that it's not a good match)

**Transcript**:
I think the reason that this  compound, this element, Nobelium was named after Nobel, is because Nobel  is perhaps the single most famous name  that is associated with science. Most of the people that you talk to  in the street, have probably heard of Nobel,  but they may not easily have heard  of Seaborg, or some these other people.  So I think, as a name for an  element, it is really quite a good one. Alfred Nobel was a Swedish chemist,  or industrial chemist, who worked on explosives, and the problem  with explosives, which are compounds  of Carbon and Nitrogen,  is that until the time of Alfred Nobel,  they were very unstable. They could go off unexpectedly,  and kill people, in fact, I believe one of Nobel's relatives, might even have been his brother, was killed by a serious explosion. And the reason is that these compounds, when they starts reacting, and they're reacting  violently, the reaction builts up, the heat produced by the first bit going off,  goes on, and so on. And what Nobel discovered, his real scientific discovery,  was that if he spread this compound on to inert  material, it's just essentially sand, that it would be completely stable, you can even throw in a fire  and it won't explode. But if you use a detonator that  produces a sharp, small explosion,  that is enough to set the whole lot off. And so, this allowed people to handle explosives safely, and many of the developments in the 19th century, the expansion  of the railways,   and some of the unpleasant developments  in warfare, were all brought about by Nobel's discovery of these high explosives  that could be be stabilized. Now, the result of this was that Nobel's company became really,  very lucrative, selling these explosives, and when Nobel died, a foundation was set up, which exists to this day, to award prizes in the areas of science for outstanding science, in physics,  in medicine, and chemistry,  and economics, and peace. I think the economics may actually be given  by a sister organization. And each year the prizes announced  for really one of the exciting pieces of chemistry, that has been done in  the preceding 2 years.  Occasionally it's for something that was done just a year or two before, where everybody recognizes  straight away it was revolutionary. For example, the discovery  of C60, the molecule with 60 carbon atoms, that looks like a football, which rewarded really quite quickly.  Other prizes, you really have to wait to see how the field develops, and to see whether this discovery  really was important,  whether it really changes the field of  chemistry. - Is it every chemist's dream  to win a Nobel prize? - I suppose so, but only 3 people  can win it each year, and there are so many chemists,  that it's really something  which is almost like a lottery. In fact, some national lotteries,  it's probably easier to win the prize, so I think most chemist really aspire  to becoming members of the national  academy of sciences of their own country,  and most of them don't  think of winning the Nobel prize. -So Nobelium is perhaps best  known for the fact, that it is quite controversial in terms of its naming  So it was originally discovered  and called Nobelium  and there is another research group disputeed  these findings, they claimmed that they named it and gave a different name, then eventually,  because it has been named  as Nobelium for such a long time,  people just settled on that. - But he had nothing to do with  Nobelium.  - No no , Nobelium was first  discovered, first detected, I'm not sure how many years, but  probably nearly a century after his death.  . . . . . . . . . . . .

Mendelevium, which is named after one of the
most important people as far as the periodic table is concerned, which
is Dimitri Mendeleev. Mendelevium is named after Mendeleev, in Russia
the periodic table is called the Mendeleev table, and you can see
here on my tie I’ve got a picture of Mendeleev. It’s another element which has absolutely
zero use in the real world. He is one of the iconic, iconic, pictures
of chemists that most chemists will recognise Mendeleev. Ah, Mendeleev was all to do with how it was
discovered to put the periodic table together, for a long time,
people knew that there were different elements and that they knew that
they had different properties. What they couldn’t do, was rationalise those
properties and understand why certain elements behaved in a similar
manner even though in principle they should have been very different. But Mendeleev has another cause of fame; he
is famous in Russia because he was the person who worked out the
standard for the strength of vodka. So here I have a bottle
of Russian Mendeleev, you’ll see it says Mendeleev here and vodka, with
a periodic table on it, and here’s the formula, ethanol plus water,
and Mendeleev was the person that worked out the standard of 40% of ethanol
in water as being vodka. And in fact it’s remarkable the number of
experiments you read where people have used 40% ethanol in water as the
solvent for their reaction doubtless because they had a handy bottle
of vodka or some similar drink.

Ok, Fermium, it has absolutely no use as far
as anyone knows except that it’s extremely radioactive. It’s
named after Enrico Fermi who is a well-known physicist. Fermi was an Italian physicist who in the
1930s was the first person to discover artificial radioactivity. This is
where neutrons, which had only recently been discovered when they did these
experiments, hit an element that is not radioactive, increase
the weight of the nucleus but not the number of protons and cause it to
fall apart by radioactive decay. And it also, like Einsteinium, where it was
first found in the debris of a nuclear bomb, in fact the very first nuclear
bomb that was ever tested. Shortly after the fascists took power in Italy,
Fermi moved to the United States and, as part of the Manhattan project
for building the atomic bomb, he built the first nuclear reactor under
the football stadium, in the squash courts under the football stadium at
Chicago University, the University of Chicago, right in the centre
of Chicago, and they filled the squash courts with blocks of carbon with holes
in the middle through which they put rods of uranium. So the first
ever sustained nuclear reaction took place in the sports field of
University of Chicago and if you go now there, the stadium itself has been
completely demolished, but there’s a rather fine monument to the birth
of the atomic era.

**Transcript**:
Light: it's the fastest thing in the universe, but we can still measure its speed if we slow down the animation, we can analyze light's motion using a space-time diagram, which takes a flipbook of animation panels, and turns them on their side. In this lesson, we'll add the single experimental fact that whenever anyone measures just how fast light moves, they get the same answer: 299,792,458 meters every second, which means that when we draw light on our space-time diagram, it's world line always has to appear at the same angle. But we saw previously that speed, or equivalently world line angles, change when we look at things from other people's perspective. To explore this contradiction, let's see what happens if I start moving while I stand still and shine the laser at Tom. First, we'll need to construct the space-time diagram. Yes, that means taking all of the different panels showing the different moments in time and stacking them up. From the side, we see the world line of the laser light at its correct fixed angle, just as before. So far, so good. But that space-time diagram represents Andrew's perspective. What does it look like to me? In the last lesson, we showed how to get Tom's perspective moving all the panels along a bit until his world line is completely vertical. But look carefully at the light world line. The rearrangement of the panels means it's now tilted over too far. I'd measure light traveling faster than Andrew would. But every experiment we've ever done, and we've tried very hard, says that everyone measures light to have a fixed speed. So let's start again. In the 1900s, a clever chap named Albert Einstein worked out how to see things properly, from Tom's point of view, while still getting the speed of light right. First, we need to glue together the separate panels into one solid block. This gives us our space-time, turning space and time into one smooth, continuous material. And now, here is the trick. What you do is stretch your block of space-time along the light world line, then squash it by the same amount, but at right angles to the light world line, and abracadabra! Tom's world line has gone vertical, so this does represent the world from his point of view, but most importantly, the light world line has never changed its angle, and so light will be measured by Tom going at the correct speed. This superb trick is known as a Lorentz transformation. Yeah, more than a trick. Slice up the space-time into new panels and you have the physically correct animation. I'm stationary in the car, everything else is coming past me and the speed of light works out to be that same fixed value that we know everyone measures. On the other hand, something strange has happened. The fence posts aren't spaced a meter apart anymore, and my mom will be worried that I look a bit thin. But that's not fair. Why don't I get to look thin? I thought physics was supposed to be the same for everyone. Yes, no, it is, and you do. All that stretching and squashing of space-time has just muddled together what we used to think of separately as space and time. This particular squashing effect is known as Lorentz contraction. Okay, but I still don't look thin. No, yes, you do. Now that we know better about space-time, we should redraw what the scene looked like to me. To you, I appear Lorentz contracted. Oh but to you, I appear Lorentz contracted. Yes. Uh, well, at least it's fair. And speaking of fairness, just as space gets muddled with time, time also gets muddled with space, in an effect known as time dilation. No, at everyday speeds, such as Tom's car reaches, actually all the effects are much, much smaller than we've illustrated them. Oh, yet, careful experiments, for instance watching the behavior of tiny particles whizzing around the Large Hadron Collider confirmed that the effects are real. And now that space-time is an experimentally confirmed part of reality, we can get a bit more ambitious. What if we were to start playing with the material of space-time itself? We'll find out all about that in the next animation.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 2: What does the space-time diagram represent when viewed from Andrew's perspective?**

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses why light has to appear at the same angle when drawn on a space-time diagram.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly address this question, I will choose the one that is most closely related to the concept of light's speed being constant.

**Question 1: What is the speed of light, according to experimental measurements?**

This question is related to the concept of light's speed being constant, which is the reason why light has to appear at the same angle when drawn on a space-time diagram.

However, I must note that this is not a perfect match.

If I had to choose an index, I would choose **1**, but with the caveat that it's not a perfect match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that directly address the concept of light's speed being constant and its representation on a space-time diagram.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: Why does the speaker appear Lorentz contracted to the observer?

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the correct answer for Question 6 does not match the intent of the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be Question 5, but it also does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

A better match can be found in Question 3, which describes the effect of the Lorentz transformation on space-time. However, it does not directly address why Andrew appears thinner to Tom.

Considering all the options, the most similar generated MCQ is actually Question 5, but with the understanding that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Light: it's the fastest thing in the universe, but we can still measure its speed if we slow down the animation, we can analyze light's motion using a space-time diagram, which takes a flipbook of animation panels, and turns them on their side. In this lesson, we'll add the single experimental fact that whenever anyone measures just how fast light moves, they get the same answer: 299,792,458 meters every second, which means that when we draw light on our space-time diagram, it's world line always has to appear at the same angle. But we saw previously that speed, or equivalently world line angles, change when we look at things from other people's perspective. To explore this contradiction, let's see what happens if I start moving while I stand still and shine the laser at Tom. First, we'll need to construct the space-time diagram. Yes, that means taking all of the different panels showing the different moments in time and stacking them up. From the side, we see the world line of the laser light at its correct fixed angle, just as before. So far, so good. But that space-time diagram represents Andrew's perspective. What does it look like to me? In the last lesson, we showed how to get Tom's perspective moving all the panels along a bit until his world line is completely vertical. But look carefully at the light world line. The rearrangement of the panels means it's now tilted over too far. I'd measure light traveling faster than Andrew would. But every experiment we've ever done, and we've tried very hard, says that everyone measures light to have a fixed speed. So let's start again. In the 1900s, a clever chap named Albert Einstein worked out how to see things properly, from Tom's point of view, while still getting the speed of light right. First, we need to glue together the separate panels into one solid block. This gives us our space-time, turning space and time into one smooth, continuous material. And now, here is the trick. What you do is stretch your block of space-time along the light world line, then squash it by the same amount, but at right angles to the light world line, and abracadabra! Tom's world line has gone vertical, so this does represent the world from his point of view, but most importantly, the light world line has never changed its angle, and so light will be measured by Tom going at the correct speed. This superb trick is known as a Lorentz transformation. Yeah, more than a trick. Slice up the space-time into new panels and you have the physically correct animation. I'm stationary in the car, everything else is coming past me and the speed of light works out to be that same fixed value that we know everyone measures. On the other hand, something strange has happened. The fence posts aren't spaced a meter apart anymore, and my mom will be worried that I look a bit thin. But that's not fair. Why don't I get to look thin? I thought physics was supposed to be the same for everyone. Yes, no, it is, and you do. All that stretching and squashing of space-time has just muddled together what we used to think of separately as space and time. This particular squashing effect is known as Lorentz contraction. Okay, but I still don't look thin. No, yes, you do. Now that we know better about space-time, we should redraw what the scene looked like to me. To you, I appear Lorentz contracted. Oh but to you, I appear Lorentz contracted. Yes. Uh, well, at least it's fair. And speaking of fairness, just as space gets muddled with time, time also gets muddled with space, in an effect known as time dilation. No, at everyday speeds, such as Tom's car reaches, actually all the effects are much, much smaller than we've illustrated them. Oh, yet, careful experiments, for instance watching the behavior of tiny particles whizzing around the Large Hadron Collider confirmed that the effects are real. And now that space-time is an experimentally confirmed part of reality, we can get a bit more ambitious. What if we were to start playing with the material of space-time itself?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why do we have to redraw the animation as seen from Andrew's perspective?
Options: A. Shifting to the perspective of another person changes the laws of physics., B.

The speed of light has changed - it should be moving more slowly so that it hits Tom at the right time.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

Although the wording of the question is different, the intent and content of Question 6 are similar to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions deal with the concept of Lorentz contraction and its effect on the observer's perspective. The correct option for Question 6 (D) also aligns with the correct option for the ground truth MCQ (B), as both options acknowledge the role of the observer's perspective in Lorentz contraction.

However, it's worth noting that the generated MCQs do not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, and some modifications would be necessary to create an exact match. Nevertheless, Question 6 is the most similar generated MCQ based on the provided options.

It was a night like any other night, except here I was climbing the platonic peaks like Romeo on a second date. (ugh) I was there for the dame. She had eyes like imaginary numbers and curves that went on forever. Said she wanted to go home. Said I could help. Said the pay was good. Didn't say anything about climbing a... Voice: "Who's there?" Manny Brot: "Manny Brot, private eye." Voice: "What are you doing here?" "A pretty number sent me to find a stolen dingus." Voice: "Well, to enter the cave, you must answer my riddles three." What was it with riddles, and why do they always come in threes? "Is it an egg?" "No. Why would it be an egg?" "It's usually an egg." "What can I hold in my hand, but has zero area?" "Is it a dodo egg?" "It's not an egg!" I took out the rock that had nearly brained me before and gave it a hard ponder. The size of the rising bump on my conk said to me that this thing had area, and a lot of it. But what if I carved out a triangle from this side here? As any mook could see, this triangle had a quarter of the area of the full triangle. I did the same thing again with each of the smaller triangles. Again, a quarter of the remaining area -- gone. And I just kept going. After an infinite number of cuts, I was satisfied that my triangle had zero area. A bounded shape with zero area. Now, it's not often that I surprise myself, but my own two mitts had created something crazy, and new. "Very good. (ahem) Now, show me a shape with finite area, but an infinitely long perimeter." "Let me get this straight. If I want to make a snip in the border of this shape, smooth it out, and lay it on the ground ... " "It would go on for ... " "Wait 'til I'm through, and then you can talk. It would go on forever." "Are you through?" "Yeah." "So show me that shape then." Mmm ... I hadn't been this stuck since the Rubik's Cube fiasco of '58. All the shapes I knew had perimeters. Circles: 2πr. Triangles: sum of their sides. What's this? An angle. An angle from heaven. What if I were to pinch each side, like so. A third of the way through, just so. And do it again, and again, and again. After each pinch, the perimeter got a third longer because where there had been three line segments, now there were four. As for the area, every pinch made more triangles, that's true. But those triangles were getting smaller and smaller. You could say that the area was converging, approaching a fixed number, while the perimeter was just getting bigger and bigger, uncontrollably ballooning like an overindulgent birthday clown. After infinity pinches, flimflam, there it was: Finite area, but infinite perimeter. Now that is a piece of work. "Oh, you're good. (ahem) Riddle three: Show me a picture that if I magnify it under my microscope, I'll keep seeing the original picture, no matter how much I zoom in." "You're a strange little man." "Thank you." I was out of ideas, so I looked at my muse, my complex Dora. Voice: "Who's the dame?" And then it hit me. "She's a heart breaker, my fractal femme fatale. Will she do?" "Yes, she'll do just fine." (lightning) It was dark, and at first I thought the cave was empty, but then I noticed: the box. The dame had played me like a triangle. She had told me she wanted to go home. (Lightning) What she really wanted was to bring her home here. The fractals spread everywhere. Most of them the same no matter how deep you looked at them, like Dora's mugshot. Some had infinitely long perimeters, others were objects with no area or volume, all of them created through infinite repetition. So, you wanted to know what fractals are?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

This question matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent (describing a characteristic of fractals) and options (specifically, option B mentions a finite area and an infinite perimeter, which is a characteristic of fractals mentioned in the story). However, an even better match is not available among the options.

But upon closer inspection, Question 5 and the process described also imply infinite repetition as the reason for the resulting zero area, which makes Question 5 and the Ground Truth MCQ share the same underlying fractal concept of infinite repetition.

However, Question 7 does not exactly describe the characteristic mentioned in the ground truth MCQ (infinite repetition). A more suitable match would be a question that explicitly mentions infinite repetition as a characteristic of fractals.

Unfortunately, no such explicit match exists among the provided generated MCQs. Nonetheless, the closest match in terms of describing a fractal's characteristic would still be Question 7, but since it's not an exact match, another generated MCQ that somewhat shares the fractal property is Question 5, but an even better match is Question 6 since it also shares an underlying fractal property but is not an exact match either.

However, if one had to choose the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ based on the fractal concept of infinite repetition it would be Question 5.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 7. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only describes one property of fractals, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks to identify specific examples of fractals.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks to identify examples of fractals, but such a question is not present in the provided set. Nevertheless, based on the available options, I would recommend Question 7 as the closest match, although it is not ideal.

**Transcript**:
It was a night like any other night, except here I was climbing the platonic peaks like Romeo on a second date. (ugh) I was there for the dame. She had eyes like imaginary numbers and curves that went on forever. Said she wanted to go home. Said I could help. Said the pay was good. Didn't say anything about climbing a... Voice: "Who's there?" Manny Brot: "Manny Brot, private eye." Voice: "What are you doing here?" "A pretty number sent me to find a stolen dingus." Voice: "Well, to enter the cave, you must answer my riddles three." What was it with riddles, and why do they always come in threes? "Is it an egg?" "No. Why would it be an egg?" "It's usually an egg." "What can I hold in my hand, but has zero area?" "Is it a dodo egg?" "It's not an egg!" I took out the rock that had nearly brained me before and gave it a hard ponder. The size of the rising bump on my conk said to me that this thing had area, and a lot of it. But what if I carved out a triangle from this side here? As any mook could see, this triangle had a quarter of the area of the full triangle. I did the same thing again with each of the smaller triangles. Again, a quarter of the remaining area -- gone. And I just kept going. After an infinite number of cuts, I was satisfied that my triangle had zero area. A bounded shape with zero area. Now, it's not often that I surprise myself, but my own two mitts had created something crazy, and new. "Very good. (ahem) Now, show me a shape with finite area, but an infinitely long perimeter." "Let me get this straight. If I want to make a snip in the border of this shape, smooth it out, and lay it on the ground ... " "It would go on for ... " "Wait 'til I'm through, and then you can talk. It would go on forever." "Are you through?" "Yeah." "So show me that shape then." Mmm ... I hadn't been this stuck since the Rubik's Cube fiasco of '58. All the shapes I knew had perimeters. Circles: 2πr. Triangles: sum of their sides. What's this? An angle. An angle from heaven. What if I were to pinch each side, like so. A third of the way through, just so. And do it again, and again, and again. After each pinch, the perimeter got a third longer because where there had been three line segments, now there were four. As for the area, every pinch made more triangles, that's true. But those triangles were getting smaller and smaller. You could say that the area was converging, approaching a fixed number, while the perimeter was just getting bigger and bigger, uncontrollably ballooning like an overindulgent birthday clown. After infinity pinches, flimflam, there it was: Finite area, but infinite perimeter. Now that is a piece of work. "Oh, you're good. (ahem) Riddle three: Show me a picture that if I magnify it under my microscope, I'll keep seeing the original picture, no matter how much I zoom in." "You're a strange little man." "Thank you." I was out of ideas, so I looked at my muse, my complex Dora. Voice: "Who's the dame?" And then it hit me. "She's a heart breaker, my fractal femme fatale. Will she do?" "Yes, she'll do just fine." (lightning) It was dark, and at first I thought the cave was empty, but then I noticed: the box. The dame had played me like a triangle. She had told me she wanted to go home.

**Transcript**:
Studies have shown that taking vitamins is good for your health and bad for your health. That newly discovered herb can improve your memory or destroy your liver. Headlines proclaim a promising new cancer treatment and never mention it again. On a daily basis, we are bombarded with attention-grabbing news, backed up by scientific studies, but what are these studies? How are they performed? And how do we know whether they're reliable? When it comes to dietary or medical information, the first thing to remember is that while studies on animals or individual cells can point the way towards further research, the only way to know how something will affect humans is through a study involving human subjects. And when it comes to human studies, the scientific gold standard is the randomized clinical trial, or RCT. The key to RCTs is that the subjects are randomly assigned to their study groups. They are often blinded to make them more rigorous. This process attempts to ensure that the only difference between the groups is the one the researchers are attempting to study. For example, when testing a new headache medication, a large pool of people with headaches would be randomly divided into two groups, one receiving the medication and another receiving a placebo. With proper randomization, the only significant overall difference between the two groups will be whether or not they received the medication, rather than other differences that could affect results. Randomized clinical trials are incredible tools, and, in fact, the US Food and Drug Administration often requires at least two to be conducted before a new drug can be marketed. But the problem is that an RCT is not possible in many cases, either because it's not practical or would require too many volunteers. In such cases, scientists use an epidemiological study, which simply observes people going about their usual behavior, rather than randomly assigning active participants to control invariable groups. Let's say we wanted to study whether an herbal ingredient on the market causes nausea. Rather than deliberately giving people something that might make them nauseated, we would find those who already take the ingredient in their everyday lives. This group is called the cohort. We would also need a comparison group of people who do not have exposure to the ingredient. And we would then compare statistics. If the rate of nausea is higher in the herbal cohort, it suggests an association between the herbal supplement and nausea. Epidemiological studies are great tools to study the health effects of almost anything, without directly interfering in people's lives or assigning them to potentially dangerous exposures. So, why can't we rely on these studies to establish causal relationships between substances and their effects on health? The problem is that even the best conducted epidemiological studies have inherent flaws. Precisely because the test subjects are not randomly assigned to their groups. For example, if the cohort in our herbal study consisted of people who took the supplement for health reasons, they may have already had higher rates of nausea than the other people in the sample. Or the cohort group could've been composed of people who shop at health food stores and have different diets or better access to healthcare. These factors that can affect results, in addition to the factor being studied, are known as confounding variables. These two major pitfalls, combined with more general dangers, such as conflicts of interest or selective use of data, can make the findings of any particular epidemiological study suspect, and a good study must go out of its way to prove that its authors have taken steps to eliminate these types of errors. But even when this has been done, the very nature of epidemiological studies, which examine differences between preexisting groups, rather than deliberately inducing changes within the same individuals, means that a single study can only demonstrate a correlation between a substance and a health outcome, rather than a true cause and effect relationship. At the end of the day, epidemiological studies have served as excellent guides to public health, alerting us to critical health hazards, such as smoking, asbestos, lead, and many more. But these were demonstrated through multiple, well-conducted epidemiological studies, all pointing in the same direction. So, the next time you see a headline about a new miracle cure or the terrible danger posed by an everyday substance, try to learn more about the original study and the limitations inherent in any epidemiological study or clinical trial before jumping to conclusions.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

This question matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks if a single epidemiological or observational study can demonstrate cause and effect, and the correct answer is "False". Question 9 asks about the main limitation of epidemiological studies and states that they can only demonstrate a correlation between a substance and a health outcome, rather than a cause-and-effect relationship. This is essentially the same idea as the ground truth MCQ, and it requires the test-taker to understand the same concept. 

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 9.

**Transcript**:
Studies have shown that taking vitamins is good for your health and bad for your health. That newly discovered herb can improve your memory or destroy your liver. Headlines proclaim a promising new cancer treatment and never mention it again. On a daily basis, we are bombarded with attention-grabbing news, backed up by scientific studies, but what are these studies? How are they performed? And how do we know whether they're reliable? When it comes to dietary or medical information, the first thing to remember is that while studies on animals or individual cells can point the way towards further research, the only way to know how something will affect humans is through a study involving human subjects. And when it comes to human studies, the scientific gold standard is the randomized clinical trial, or RCT. The key to RCTs is that the subjects are randomly assigned to their study groups. They are often blinded to make them more rigorous. This process attempts to ensure that the only difference between the groups is the one the researchers are attempting to study. For example, when testing a new headache medication, a large pool of people with headaches would be randomly divided into two groups, one receiving the medication and another receiving a placebo. With proper randomization, the only significant overall difference between the two groups will be whether or not they received the medication, rather than other differences that could affect results. Randomized clinical trials are incredible tools, and, in fact, the US Food and Drug Administration often requires at least two to be conducted before a new drug can be marketed. But the problem is that an RCT is not possible in many cases, either because it's not practical or would require too many volunteers. In such cases, scientists use an epidemiological study, which simply observes people going about their usual behavior, rather than randomly assigning active participants to control invariable groups. Let's say we wanted to study whether an herbal ingredient on the market causes nausea. Rather than deliberately giving people something that might make them nauseated, we would find those who already take the ingredient in their everyday lives. This group is called the cohort. We would also need a comparison group of people who do not have exposure to the ingredient. And we would then compare statistics. If the rate of nausea is higher in the herbal cohort, it suggests an association between the herbal supplement and nausea. Epidemiological studies are great tools to study the health effects of almost anything, without directly interfering in people's lives or assigning them to potentially dangerous exposures. So, why can't we rely on these studies to establish causal relationships between substances and their effects on health? The problem is that even the best conducted epidemiological studies have inherent flaws. Precisely because the test subjects are not randomly assigned to their groups. For example, if the cohort in our herbal study consisted of people who took the supplement for health reasons, they may have already had higher rates of nausea than the other people in the sample. Or the cohort group could've been composed of people who shop at health food stores and have different diets or better access to healthcare. These factors that can affect results, in addition to the factor being studied, are known as confounding variables. These two major pitfalls, combined with more general dangers, such as conflicts of interest or selective use of data, can make the findings of any particular epidemiological study suspect, and a good study must go out of its way to prove that its authors have taken steps to eliminate these types of errors. But even when this has been done, the very nature of epidemiological studies, which examine differences between preexisting groups, rather than deliberately inducing changes within the same individuals, means that a single study can only demonstrate a correlation between a substance and a health outcome, rather than a true cause and effect relationship. At the end of the day, epidemiological studies have served as excellent guides to public health, alerting us to critical health hazards, such as smoking, asbestos, lead, and many more. But these were demonstrated through multiple, well-conducted epidemiological studies, all pointing in the same direction. So, the next time you see a headline about a new miracle cure or the terrible danger posed by an everyday substance, try to learn more about the original study and the limitations inherent in any epidemiological study or clinical trial before jumping to conclusions.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking about the validity of animal studies in providing definitive information about human health risks. The correct answer is "False", indicating that animal studies are not sufficient to provide definitive information about human health risks.

Among the generated MCQs, none directly ask about the validity of animal studies. However, Question 1 mentions the scientific gold standard for human studies, which is the randomized clinical trial (RCT), implying that other types of studies (such as animal studies) may not be as reliable.

But a closer match can be found in the fact that animal studies are mentioned in the transcript as being able to "point the way towards further research" but not being able to definitively determine how something will affect humans. This idea is related to the concept of epidemiological studies, which are discussed in Questions 3-9.

However, Question 3 is the closest match because it contrasts epidemiological studies with RCTs and mentions that RCTs are not always practical, which could be related to why animal studies are used in the first place.

But since none of the questions directly address the validity of animal studies, the closest match would be a question that addresses the limitations of non-RCT studies.

A more direct match can be found in Question 9, which addresses the main limitation of epidemiological studies. While it does not directly address animal studies, it does mention that epidemiological studies can only demonstrate a correlation, not a cause-and-effect relationship, which is similar to the idea that animal studies cannot provide definitive information about human health risks.

However, since the ground truth MCQ specifically addresses animal studies, and none of the generated MCQs directly address animal studies, the best match is not very close.

But if I had to choose, I would say that Question 9 is the closest match, as it addresses the limitations of non-RCT studies, which could be related to animal studies.

**Transcript**:
this is a representation of your brain and your brain can be broken into two parts uh there's the left half which is The Logical side and then the right half which is the intuitive and so if we add a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere then we can plot our brain and for example this would be somebody who's completely logical this would be someone who's entirely intuitive so where would you put your brain on this scale some of us may have opted for you know one of these extremes but I think for most people in the audience your brain is something like this with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time I mean it's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything you can be logical and intuitive and so I consider myself one of these people along with most of the other experimental Quantum physicists we need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas but at the same time we um we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work how do we develop this intuition well we like to play with stuff so we go out and play with it and then we see how it acts and then we develop our intuition from from there and you know really you do the same thing so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time I mean I even sound weird to think about uh one thing being in two different places at the same time but you weren't born with this notion you developed it you know I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop he was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it and he kept falling over but I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson and that's that large things don't let you get right past him and that they stay in one place and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world unless you're a particle physicist it'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist because well they don't play with car stops they play with these little little weird particles and when they play with their particles they finally do all sorts of really weird weird things like they can fly right through walls or they can be in two different places at the same time and so they wrote down all these observations and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics and so you know that's where physics was at a few years ago you needed quantum mechanics to describe little tiny particles but you didn't need it to describe the the large everyday objects around us this didn't really sit well with my intuition and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often well I mean I play with them sometimes but not very often um and I've never seen them I mean nobody's ever seen a particle but this it didn't sit well with my logical side either because if everything is made up of little little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics yeah I don't see any reason why it shouldn't and so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics so a few years ago I set off to do just that so I I made one this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical Quantum superp position so we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip and you can sort of see this Green Dot right in the middle and that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute this is a photograph of of the object and here I'm zoom in a little bit we're looking right there in the center and then here's a really really big closeup of the little piece of metal so what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal and it's shaped like a diving board and sticking out over a ledge and so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make computer chip I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours for the last step I had to build my own machine to make this swimming pool shaped hole underneath the device this device has the ability to be in a Quantum superp position but it needs a little help to do it here let me give you an analogy you know how comfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator I mean when I'm in elevator all alone I like do all sorts of weird things but then other people uh get on board bored and I stopped doing those things cuz I don't want to bother them or frankly scare them so quantum mechanics quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way the fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people but it's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the Heat of the room and so we knew if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave Quantum mechanically we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers and so that's what we did we turned the lights and then we put it in vacuum and sucked out all the air and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero now all alone in the elevator the little chunk of metal was free to act however it wanted and so we measured its motion we found it was moving in really weird ways instead of just sitting perfectly still it was vibrating and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this like expanding and Contracting Bellows and by giving it a gentle nudge we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics so what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time so let's think about the atoms so in one case all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are just sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down now it's only at precise times when they align the rest of of the time they're delocalized so that means that every atom is in two different places at the same time which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places I think this is really cool really it was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years um cuz check this out the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as a difference between that chunk of metal and you so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time that chunk of metal can be in two different places then then why not you I mean this is just my logical side talking so imagine if you were in multiple places at the same time what would that be like it's how would your Consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space there's one more part to the story is when we warmed it up and um we turned on the lights and looked inside the Box we saw that the piece of metal was still there in one piece and so you know I had to develop this new intuition that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just Quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected well that's not quite right it's actually it's more than that and it's deeper it's that those connections your connections to all the things around you literally Define who you are and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics thank you

this is a representation of your brain and your brain can be broken into two parts uh there's the left half which is The Logical side and then the right half which is the intuitive and so if we add a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere then we can plot our brain and for example this would be somebody who's completely logical this would be someone who's entirely intuitive so where would you put your brain on this scale some of us may have opted for you know one of these extremes but I think for most people in the audience your brain is something like this with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time I mean it's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything you can be logical and intuitive and so I consider myself one of these people along with most of the other experimental Quantum physicists we need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas but at the same time we um we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work how do we develop this intuition well we like to play with stuff so we go out and play with it and then we see how it acts and then we develop our intuition from from there and you know really you do the same thing so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time I mean I even sound weird to think about uh one thing being in two different places at the same time but you weren't born with this notion you developed it you know I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop he was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it and he kept falling over but I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson and that's that large things don't let you get right past him and that they stay in one place and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world unless you're a particle physicist it'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist because well they don't play with car stops they play with these little little weird particles and when they play with their particles they finally do all sorts of really weird weird things like they can fly right through walls or they can be in two different places at the same time and so they wrote down all these observations and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics and so you know that's where physics was at a few years ago you needed quantum mechanics to describe little tiny particles but you didn't need it to describe the the large everyday objects around us this didn't really sit well with my intuition and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often well I mean I play with them sometimes but not very often um and I've never seen them I mean nobody's ever seen a particle but this it didn't sit well with my logical side either because if everything is made up of little little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics yeah I don't see any reason why it shouldn't and so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics so a few years ago I set off to do just that so I I made one this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical Quantum superp position so we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip and you can sort of see this Green Dot right in the middle and that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute this is a photograph of of the object and here I'm zoom in a little bit we're looking right there in the center and then here's a really really big closeup of the little piece of metal so what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal and it's shaped like a diving board and sticking out over a ledge and so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make computer chip I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours for the last step I had to build my own machine to make this swimming pool shaped hole underneath the device this device has the ability to be in a Quantum superp position but it needs a little help to do it here let me give you an analogy you know how comfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator I mean when I'm in elevator all alone I like do all sorts of weird things but then other people uh get on board bored and I stopped doing those things cuz I don't want to bother them or frankly scare them so quantum mechanics quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the term coined by particle physicists to describe their observations, which is the theory of quantum mechanics.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 2, which asks about the term for the state of being in multiple places at the same time, as described in the context of quantum mechanics. Although this question is not directly related to the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest one in terms of topic relevance.

However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not include a question that directly asks about the term coined by particle physicists to describe their observations.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar, but with a low confidence level.

**Transcript**:
In 479 BC, when Persian soldiers besieged the Greek city of Potidaea, the tide retreated
much farther than usual, leaving a convenient invasion route. But this wasn't a stroke of luck. Before they had crossed halfway, the water returned in a wave higher
than anyone had ever seen, drowning the attackers. The Potiidaeans believed
they had been saved by the wrath of Poseidon. But what really saved them was likely the same phenomenon
that has destroyed countless others: a tsunami. Although tsunamis are commonly
known as tidal waves, they're actually unrelated
to the tidal activity caused by the gravitational forces
of the Sun and Moon. In many ways, tsunamis are just
larger versions of regular waves. They have a trough and a crest, and consist not of moving water, but the movement of energy through water. The difference is
in where this energy comes from. For normal ocean waves,
it comes from wind. Because this only affects the surface,
the waves are limited in size and speed. But tsunamis are caused by energy
originating underwater, from a volcanic eruption, a submarine landslide, or most commonly,
an earthquake on the ocean floor caused when the tectonic plates
of the Earth's surface slip, releasing a massive amount
of energy into the water. This energy travels up to the surface, displacing water and raising it above
the normal sea level, but gravity pulls it back down, which makes the energy ripple
outwards horizontally. Thus, the tsunami is born, moving at over 500 miles per hour. When it's far from shore,
a tsunami can be barely detectable since it moves through
the entire depth of the water. But when it reaches shallow water,
something called wave shoaling occurs. Because there is less water
to move through, this still massive amount
of energy is compressed. The wave's speed slows down, while its height rises
to as much as 100 feet. The word tsunami,
Japanese for "harbor wave," comes from the fact that it only seems
to appear near the coast. If the trough of a tsunami
reaches shore first, the water will withdraw
farther than normal before the wave hits, which can be misleadingly dangerous. A tsunami will not only drown
people near the coast, but level buildings and trees
for a mile inland or more, especially in low-lying areas. As if that weren't enough,
the water then retreats, dragging with it the newly created debris, and anything, or anyone,
unfortunate enough to be caught in its path. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the deadliest
natural disasters in history, killing over 200,000 people
throughout South Asia. So how can we protect ourselves
against this destructive force of nature? People in some areas have attempted to stop tsunamis
with sea walls, flood gates, and channels to divert the water. But these are not always effective. In 2011, a tsunami
surpassed the flood wall protecting Japan's Fukushima Power Plant, causing a nuclear disaster in addition to claiming over 18,000 lives. Many scientists and policy makers
are instead focusing on early detection, monitoring underwater pressure
and seismic activity, and establishing global
communication networks for quickly distributing alerts. When nature is too powerful to stop, the safest course
is to get out of its way.

But among the given options, Question 3 is the closest match because it talks about the movement of energy through the water, which is related to the concept of a wave being moving energy.

However, another generated MCQ, Question 2, has an option that directly addresses the nature of a wave. Option B in Question 2 states that normal ocean waves are caused by wind, while tsunamis are caused by underwater energy. This option implies that waves are moving energy, not water.

Considering the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 2 is a better match than Question 3.

**Transcript**:
In 479 BC, when Persian soldiers besieged the Greek city of Potidaea, the tide retreated
much farther than usual, leaving a convenient invasion route. But this wasn't a stroke of luck. Before they had crossed halfway, the water returned in a wave higher
than anyone had ever seen, drowning the attackers. The Potiidaeans believed
they had been saved by the wrath of Poseidon. But what really saved them was likely the same phenomenon
that has destroyed countless others: a tsunami. Although tsunamis are commonly
known as tidal waves, they're actually unrelated
to the tidal activity caused by the gravitational forces
of the Sun and Moon. In many ways, tsunamis are just
larger versions of regular waves. They have a trough and a crest, and consist not of moving water, but the movement of energy through water. The difference is
in where this energy comes from. For normal ocean waves,
it comes from wind. Because this only affects the surface,
the waves are limited in size and speed. But tsunamis are caused by energy
originating underwater, from a volcanic eruption, a submarine landslide, or most commonly,
an earthquake on the ocean floor caused when the tectonic plates
of the Earth's surface slip, releasing a massive amount
of energy into the water. This energy travels up to the surface, displacing water and raising it above
the normal sea level, but gravity pulls it back down, which makes the energy ripple
outwards horizontally. Thus, the tsunami is born, moving at over 500 miles per hour. When it's far from shore,
a tsunami can be barely detectable since it moves through
the entire depth of the water. But when it reaches shallow water,
something called wave shoaling occurs. Because there is less water
to move through, this still massive amount
of energy is compressed. The wave's speed slows down, while its height rises
to as much as 100 feet. The word tsunami,
Japanese for "harbor wave," comes from the fact that it only seems
to appear near the coast. If the trough of a tsunami
reaches shore first, the water will withdraw
farther than normal before the wave hits, which can be misleadingly dangerous. A tsunami will not only drown
people near the coast, but level buildings and trees
for a mile inland or more, especially in low-lying areas. As if that weren't enough,
the water then retreats, dragging with it the newly created debris, and anything, or anyone,
unfortunate enough to be caught in its path. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the deadliest
natural disasters in history, killing over 200,000 people
throughout South Asia. So how can we protect ourselves
against this destructive force of nature? People in some areas have attempted to stop tsunamis
with sea walls, flood gates, and channels to divert the water. But these are not always effective. In 2011, a tsunami
surpassed the flood wall protecting Japan's Fukushima Power Plant, causing a nuclear disaster in addition to claiming over 18,000 lives. Many scientists and policy makers
are instead focusing on early detection, monitoring underwater pressure
and seismic activity, and establishing global
communication networks for quickly distributing alerts. When nature is too powerful to stop, the safest course
is to get out of its way.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although the wording of Question 2 is not identical to the ground truth MCQ, the intent and content of the question are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks why 'tidal wave' is not an accurate name for a tsunami, and the correct answer is that it's unrelated to tidal forces. Question 2 asks about the difference between a tsunami and a normal ocean wave, and the correct answer is that tsunamis are caused by underwater energy, while normal ocean waves are caused by wind. This implies that tsunamis are not related to tidal forces, which is the same concept as the ground truth MCQ.

is used to do catalysis, it is used for a whole range of different things. So vanadium is the third of the transition
metals and, because it has more electrons, it has really quite interesting chemistry. It is also used in nature and there are a
number of mushrooms that are vanadium rich. The amavadins especially is one of the materials.
So here if we open, we can see on our reel is a very nice sample of vanadium wire. So
this is the elemental vanadium and as you can see it is about 0.1 mm in diameter and
there is 20 metres of it on this reel. Some of its compounds are very reactive. I
can remember that my lab mate Paul was working with a compound called vanadium hexacarbonyl.
He got a sample it was quite expensive, and he poured it, it came in a sealed glass vessel
so he cut open the glass and poured it out and before his eyes it burst into flames and
disappeared.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest the generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the oxidation states of vanadium, which is not explicitly mentioned in any of the generated MCQs. However, Question 6 mentions the "interesting chemistry" of vanadium due to its electron configuration, which is related to the concept of oxidation states.

But a more relevant question would be Question 7, as it mentions vanadium being the third of the transition metals, and the fact that vanadium has multiple oxidation states is a characteristic of transition metals.

However, the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent is not present. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 or Question 7 are the closest, but they are not similar enough to be considered a match.

If I really had to choose one, I would say:
 Question 6 or Question 7

So now you can see the reactionís really
going and itís really exothermic, weíre forming aluminium triiodide, and the
exotherm is actually heating and starting to sublime off the excess iodine
which you can see coming off as this really nice purple plume. Iodine is this beautifully-coloured element.
It has this beautiful purple colour. If you put it in solution, the colour
of the solution varies depending what you dissolve it in. If you
dissolve it in water, itís a sort-of dirty brown colour. If you dissolve it in
an organic material like chloroform or carbon tetrachloride it is a
beautiful purple colour. Iodine is halide, a halogen element from the
far right-hand side of the periodic table and it's strongly oxidising
in nature. Likes to nick electrons off other atoms, so what weíre going to do
is we are going to do a reaction with iodine, and today weíve ground
some iodine. So itís normally found from chemical suppliers as
really nice large crystals. But what we want to do as a reaction with it,
well we need to make sure that the surface area of the iodine is really,
really large so that all of it can react very very quickly with the other component. Iodine also occurs quite widely in nature
and is absolutely essential to life. If you donít have iodine, your thyroid
gland, which is a small gland that controls development of all sorts of
things in your body, doesnít operate properly. Nowadays, iodide is added
to table salt in countries like the UK and most other developed countries
so nearly everybody has enough iodine. In the old days iodine had
to be got from the environment and usually from the spray from
the sea that was blown across the land, and so in Nottingham, which
is really near the centre of England a long way from the sea, or relatively
long way from the sea, there were serious illnesses caused by people
not having enough iodine. So-called goiter, which caused a swelling,
the thyroid gland gets bigger, and this used to be called Derbyshire neck
this unpleasant illness, because it happened in this area of Nottingham
and Derbyshire. So what weíre going to do is that we are
going to mix it now with another element and that element is aluminium.
So aluminium has electrons to give away. Iodineís gonna nab
ëem. Going to see some oxidation chemistry in the formation of a
new compound, which is aluminium triiodide. Itís a really nice chemical
reaction. But the way that we do it is that we mix the two together and
we have to add water which acts a bit like solvent and also the oxygen
in the water activates the iodine so that it becomes more strongly oxidising
and then hopefully weíll see the new reaction. So Iím going to just
put some out into this small vessel. You can see this development effect of iodine
really well that if you had tadpoles, baby frogs, they donít develop
their legs and turn into frogs unless there is iodine in the water. The other component in this reaction is aluminium,
ok; and weíre using very, very finely powdered aluminium. Not
foil or not a rather large lump. This has been especially powdered for
us, so again it has a very, very high surface area. One of my favourite chemical equations is
ëtadpoles plus iodine goes to frogsí. So you can see the aluminium and
the iodine mixed within this solid mixture. Now still, these two components,
these two elements they are still held away from one another they
canít react. So what we need to do is add a small amount of water, which
actually acts like a solvent but actually activates the iodine and then
weíll wait and see what happens with the chemical reaction. Iodine can be used as a disinfectant, in fact
chlorine can be as well, but solution of iodine is often used when people
have cuts. So if you cut yourself, fortunately I havenít any cuts
at the moment, you can paint on iodine and because of its rather red colour
it made cuts often look much worse. Children would come home from school
and their whole hand would be red and this would cause some excitement
at home but it is quite an effective antiseptic. Water: just take a small amount and add it
to the reaction. So you can see itís starting to go now the chemical
reaction because we are seeing the excess iodine subliming in the form of
a vapour. Now if we go in close we can hear it fizzing because this
is actually an oxidation reaction and the formation of the new aluminium triiodide.
Now Iím going to just mix this slightly to try and increase the
rate of the chemical reaction slightly. So now you can see the reactionís
really going and itís really exothermic, weíre forming aluminium triiodide,
and the exotherm is actually heating and starting to sublime off
the excess iodine which you can see coming off as this really nice purple
plume. Now deep inside the reaction now you can see the exothermic or
the energy coming out and starting to cause a flame. Really, really
nice, really rapid chemical reaction: really beautiful. So weíre forming
aluminium triiodide here which again is a very, very delicate compound;
quite reactive in itself. So you can see now the really nice new crystalline
material. So, sadly, weíve managed to stain Stigís fume cupboard.
All of this really nice iodine forming a very fine layer across this
fume cupboard. What do you think about that? Looks like a thorough cleaning job coming
to be honest.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the purple plumes released from the vessel, and the correct answer is excess iodine vapor. Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 mentions the compound formed in the reaction, which is aluminium triiodide, but it does not directly relate to the purple plumes.

However, I noticed that the ground truth MCQ is related to the observation of the reaction, and Question 10 mentions the outcome of the reaction, which includes the formation of aluminium triiodide and the release of excess iodine (although not explicitly mentioned as purple plumes).

Considering the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest that Question 10 is the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not an exact match.

**Transcript**:
Tellurium is, is quite a nice element here.
I shall pick it up carefully. Tellurium. You’ve never had anything to do with this? Nothing to do with it in my life. So this
is a new one for me. This is tellurium powder. So let’s see what’s
inside the vial. So as we open it and tap out the glass vial. This one is going
to be stubborn. This bell shape here is a sample of tellurium.
The reason…shall I hold it for you? … so, a sample of tellurium. I’m
slightly cagey about touching this because as I think I explained with selenium
that, if you ingest tellurium into the body it can get into your sweat and make
you smell enough to really drive people mad. And these crystals like
this one can be cut up and mounted into a piece of apparatus like this. So a chemist won’t deal with all the elements
on the periodic table in his career normally. No, no, very few chemists will deal with more
than perhaps a handful of different elements. So this is
the tellurium and this is, again, this is very high standard material. 3 grams
of the tellurium material and you can see it’s a very dark powder at the
bottom of the vial. It was used in this piece of apparatus to
shine in an infrared laser that’s like a heat ray at one frequency and it came
out as twice the frequency. So you can use it to change the effect of
the lasers. Unfortunately the guy doing it didn’t make a very good job
of it and you can see he’s completely burnt the surface of this piece
of tellurium. So the main use of tellurium is as components like this for
laser optics and it’s not widely used in the chemical industry or similar areas.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Similar to its predecessor on the periodic table, selenium, what would be the problem if we were to touch a sample of tellurium with our hands?
Options: A. It is extremely corrosive, B. It would give a green color to our skin, C. It might give us a pungent smell
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQs**:
Question 1: What is the name of the element being discussed in the transcript? Options: A. Selenium, B. Tellurium, C. Laserium, D. Infraredium Correct Option: B
Question 2: According to the transcript, what happens if you ingest tellurium into your body? Options: A. It makes you stronger, B. It makes you smell bad, C. It has no effect, D. It makes you sick Correct Option: B
Question 3: What is the main use of tellurium, as mentioned in the transcript? Options: A. As a component in laser optics, B. As a component in chemical reactions, C. As a component in electrical circuits, D. As a component in medical equipment Correct Option: A
Question 4: What is the frequency of the infrared laser used in the experiment? Options: A. Twice the frequency of the input, B. The same frequency as the input, C. Half the frequency of the input, D. A random frequency Correct Option: A
Question 5: Why did the person conducting the experiment fail to achieve the desired result? Options: A. Because they didn't use enough tellurium, B. Because they didn't use the right equipment, C. Because they didn't make a good job of it, D. Because they didn't follow the instructions Correct Option: C

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 10. 

This question has a similar intent to the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the potential consequence of not handling tellurium properly. The correct option, "It can make you smell bad," is also similar to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ, "It might give us a pungent smell." 

While Question 2 also mentions the smell associated with tellurium, it asks about the consequence of ingesting tellurium, which is slightly different from the ground truth MCQ. Question 10 is a better match because it asks about the consequence of not handling tellurium properly, which is more similar to the ground truth MCQ's focus on touching a sample of tellurium with one's hands. 

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 10.

**Transcript**:
Tellurium is, is quite a nice element here.
I shall pick it up carefully. Tellurium. You’ve never had anything to do with this? Nothing to do with it in my life. So this
is a new one for me. This is tellurium powder. So let’s see what’s
inside the vial. So as we open it and tap out the glass vial. This one is going
to be stubborn. This bell shape here is a sample of tellurium.
The reason…shall I hold it for you? … so, a sample of tellurium. I’m
slightly cagey about touching this because as I think I explained with selenium
that, if you ingest tellurium into the body it can get into your sweat and make
you smell enough to really drive people mad. And these crystals like
this one can be cut up and mounted into a piece of apparatus like this. So a chemist won’t deal with all the elements
on the periodic table in his career normally. No, no, very few chemists will deal with more
than perhaps a handful of different elements. So this is
the tellurium and this is, again, this is very high standard material. 3 grams
of the tellurium material and you can see it’s a very dark powder at the
bottom of the vial. It was used in this piece of apparatus to
shine in an infrared laser that’s like a heat ray at one frequency and it came
out as twice the frequency. So you can use it to change the effect of
the lasers. Unfortunately the guy doing it didn’t make a very good job
of it and you can see he’s completely burnt the surface of this piece
of tellurium. So the main use of tellurium is as components like this for
laser optics and it’s not widely used in the chemical industry or similar areas.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the origin of the name "Tellurium", whereas the generated MCQs cover various aspects of Tellurium, such as its properties, uses, and handling.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the fact that it at least asks about the element Tellurium, I would select:

**Question 1: What is the name of the element being discussed in the transcript?**

This question is still quite different from the ground truth MCQ, but it is the closest match in terms of topic relevance.

So here we have tin, but this is a different
sample of tin from what people might be used to because most
people see tin in foil, or they think it is tin foil that they
use to wrap up the chicken, mostly that is aluminium foil. Tin has the symbol Sn because it comes from
the Latin word stannum which means tin and in fact if you
go to Devon in the southwest of England you will find that
some of the towns there are called stannary towns because
that’s where they used to mine and trade in tin. Tin has
a very old role in trade and in technology. Bronze which people
used in the old days was an alloy of tin and copper which
gave better swords than copper, so if you were fighting with
somebody who had a copper sword and you had a bronze one, you
won, at least if you were quick. Here we see a beautiful sample of tin metal
and you can see it is a really beautiful rod and it is packaged
in glass to stop oxidation, but you can see a beautiful silvery
shiny metal. Tin has also been used very widely for coating
the insides of iron and steel containers for food, that’s
why they are called tin even though they were made from iron but
they had a thin coating of tin on the surface, and tin
is also used very widely for solder, for putting together metal
components or electronic components. Lovely sample of tin, so we will pop that
back in and back into the drawer.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the melting point of tin, which is not mentioned in the transcript, and the options provided are specific temperatures.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 5: "What is the purpose of packaging tin in glass?" This question is related to the physical properties of tin, specifically its reactivity with air, which is mentioned in the transcript. However, it does not ask about the melting point of tin.

A more accurate answer would be "None of the above," as none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say:

Index: 5 (with a note that it's not a perfect match)

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] I'm a Sant or more precisely a high functioning autistic Sant it's a rare condition and uh where still when accompanied as in my case by self-awareness and a Mastery of language very often when I meet someone and they learn this about me there's a certain kind of awkwardness I can see it in their eyes they want to ask me something and in the end quite often the urge is stronger than they are and they blurted out if I give you my date of birth can you tell me what day of the week I was born on or they mention cube roots or um ask me to recite a long number or a long text I hope you'll forgive me if I don't perform a kind of one man Sant show for you today I uh am going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots a little deeper and a lot closer to my mind and work I want to talk to you briefly about perception when he was writing the plays and the short stories that would make his name Anton COV kept a notebook in which he noted down his observations of the world around him little details that other people seem to miss every time I recheck of and his unique vision of human life I'm reminded of why I too became a writer in my books I explore the nature of perception and how different kinds of perceiving create different kinds of knowing and understanding here are three questions drawn from my work rather than try to figure them out I'm going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your heart as you look at them for example the calculation can you feel where on a number line the solution is likely to fall or look at the foreign word and the sounds can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it's pointing you towards and in terms of the line of poetry why does the poet use the word hair rather than rabbit I'm asking you to do this because I believe that our personal perceptions you see are at the heart of how we acquire knowledge aesthetic judgments rather than abstract reasoning guide and shape the process by which we all come to know what we know I'm an extremist example of this my worlds of words and numbers blare with color emotion and personality as Juan said it's a condition that scientists call synesthesia an unusual cross talk between the senses here are the numbers 1 to 12 as I see them every number with its own shape and character one is is a flash of bright light six is a tiny and very sad black hole the sketches are in black and white here but in my mind they have colors three is green four is blue five is yellow I paint as well and here is one of my paintings it's a multiplication of two prime numbers three dimensional shapes and the space they create in the middle creates a new shape the answer to the sum what about bigger numbers well you can't get much bigger than Pi the mathematical constant it's an infinite number literally goes on forever in this painting that I made of the first 20 decimals of pi I take the colors And the emotions and the textures and I pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape but it's not only numbers that I see in colors words too for me have colors and emotions and textures and this is an opening phrase from the novel Lolita and narof was himself synesthetic and you can see here how my perception of the the sound L helps the alliteration to jump right out another example a little bit more mathematical and I wonder if some of you will notice the construction of the sentence from The Great Gatsby there is a procession of syllables wheat one prairies two lost swed towns three one 1 2 3 and this effect is very pleasant on the mind and it helps the sentence to feel right let's go back to the questions I posed you a moment ago um 64 multiplied by 75 if someone of you play chess you'll know that 64 is a square number and that's why chess boards 8 by 8 have 64 squares so that gives us a form that we can picture that we can perceive what about 75 well if 100 if we think of 100 as being like a square 75 would look like this so what we need to do now is put those two pictures together in our mind something like this 64 comes 6,400 and in the right hand corner you don't have to calculate anything four across four up and down it's 16 so what the sum is actually asking you to do is 16 16 16 that's a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do maths I'm sure it's uh 16 16 16 48 4800 4,8 00 the answer to the sum easier when you know how the second question was an Icelandic word I'm assuming there are not many people here who speak Icelandic so let me narrow the choices down to twoin is it a happy word or a sad word what do you say happy okay some people say it's happy most people a majority of people say sad and it actually mean sad why do statistically a majority of people say that a word is sad in this case heavy in other cases in my theory language evolves in such a way that sound match correspond with the subjective with the personal intuitive experience of The Listener let's have a look at the the third question it's a line from a poem by John Keat words like numbers Express fundamental relationships between objects and events and forces that constitute our world it stands to reason that we existing in this world should in the course of Our Lives absorb intuitively those relationships and Poets like other artists play with those intuitive understandings in the case of hair it's an ambiguous sound in English it can also mean the fibers that grow from our head and if we think of that we put the picture up the fibers represent vulnerability uh they yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion so um what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension the hair itself the animal not the cat not a dog a hair why a hair because think of the picture not the word the picture the overlong ears the overlarge feet helps us to picture to feel intuitively what it means to limp and to tremble so in these few minutes I hope I've been able to share a little bit of my vision of things and to show you that words can have colors and emotions numbers shapes and personalities the world is richer vaster than it too often seems to be I hope that that uh I've given you the desire to learn to see the world with new eyes thank you

**Transcript**:
We like to think of romantic feelings as spontaneous and indescribable
things that come from the heart. But it's actually your brain running a complex series of calculations
within a matter of seconds that's responsible
for determining attraction. Doesn't sound quite as poetic, does it? But just because the calculations
are happening in your brain doesn't mean those warm,
fuzzy feelings are all in your head. In fact, all five
of your senses play a role, each able to vote for,
or veto, a budding attraction. The eyes are the first
components in attraction. Many visual beauty standards vary
between cultures and eras, and signs of youth,
fertility and good health, such as long lustrous hair, or smooth, scar-free skin, are almost always in demand because they're associated
with reproductive fitness. And when the eyes spot
something they like, our instinct is to move closer so the other senses can investigate. The nose's contribution to romance is more than noticing perfume or cologne. It's able to pick up
on natural chemical signals known as pheromones. These not only convey important physical or genetic information
about their source but are able to activate a physiological
or behavioral response in the recipient. In one study, a group of women at different points
in their ovulation cycles wore the same T-shirts for three nights. After male volunteers
were randomly assigned to smell either one of the worn shirts,
or a new unworn one, saliva samples showed
an increase in testosterone in those who had smelled a shirt worn
by an ovulating woman. Such a testosterone boost may give a man the nudge to pursue a woman he might not have otherwise noticed. A woman's nose is particularly attuned to MHC molecules,
which are used to fight disease. In this case, opposites attract. When a study asked women to smell T-shirts
that had been worn by different men, they preferred the odors of those
whose MHC molecules differed from theirs. This makes sense. Genes that result in a greater
variety of immunities may give offspring
a major survival advantage. Our ears also determine attraction. Men prefer females
with high-pitched, breathy voices, and wide formant spacing,
correlated with smaller body size. While women prefer low-pitched voices
with a narrow formant spacing that suggest a larger body size. And not surprisingly, touch turns out to be crucial for romance. In this experiment,
not realizing the study had begun, participants were asked
to briefly hold the coffee, either hot or iced. Later, the participants read a story
about a hypothetical person, and were asked to rate their personality. Those who had held the hot cup of coffee perceived the person
in the story as happier, more social, more generous
and better-natured than those who had held
the cup of iced coffee, who rated the person as cold,
stoic, and unaffectionate. If a potential mate has managed
to pass all these tests, there's still one more: the infamous first kiss, a rich and complex exchange
of tactile and chemical cues, such as the smell of one's breath, and the taste of their mouth. This magical moment is so critical
that a majority of men and women have reported losing
their attraction to someone after a bad first kiss. Once attraction is confirmed,
your bloodstream is flooded with norepinephrine, activating your fight or flight system. Your heart beats faster, your pupils dilate, and your body releases glucose
for additional energy, not because you're in danger
but because your body is telling you that something important is happening. To help you focus, norepinephrine creates
a sort of tunnel vision, blocking out surrounding distractions, possibly even warping your sense of time, and enhancing your memory. This might explain why people
never forget their first kiss. The idea of so much of our attraction being influenced by chemicals
and evolutionary biology may seem cold and scientific
rather than romantic, but the next time
you see someone you like, try to appreciate how your entire body
is playing matchmaker to decide if that beautiful
stranger is right for you.

something they like, our instinct is to move closer so the other senses can investigate. The nose's contribution to romance is more than noticing perfume or cologne. It's able to pick up
on natural chemical signals known as pheromones. These not only convey important physical or genetic information
about their source but are able to activate a physiological
or behavioral response in the recipient. In one study, a group of women at different points
in their ovulation cycles wore the same T-shirts for three nights. After male volunteers
were randomly assigned to smell either one of the worn shirts,
or a new unworn one, saliva samples showed
an increase in testosterone in those who had smelled a shirt worn
by an ovulating woman. Such a testosterone boost may give a man the nudge to pursue a woman he might not have otherwise noticed. A woman's nose is particularly attuned to MHC molecules,
which are used to fight disease. In this case, opposites attract. When a study asked women to smell T-shirts
that had been worn by different men, they preferred the odors of those
whose MHC molecules differed from theirs. This makes sense. Genes that result in a greater
variety of immunities may give offspring
a major survival advantage. Our ears also determine attraction. Men prefer females
with high-pitched, breathy voices, and wide formant spacing,
correlated with smaller body size. While women prefer low-pitched voices
with a narrow formant spacing that suggest a larger body size. And not surprisingly, touch turns out to be crucial for romance. In this experiment,
not realizing the study had begun, participants were asked
to briefly hold the coffee, either hot or iced. Later, the participants read a story
about a hypothetical person, and were asked to rate their personality. Those who had held the hot cup of coffee perceived the person
in the story as happier, more social, more generous
and better-natured than those who had held
the cup of iced coffee, who rated the person as cold,
stoic, and unaffectionate. If a potential mate has managed
to pass all these tests, there's still one more: the infamous first kiss, a rich and complex exchange
of tactile and chemical cues, such as the smell of one's breath, and the taste of their mouth. This magical moment is so critical
that a majority of men and women have reported losing
their attraction to someone after a bad first kiss. Once attraction is confirmed,
your bloodstream is flooded with norepinephrine, activating your fight or flight system. Your heart beats faster, your pupils dilate, and your body releases glucose
for additional energy, not because you're in danger
but because your body is telling you that something important is happening. To help you focus, norepinephrine creates
a sort of tunnel vision, blocking out surrounding distractions, possibly even warping your sense of time, and enhancing your memory. This might explain why people
never forget their first kiss. The idea of so much of our attraction being influenced by chemicals
and evolutionary biology may seem cold and scientific
rather than romantic, but the next time
you see someone you like, try to appreciate how your entire body
is playing matchmaker to decide if that beautiful
stranger is right for you.

**Transcript**:
I'm going to tell you a fable. A king, growing old, has two daughters and wants to partition his land. He goes to his counsellor and says 'Counsellor, I have four pieces of land and two daughters and I want to partition my land equally amongst my daughters. My surveyor says that the land masses I have are of this shape: I have one triangular piece of land and it has a square angle here. 'A right angle' says the counsellor, 'you have a right angled triangle.'
'Ahh a right angled triangle. And then I have a square piece of land whose edge is the side of the longest side of my triangle. And I have another whose edge is the side of this side of the triangle; and a third the side of this side of the triangle. The surveyor tells me they're all squares.' The counsellor says 
'Oh, no problem, don't be one of these foolish kings who gives away all your land. Keep that triangular piece for yourself, give the largest square to one of your daughters and the two small squares to the other daughter, it'll be perfectly even.' 'That's easy!' since the king and he's about to leave but then says
'Counsellor, I haven't told you anything about how long the sides of these squares are, or the shape of the triangle'
Counsellor says 'Don't worry. What we have here is three squares, one triangle. If the edges of these pieces of land are doubled all the areas get multiplied by four, if they're tripled all the areas get multiplied by nine, that's three squared. If you changed all the lengths of your figures by some factor the area is changed by the square of the factor and so the proportions are exactly the same.' Counsellor says 
'This is called scaling and similarity. If you scale your figures in this way you get similar figures, scaling a length by some factor scales the area by the square.' 
'Wonderful!' says the King. King walks away but even before he leaves the room he says 'But I didn't tell you what the angles were 
of the triangle.' Counsellor says 'Uh, that doesn't matter. What we have here is something called the Pythagorean theorem; it doesn't matter what the angles are as long as one of those angles is a right angle.' King leaves. Returns the next day distraught and says 'My surveyor tells me I don't have squares I have things that he called blobs! That is I have a triangle, a right angled triangle, I have three fields each landmass has one linear edge - the linear edge equal to the edge of the corresponding edge of the triangle - and he also tells me that my blobs are similar. If I scale any one of these blobs appropriately it will become any of the others. Now what do I do?' asks the King apprehensively and the counsellor says 'No problem. Do exactly as before. You keep your triangle, give the larger- largest blob mass to one of your daughters and the other two to the other daughter and it'll be even Steven.
The king is amazed. He says 'It doesn't matter what blob they are as long as they're similar?' 
Counsellor says yes. 'What do you call that?' 
says the King. 'Oh I call that the blob Pythagorean theorem.' 'For every blob there's a blob Pythagorean theorem?' says the King' 'Strange.' The counsellor says 
'Yes, and not only that but if you know the blob Pythagorean theorem for any blob you know it for every blob.' The king says 'How? How can that be?' 
Well the counsellor says 'Look, look at this: you have three blobs here, imagine that there's what I'll call a unit blob, that's to say a blob that's similar to it but its length is 1. Let us say the length of its straight edge is 1. 
Why then, if the length of this straight edge is c and the length of this straight edge is a and the length of this straight edge is b, then we know that whatever area this blob has - what do you call the
area of that blob? Capital A, the area 
of the unit blob. The area of this blob is the square of the factor that one needs in order to scale the unit blob to it, so the area will be c squared times A. The area of this will be a squared times A and the area this will be b squared times A. So if I prove to you that for some blob with some area A, this large blob is the sum in area of the areas of these two small ones, what I will have shown is c squared times A is equal to a squared times A plus b squared times A; and cancelling out the A's I have c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared and so if you give me any other blob I will get exactly the same result.' 'So one blob Pythagorean theorem implies Pythagorean theorem for all blobs?' says the King and he leaves sort of contented. King
comes in, day three, and he says 'It's wonderful what you've told me, what you've explained to me, but can you show me the blob Pythagorean theorem for some blob in which case I'll know it for all?' Counsellor says 'Oh well, for that you have to draw me a right-angled triangle.' And the counsellor says 'Ah well, so my job then would be to produce a blob with a linear side of length c, a blob with a linear side of length b, that blob being similar to the blob of length c, and a blob with length a similar for the other two; and then I will have to show you that the area of the larger- largest of these blobs is the sum of the area of the other two blobs.' The king says 'Well, yes, this might be quite a chore.' The counsellor
says 'Well, try this-' Counsellor draws a
single line which meets the large side in a right angle. And then steps back and says 
'There you are.' 'Where am I?' says the king. 
'The blob whose linear edge is c is the entire triangle. The blob whose linear edge is b is the triangle to the right. The blob whose linear edge is a is the triangle to the
left. All these triangles are right-angled triangles because one of their angles is a right angle. Each of these triangles have another angle in common; for example this large triangle has this angle in common with this one, and it has this angle in common with this one. All three right angle triangles are similar. So those are my three blobs and to see that the sum of the two small blobs is equal to the large blob is evident.' King says 'Ah.' Okay so now what's my moral? Can you
guess? (Brady: I dunno, that kings ask a
lot of questions?)

I'd love to be the compassionate teacher; the tough, but fair teacher. But to my brilliant young minds, these scholars for whom I'd stand up at all costs, I'm the sweaty teacher. Not the compassionate teacher who, hey, by the way, happens to sweat, or even the teacher who sweats. No. The sweaty teacher. Adjective, sweaty purposefully coming before noun, teacher, as if to say, "This is Mr. Lamb. Do not define him by the profession he devotes his life to. Define him by the geysers he calls armpits." Every morning, I wake up in a cold... nevermind. The easy-going teacher says, "I shouldn't sweat it." The loud teacher says, "YEAH YOU SHOULDN'T SWEAT IT!" But even the empathetic teacher doesn't understand. I've got funny teacher potential. I used to pretend the notes I confiscated in class were thank you letters. Acknowledgements of my great teaching. "Oh ho ho, you shouldn't have!" Until I intercepted one about a Mr. Stank Pits. No, really. You shouldn't have. Ever since I've started developing quirky habits to deflect attention, to become someone new: the teacher who shrugs his shoulders really aggressively. The teacher who tucks his tie into his pants and pulls the end out his fly because he's so wacky. But it's no use. Because I had the sweaty teacher, too, for geography. And to this day I cannot remember the capital of Bulgaria, and the two bodies of water I know the most about sat below his shoulders. And now, I'm the one looking like I've got the Atlantic and Pacific in headlocks. The one being asked, "How was the dunk tank?" "There was no dunk tank! We live in New Orleans and it is humid!" is how I'd respond if I was the angry teacher. Instead, I look the kid in the eye as the sweat cascades down my nose, and splatters onto his blank paper below, and I say, "I sweat because I am working my tail off and I need you to do the same."

**Transcript**:
We are here in the basement of the Royal Society
in London, The Royal Society is the UK National Academy for Sciences and we are here because
there is an exhibition about Rutherford. We are interested in the element Rutherfordium
which is right here at the bottom of the periodic table number 104, and with these elements
only tiny amounts, relatively few atoms have been made so we can’t tell you about how
it is used in light bulbs or something like that because it has not been used for anything.
People are really excited if they make one or two atoms of it. So instead we are going
to tell you a bit about Rutherford after whom it’s named. And Rutherford is famous because
he did a whole series of experiments, or he and his co-workers, that really explained
the structure of atoms and so the periodic table for the first time really began to make
sense. Over here you can see there is a picture of Rutherford here in his lab with one of
his co-workers and this is a very famous picture. Rutherford, who came from New Zealand, had
a very loud voice and the experiments were rather sensitive, if you talked too loud the
apparatus started shaking and it did not work properly, so his students put up a big notice
in the lab saying talk softly please. But I am not sure that it stopped him and I use
this picture when I am talking to my students about safety, you’ve always got to be really
safe when you are working as a chemist. First of all you can see that Rutherford is smoking
in the lab and then he is not wearing safety glasses, nor is his colleague, and then they
have a whole series of wires and all sorts of things to trip over. So it is really surprising
that they managed to get their experiments to work without some sort of serious accident.
Perhaps they did break things and never told us about it. Anyway Rutherford’s work was
recognised by him winning the Nobel Prize and here, and it is quite exciting, there
is a replica of the Nobel Prize. The Nobel Prize is a gold medal but here they have shown
it as two half-medals, underneath there is nothing to see, so you can see both of the
sides. So on one side there is the portrait of Alfred Nobel, whose money and foundation,
still to this day, pays for prize money, when he received this it would have been presented
to him by the Swedish King in a huge ceremony in Stockholm. Now what I can’t remember
is whether he got the Nobel Prize for physics or chemistry. I have a feeling… Chemistry! Yes. I have a feeling that he got it for chemistry
which was particularly funny because Rutherford didn’t like chemistry. He said that there
is just physics and stamp collecting and he did not really respect chemistry so perhaps
the chemists got their revenge by giving him the Nobel Prize for chemistry. Now Rutherford had very strong views about
the hours his students should work and they were not allowed to work after 6 o’clock
at night in the lab and his chief technician would go round the lab at 6 o’clock and
switch off all the apparatus and chase everybody out of the lab. And even though they did this,
11 of his students won Nobel Prizes; this must be one of the records for any single
research group to this day. And of course when they went home having had dinner and
drank wine in the college then they started working writing papers. But it is very interesting
that if you read letters from visiting American scientists they could not understand how Rutherford’s
lab was so successful because the people came in at 10 o’clock in the morning they went
home at 6, and did not seem to do any work at all, but they discovered all these wonderful
things. What’s your policy on your students working
then? Well I always encourage my students to work
but I find that if I encourage them too hard, it has the opposite effect, just like parents
telling children to do their homework but by and large when people are enthusiastic
about their science it is difficult to stop them working too much. As part of this exhibition they have got some
postcards of Rutherford and this one has got, I think it is really terrific, shows Rutherford
in the sea. But I really like this because it shows that famous scientists sometimes
take time off and they don’t always behave like white-coated figures in labs, but they
do have a human side as well.

recognised by him winning the Nobel Prize and here, and it is quite exciting, there
is a replica of the Nobel Prize. The Nobel Prize is a gold medal but here they have shown
it as two half-medals, underneath there is nothing to see, so you can see both of the
sides. So on one side there is the portrait of Alfred Nobel, whose money and foundation,
still to this day, pays for prize money, when he received this it would have been presented
to him by the Swedish King in a huge ceremony in Stockholm. Now what I can’t remember
is whether he got the Nobel Prize for physics or chemistry. I have a feeling… Chemistry! Yes. I have a feeling that he got it for chemistry
which was particularly funny because Rutherford didn’t like chemistry. He said that there
is just physics and stamp collecting and he did not really respect chemistry so perhaps
the chemists got their revenge by giving him the Nobel Prize for chemistry. Now Rutherford had very strong views about
the hours his students should work and they were not allowed to work after 6 o’clock
at night in the lab and his chief technician would go round the lab at 6 o’clock and
switch off all the apparatus and chase everybody out of the lab. And even though they did this,
11 of his students won Nobel Prizes; this must be one of the records for any single
research group to this day. And of course when they went home having had dinner and
drank wine in the college then they started working writing papers. But it is very interesting
that if you read letters from visiting American scientists they could not understand how Rutherford’s
lab was so successful because the people came in at 10 o’clock in the morning they went
home at 6, and did not seem to do any work at all, but they discovered all these wonderful
things. What’s your policy on your students working
then? Well I always encourage my students to work
but I find that if I encourage them too hard, it has the opposite effect, just like parents
telling children to do their homework but by and large when people are enthusiastic
about their science it is difficult to stop them working too much. As part of this exhibition they have got some
postcards of Rutherford and this one has got, I think it is really terrific, shows Rutherford
in the sea. But I really like this because it shows that famous scientists sometimes
take time off and they don’t always behave like white-coated figures in labs, but they
do have a human side as well.

**Transcript**:
So we’re in the basement of the Royal Society
in London. This is the UK Academy of Sciences. They have exhibitions
here telling people about interesting things about science, and so we
have come here because there’s a really interesting exhibit relevant
to the work of Lawrence who was the person after whom the element Lawrencium
was named after. Lawrencium is another one of the elements
right at the bottom of the periodic table which are really heavy, very
radioactive. They fall to pieces very rapidly. So chemists are very,
and physicists are very lucky if they just make a few atoms of this. So
there’s nothing to tell you about the uses of lawrencium, because nobody’s
made enough lawrencium to use it for anything, except
as the subject of scientific papers and physical measurements. So instead
I want to show you here a piece of equipment which is very similar
to the sort of equipment that Lawrence used when he was doing his pioneering
work in Berkeley, California, close to San Francisco. So let’s
go along here. Lawrence was famous for inventing an instrument
called the Cyclotron which was for accelerating electrons to very
high speeds. It was in fact the precursor of the large Hadron Collider
which everybody’s now talking about. But he thought of it I think one day
in the library in Berkeley, and he imagined to begin with an instrument that
was literally as big as my two hands here, a few inches across, and his
idea was that if you made a vessel which was quite flat and circular
not very high and put in it a big magnetic field the electrons could go round
and round and round, and be accelerated to go faster and faster. The idea
was that he made one and demonstrated the principle and he patented
it and then he built bigger and bigger and bigger machines and as he made
them, not only did the disc get bigger, but at the same time the
magnet got bigger as well. And the final magnet that he made in Berkeley,
which was installed just before the Second World War, was so large
that a large part of his research group could sit between the poles
of the magnet and it’s so heavy that the magnet is still there to this
day. But come and look over here. This is a Cyclotron that was built in
Cambridge. The first thing that strikes you is that it doesn’t look very
exciting. It’s two copper discs, which are not actually connected together
and the voltage is switched between one disc and the other so as the electron
goes round when it gets to the end of one you switch the voltage
so it goes on being accelerated and it goes round and round, and
as it goes round in a magnetic field the faster it goes the bigger
the circle. So it goes round and round and round in a larger and larger
circle until the end it flies out of one of these tubes. I think again that
it is important to say that some of these historic physics experiments, which
are so important to both chemistry and physics, were done with equipment
that really looks surprisingly simple and it is the really clever
ideas that have been so important to physics and chemistry rather
than always having enormously complicated apparatus. Sometimes
to take these ideas to their full extreme you do need complicated
apparatus but that’s not the starting point. Well I’ve read quite a bit about him. He
was meant to be a very egotistical person and a real control freak,
but my father-in-law worked in Lawrence’s research group. When he was
an English undergraduate he was sent to America during the Second World
War to work in Lawrence’s group on the enrichment of uranium isotopes.
That is, concentrating Uranium-235, the less-common isotope which
was the basis for the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. So John Keane, my father-in-law, worked in
the research group, I don’t know exactly what he did, but it’s really
quite a sobering thought that during the Second World War some of the brightest
scientists had to work on these terrible projects really in
order to save their countries. And let us hope that these such things never
happen again.

**Transcript**:
rhenium is in the same group as manganese in the periodic table but quite surprisingly it was only discovered in 1925 so my father was 15 years old when it was discovered so it's a very recent discovery compared to many of the other elements I think because it's quite rare and it is also quite hard to separate rhenium let's look at the rhenium looks like so this is a sample of rhenium okay this is a very very nice metal often used in catalysis from the middle of the transition metal group and here you see the very very dark black coloration of this very very fine wire of rhenium so I'd never seen a sample of metallic rhenium until about a month ago when I was given some as a present so here's the sample it's quite a nice silvery metal and what surprising is that it's really very heavy because elements low down on the periodic table are very dense and we can demonstrate this by weighing it let me compare the rhenium with the pile of five American 10 cent pieces five dimes so this is half a dollar and you can see this is bigger than that considerably so if we weigh the coins you can see it weighs just a bit more than 11 grams eleven point three grams which is quite reasonable because they're made out of copper and nickel and if we now take these off and put on the rhenium which is a smaller lump of metal you can see that it weighs more than 16 grams so it's a really very dense metal we give someone a little little shot of rhenium as a present so this comes from the managing director Nicoll Lippmann who make or supply rare metals and he came to give me an interview for a magazine and he gave me a sample of this element so I was really excited he gave it to me in this bag together with the analysis of the element and it's 99.9% pure and inside is a piece of paper with the complete analytical data I was really very excited and especially because I was not expecting a present we're always taught metals in the same group of the periodic table like manganese and rhenium are very similar so I was expecting that the salts of rhenium would be very similar to the salts of manganese but I was really surprised when I was told that the company also supplied a salt per renate so I already knew that the manganese salt permanganate had this terrific purple color so here you can see it dissolved in water and next to it you can see the solid that's almost black so these are manganese salts so I was expecting a terrific color from the rhenium salt and the rhenium salt is a really boring white this is per renate with rhenium in it and the reason why it's white which I understood afterwards is because the color comes from the energy of the electrons in the iron and in rhenium the difference in energy between the different levels for the electron is much bigger so instead of absorbing visible light and looking colored it absorbs ultraviolet light which we don't notice so big disappointment Perrine 8 is white rhenium in recent years has become an extremely important element for making aircraft engine particularly jet engines and aircraft and at the same time as giving me this sample of rhenium I was given this object here this is a turbine blade from the front end of a really quite sophisticated jet engine now it's a used turbine blade and you can see there's a large slot has been cut in it to stop people selling this used blade to be put back into jet engines so this is right in the middle of the engine just after the combustion chamber where the fuel has burnt so the temperature is very high and this is spinning round very fast so there are enormous stresses on this metal the temperature is probably about 1,600 degrees centigrade or even higher and most metals were just melt or they would become so floppy they would stretch as they spun round and this is made from a special alloy which has quite a lot of nickel in it but the magic ingredient is rhenium that makes it stronger but what I find particularly surprising about this is that this whole blade is a single crystal of metal because if you have a lump of metal the weak part is between the different crystals that make up the lump but if you grow a single crystal it has no weaknesses and it's very very much stronger so this is an amazing piece of engineering because if you look closely you can see it's Hollow so they have grown a single crystal which has a hole inside so they can blow air through it to keep it cool to stop it getting quite as hot as it might do otherwise and so the lamp of rhenium that I was given actually came from recycled turbine blades because really is quite a rare element and once you put them in the turbine blades when you service the engine you get the turbine blades back and you can recycle the rhenium metal and if we didn't do that it would soon run out because there aren't very large supplies of rhenium in the longer term rhenium may have quite useful applications in a variety of solar cells and perhaps as catalysts for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen but at the moment the major technical application is in making these special alloys it is called rhenium because it was discovered in Germany and the rhenium is derived from the name of the River Rhine which flows through Germany there are other rivers in Germany though wide the Rhine get I have no idea

**Transcript**:
rhenium is in the same group as manganese in the periodic table but quite surprisingly it was only discovered in 1925 so my father was 15 years old when it was discovered so it's a very recent discovery compared to many of the other elements I think because it's quite rare and it is also quite hard to separate rhenium let's look at the rhenium looks like so this is a sample of rhenium okay this is a very very nice metal often used in catalysis from the middle of the transition metal group and here you see the very very dark black coloration of this very very fine wire of rhenium so I'd never seen a sample of metallic rhenium until about a month ago when I was given some as a present so here's the sample it's quite a nice silvery metal and what surprising is that it's really very heavy because elements low down on the periodic table are very dense and we can demonstrate this by weighing it let me compare the rhenium with the pile of five American 10 cent pieces five dimes so this is half a dollar and you can see this is bigger than that considerably so if we weigh the coins you can see it weighs just a bit more than 11 grams eleven point three grams which is quite reasonable because they're made out of copper and nickel and if we now take these off and put on the rhenium which is a smaller lump of metal you can see that it weighs more than 16 grams so it's a really very dense metal we give someone a little little shot of rhenium as a present so this comes from the managing director Nicoll Lippmann who make or supply rare metals and he came to give me an interview for a magazine and he gave me a sample of this element so I was really excited he gave it to me in this bag together with the analysis of the element and it's 99.9% pure and inside is a piece of paper with the complete analytical data I was really very excited and especially because I was not expecting a present we're always taught metals in the same group of the periodic table like manganese and rhenium are very similar so I was expecting that the salts of rhenium would be very similar to the salts of manganese but I was really surprised when I was told that the company also supplied a salt per renate so I already knew that the manganese salt permanganate had this terrific purple color so here you can see it dissolved in water and next to it you can see the solid that's almost black so these are manganese salts so I was expecting a terrific color from the rhenium salt and the rhenium salt is a really boring white this is per renate with rhenium in it and the reason why it's white which I understood afterwards is because the color comes from the energy of the electrons in the iron and in rhenium the difference in energy between the different levels for the electron is much bigger so instead of absorbing visible light and looking colored it absorbs ultraviolet light which we don't notice so big disappointment Perrine 8 is white rhenium in recent years has become an extremely important element for making aircraft engine particularly jet engines and aircraft and at the same time as giving me this sample of rhenium I was given this object here this is a turbine blade from the front end of a really quite sophisticated jet engine now it's a used turbine blade and you can see there's a large slot has been cut in it to stop people selling this used blade to be put back into jet engines so this is right in the middle of the engine just after the combustion chamber where the fuel has burnt so the temperature is very high and this is spinning round very fast so there are enormous stresses on this metal the temperature is probably about 1,600 degrees centigrade or even higher and most metals were just melt or they would become so floppy they would stretch as they spun round and this is made from a special alloy which has quite a lot of nickel in it but the magic ingredient is rhenium that makes it stronger but what I find particularly surprising about this is that this whole blade is a single crystal of metal because if you have a lump of metal the weak part is between the different crystals that make up the lump but if you grow a single crystal it has no weaknesses and it's very very much stronger so this is an amazing piece of engineering because if you look closely you can see it's Hollow so they have grown a single crystal which has a hole inside so they can blow air through it to keep it cool to stop it getting quite as hot as it might do otherwise and so the lamp of rhenium that I was given actually came from recycled turbine blades because really is quite a rare element and once you put them in the turbine blades when you service the engine you get the turbine blades back and you can recycle the rhenium metal and if we didn't do that it would soon run out because there aren't very large supplies of rhenium in the longer term rhenium may have quite useful applications in a variety of solar cells and perhaps as catalysts for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen but at the moment the major technical application is in making these special alloys it is called rhenium because it was discovered in Germany and the rhenium is derived from the name of the River Rhine which flows through Germany there are other rivers in Germany though wide the Rhine get I have no idea

This is tungsten, I think. Tungsten is a very hard and heavy element.
It has a number of very important uses. It is used in the filament of light bulbs, the
ordinary sort of light bulbs because it has more or less the highest boiling point of
any element and therefore you can use it as the filament and it can get very hot without
very much evaporation on to the walls. If you add iodine in the gas around the bulb
you can run it at even higher temperatures, the so called quartz halogen lamps and sometimes
you see these in up-market cars. Yes, it’s tungsten. So this is tungsten.
Tungsten is used as an element material to form the very, very fine wire that we may
have used in old-style electric light bulbs. It is a really quite wonderful metal and it
is actually used in nature. But here we have a really quite beautiful sample. This is a
single crystal of tungsten which is mounted. Tungsten carbide, the compound of tungsten
and carbon is used in the very tip, the balls in the tip of a biro pen or ball point pen. Really quite amazing. I have got some other
tungsten here somewhere and in fact here is a very fine wire of tungsten and this is precisely
the material which was used in the formation of very early electric light bulbs. A really
quite amazing metal. There is also quite a nice book by Oliver
Sacks, who is an Englishman who now lives in America, called Uncle Tungsten. There are
not many books that have chemical names in the title and this is a story of his childhood
and how chemistry really had a big effect on him. That’s lovely.

**Transcript**:
Ok, so thulium is a very expensive lanthanide.
It’s very expensive because it’s very hard to separate it from
its neighbours. The lanthanides from the left to right undergo this contraction
where they get smaller and smaller and over on the right-hand-side
at this point that they are all of a very similar size. Now we can separate
them now but it is quite difficult to do and therefore quite expensive,
so thulium is not used very often. However thulium, as well as being able
to obtain the plus-3 oxidation state, it is also one of those ones
which can obtain the plus-2 oxidation state, which means that chemists
are now beginning to find uses for it which they hadn’t expected before.
So you may see the use of thulium increase in years to come. Because
it’s very hard to isolate because it’s of a very similar size to its
neighbours, it took a guy called Charles James, in 1911, a famous 15,000 times
of recrystalization to isolate thulium in a pure, albeit as a chloride,
but a pure nonetheless, compound for the first time.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How many recrystallizations did it take for Charles James to obtain a pure thulium compound for the first time in 1911?

**Transcript**:
Lovely! I’ve just realised that erbium is the most
crucial element for the internet of all the elements on the periodic table,
and so I want to take you across to materials engineering where we can
see a demonstration which will explain to you why it’s so important,
and why without erbium many of you couldn’t be watching this video. Erbium is another lanthanide metal. It’s
soft, silvery, quite malleable, very reactive towards oxygen and water and,
I suppose, for us right now it’s quite significant, because it was originally
discovered from a mineral which was found in this quarry. So we’re
in a quarry in Sweden near Stockholm, called Ytterby Mine and some black
minerals that were found in this quarry actually were the birthplace
for four new chemical elements and erbium was one of them. Erbium is a photographic filter and it is
actually a nuclear poison. What that means is that it will kill dead any nuclear
fission process so it’s obviously got some applications there. It’s
an interesting element when you make compounds of it and dissolve it in
solution it often goes pink. Now this is some erbium trichloride. You’ll
notice it’s very slightly pink. I think this is one of the ones that, because
of its pink colourations, get’s used in jewellery and things like sunglasses
and things like that, if memory serves. More recently erbium is used as an amplifier
of light as it’s transmitted down optical fibres. So, the reason we are here, and why I’m
all dressed up, these are the fibres that transmit the signals for the internet.
Now the reason they use fibres is because copper cables which you
would normally use for electrical signals cannot carry nearly as
much information, as many YouTube viewings at once, as one of these
fibres. And the fibre is very strong, neither Brady nor I have managed to
break it, and the problem is that even with this fibre, with the light
beam going down it, eventually the light gets weaker and weaker and you lose
the signal. So every 50km, every 30 miles or so, down the fibre
when it’s under the sea you have to amplify the signal to get it back
up again so that our YouTube video can reach the other side of the Atlantic
or to India or wherever. And so the way you’ve got to do it you’ve
got to somehow amplify the light, make it more intense, and you can do
this with erbium because if you put erbium into the glass then if you
shine a light onto the erbium atoms they get excited and then as the light
comes in from the signal it interacts with the erbium atom and the erbium
atom loses its energy and gives out more light. So essentially the light
comes in and comes out twice as intense. It then keeps going another
30 miles and you repeat it. Here we’ve got the infrared laser, I used
to work with lasers, but I’ve rather given up now. So it’s quite nostalgic.
Is it switched on? And if you put this in the laser beam you can see there’s
a special screen here, which will actually take an infrared laser
beam which you can’t see and make it into visible light so you can see
it. We’ve got infrared light going into a piece of glass with erbium in it. Now,
what is happening here is the physics here is slightly different from what
happens in the amplifier, but is really quite fun because the light beam
that you can’t see is suddenly being changed into visible light, to green
light, which you can. Yes it’s very important, I had heard about
it in lectures but when we videoed our first video about erbium I had
completely forgotten about this, although without it nobody would have
seen any of our videos. Welders, people that join pieces of metal
together using either large electric fields or extreme temperatures have
special masks to protect their eyes from the very bright light which
is given out in the welding process. Welding goggles typically can include
erbium salts because they are intense and they absorb a massive amount
of the light so the eyes of the welder are not damaged at all. So, under the sea you have these fibres with
copper wires going next to it carrying the currents for the diodes that
excite the amplifiers all the way along and, apparently, the current going
down these wires is quite attractive to sharks and so in shallow water
sharks come along and see the cable and it seems attractive and they
start chewing it and, although Brady and I can’t break the fibres, a shark
in full spate can easily cut through it and so there have been quite alot
of problems with the optic fibres in shallow water being chewed to bits
by sharks.

**Transcript**:
I think the reason that this  compound, this element, Nobelium was named after Nobel, is because Nobel  is perhaps the single most famous name  that is associated with science. Most of the people that you talk to  in the street, have probably heard of Nobel,  but they may not easily have heard  of Seaborg, or some these other people.  So I think, as a name for an  element, it is really quite a good one. Alfred Nobel was a Swedish chemist,  or industrial chemist, who worked on explosives, and the problem  with explosives, which are compounds  of Carbon and Nitrogen,  is that until the time of Alfred Nobel,  they were very unstable. They could go off unexpectedly,  and kill people, in fact, I believe one of Nobel's relatives, might even have been his brother, was killed by a serious explosion. And the reason is that these compounds, when they starts reacting, and they're reacting  violently, the reaction builts up, the heat produced by the first bit going off,  goes on, and so on. And what Nobel discovered, his real scientific discovery,  was that if he spread this compound on to inert  material, it's just essentially sand, that it would be completely stable, you can even throw in a fire  and it won't explode. But if you use a detonator that  produces a sharp, small explosion,  that is enough to set the whole lot off. And so, this allowed people to handle explosives safely, and many of the developments in the 19th century, the expansion  of the railways,   and some of the unpleasant developments  in warfare, were all brought about by Nobel's discovery of these high explosives  that could be be stabilized. Now, the result of this was that Nobel's company became really,  very lucrative, selling these explosives, and when Nobel died, a foundation was set up, which exists to this day, to award prizes in the areas of science for outstanding science, in physics,  in medicine, and chemistry,  and economics, and peace. I think the economics may actually be given  by a sister organization. And each year the prizes announced  for really one of the exciting pieces of chemistry, that has been done in  the preceding 2 years.  Occasionally it's for something that was done just a year or two before, where everybody recognizes  straight away it was revolutionary. For example, the discovery  of C60, the molecule with 60 carbon atoms, that looks like a football, which rewarded really quite quickly.  Other prizes, you really have to wait to see how the field develops, and to see whether this discovery  really was important,  whether it really changes the field of  chemistry. - Is it every chemist's dream  to win a Nobel prize? - I suppose so, but only 3 people  can win it each year, and there are so many chemists,  that it's really something  which is almost like a lottery. In fact, some national lotteries,  it's probably easier to win the prize, so I think most chemist really aspire  to becoming members of the national  academy of sciences of their own country,  and most of them don't  think of winning the Nobel prize. -So Nobelium is perhaps best  known for the fact, that it is quite controversial in terms of its naming  So it was originally discovered  and called Nobelium  and there is another research group disputeed  these findings, they claimmed that they named it and gave a different name, then eventually,  because it has been named  as Nobelium for such a long time,  people just settled on that. - But he had nothing to do with  Nobelium.  - No no , Nobelium was first  discovered, first detected, I'm not sure how many years, but  probably nearly a century after his death.  . . . . . . . . . . . .

Mendelevium, which is named after one of the
most important people as far as the periodic table is concerned, which
is Dimitri Mendeleev. Mendelevium is named after Mendeleev, in Russia
the periodic table is called the Mendeleev table, and you can see
here on my tie I’ve got a picture of Mendeleev. It’s another element which has absolutely
zero use in the real world. He is one of the iconic, iconic, pictures
of chemists that most chemists will recognise Mendeleev. Ah, Mendeleev was all to do with how it was
discovered to put the periodic table together, for a long time,
people knew that there were different elements and that they knew that
they had different properties. What they couldn’t do, was rationalise those
properties and understand why certain elements behaved in a similar
manner even though in principle they should have been very different. But Mendeleev has another cause of fame; he
is famous in Russia because he was the person who worked out the
standard for the strength of vodka. So here I have a bottle
of Russian Mendeleev, you’ll see it says Mendeleev here and vodka, with
a periodic table on it, and here’s the formula, ethanol plus water,
and Mendeleev was the person that worked out the standard of 40% of ethanol
in water as being vodka. And in fact it’s remarkable the number of
experiments you read where people have used 40% ethanol in water as the
solvent for their reaction doubtless because they had a handy bottle
of vodka or some similar drink.

Ok, Fermium, it has absolutely no use as far
as anyone knows except that it’s extremely radioactive. It’s
named after Enrico Fermi who is a well-known physicist. Fermi was an Italian physicist who in the
1930s was the first person to discover artificial radioactivity. This is
where neutrons, which had only recently been discovered when they did these
experiments, hit an element that is not radioactive, increase
the weight of the nucleus but not the number of protons and cause it to
fall apart by radioactive decay. And it also, like Einsteinium, where it was
first found in the debris of a nuclear bomb, in fact the very first nuclear
bomb that was ever tested. Shortly after the fascists took power in Italy,
Fermi moved to the United States and, as part of the Manhattan project
for building the atomic bomb, he built the first nuclear reactor under
the football stadium, in the squash courts under the football stadium at
Chicago University, the University of Chicago, right in the centre
of Chicago, and they filled the squash courts with blocks of carbon with holes
in the middle through which they put rods of uranium. So the first
ever sustained nuclear reaction took place in the sports field of
University of Chicago and if you go now there, the stadium itself has been
completely demolished, but there’s a rather fine monument to the birth
of the atomic era.

**Transcript**:
Light: it's the fastest thing in the universe, but we can still measure its speed if we slow down the animation, we can analyze light's motion using a space-time diagram, which takes a flipbook of animation panels, and turns them on their side. In this lesson, we'll add the single experimental fact that whenever anyone measures just how fast light moves, they get the same answer: 299,792,458 meters every second, which means that when we draw light on our space-time diagram, it's world line always has to appear at the same angle. But we saw previously that speed, or equivalently world line angles, change when we look at things from other people's perspective. To explore this contradiction, let's see what happens if I start moving while I stand still and shine the laser at Tom. First, we'll need to construct the space-time diagram. Yes, that means taking all of the different panels showing the different moments in time and stacking them up. From the side, we see the world line of the laser light at its correct fixed angle, just as before. So far, so good. But that space-time diagram represents Andrew's perspective. What does it look like to me? In the last lesson, we showed how to get Tom's perspective moving all the panels along a bit until his world line is completely vertical. But look carefully at the light world line. The rearrangement of the panels means it's now tilted over too far. I'd measure light traveling faster than Andrew would. But every experiment we've ever done, and we've tried very hard, says that everyone measures light to have a fixed speed. So let's start again. In the 1900s, a clever chap named Albert Einstein worked out how to see things properly, from Tom's point of view, while still getting the speed of light right. First, we need to glue together the separate panels into one solid block. This gives us our space-time, turning space and time into one smooth, continuous material. And now, here is the trick. What you do is stretch your block of space-time along the light world line, then squash it by the same amount, but at right angles to the light world line, and abracadabra! Tom's world line has gone vertical, so this does represent the world from his point of view, but most importantly, the light world line has never changed its angle, and so light will be measured by Tom going at the correct speed. This superb trick is known as a Lorentz transformation. Yeah, more than a trick. Slice up the space-time into new panels and you have the physically correct animation. I'm stationary in the car, everything else is coming past me and the speed of light works out to be that same fixed value that we know everyone measures. On the other hand, something strange has happened. The fence posts aren't spaced a meter apart anymore, and my mom will be worried that I look a bit thin. But that's not fair. Why don't I get to look thin? I thought physics was supposed to be the same for everyone. Yes, no, it is, and you do. All that stretching and squashing of space-time has just muddled together what we used to think of separately as space and time. This particular squashing effect is known as Lorentz contraction. Okay, but I still don't look thin. No, yes, you do. Now that we know better about space-time, we should redraw what the scene looked like to me. To you, I appear Lorentz contracted. Oh but to you, I appear Lorentz contracted. Yes. Uh, well, at least it's fair. And speaking of fairness, just as space gets muddled with time, time also gets muddled with space, in an effect known as time dilation. No, at everyday speeds, such as Tom's car reaches, actually all the effects are much, much smaller than we've illustrated them. Oh, yet, careful experiments, for instance watching the behavior of tiny particles whizzing around the Large Hadron Collider confirmed that the effects are real. And now that space-time is an experimentally confirmed part of reality, we can get a bit more ambitious. What if we were to start playing with the material of space-time itself? We'll find out all about that in the next animation.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why does light have to appear at the same angle when drawn on a space-time diagram?

Let's assume we have another generated MCQ that better matches the ground truth MCQ:

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: Why does the worldline of light always appear at the same angle on a space-time diagram?
Options: A. Because the speed of light is relative, B. Because the speed of light is a constant, C. Because light always travels in straight lines, D. Because the laws of physics are different for light
Correct Option: B

**Transcript**:
Light: it's the fastest thing in the universe, but we can still measure its speed if we slow down the animation, we can analyze light's motion using a space-time diagram, which takes a flipbook of animation panels, and turns them on their side. In this lesson, we'll add the single experimental fact that whenever anyone measures just how fast light moves, they get the same answer: 299,792,458 meters every second, which means that when we draw light on our space-time diagram, it's world line always has to appear at the same angle. But we saw previously that speed, or equivalently world line angles, change when we look at things from other people's perspective. To explore this contradiction, let's see what happens if I start moving while I stand still and shine the laser at Tom. First, we'll need to construct the space-time diagram. Yes, that means taking all of the different panels showing the different moments in time and stacking them up. From the side, we see the world line of the laser light at its correct fixed angle, just as before. So far, so good. But that space-time diagram represents Andrew's perspective. What does it look like to me? In the last lesson, we showed how to get Tom's perspective moving all the panels along a bit until his world line is completely vertical. But look carefully at the light world line. The rearrangement of the panels means it's now tilted over too far. I'd measure light traveling faster than Andrew would. But every experiment we've ever done, and we've tried very hard, says that everyone measures light to have a fixed speed. So let's start again. In the 1900s, a clever chap named Albert Einstein worked out how to see things properly, from Tom's point of view, while still getting the speed of light right. First, we need to glue together the separate panels into one solid block. This gives us our space-time, turning space and time into one smooth, continuous material. And now, here is the trick. What you do is stretch your block of space-time along the light world line, then squash it by the same amount, but at right angles to the light world line, and abracadabra! Tom's world line has gone vertical, so this does represent the world from his point of view, but most importantly, the light world line has never changed its angle, and so light will be measured by Tom going at the correct speed. This superb trick is known as a Lorentz transformation. Yeah, more than a trick. Slice up the space-time into new panels and you have the physically correct animation. I'm stationary in the car, everything else is coming past me and the speed of light works out to be that same fixed value that we know everyone measures. On the other hand, something strange has happened. The fence posts aren't spaced a meter apart anymore, and my mom will be worried that I look a bit thin. But that's not fair. Why don't I get to look thin? I thought physics was supposed to be the same for everyone. Yes, no, it is, and you do. All that stretching and squashing of space-time has just muddled together what we used to think of separately as space and time. This particular squashing effect is known as Lorentz contraction. Okay, but I still don't look thin. No, yes, you do. Now that we know better about space-time, we should redraw what the scene looked like to me. To you, I appear Lorentz contracted. Oh but to you, I appear Lorentz contracted. Yes. Uh, well, at least it's fair. And speaking of fairness, just as space gets muddled with time, time also gets muddled with space, in an effect known as time dilation. No, at everyday speeds, such as Tom's car reaches, actually all the effects are much, much smaller than we've illustrated them. Oh, yet, careful experiments, for instance watching the behavior of tiny particles whizzing around the Large Hadron Collider confirmed that the effects are real. And now that space-time is an experimentally confirmed part of reality, we can get a bit more ambitious. What if we were to start playing with the material of space-time itself? We'll find out all about that in the next animation.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why doesn’t sliding the panels to change perspective work when we have light in the picture?
Options: A. Light has to be drawn parallel to the edge of the panels, and so only appears on one panel at a time., B. Sliding the panels tilts the light worldlines, which suggests the speed of light has changed., C. Light moves so quickly that we can't draw enough panels to measure the correct speed.
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: How does the space-time diagram change when viewed from Tom's perspective using a Lorentz transformation?
Options: A. The light world line changes its angle, B. The space-time is stretched along the light world line and squashed at right angles to it, C. The fence posts become spaced farther apart, D. The laser light's world line becomes vertical

She had eyes like imaginary numbers and curves that went on forever. Said she wanted to go home. Said I could help. Said the pay was good. Didn't say anything about climbing a... Voice: "Who's there?" Manny Brot: "Manny Brot, private eye." Voice: "What are you doing here?" "A pretty number sent me to find a stolen dingus." Voice: "Well, to enter the cave, you must answer my riddles three." What was it with riddles, and why do they always come in threes? "Is it an egg?" "No. Why would it be an egg?" "It's usually an egg." "What can I hold in my hand, but has zero area?" "Is it a dodo egg?" "It's not an egg!" I took out the rock that had nearly brained me before and gave it a hard ponder. The size of the rising bump on my conk said to me that this thing had area, and a lot of it. But what if I carved out a triangle from this side here? As any mook could see, this triangle had a quarter of the area of the full triangle. I did the same thing again with each of the smaller triangles. Again, a quarter of the remaining area -- gone. And I just kept going. After an infinite number of cuts, I was satisfied that my triangle had zero area. A bounded shape with zero area. Now, it's not often that I surprise myself, but my own two mitts had created something crazy, and new. "Very good. (ahem) Now, show me a shape with finite area, but an infinitely long perimeter." "Let me get this straight. If I want to make a snip in the border of this shape, smooth it out, and lay it on the ground ... " "It would go on for ... " "Wait 'til I'm through, and then you can talk. It would go on forever." "Are you through?" "Yeah." "So show me that shape then." Mmm ... I hadn't been this stuck since the Rubik's Cube fiasco of '58. All the shapes I knew had perimeters. Circles: 2πr. Triangles: sum of their sides. What's this? An angle. An angle from heaven. What if I were to pinch each side, like so. A third of the way through, just so. And do it again, and again, and again. After each pinch, the perimeter got a third longer because where there had been three line segments, now there were four. As for the area, every pinch made more triangles, that's true. But those triangles were getting smaller and smaller. You could say that the area was converging, approaching a fixed number, while the perimeter was just getting bigger and bigger, uncontrollably ballooning like an overindulgent birthday clown. After infinity pinches, flimflam, there it was: Finite area, but infinite perimeter. Now that is a piece of work. "Oh, you're good. (ahem) Riddle three: Show me a picture that if I magnify it under my microscope, I'll keep seeing the original picture, no matter how much I zoom in." "You're a strange little man." "Thank you." I was out of ideas, so I looked at my muse, my complex Dora. Voice: "Who's the dame?" And then it hit me. "She's a heart breaker, my fractal femme fatale. Will she do?" "Yes, she'll do just fine." (lightning) It was dark, and at first I thought the cave was empty, but then I noticed: the box. The dame had played me like a triangle. She had told me she wanted to go home. (Lightning) What she really wanted was to bring her home here. The fractals spread everywhere. Most of them the same no matter how deep you looked at them, like Dora's mugshot. Some had infinitely long perimeters, others were objects with no area or volume, all of them created through infinite repetition. So, you wanted to know what fractals are? Well, kid, they're the stuff that dreams are made of. (Music)

(lightning) It was dark, and at first I thought the cave was empty, but then I noticed: the box. The dame had played me like a triangle. She had told me she wanted to go home. (Lightning) What she really wanted was to bring her home here. The fractals spread everywhere. Most of them the same no matter how deep you looked at them, like Dora's mugshot. Some had infinitely long perimeters, others were objects with no area or volume, all of them created through infinite repetition. So, you wanted to know what fractals are? Well, kid, they're the stuff that dreams are made of. (Music)

**Transcript**:
Studies have shown that taking vitamins is good for your health and bad for your health. That newly discovered herb can improve your memory or destroy your liver. Headlines proclaim a promising new cancer treatment and never mention it again. On a daily basis, we are bombarded with attention-grabbing news, backed up by scientific studies, but what are these studies? How are they performed? And how do we know whether they're reliable? When it comes to dietary or medical information, the first thing to remember is that while studies on animals or individual cells can point the way towards further research, the only way to know how something will affect humans is through a study involving human subjects. And when it comes to human studies, the scientific gold standard is the randomized clinical trial, or RCT. The key to RCTs is that the subjects are randomly assigned to their study groups. They are often blinded to make them more rigorous. This process attempts to ensure that the only difference between the groups is the one the researchers are attempting to study. For example, when testing a new headache medication, a large pool of people with headaches would be randomly divided into two groups, one receiving the medication and another receiving a placebo. With proper randomization, the only significant overall difference between the two groups will be whether or not they received the medication, rather than other differences that could affect results. Randomized clinical trials are incredible tools, and, in fact, the US Food and Drug Administration often requires at least two to be conducted before a new drug can be marketed. But the problem is that an RCT is not possible in many cases, either because it's not practical or would require too many volunteers. In such cases, scientists use an epidemiological study, which simply observes people going about their usual behavior, rather than randomly assigning active participants to control invariable groups. Let's say we wanted to study whether an herbal ingredient on the market causes nausea. Rather than deliberately giving people something that might make them nauseated, we would find those who already take the ingredient in their everyday lives. This group is called the cohort. We would also need a comparison group of people who do not have exposure to the ingredient. And we would then compare statistics. If the rate of nausea is higher in the herbal cohort, it suggests an association between the herbal supplement and nausea. Epidemiological studies are great tools to study the health effects of almost anything, without directly interfering in people's lives or assigning them to potentially dangerous exposures. So, why can't we rely on these studies to establish causal relationships between substances and their effects on health? The problem is that even the best conducted epidemiological studies have inherent flaws. Precisely because the test subjects are not randomly assigned to their groups. For example, if the cohort in our herbal study consisted of people who took the supplement for health reasons, they may have already had higher rates of nausea than the other people in the sample. Or the cohort group could've been composed of people who shop at health food stores and have different diets or better access to healthcare. These factors that can affect results, in addition to the factor being studied, are known as confounding variables. These two major pitfalls, combined with more general dangers, such as conflicts of interest or selective use of data, can make the findings of any particular epidemiological study suspect, and a good study must go out of its way to prove that its authors have taken steps to eliminate these types of errors. But even when this has been done, the very nature of epidemiological studies, which examine differences between preexisting groups, rather than deliberately inducing changes within the same individuals, means that a single study can only demonstrate a correlation between a substance and a health outcome, rather than a true cause and effect relationship. At the end of the day, epidemiological studies have served as excellent guides to public health, alerting us to critical health hazards, such as smoking, asbestos, lead, and many more. But these were demonstrated through multiple, well-conducted epidemiological studies, all pointing in the same direction. So, the next time you see a headline about a new miracle cure or the terrible danger posed by an everyday substance, try to learn more about the original study and the limitations inherent in any epidemiological study or clinical trial before jumping to conclusions.

**Transcript**:
Studies have shown that taking vitamins is good for your health and bad for your health. That newly discovered herb can improve your memory or destroy your liver. Headlines proclaim a promising new cancer treatment and never mention it again. On a daily basis, we are bombarded with attention-grabbing news, backed up by scientific studies, but what are these studies? How are they performed? And how do we know whether they're reliable? When it comes to dietary or medical information, the first thing to remember is that while studies on animals or individual cells can point the way towards further research, the only way to know how something will affect humans is through a study involving human subjects. And when it comes to human studies, the scientific gold standard is the randomized clinical trial, or RCT. The key to RCTs is that the subjects are randomly assigned to their study groups. They are often blinded to make them more rigorous. This process attempts to ensure that the only difference between the groups is the one the researchers are attempting to study. For example, when testing a new headache medication, a large pool of people with headaches would be randomly divided into two groups, one receiving the medication and another receiving a placebo. With proper randomization, the only significant overall difference between the two groups will be whether or not they received the medication, rather than other differences that could affect results. Randomized clinical trials are incredible tools, and, in fact, the US Food and Drug Administration often requires at least two to be conducted before a new drug can be marketed. But the problem is that an RCT is not possible in many cases, either because it's not practical or would require too many volunteers. In such cases, scientists use an epidemiological study, which simply observes people going about their usual behavior, rather than randomly assigning active participants to control invariable groups. Let's say we wanted to study whether an herbal ingredient on the market causes nausea. Rather than deliberately giving people something that might make them nauseated, we would find those who already take the ingredient in their everyday lives. This group is called the cohort. We would also need a comparison group of people who do not have exposure to the ingredient. And we would then compare statistics. If the rate of nausea is higher in the herbal cohort, it suggests an association between the herbal supplement and nausea. Epidemiological studies are great tools to study the health effects of almost anything, without directly interfering in people's lives or assigning them to potentially dangerous exposures. So, why can't we rely on these studies to establish causal relationships between substances and their effects on health? The problem is that even the best conducted epidemiological studies have inherent flaws. Precisely because the test subjects are not randomly assigned to their groups. For example, if the cohort in our herbal study consisted of people who took the supplement for health reasons, they may have already had higher rates of nausea than the other people in the sample. Or the cohort group could've been composed of people who shop at health food stores and have different diets or better access to healthcare. These factors that can affect results, in addition to the factor being studied, are known as confounding variables. These two major pitfalls, combined with more general dangers, such as conflicts of interest or selective use of data, can make the findings of any particular epidemiological study suspect, and a good study must go out of its way to prove that its authors have taken steps to eliminate these types of errors. But even when this has been done, the very nature of epidemiological studies, which examine differences between preexisting groups, rather than deliberately inducing changes within the same individuals, means that a single study can only demonstrate a correlation between a substance and a health outcome, rather than a true cause and effect relationship. At the end of the day, epidemiological studies have served as excellent guides to public health, alerting us to critical health hazards, such as smoking, asbestos, lead, and many more. But these were demonstrated through multiple, well-conducted epidemiological studies, all pointing in the same direction. So, the next time you see a headline about a new miracle cure or the terrible danger posed by an everyday substance, try to learn more about the original study and the limitations inherent in any epidemiological study or clinical trial before jumping to conclusions.

**Transcript**:
this is a representation of your brain and your brain can be broken into two parts uh there's the left half which is The Logical side and then the right half which is the intuitive and so if we add a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere then we can plot our brain and for example this would be somebody who's completely logical this would be someone who's entirely intuitive so where would you put your brain on this scale some of us may have opted for you know one of these extremes but I think for most people in the audience your brain is something like this with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time I mean it's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything you can be logical and intuitive and so I consider myself one of these people along with most of the other experimental Quantum physicists we need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas but at the same time we um we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work how do we develop this intuition well we like to play with stuff so we go out and play with it and then we see how it acts and then we develop our intuition from from there and you know really you do the same thing so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time I mean I even sound weird to think about uh one thing being in two different places at the same time but you weren't born with this notion you developed it you know I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop he was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it and he kept falling over but I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson and that's that large things don't let you get right past him and that they stay in one place and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world unless you're a particle physicist it'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist because well they don't play with car stops they play with these little little weird particles and when they play with their particles they finally do all sorts of really weird weird things like they can fly right through walls or they can be in two different places at the same time and so they wrote down all these observations and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics and so you know that's where physics was at a few years ago you needed quantum mechanics to describe little tiny particles but you didn't need it to describe the the large everyday objects around us this didn't really sit well with my intuition and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often well I mean I play with them sometimes but not very often um and I've never seen them I mean nobody's ever seen a particle but this it didn't sit well with my logical side either because if everything is made up of little little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics yeah I don't see any reason why it shouldn't and so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics so a few years ago I set off to do just that so I I made one this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical Quantum superp position so we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip and you can sort of see this Green Dot right in the middle and that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute this is a photograph of of the object and here I'm zoom in a little bit we're looking right there in the center and then here's a really really big closeup of the little piece of metal so what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal and it's shaped like a diving board and sticking out over a ledge and so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make computer chip I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours for the last step I had to build my own machine to make this swimming pool shaped hole underneath the device this device has the ability to be in a Quantum superp position but it needs a little help to do it here let me give you an analogy you know how comfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator I mean when I'm in elevator all alone I like do all sorts of weird things but then other people uh get on board bored and I stopped doing those things cuz I don't want to bother them or frankly scare them so quantum mechanics quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way the fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people but it's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the Heat of the room and so we knew if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave Quantum mechanically we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers and so that's what we did we turned the lights and then we put it in vacuum and sucked out all the air and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero now all alone in the elevator the little chunk of metal was free to act however it wanted and so we measured its motion we found it was moving in really weird ways instead of just sitting perfectly still it was vibrating and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this like expanding and Contracting Bellows and by giving it a gentle nudge we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics so what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time so let's think about the atoms so in one case all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are just sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down now it's only at precise times when they align the rest of of the time they're delocalized so that means that every atom is in two different places at the same time which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places I think this is really cool really it was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years um cuz check this out the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as a difference between that chunk of metal and you so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time that chunk of metal can be in two different places then then why not you I mean this is just my logical side talking so imagine if you were in multiple places at the same time what would that be like it's how would your Consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space there's one more part to the story is when we warmed it up and um we turned on the lights and looked inside the Box we saw that the piece of metal was still there in one piece and so you know I had to develop this new intuition that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just Quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected well that's not quite right it's actually it's more than that and it's deeper it's that those connections your connections to all the things around you literally Define who you are and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics thank you

this piece of metal behave Quantum mechanically we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers and so that's what we did we turned the lights and then we put it in vacuum and sucked out all the air and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero now all alone in the elevator the little chunk of metal was free to act however it wanted and so we measured its motion we found it was moving in really weird ways instead of just sitting perfectly still it was vibrating and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this like expanding and Contracting Bellows and by giving it a gentle nudge we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics so what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time so let's think about the atoms so in one case all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are just sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down now it's only at precise times when they align the rest of of the time they're delocalized so that means that every atom is in two different places at the same time which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places I think this is really cool really it was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years um cuz check this out the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as a difference between that chunk of metal and you so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time that chunk of metal can be in two different places then then why not you I mean this is just my logical side talking so imagine if you were in multiple places at the same time what would that be like it's how would your Consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space there's one more part to the story is when we warmed it up and um we turned on the lights and looked inside the Box we saw that the piece of metal was still there in one piece and so you know I had to develop this new intuition that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just Quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected well that's not quite right it's actually it's more than that and it's deeper it's that those connections your connections to all the things around you literally Define who you are and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics thank you

**Transcript**:
In 479 BC, when Persian soldiers besieged the Greek city of Potidaea, the tide retreated
much farther than usual, leaving a convenient invasion route. But this wasn't a stroke of luck. Before they had crossed halfway, the water returned in a wave higher
than anyone had ever seen, drowning the attackers. The Potiidaeans believed
they had been saved by the wrath of Poseidon. But what really saved them was likely the same phenomenon
that has destroyed countless others: a tsunami. Although tsunamis are commonly
known as tidal waves, they're actually unrelated
to the tidal activity caused by the gravitational forces
of the Sun and Moon. In many ways, tsunamis are just
larger versions of regular waves. They have a trough and a crest, and consist not of moving water, but the movement of energy through water. The difference is
in where this energy comes from. For normal ocean waves,
it comes from wind. Because this only affects the surface,
the waves are limited in size and speed. But tsunamis are caused by energy
originating underwater, from a volcanic eruption, a submarine landslide, or most commonly,
an earthquake on the ocean floor caused when the tectonic plates
of the Earth's surface slip, releasing a massive amount
of energy into the water. This energy travels up to the surface, displacing water and raising it above
the normal sea level, but gravity pulls it back down, which makes the energy ripple
outwards horizontally. Thus, the tsunami is born, moving at over 500 miles per hour. When it's far from shore,
a tsunami can be barely detectable since it moves through
the entire depth of the water. But when it reaches shallow water,
something called wave shoaling occurs. Because there is less water
to move through, this still massive amount
of energy is compressed. The wave's speed slows down, while its height rises
to as much as 100 feet. The word tsunami,
Japanese for "harbor wave," comes from the fact that it only seems
to appear near the coast. If the trough of a tsunami
reaches shore first, the water will withdraw
farther than normal before the wave hits, which can be misleadingly dangerous. A tsunami will not only drown
people near the coast, but level buildings and trees
for a mile inland or more, especially in low-lying areas. As if that weren't enough,
the water then retreats, dragging with it the newly created debris, and anything, or anyone,
unfortunate enough to be caught in its path. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the deadliest
natural disasters in history, killing over 200,000 people
throughout South Asia. So how can we protect ourselves
against this destructive force of nature? People in some areas have attempted to stop tsunamis
with sea walls, flood gates, and channels to divert the water. But these are not always effective. In 2011, a tsunami
surpassed the flood wall protecting Japan's Fukushima Power Plant, causing a nuclear disaster in addition to claiming over 18,000 lives. Many scientists and policy makers
are instead focusing on early detection, monitoring underwater pressure
and seismic activity, and establishing global
communication networks for quickly distributing alerts. When nature is too powerful to stop, the safest course
is to get out of its way.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What exactly is a wave?
Options: A. Moving water, B. Moving air, C. Moving earth, D. Moving energy
Correct Option: D

Question: How do tsunamis move through the water?

**Transcript**:
In 479 BC, when Persian soldiers besieged the Greek city of Potidaea, the tide retreated
much farther than usual, leaving a convenient invasion route. But this wasn't a stroke of luck. Before they had crossed halfway, the water returned in a wave higher
than anyone had ever seen, drowning the attackers. The Potiidaeans believed
they had been saved by the wrath of Poseidon. But what really saved them was likely the same phenomenon
that has destroyed countless others: a tsunami. Although tsunamis are commonly
known as tidal waves, they're actually unrelated
to the tidal activity caused by the gravitational forces
of the Sun and Moon. In many ways, tsunamis are just
larger versions of regular waves. They have a trough and a crest, and consist not of moving water, but the movement of energy through water. The difference is
in where this energy comes from. For normal ocean waves,
it comes from wind. Because this only affects the surface,
the waves are limited in size and speed. But tsunamis are caused by energy
originating underwater, from a volcanic eruption, a submarine landslide, or most commonly,
an earthquake on the ocean floor caused when the tectonic plates
of the Earth's surface slip, releasing a massive amount
of energy into the water. This energy travels up to the surface, displacing water and raising it above
the normal sea level, but gravity pulls it back down, which makes the energy ripple
outwards horizontally. Thus, the tsunami is born, moving at over 500 miles per hour. When it's far from shore,
a tsunami can be barely detectable since it moves through
the entire depth of the water. But when it reaches shallow water,
something called wave shoaling occurs. Because there is less water
to move through, this still massive amount
of energy is compressed. The wave's speed slows down, while its height rises
to as much as 100 feet. The word tsunami,
Japanese for "harbor wave," comes from the fact that it only seems
to appear near the coast. If the trough of a tsunami
reaches shore first, the water will withdraw
farther than normal before the wave hits, which can be misleadingly dangerous. A tsunami will not only drown
people near the coast, but level buildings and trees
for a mile inland or more, especially in low-lying areas. As if that weren't enough,
the water then retreats, dragging with it the newly created debris, and anything, or anyone,
unfortunate enough to be caught in its path. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the deadliest
natural disasters in history, killing over 200,000 people
throughout South Asia. So how can we protect ourselves
against this destructive force of nature? People in some areas have attempted to stop tsunamis
with sea walls, flood gates, and channels to divert the water. But these are not always effective. In 2011, a tsunami
surpassed the flood wall protecting Japan's Fukushima Power Plant, causing a nuclear disaster in addition to claiming over 18,000 lives. Many scientists and policy makers
are instead focusing on early detection, monitoring underwater pressure
and seismic activity, and establishing global
communication networks for quickly distributing alerts. When nature is too powerful to stop, the safest course
is to get out of its way.

So here we have a sample of vanadium. So vanadium
is used to do catalysis, it is used for a whole range of different things. So vanadium is the third of the transition
metals and, because it has more electrons, it has really quite interesting chemistry. It is also used in nature and there are a
number of mushrooms that are vanadium rich. The amavadins especially is one of the materials.
So here if we open, we can see on our reel is a very nice sample of vanadium wire. So
this is the elemental vanadium and as you can see it is about 0.1 mm in diameter and
there is 20 metres of it on this reel. Some of its compounds are very reactive. I
can remember that my lab mate Paul was working with a compound called vanadium hexacarbonyl.
He got a sample it was quite expensive, and he poured it, it came in a sealed glass vessel
so he cut open the glass and poured it out and before his eyes it burst into flames and
disappeared.

metals and, because it has more electrons, it has really quite interesting chemistry. It is also used in nature and there are a
number of mushrooms that are vanadium rich. The amavadins especially is one of the materials.
So here if we open, we can see on our reel is a very nice sample of vanadium wire. So
this is the elemental vanadium and as you can see it is about 0.1 mm in diameter and
there is 20 metres of it on this reel. Some of its compounds are very reactive. I
can remember that my lab mate Paul was working with a compound called vanadium hexacarbonyl.
He got a sample it was quite expensive, and he poured it, it came in a sealed glass vessel
so he cut open the glass and poured it out and before his eyes it burst into flames and
disappeared.

**Transcript**:
So now you can see the reactionís really
going and itís really exothermic, weíre forming aluminium triiodide, and the
exotherm is actually heating and starting to sublime off the excess iodine
which you can see coming off as this really nice purple plume. Iodine is this beautifully-coloured element.
It has this beautiful purple colour. If you put it in solution, the colour
of the solution varies depending what you dissolve it in. If you
dissolve it in water, itís a sort-of dirty brown colour. If you dissolve it in
an organic material like chloroform or carbon tetrachloride it is a
beautiful purple colour. Iodine is halide, a halogen element from the
far right-hand side of the periodic table and it's strongly oxidising
in nature. Likes to nick electrons off other atoms, so what weíre going to do
is we are going to do a reaction with iodine, and today weíve ground
some iodine. So itís normally found from chemical suppliers as
really nice large crystals. But what we want to do as a reaction with it,
well we need to make sure that the surface area of the iodine is really,
really large so that all of it can react very very quickly with the other component. Iodine also occurs quite widely in nature
and is absolutely essential to life. If you donít have iodine, your thyroid
gland, which is a small gland that controls development of all sorts of
things in your body, doesnít operate properly. Nowadays, iodide is added
to table salt in countries like the UK and most other developed countries
so nearly everybody has enough iodine. In the old days iodine had
to be got from the environment and usually from the spray from
the sea that was blown across the land, and so in Nottingham, which
is really near the centre of England a long way from the sea, or relatively
long way from the sea, there were serious illnesses caused by people
not having enough iodine. So-called goiter, which caused a swelling,
the thyroid gland gets bigger, and this used to be called Derbyshire neck
this unpleasant illness, because it happened in this area of Nottingham
and Derbyshire. So what weíre going to do is that we are
going to mix it now with another element and that element is aluminium.
So aluminium has electrons to give away. Iodineís gonna nab
ëem. Going to see some oxidation chemistry in the formation of a
new compound, which is aluminium triiodide. Itís a really nice chemical
reaction. But the way that we do it is that we mix the two together and
we have to add water which acts a bit like solvent and also the oxygen
in the water activates the iodine so that it becomes more strongly oxidising
and then hopefully weíll see the new reaction. So Iím going to just
put some out into this small vessel. You can see this development effect of iodine
really well that if you had tadpoles, baby frogs, they donít develop
their legs and turn into frogs unless there is iodine in the water. The other component in this reaction is aluminium,
ok; and weíre using very, very finely powdered aluminium. Not
foil or not a rather large lump. This has been especially powdered for
us, so again it has a very, very high surface area. One of my favourite chemical equations is
ëtadpoles plus iodine goes to frogsí. So you can see the aluminium and
the iodine mixed within this solid mixture. Now still, these two components,
these two elements they are still held away from one another they
canít react. So what we need to do is add a small amount of water, which
actually acts like a solvent but actually activates the iodine and then
weíll wait and see what happens with the chemical reaction. Iodine can be used as a disinfectant, in fact
chlorine can be as well, but solution of iodine is often used when people
have cuts. So if you cut yourself, fortunately I havenít any cuts
at the moment, you can paint on iodine and because of its rather red colour
it made cuts often look much worse. Children would come home from school
and their whole hand would be red and this would cause some excitement
at home but it is quite an effective antiseptic. Water: just take a small amount and add it
to the reaction. So you can see itís starting to go now the chemical
reaction because we are seeing the excess iodine subliming in the form of
a vapour. Now if we go in close we can hear it fizzing because this
is actually an oxidation reaction and the formation of the new aluminium triiodide.
Now Iím going to just mix this slightly to try and increase the
rate of the chemical reaction slightly. So now you can see the reactionís
really going and itís really exothermic, weíre forming aluminium triiodide,
and the exotherm is actually heating and starting to sublime off
the excess iodine which you can see coming off as this really nice purple
plume. Now deep inside the reaction now you can see the exothermic or
the energy coming out and starting to cause a flame. Really, really
nice, really rapid chemical reaction: really beautiful. So weíre forming
aluminium triiodide here which again is a very, very delicate compound;
quite reactive in itself. So you can see now the really nice new crystalline
material. So, sadly, weíve managed to stain Stigís fume cupboard.
All of this really nice iodine forming a very fine layer across this
fume cupboard. What do you think about that? Looks like a thorough cleaning job coming
to be honest.

Tellurium is, is quite a nice element here.
I shall pick it up carefully. Tellurium. You’ve never had anything to do with this? Nothing to do with it in my life. So this
is a new one for me. This is tellurium powder. So let’s see what’s
inside the vial. So as we open it and tap out the glass vial. This one is going
to be stubborn. This bell shape here is a sample of tellurium.
The reason…shall I hold it for you? … so, a sample of tellurium. I’m
slightly cagey about touching this because as I think I explained with selenium
that, if you ingest tellurium into the body it can get into your sweat and make
you smell enough to really drive people mad. And these crystals like
this one can be cut up and mounted into a piece of apparatus like this. So a chemist won’t deal with all the elements
on the periodic table in his career normally. No, no, very few chemists will deal with more
than perhaps a handful of different elements. So this is
the tellurium and this is, again, this is very high standard material. 3 grams
of the tellurium material and you can see it’s a very dark powder at the
bottom of the vial. It was used in this piece of apparatus to
shine in an infrared laser that’s like a heat ray at one frequency and it came
out as twice the frequency. So you can use it to change the effect of
the lasers. Unfortunately the guy doing it didn’t make a very good job
of it and you can see he’s completely burnt the surface of this piece
of tellurium. So the main use of tellurium is as components like this for
laser optics and it’s not widely used in the chemical industry or similar areas.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Similar to its predecessor on the periodic table, selenium, what would be the problem if we were to touch a sample of tellurium with our hands?

So here we have tin, but this is a different
sample of tin from what people might be used to because most
people see tin in foil, or they think it is tin foil that they
use to wrap up the chicken, mostly that is aluminium foil. Tin has the symbol Sn because it comes from
the Latin word stannum which means tin and in fact if you
go to Devon in the southwest of England you will find that
some of the towns there are called stannary towns because
that’s where they used to mine and trade in tin. Tin has
a very old role in trade and in technology. Bronze which people
used in the old days was an alloy of tin and copper which
gave better swords than copper, so if you were fighting with
somebody who had a copper sword and you had a bronze one, you
won, at least if you were quick. Here we see a beautiful sample of tin metal
and you can see it is a really beautiful rod and it is packaged
in glass to stop oxidation, but you can see a beautiful silvery
shiny metal. Tin has also been used very widely for coating
the insides of iron and steel containers for food, that’s
why they are called tin even though they were made from iron but
they had a thin coating of tin on the surface, and tin
is also used very widely for solder, for putting together metal
components or electronic components. Lovely sample of tin, so we will pop that
back in and back into the drawer.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 24, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 5
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
So here we have tin, but this is a different
sample of tin from what people might be used to because most
people see tin in foil, or they think it is tin foil that they
use to wrap up the chicken, mostly that is aluminium foil. Tin has the symbol Sn because it comes from
the Latin word stannum which means tin and in fact if you
go to Devon in the southwest of England you will find that
some of the towns there are called stannary towns because
that’s where they used to mine and trade in tin. Tin has
a very old role in trade and in technology. Bronze which people
used in the old days was an alloy of tin and copper which
gave better swords than copper, so if you were fighting with
somebody who had a copper sword and you had a bronze one, you
won, at least if you were quick. Here we see a beautiful sample of tin metal
and you can see it is a really beautiful rod and it is packaged
in glass to stop oxidation, but you can see a beautiful silvery
shiny metal. Tin has also been used very widely for coating
the insides of iron and steel containers for food, that’s
why they are called tin even though they were made from iron but
they had a thin coating of tin on the surface, and tin
is also used very widely for solder, for putting together metal
components or electronic components. Lovely sample of tin, so we will pop that
back in and back into the drawer.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Tin's other well-known use is for toy soldiers. What is the melting point of tin?
Options: A. 202 ºC, B. 232 ºC, C. 262 ºC
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the purpose of packaging tin in glass?
