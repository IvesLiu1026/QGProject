**Transcript**:
On March 14th, 1970, Robert White
and his team carted two small monkeys into an operating room. The neurosurgeon lay on the verge
of an ambitious experiment, decades in the making,
which was bizarre, if not pulled straight
from his own fever dream. White’s objective? Connect the head of Monkey A
to the body of Monkey B, in what he considered
a whole-body transplant. White’s ultimate goal was to one day
perform this surgery on humans. While disturbing,
the idea of a body transplant raises ethical, biological,
and philosophical questions— on the nature of life
and the limits of science— that are still discussed today. But first, is it even medically possible? White's surgery faced several
technical hurdles. For one thing, it guaranteed paralysis as no doctor then— or now—
could reconnect a severed spinal cord. But White,
a practicing neurosurgeon, thought the surgery could be life-saving for his patients with spinal cord injuries
or progressive mobility diseases like ALS. These patients often face
multi-organ failures and paralysis, so with a body transplant, he hoped to save their lives by replacing
all of their organs at once. But paralysis wasn't the only challenge. Due to their high energy demands, brain cells require a constant supply
of oxygenated blood to survive. Yet the transplant surgery would likely
interrupt the brain’s oxygen flow for hours. But White had an idea. When the brain is cold, its metabolism slows down
and it relies less on oxygen. Experimenting on dogs and monkeys, White optimized a brain-cooling technique where the brain’s blood flow was
selectively chilled and halted, while the rest of the body’s blood
remained warm and circulated. Then, in 1964, White successfully cooled
the brain of a human patient with a life-threatening brain tumor
into “suspended animation” at 11°C. Whereas normally the surgical team
would have just 3 to 5 minutes to remove the tumor, with this new technique, they operated for over an hour
without causing damage. Brain cooling revolutionized
the field of neurosurgery and put White one step closer
to his body transplant goal. But this vision was fraught
with serious ethical concerns. What conditions would justify
such an experimental surgery, that could result in debilitating pain
and neurological damage? And how many animals would have to die
to prove it was possible? At the time, bioethics
was still an emerging field. Nevertheless, numerous critics, including
many in the scientific community, recognized the cruelty of White's research
and strongly opposed it. Yet White continued to gain approval
from agencies like the NIH. And by 1970, he was ready to attempt
a monkey body transplant. First Monkey A was installed
with temporary blood vessels— coils of plastic tubes that tethered
the head to the body. Plastic tube by plastic tube,
the team connected Body B to Head A, and then waited for the subject
to awake from anesthesia. The monkey did— alive, paralyzed,
and extremely distressed. According to the team, the monkey
could see, smell, hear, and even tried to bite off
one of the doctors’ fingers. White felt this proved that the operation
could work. The brain appeared to survive
a head transplant and, with high doses of drugs,
could live without immune rejection. But had White performed
a body transplant on Monkey A? Or was it a head transplant on Monkey B? The surgery raises questions
about the mind-body divide that have been debated for millennia. While modern neuroscience supports
the central role of the brain in building out our consciousness, discoveries about gut neurons
and the microbiome suggest that the answer
may be more complicated. Does part of the “self” reside
outside of the mind? The body and brain are interconnected
by circuits and signaling systems; so, what is lost by separating the two? As a neurosurgeon, White performed
more than 10,000 brain operations before retiring in 1998— but never the human head transplant
he dreamed of. Since then, several scientists have
expressed interest in picking up where White left off,
reviving unfinished debates. Even if a doctor could successfully
connect a patient’s head to a donor’s body, who of the two would emerge? And is extending a life
always worth the cost?

**Transcript**:
On March 14th, 1970, Robert White
and his team carted two small monkeys into an operating room. The neurosurgeon lay on the verge
of an ambitious experiment, decades in the making,
which was bizarre, if not pulled straight
from his own fever dream. White’s objective? Connect the head of Monkey A
to the body of Monkey B, in what he considered
a whole-body transplant. White’s ultimate goal was to one day
perform this surgery on humans. While disturbing,
the idea of a body transplant raises ethical, biological,
and philosophical questions— on the nature of life
and the limits of science— that are still discussed today. But first, is it even medically possible? White's surgery faced several
technical hurdles. For one thing, it guaranteed paralysis as no doctor then— or now—
could reconnect a severed spinal cord. But White,
a practicing neurosurgeon, thought the surgery could be life-saving for his patients with spinal cord injuries
or progressive mobility diseases like ALS. These patients often face
multi-organ failures and paralysis, so with a body transplant, he hoped to save their lives by replacing
all of their organs at once. But paralysis wasn't the only challenge. Due to their high energy demands, brain cells require a constant supply
of oxygenated blood to survive. Yet the transplant surgery would likely
interrupt the brain’s oxygen flow for hours. But White had an idea. When the brain is cold, its metabolism slows down
and it relies less on oxygen. Experimenting on dogs and monkeys, White optimized a brain-cooling technique where the brain’s blood flow was
selectively chilled and halted, while the rest of the body’s blood
remained warm and circulated. Then, in 1964, White successfully cooled
the brain of a human patient with a life-threatening brain tumor
into “suspended animation” at 11°C. Whereas normally the surgical team
would have just 3 to 5 minutes to remove the tumor, with this new technique, they operated for over an hour
without causing damage. Brain cooling revolutionized
the field of neurosurgery and put White one step closer
to his body transplant goal. But this vision was fraught
with serious ethical concerns. What conditions would justify
such an experimental surgery, that could result in debilitating pain
and neurological damage? And how many animals would have to die
to prove it was possible? At the time, bioethics
was still an emerging field. Nevertheless, numerous critics, including
many in the scientific community, recognized the cruelty of White's research
and strongly opposed it. Yet White continued to gain approval
from agencies like the NIH. And by 1970, he was ready to attempt
a monkey body transplant. First Monkey A was installed
with temporary blood vessels— coils of plastic tubes that tethered
the head to the body. Plastic tube by plastic tube,
the team connected Body B to Head A, and then waited for the subject
to awake from anesthesia. The monkey did— alive, paralyzed,
and extremely distressed. According to the team, the monkey
could see, smell, hear, and even tried to bite off
one of the doctors’ fingers. White felt this proved that the operation
could work. The brain appeared to survive
a head transplant and, with high doses of drugs,
could live without immune rejection. But had White performed
a body transplant on Monkey A? Or was it a head transplant on Monkey B? The surgery raises questions
about the mind-body divide that have been debated for millennia. While modern neuroscience supports
the central role of the brain in building out our consciousness, discoveries about gut neurons
and the microbiome suggest that the answer
may be more complicated. Does part of the “self” reside
outside of the mind? The body and brain are interconnected
by circuits and signaling systems; so, what is lost by separating the two? As a neurosurgeon, White performed
more than 10,000 brain operations before retiring in 1998— but never the human head transplant
he dreamed of. Since then, several scientists have
expressed interest in picking up where White left off,
reviving unfinished debates. Even if a doctor could successfully
connect a patient’s head to a donor’s body, who of the two would emerge? And is extending a life
always worth the cost?

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 9 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 9 does not directly address why Robert White never performed his dream operation on a human, I re-evaluated the options and found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the overall topic and content, I would say that Question 5 is the closest, as it discusses the ethical concerns surrounding Dr. White's research, which might be related to why he never performed the operation on a human. Nevertheless, it is essential to note that this is a weak match.

Therefore, I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that directly addresses the question of why Robert White never performed his dream operation on a human, with options that match the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 5 (weak match)

**Transcript**:
On a hot spring afternoon in 1963, two men, sent by the American CIA, snuck into the cafeteria
of the Havana Libre Hotel. Their directive was to retrieve
a poison pill from the freezer and slip it into the chocolate milkshake
of Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader who was known to devour
up to 18 scoops of ice cream after lunch. While exact details of the story are
contested, it's rumored that the pill, however, froze to the freezer coils
and broke, foiling the CIA’s plan and granting Castro
many more days to satiate his sweet tooth. Ice cream has held a unique role in our
world’s history, culture, and cravings— but where did it come from? The first accounts of cold desserts
and iced drinks date back as early as the first century. In civilizations including ancient Rome,
Mughal India, and Tang dynasty China, these icy treats were mainly enjoyed
by the royal elites. And finding the means to freeze
these delicacies wasn’t always easy. Wealthy Mediterranean nobility sent
laborers to trek up high mountains to harvest glacial ice and snow. Meanwhile, ancient Persians built
shallow insulated pools of water and utilized a technique
known as sky cooling. At night, the shallow pools would
naturally radiate heat into the dry desert skies, causing them to dip below the
ambient temperature and freeze. Yet the cream-based treat we know today
made a much later debut. It was originally inspired by sherbet,
or sharbat in Arabic, an icy drink believed to have
originated in Persia, and subsequently gained popularity
in the Middle Ages. European travelers brought
sharbat recipes home, and began creating their own
chocolate, pinecone, and even eggplant flavored
takes on the refreshment. In 1692, Antonio Latini,
a Neapolitan chef, recorded a recipe for a
unique milk-based version, which some historians dub
the first ice cream. In the 18th century,
ice cream expanded its reach as these recipes set sail alongside
European settlers to North America. Yet it was still mainly enjoyed
by the upper classes as the process to make it
was quite laborious, and its main ingredients—
sugar, salt, and cream— were expensive. George Washington is said to have spent
the equivalent of $6,600 in today’s dollars on ice cream
in one summer alone. It was on American soil that the
frozen dessert entered its golden age, as inventors and entrepreneurs began to
engineer ways to bring it to the masses. In Philadelphia in 1843,
Nancy Johnson patented a revolutionary ice cream-making machine
featuring a crank and beater, which made the process easier
for any home cook. And storing ice cream was no longer
an obstacle, as by the mid-1830s, New England businessman “Ice King”
Frederic Tudor had greatly improved the ice trade, shipping thousands of tons of ice
to households across the globe. Soon, ice cream was
on every street corner. In the late 1880s, political turmoil
brought Italian immigrants to cities like London, Glasgow, and New York, where many took up jobs as street vendors
selling licks of ice cream for roughly a penny each. Meanwhile, American druggists discovered
the appeal of combining soda, a drink thought to have therapeutic
properties at the time, with ice cream, and a new social spot was born:
the soda fountain. When the sale of alcohol
was banned in 1920, many American saloons reinvented
themselves as soda fountains, and breweries like Anheuser-Busch
and Yuengling pivoted to producing ice cream. At the same time, refrigeration technology
was improving rapidly. By the end of World War II, the average American home had a freezer
that could house a quart of ice cream. Even trucks could be equipped
with freezers full of frozen treats. Today, ice cream continues
to take on new forms. And while some of its mysteries
may never be solved, one thing is certain:
our love for ice cream will never thaw.

contested, it's rumored that the pill, however, froze to the freezer coils
and broke, foiling the CIA’s plan and granting Castro
many more days to satiate his sweet tooth. Ice cream has held a unique role in our
world’s history, culture, and cravings— but where did it come from? The first accounts of cold desserts
and iced drinks date back as early as the first century. In civilizations including ancient Rome,
Mughal India, and Tang dynasty China, these icy treats were mainly enjoyed
by the royal elites. And finding the means to freeze
these delicacies wasn’t always easy. Wealthy Mediterranean nobility sent
laborers to trek up high mountains to harvest glacial ice and snow. Meanwhile, ancient Persians built
shallow insulated pools of water and utilized a technique
known as sky cooling. At night, the shallow pools would
naturally radiate heat into the dry desert skies, causing them to dip below the
ambient temperature and freeze. Yet the cream-based treat we know today
made a much later debut. It was originally inspired by sherbet,
or sharbat in Arabic, an icy drink believed to have
originated in Persia, and subsequently gained popularity
in the Middle Ages. European travelers brought
sharbat recipes home, and began creating their own
chocolate, pinecone, and even eggplant flavored
takes on the refreshment. In 1692, Antonio Latini,
a Neapolitan chef, recorded a recipe for a
unique milk-based version, which some historians dub
the first ice cream. In the 18th century,
ice cream expanded its reach as these recipes set sail alongside
European settlers to North America. Yet it was still mainly enjoyed
by the upper classes as the process to make it
was quite laborious, and its main ingredients—
sugar, salt, and cream— were expensive. George Washington is said to have spent
the equivalent of $6,600 in today’s dollars on ice cream
in one summer alone. It was on American soil that the
frozen dessert entered its golden age, as inventors and entrepreneurs began to
engineer ways to bring it to the masses. In Philadelphia in 1843,
Nancy Johnson patented a revolutionary ice cream-making machine
featuring a crank and beater, which made the process easier
for any home cook. And storing ice cream was no longer
an obstacle, as by the mid-1830s, New England businessman “Ice King”
Frederic Tudor had greatly improved the ice trade, shipping thousands of tons of ice
to households across the globe. Soon, ice cream was
on every street corner. In the late 1880s, political turmoil
brought Italian immigrants to cities like London, Glasgow, and New York, where many took up jobs as street vendors
selling licks of ice cream for roughly a penny each. Meanwhile, American druggists discovered
the appeal of combining soda, a drink thought to have therapeutic
properties at the time, with ice cream, and a new social spot was born:
the soda fountain. When the sale of alcohol
was banned in 1920, many American saloons reinvented
themselves as soda fountains, and breweries like Anheuser-Busch
and Yuengling pivoted to producing ice cream. At the same time, refrigeration technology
was improving rapidly. By the end of World War II, the average American home had a freezer
that could house a quart of ice cream. Even trucks could be equipped
with freezers full of frozen treats. Today, ice cream continues
to take on new forms. And while some of its mysteries
may never be solved, one thing is certain:
our love for ice cream will never thaw.

Typically, with any piece of technology,
you get out what you put in. Pump one unit of energy
into an electric toaster and you get about one
out in the form of heat. That’s just the first law
of thermodynamics: energy has to be conserved. But there's a piece of technology
called a heat pump, where for every bit of energy you put in,
you get 3 to 5 times as much heat out. What wizardry is this? Heat pumps have been hailed
as a climate-friendly heating solution to traditional heaters, most of which operate
by burning fossil fuels. So much so that in 2021, heating buildings was responsible
for about 10% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Heat pumps reduce emissions in two ways— first, they run on electricity, meaning less fossil fuel use as grids
make the switch to renewable energy. And second, they're more efficient
than their counterparts, using less energy to produce
the same amount of heat. Where a typical oil or gas boiler is,
at best, about 90% efficient, some heat pumps can achieve
500% efficiency. Heat pumps rely on the same technology
as air conditioners. And in fact, they often double
as air conditioners, heating your home in the winter
and cooling it in the summer. How? Air conditioners take heat
from your home and move it outside. To do so, they harness the second law
of thermodynamics. That’s the one that says that heat will
always move from a hotter object to a colder one. When you turn on your A/C, a fan blows the hot air from your home
over coils containing a substance
called a refrigerant. A refrigerant’s molecules turn to gas
at relatively low temperatures, so as it collects thermal energy
from the hot air in your home, it boils. Then, it passes into a compressor, which pushes the gas molecules
closer together, heating them up even more. Now that gas is hot—
way hotter than the outside air. So when a fan blows over the refrigerant, thermal energy transfers to the
comparatively cold air outside. As the refrigerant releases heat,
it starts to liquefy. It goes through an expansion valve,
which decreases the pressure, causing it to get even colder. Now, it’s ready to pick up more heat
from your house and start the cycle again. In winter, heat pumps work
exactly the same way. But this time they pick up heat
from outside and move it into your home. Of course, it’s sometimes freezing outside
when you want to use your heater. But the air doesn’t need to be warm— it just needs to be warmer than the
refrigerant to transfer its heat. All this sounds great, but for now there
are some drawbacks to this technology. First, refrigerants can be
potent greenhouse gases. Hydrofluorocarbons are some
of the most popular refrigerants. But a single hydrofluorocarbon molecule
can have 2,000 times the global warming impact of CO2. While in use, the refrigerant stays
contained in a closed loop. But when heat pumps, A/Cs, and
refrigerators are improperly installed or thrown into landfills,
the refrigerant can leak out. So scientists are trying to create
new refrigerants that are better for the environment. Also, the colder it is outside, the less efficient an air-to-air
heat pump will be. Nevertheless, over half the buildings
in icy Norway use heat pumps. Some people there have opted for pumps
that draw heat from under the ground, which stays more consistently warm,
rather than heat from the air. Finally, there's the cost. In the US, installing a small heat pump
usually costs several thousand dollars, though some people need
more powerful systems, depending on the size of their home
or the temperature in winter. Often they’re only a little more expensive
than installing a new A/C system, and the heat pump can save money
on utilities in the long run. But replacing a working system requires
an upfront investment that a lot of people just don’t have. Still, as the risks
of climate change loom, many countries are offering subsidies
to help with the costs. And some cities are creatively harnessing
seas, sewage, and data centers as heat sources,
using heat pumps in manufacturing, and even creating giant heat pumps
for entire districts. So, are heat pumps actually breaking
the first law of thermodynamics? Of course not. They’re just not using
their electricity to make heat. They're using it to power the compressor
and spin the fans. They get the extra energy for free—
from heat in the air or underground. Which is how, by putting in 1 unit
of energy, you get 3 to 5 units of heat out. Seems like magic, but it's just physics.

you get out what you put in. Pump one unit of energy
into an electric toaster and you get about one
out in the form of heat. That’s just the first law
of thermodynamics: energy has to be conserved. But there's a piece of technology
called a heat pump, where for every bit of energy you put in,
you get 3 to 5 times as much heat out. What wizardry is this? Heat pumps have been hailed
as a climate-friendly heating solution to traditional heaters, most of which operate
by burning fossil fuels. So much so that in 2021, heating buildings was responsible
for about 10% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Heat pumps reduce emissions in two ways— first, they run on electricity, meaning less fossil fuel use as grids
make the switch to renewable energy. And second, they're more efficient
than their counterparts, using less energy to produce
the same amount of heat. Where a typical oil or gas boiler is,
at best, about 90% efficient, some heat pumps can achieve
500% efficiency. Heat pumps rely on the same technology
as air conditioners. And in fact, they often double
as air conditioners, heating your home in the winter
and cooling it in the summer. How? Air conditioners take heat
from your home and move it outside. To do so, they harness the second law
of thermodynamics. That’s the one that says that heat will
always move from a hotter object to a colder one. When you turn on your A/C, a fan blows the hot air from your home
over coils containing a substance
called a refrigerant. A refrigerant’s molecules turn to gas
at relatively low temperatures, so as it collects thermal energy
from the hot air in your home, it boils. Then, it passes into a compressor, which pushes the gas molecules
closer together, heating them up even more. Now that gas is hot—
way hotter than the outside air. So when a fan blows over the refrigerant, thermal energy transfers to the
comparatively cold air outside. As the refrigerant releases heat,
it starts to liquefy. It goes through an expansion valve,
which decreases the pressure, causing it to get even colder. Now, it’s ready to pick up more heat
from your house and start the cycle again. In winter, heat pumps work
exactly the same way. But this time they pick up heat
from outside and move it into your home. Of course, it’s sometimes freezing outside
when you want to use your heater. But the air doesn’t need to be warm— it just needs to be warmer than the
refrigerant to transfer its heat. All this sounds great, but for now there
are some drawbacks to this technology. First, refrigerants can be
potent greenhouse gases. Hydrofluorocarbons are some
of the most popular refrigerants. But a single hydrofluorocarbon molecule
can have 2,000 times the global warming impact of CO2. While in use, the refrigerant stays
contained in a closed loop. But when heat pumps, A/Cs, and
refrigerators are improperly installed or thrown into landfills,
the refrigerant can leak out. So scientists are trying to create
new refrigerants that are better for the environment. Also, the colder it is outside, the less efficient an air-to-air
heat pump will be. Nevertheless, over half the buildings
in icy Norway use heat pumps. Some people there have opted for pumps
that draw heat from under the ground, which stays more consistently warm,
rather than heat from the air. Finally, there's the cost. In the US, installing a small heat pump
usually costs several thousand dollars, though some people need
more powerful systems, depending on the size of their home
or the temperature in winter. Often they’re only a little more expensive
than installing a new A/C system, and the heat pump can save money
on utilities in the long run. But replacing a working system requires
an upfront investment that a lot of people just don’t have. Still, as the risks
of climate change loom, many countries are offering subsidies
to help with the costs. And some cities are creatively harnessing
seas, sewage, and data centers as heat sources,
using heat pumps in manufacturing, and even creating giant heat pumps
for entire districts. So, are heat pumps actually breaking
the first law of thermodynamics? Of course not. They’re just not using
their electricity to make heat. They're using it to power the compressor
and spin the fans. They get the extra energy for free—
from heat in the air or underground. Which is how, by putting in 1 unit
of energy, you get 3 to 5 units of heat out. Seems like magic, but it's just physics.

**Transcript**:
It was June 2010. Inside the Scripps National Spelling Bee, contestants between 8- and 15-years-old
wrestled words like brachydactylous and leguleian. Outside, a crowd protested the complexity
of English spelling conventions. Indeed, spelling reformers have
been around for centuries, advocating for overarching changes to make
English spelling more intuitive. The English language is chock-full
of irregularities. One commonly used example of this:
take the “g-h” sound from “enough,” the “o” sound from “women,”
and the “t-i” sound from “action,” and you could argue that
“g-h-o-t-i” spells “fish.” So, how did English get like this? English arose from old Germanic
tribes that invaded the British Isles more than 1,500 years ago. Their languages coalesced and evolved
into Old English. When Roman missionaries arrived
around 600 CE, they devised ways to write it
down using the Latin alphabet, supplementing it with some Germanic runes
for sounds they didn’t have letters for. Then came the Norman invasion of 1066
when French speakers conquered England. French became the language
of authority and high society. But English remained the dominant
spoken language. Over time, those descended from French
speakers also became English speakers, but some French words snuck
into the language. Some English speakers were also familiar
with Latin through the church and formal education. By the mid-1400s, people were writing
in English again— but it was unstandardized. They used a mix of influences to determine
word choice and spelling, including the French they knew,
the Latin they studied, and the English they spoke. So, things were already pretty messy. Then, in 1476, the printing press
arrived in England. Some of the people working the presses
may have mainly spoken Flemish— not English. And they were given manuscripts
that varied widely in their spelling. Without standardization, different writers
went with various spellings based in part on what they happened
to encounter while reading. Many words had a multitude of spellings. The word “dough,” for instance, used to be spelled in all these ways
and was originally pronounced “dach.” The guttural Germanic sound it ended with
was one the Latin alphabet didn’t cover. It eventually came to be
represented with “g-h.” But, for some “g-h” words, English speakers eventually dropped
the guttural sound altogether; for others, they ended up pronouncing
it as “f” instead, as exemplified in “dough” versus “tough.” Printing presses memorialized
the spelling even though the pronunciation
eventually changed. And this wasn’t just the case with “g-h.” Some letters in other words
also fell silent: words like knife, gnat, and wrong all contain the vestiges
of past pronunciations. But while the printing press
was solidifying spellings, the English language was also undergoing
what scholars call the Great Vowel Shift. Between the 14th and 18th centuries, the way English speakers pronounced
many vowels changed significantly. For instance, “bawt” became “boat.” This displaced the word for “boot,” which had up until then
been pronounced “boat,” and pushed it into the high “u” vowel
position it maintains today. Words that already had this high “u”
often became diphthongs, with two vowels in a single syllable. So, “hus” became “house.” As with so many linguistic matters,
there's no clear reason why this happened. But it did. And how the vowel shift affected a word
depended on various things, including the other sounds in the word. The word “tough” was once “tōh,”
among other variations. “Through” was once “thruch”
and “dough” “dah.” These words all started
with different vowel sounds that were then affected differently
by the vowel shift. The “o-u” spelling they all adopted was
a haphazardly applied French influence. So, eventually they wound up with
still distinct vowel sounds, but similar spellings
that don’t really make much sense. All this means English can be
a difficult language for non-native speakers to learn. And it reveals the many ways history,
in all its messiness, acted upon English,
making it especially tough.

**Transcript**:
It was June 2010. Inside the Scripps National Spelling Bee, contestants between 8- and 15-years-old
wrestled words like brachydactylous and leguleian. Outside, a crowd protested the complexity
of English spelling conventions. Indeed, spelling reformers have
been around for centuries, advocating for overarching changes to make
English spelling more intuitive. The English language is chock-full
of irregularities. One commonly used example of this:
take the “g-h” sound from “enough,” the “o” sound from “women,”
and the “t-i” sound from “action,” and you could argue that
“g-h-o-t-i” spells “fish.” So, how did English get like this? English arose from old Germanic
tribes that invaded the British Isles more than 1,500 years ago. Their languages coalesced and evolved
into Old English. When Roman missionaries arrived
around 600 CE, they devised ways to write it
down using the Latin alphabet, supplementing it with some Germanic runes
for sounds they didn’t have letters for. Then came the Norman invasion of 1066
when French speakers conquered England. French became the language
of authority and high society. But English remained the dominant
spoken language. Over time, those descended from French
speakers also became English speakers, but some French words snuck
into the language. Some English speakers were also familiar
with Latin through the church and formal education. By the mid-1400s, people were writing
in English again— but it was unstandardized. They used a mix of influences to determine
word choice and spelling, including the French they knew,
the Latin they studied, and the English they spoke. So, things were already pretty messy. Then, in 1476, the printing press
arrived in England. Some of the people working the presses
may have mainly spoken Flemish— not English. And they were given manuscripts
that varied widely in their spelling. Without standardization, different writers
went with various spellings based in part on what they happened
to encounter while reading. Many words had a multitude of spellings. The word “dough,” for instance, used to be spelled in all these ways
and was originally pronounced “dach.” The guttural Germanic sound it ended with
was one the Latin alphabet didn’t cover. It eventually came to be
represented with “g-h.” But, for some “g-h” words, English speakers eventually dropped
the guttural sound altogether; for others, they ended up pronouncing
it as “f” instead, as exemplified in “dough” versus “tough.” Printing presses memorialized
the spelling even though the pronunciation
eventually changed. And this wasn’t just the case with “g-h.” Some letters in other words
also fell silent: words like knife, gnat, and wrong all contain the vestiges
of past pronunciations. But while the printing press
was solidifying spellings, the English language was also undergoing
what scholars call the Great Vowel Shift. Between the 14th and 18th centuries, the way English speakers pronounced
many vowels changed significantly. For instance, “bawt” became “boat.” This displaced the word for “boot,” which had up until then
been pronounced “boat,” and pushed it into the high “u” vowel
position it maintains today. Words that already had this high “u”
often became diphthongs, with two vowels in a single syllable. So, “hus” became “house.” As with so many linguistic matters,
there's no clear reason why this happened. But it did. And how the vowel shift affected a word
depended on various things, including the other sounds in the word. The word “tough” was once “tōh,”
among other variations. “Through” was once “thruch”
and “dough” “dah.” These words all started
with different vowel sounds that were then affected differently
by the vowel shift. The “o-u” spelling they all adopted was
a haphazardly applied French influence. So, eventually they wound up with
still distinct vowel sounds, but similar spellings
that don’t really make much sense. All this means English can be
a difficult language for non-native speakers to learn. And it reveals the many ways history,
in all its messiness, acted upon English,
making it especially tough.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although the wording of the question is different, the intent and content of Question 8 are similar to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions ask about the impact of the Norman invasion of 1066 on the English language, specifically with regards to the role of French. However, the correct option for Question 8 (A. It introduced French as the dominant language) is not an exact match for the correct option of the ground truth MCQ (B. The ruling class).

A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the specific social class that adopted French as their language after the Norman invasion. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Therefore, the closest match is Question 8, but with some differences in wording and options.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4: What is the term used to describe the change in the pronunciation of vowels in English between the 14th and 18th centuries?**

However, this question does not match the intent of the ground truth MCQ. A closer match is:

**No direct match, but Question 6 is related to the Great Vowel Shift.**

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about when the Great Vowel Shift occurred or how it affected English vowels. Since there isn't a direct match, I will provide the index of the most related question:

**Index: 6 (with a note that it's not a direct match)**

If I had to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be:

**New Question: When did the Great Vowel Shift affect how English vowels were pronounced?**

Options: A. In Old English, B. Before spelling was standardized, C. After spelling was standardized, D. While spelling was being standardized

Correct Option: D

This new question matches the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You and your partner Alex have been in a
strong, loving relationship for years, and lately you're considering
getting engaged. Alex is enthusiastic about the idea,
but you can’t get over the statistics. You know a lot of marriages end
in divorce, often not amicably. And over 10% of couples
in their first marriage get divorced within the first five years. If your marriage wouldn’t
even last five years, you feel like tying the knot
would be a mistake. But you live in the near future, where a brand-new company just
released an AI-based model that can predict your likelihood
of divorce. The model is trained on data sets containing individuals’
social media activity, online search histories, spending habits,
and history of marriage and divorce. And using this information, the AI can predict if a couple
will divorce within the first five years of marriage
with 95% accuracy. The only catch is the model doesn’t offer
any reasons for its results— it simply predicts that you will or won’t
divorce without saying why. So, should you decide whether or not
to get married based on this AI’s prediction? Suppose the model predicts you and Alex would divorce within five years
of getting married. At this point, you'd have three options. You could get married anyway
and hope the prediction is wrong. You could break up now, though there’s no way to know if ending
your currently happy relationship would cause more harm than letting
the prediction run its course. Or, you could stay together
and remain unmarried, on the off-chance marriage itself
would be the problem. Though without understanding the reasons
for your predicted divorce, you’d never know if those mystery issues
would still emerge to ruin your relationship. The uncertainty undermining
all these options stems from a well known issue with AI
around explainability and transparency. This problem plagues tons of potentially
useful predictive models, such as those that could be used
to predict which bank customers are most likely to repay a loan, or which prisoners are most likely
to reoffend if granted parole. Without knowing why AI systems
reach their decisions, many worry we can’t think critically
about how to follow their advice. But the transparency problem
doesn’t just prevent us from understanding these models, it also impacts the user’s accountability. For example, if the AI's prediction
led you to break up with Alex, what explanation could you
reasonably offer them? That you want to end
your happy relationship because some mysterious machine
predicted its demise? That hardly seems fair to Alex. We don’t always owe people
an explanation for our actions, but when we do, AI’s lack of transparency can create
ethically challenging situations. And accountability is just one
of the tradeoffs we make by outsourcing important decisions to AI. If you’re comfortable deferring
your agency to an AI model it’s likely because you’re focused
on the accuracy of the prediction. In this mindset, it doesn’t really matter
why you and Alex might break up— simply that you likely will. But if you prioritize authenticity
over accuracy, then you'll need to understand
and appreciate the reasons for your future divorce
before ending things today. Authentic decision making like this is
essential for maintaining accountability, and it might be your best chance
to prove the prediction wrong. On the other hand,
it’s also possible the model already accounted for your attempts
to defy it, and you’re just setting yourself
up for failure. 95% accuracy is high, 
but it’s not perfect— that figure means 1 in 20 couples
will receive a false prediction. And as more people use this service, the likelihood increases that someone
who was predicted to divorce will do so just because the AI
predicted they would. If that happens to enough newlyweds, the AI's success rate could
be artificially maintained or even increased by these
self-fulfilling predictions. Of course, no matter what
the AI might tell you, whether you even ask for its prediction
is still up to you.

**Transcript**:
You and your partner Alex have been in a
strong, loving relationship for years, and lately you're considering
getting engaged. Alex is enthusiastic about the idea,
but you can’t get over the statistics. You know a lot of marriages end
in divorce, often not amicably. And over 10% of couples
in their first marriage get divorced within the first five years. If your marriage wouldn’t
even last five years, you feel like tying the knot
would be a mistake. But you live in the near future, where a brand-new company just
released an AI-based model that can predict your likelihood
of divorce. The model is trained on data sets containing individuals’
social media activity, online search histories, spending habits,
and history of marriage and divorce. And using this information, the AI can predict if a couple
will divorce within the first five years of marriage
with 95% accuracy. The only catch is the model doesn’t offer
any reasons for its results— it simply predicts that you will or won’t
divorce without saying why. So, should you decide whether or not
to get married based on this AI’s prediction? Suppose the model predicts you and Alex would divorce within five years
of getting married. At this point, you'd have three options. You could get married anyway
and hope the prediction is wrong. You could break up now, though there’s no way to know if ending
your currently happy relationship would cause more harm than letting
the prediction run its course. Or, you could stay together
and remain unmarried, on the off-chance marriage itself
would be the problem. Though without understanding the reasons
for your predicted divorce, you’d never know if those mystery issues
would still emerge to ruin your relationship. The uncertainty undermining
all these options stems from a well known issue with AI
around explainability and transparency. This problem plagues tons of potentially
useful predictive models, such as those that could be used
to predict which bank customers are most likely to repay a loan, or which prisoners are most likely
to reoffend if granted parole. Without knowing why AI systems
reach their decisions, many worry we can’t think critically
about how to follow their advice. But the transparency problem
doesn’t just prevent us from understanding these models, it also impacts the user’s accountability. For example, if the AI's prediction
led you to break up with Alex, what explanation could you
reasonably offer them? That you want to end
your happy relationship because some mysterious machine
predicted its demise? That hardly seems fair to Alex. We don’t always owe people
an explanation for our actions, but when we do, AI’s lack of transparency can create
ethically challenging situations. And accountability is just one
of the tradeoffs we make by outsourcing important decisions to AI. If you’re comfortable deferring
your agency to an AI model it’s likely because you’re focused
on the accuracy of the prediction. In this mindset, it doesn’t really matter
why you and Alex might break up— simply that you likely will. But if you prioritize authenticity
over accuracy, then you'll need to understand
and appreciate the reasons for your future divorce
before ending things today. Authentic decision making like this is
essential for maintaining accountability, and it might be your best chance
to prove the prediction wrong. On the other hand,
it’s also possible the model already accounted for your attempts
to defy it, and you’re just setting yourself
up for failure. 95% accuracy is high, 
but it’s not perfect— that figure means 1 in 20 couples
will receive a false prediction. And as more people use this service, the likelihood increases that someone
who was predicted to divorce will do so just because the AI
predicted they would. If that happens to enough newlyweds, the AI's success rate could
be artificially maintained or even increased by these
self-fulfilling predictions. Of course, no matter what
the AI might tell you, whether you even ask for its prediction
is still up to you.

**Transcript**:
According to legend, the ancient Roman
statesman Cincinnatus was plowing his fields
when news arrived that the Aequi, Rome’s powerful enemy to the east,
had invaded. Rome was in need of swift,
decisive action, and the senate had chosen him
to serve as dictator, with absolute power over the military
and government. Cincinnatus set down his plow,
took control and, in a matter of weeks,
saved Rome. This story reinforces the myth
of the “benevolent dictator”— the idea of a leader who
holds absolute power, yet only uses it for the common good, 
to address problems efficiently, and create a just regime. But can a truly benevolent dictator
exist in today’s world? Nations established modern democracies
to safeguard against the potentially destructive whims
of a single individual. When functioning properly,
democracies enable a society to be freer, and provide stability by protecting
against corruption and the abuse of power. This is accomplished by holding regular,
free, and fair elections, imposing term limits, and establishing strong legislative
branches and court systems. Maintaining a free press also helps keep
politicians accountable for their actions and encourages citizens to engage
in their governments and communities. In a dictatorship,
absolute or near-absolute power is held by a single individual who is free to impose their vision
on society. Under certain conditions, the idea
of a dictator can sound appealing, like when a democracy isn't functioning
as it should due to corruption, economic instability,
or extreme political polarization. At these moments, people may be willing to give up some
democratic rights and freedoms for hopes of a better future. Authoritarian-leaning leaders
present themselves as the ones who can fix everything. They distill complex problems
into simple talking points and promise quick solutions. Some of the most overt authoritarian
leaders have taken this strategy, including military dictators who seized
control through coups like Augusto Pinochet, Mobuto Sese Seko,
and Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi, for example, initially asserted
himself as a revolutionary hero, canceling the country's exploitative
foreign oil contracts. But the longer he was in power,
the more riddled with paranoia he became. Like Pinochet and Mobuto, he used his
position to target and torture opponents, embark on campaigns of mass violence
against everyday people, and build an enormous personal fortune. Other modern dictators were initially
elected democratically, then strategically accumulated power by
embracing authoritarian forms of control. Italy’s Benito Mussolini and
Germany’s Adolf Hitler, for example, gained popularity during waves
of mass discontent. Both channeled economic woes
into racist rhetoric and embraced fascism, a type of authoritarianism which exalts
the importance of one nation, or race, above all others. Once in office, such leaders gradually
dismantle checks on their power, including removing judges who might rule
against them, abolishing term limits, or refusing to acknowledge
unfavorable election results. Since they punish dissenting voices, dictators are often surrounded
with yes-men, who are promoted based on loyalty
over expertise, ultimately wreaking incalculable economic,
social, and environmental costs. But these costs can also
be hidden from view. Dictators build up cults of personality
by minimizing negative coverage and pushing positive propaganda
that presents them as strong or heroic. This can make it almost impossible
to accurately measure their success. Did Mussolini really make
the trains run on time? It’s hard to know, since he would have
punished those who said otherwise. While some modern dictators have
brought modest growth to their nation’s economies
and industries, most have enriched the few and left
widespread destruction in their wake. Even so-called benevolent dictators,
whose regimes lacked overt violence, stand accused of censoring journalists and limiting the rights
and freedoms of citizens. Back to ancient Rome. Perhaps the most important dimension of Cincinnatus’ legendary 
benevolent dictatorship is not that he held total power, but that he gave it up after only 16 days. Once Rome was safe,
he stepped down and retired to his fields. His willingness to relinquish control
to the senate was as important to the common good
as his ability to fend off invaders. In practice, no modern dictator
has lived up to this ideal. Dictators don’t willingly walk away
from power, they continuously crave more. That’s why institutions that provide
checks on leaders must be safeguarded: in the hands of an aspiring dictator, even seemingly robust democracies can sink into repressive,
authoritarian regimes.

himself as a revolutionary hero, canceling the country's exploitative
foreign oil contracts. But the longer he was in power,
the more riddled with paranoia he became. Like Pinochet and Mobuto, he used his
position to target and torture opponents, embark on campaigns of mass violence
against everyday people, and build an enormous personal fortune. Other modern dictators were initially
elected democratically, then strategically accumulated power by
embracing authoritarian forms of control. Italy’s Benito Mussolini and
Germany’s Adolf Hitler, for example, gained popularity during waves
of mass discontent. Both channeled economic woes
into racist rhetoric and embraced fascism, a type of authoritarianism which exalts
the importance of one nation, or race, above all others. Once in office, such leaders gradually
dismantle checks on their power, including removing judges who might rule
against them, abolishing term limits, or refusing to acknowledge
unfavorable election results. Since they punish dissenting voices, dictators are often surrounded
with yes-men, who are promoted based on loyalty
over expertise, ultimately wreaking incalculable economic,
social, and environmental costs. But these costs can also
be hidden from view. Dictators build up cults of personality
by minimizing negative coverage and pushing positive propaganda
that presents them as strong or heroic. This can make it almost impossible
to accurately measure their success. Did Mussolini really make
the trains run on time? It’s hard to know, since he would have
punished those who said otherwise. While some modern dictators have
brought modest growth to their nation’s economies
and industries, most have enriched the few and left
widespread destruction in their wake. Even so-called benevolent dictators,
whose regimes lacked overt violence, stand accused of censoring journalists and limiting the rights
and freedoms of citizens. Back to ancient Rome. Perhaps the most important dimension of Cincinnatus’ legendary 
benevolent dictatorship is not that he held total power, but that he gave it up after only 16 days. Once Rome was safe,
he stepped down and retired to his fields. His willingness to relinquish control
to the senate was as important to the common good
as his ability to fend off invaders. In practice, no modern dictator
has lived up to this ideal. Dictators don’t willingly walk away
from power, they continuously crave more. That’s why institutions that provide
checks on leaders must be safeguarded: in the hands of an aspiring dictator, even seemingly robust democracies can sink into repressive,
authoritarian regimes.

**Transcript**:
According to legend, the ancient Roman
statesman Cincinnatus was plowing his fields
when news arrived that the Aequi, Rome’s powerful enemy to the east,
had invaded. Rome was in need of swift,
decisive action, and the senate had chosen him
to serve as dictator, with absolute power over the military
and government. Cincinnatus set down his plow,
took control and, in a matter of weeks,
saved Rome. This story reinforces the myth
of the “benevolent dictator”— the idea of a leader who
holds absolute power, yet only uses it for the common good, 
to address problems efficiently, and create a just regime. But can a truly benevolent dictator
exist in today’s world? Nations established modern democracies
to safeguard against the potentially destructive whims
of a single individual. When functioning properly,
democracies enable a society to be freer, and provide stability by protecting
against corruption and the abuse of power. This is accomplished by holding regular,
free, and fair elections, imposing term limits, and establishing strong legislative
branches and court systems. Maintaining a free press also helps keep
politicians accountable for their actions and encourages citizens to engage
in their governments and communities. In a dictatorship,
absolute or near-absolute power is held by a single individual who is free to impose their vision
on society. Under certain conditions, the idea
of a dictator can sound appealing, like when a democracy isn't functioning
as it should due to corruption, economic instability,
or extreme political polarization. At these moments, people may be willing to give up some
democratic rights and freedoms for hopes of a better future. Authoritarian-leaning leaders
present themselves as the ones who can fix everything. They distill complex problems
into simple talking points and promise quick solutions. Some of the most overt authoritarian
leaders have taken this strategy, including military dictators who seized
control through coups like Augusto Pinochet, Mobuto Sese Seko,
and Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi, for example, initially asserted
himself as a revolutionary hero, canceling the country's exploitative
foreign oil contracts. But the longer he was in power,
the more riddled with paranoia he became. Like Pinochet and Mobuto, he used his

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

Although the wording of Question 9 is different from the ground truth MCQ, the intent and content are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the political climate in which authoritarian dictators often rise to power, and the correct answer is "Times of economic hardship." Question 9 does not directly ask about the political climate, but it provides a similar context by stating that "A dictatorship is a system of government where power is held by a single individual who is free to impose their vision on society." 

However, a more relevant generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ's intent would be one that directly asks about the conditions under which dictators rise to power. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs directly ask this question.

That being said, among the provided options, Question 2's Option B states, "The idea of a dictator can be appealing when a democracy is functioning properly." This statement is opposite to the ground truth MCQ's intent. However, if this statement were rephrased to something like "The idea of a dictator can be appealing when a democracy is not functioning properly," it would be more similar to the ground truth MCQ's intent.

Considering the above points, the most similar generated MCQ would be a question that asks about the conditions under which dictators rise to power. Since this question is not available, I will choose Question 2 as the closest match, with the understanding that its Option B would need to be rephrased to match the ground truth MCQ's intent.

However, if I had to choose one of the provided generated MCQs without any modifications, I would choose Question 9, as mentioned earlier.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 9 (or 2 with modifications)

**Transcript**:
Roughly 3 billion years ago, a single-celled photosynthetic bacterium
began burping a new chemical that was poisonous
to nearly every species on Earth. Over the following hundreds
of millions of years, more microorganisms began producing
this toxic gas, first saturating Earth's oceans
and eventually its atmosphere. Up here, this chemical changed
the composition of pre-existing gases so drastically that it caused
a global ice age. And the name of this powerful, poisonous,
world-changing gas? Oxygen. In the millions of years since
the Great Oxygen Catastrophe, most life, including all
multicellular organisms, have evolved to rely on this gas. However, there are some places
where oxygen-averse microorganisms, like those from Earth's earliest days,
have re-emerged. Many of these places are
in the ocean depths, beyond the reach of researchers. But there are other bodies of water
completely devoid of oxygen, yet close enough to the surface
to explore. And one such lake is hidden high
in the Swiss Alps’ Piora Valley. Formed over 10,000 years ago, Lake Cadagno is one of roughly 200
known meromictic lakes, meaning it's actually two distinct bodies
of water stacked on top of each other. The top layer functions like
a standard body of freshwater. It’s safe for swimming and known mostly
for a plump and plentiful fish population that’s been the subject
of local fishing legends for centuries. But just 13 meters beneath that bounty
is a dense, sulfurous, oxygen-free pool lethal to any multicellular life forms,
fish included. In a typical lake, the entire
body of water would gradually mix, diffusing oxygen
from the surface throughout. But these two layers never mix,
as is the case with any meromictic lake. And the reason for this divide in Cadagno is the waters’ unique
chemical compositions. Both layers are fed by rainwater
flowing down the mountains, however, this water can take two paths. The first is to trickle down the granitic
mountain directly into the top layer. The second is to seep into the
Piora Valley’s vein of dolomite— a porous rock full of salts
such as sulfate. Rainwater that sinks into the dolomite
will slowly inch towards the lake, all the while shedding its oxygen
and picking up salts. Finally, this heavier water will cascade
from sublacustrine springs below the lake’s surface, forming the dense,
salt-rich bottom layer. This lower layer is anoxic,
meaning oxygen free, and will suffocate any
oxygen-dependent life. But it’s ideal for the kind
of anaerobic bacteria that died off in the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. The flow from the sublacustrine springs
creates microenvironments which feed large aggregates
of microorganisms that emerge from the lakebed
in strange and otherworldly shapes. Various anaerobic microorganisms
take in the water's sulfate and emit toxic sulfide. And at the border of these layers, there’s a thin blanket mainly composed
of pink-bodied Chromatium okenii: a photosynthesizing bacterium
that relies on this sulfur the way most plants rely on oxygen. However, while neither water nor organisms
move between the layers, these ecosystems aren’t
completely out of touch. Chromatium okenii live
at the top of the bottom layer because they need to be as close
to the sun as possible. But while they never cross
into the deadly oxygenated waters, they’re close enough that organisms

**Transcript**:
Roughly 3 billion years ago, a single-celled photosynthetic bacterium
began burping a new chemical that was poisonous
to nearly every species on Earth. Over the following hundreds
of millions of years, more microorganisms began producing
this toxic gas, first saturating Earth's oceans
and eventually its atmosphere. Up here, this chemical changed
the composition of pre-existing gases so drastically that it caused
a global ice age. And the name of this powerful, poisonous,
world-changing gas? Oxygen. In the millions of years since
the Great Oxygen Catastrophe, most life, including all
multicellular organisms, have evolved to rely on this gas. However, there are some places
where oxygen-averse microorganisms, like those from Earth's earliest days,
have re-emerged. Many of these places are
in the ocean depths, beyond the reach of researchers. But there are other bodies of water
completely devoid of oxygen, yet close enough to the surface
to explore. And one such lake is hidden high
in the Swiss Alps’ Piora Valley. Formed over 10,000 years ago, Lake Cadagno is one of roughly 200
known meromictic lakes, meaning it's actually two distinct bodies
of water stacked on top of each other. The top layer functions like
a standard body of freshwater. It’s safe for swimming and known mostly
for a plump and plentiful fish population that’s been the subject
of local fishing legends for centuries. But just 13 meters beneath that bounty
is a dense, sulfurous, oxygen-free pool lethal to any multicellular life forms,
fish included. In a typical lake, the entire
body of water would gradually mix, diffusing oxygen
from the surface throughout. But these two layers never mix,
as is the case with any meromictic lake. And the reason for this divide in Cadagno is the waters’ unique
chemical compositions. Both layers are fed by rainwater
flowing down the mountains, however, this water can take two paths. The first is to trickle down the granitic
mountain directly into the top layer. The second is to seep into the
Piora Valley’s vein of dolomite— a porous rock full of salts
such as sulfate. Rainwater that sinks into the dolomite
will slowly inch towards the lake, all the while shedding its oxygen
and picking up salts. Finally, this heavier water will cascade
from sublacustrine springs below the lake’s surface, forming the dense,
salt-rich bottom layer. This lower layer is anoxic,
meaning oxygen free, and will suffocate any
oxygen-dependent life. But it’s ideal for the kind
of anaerobic bacteria that died off in the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. The flow from the sublacustrine springs
creates microenvironments which feed large aggregates
of microorganisms that emerge from the lakebed
in strange and otherworldly shapes. Various anaerobic microorganisms
take in the water's sulfate and emit toxic sulfide. And at the border of these layers, there’s a thin blanket mainly composed
of pink-bodied Chromatium okenii: a photosynthesizing bacterium
that relies on this sulfur the way most plants rely on oxygen. However, while neither water nor organisms
move between the layers, these ecosystems aren’t
completely out of touch. Chromatium okenii live
at the top of the bottom layer because they need to be as close
to the sun as possible. But while they never cross
into the deadly oxygenated waters, they’re close enough that organisms
like zooplankton can dive down, eat them, and get back up. In fact, this relationship forms
the bottom of the upper layer’s robust food chain supporting the lake’s
legendary fish population. This unique ecology is more than
just a boon for Cadagno’s fishermen. Having access to an isolated

as is the case with any meromictic lake. And the reason for this divide in Cadagno is the waters’ unique
chemical compositions. Both layers are fed by rainwater
flowing down the mountains, however, this water can take two paths. The first is to trickle down the granitic
mountain directly into the top layer. The second is to seep into the
Piora Valley’s vein of dolomite— a porous rock full of salts
such as sulfate. Rainwater that sinks into the dolomite
will slowly inch towards the lake, all the while shedding its oxygen
and picking up salts. Finally, this heavier water will cascade
from sublacustrine springs below the lake’s surface, forming the dense,
salt-rich bottom layer. This lower layer is anoxic,
meaning oxygen free, and will suffocate any
oxygen-dependent life. But it’s ideal for the kind
of anaerobic bacteria that died off in the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. The flow from the sublacustrine springs
creates microenvironments which feed large aggregates
of microorganisms that emerge from the lakebed
in strange and otherworldly shapes. Various anaerobic microorganisms
take in the water's sulfate and emit toxic sulfide. And at the border of these layers, there’s a thin blanket mainly composed
of pink-bodied Chromatium okenii: a photosynthesizing bacterium
that relies on this sulfur the way most plants rely on oxygen. However, while neither water nor organisms
move between the layers, these ecosystems aren’t
completely out of touch. Chromatium okenii live
at the top of the bottom layer because they need to be as close
to the sun as possible. But while they never cross
into the deadly oxygenated waters, they’re close enough that organisms
like zooplankton can dive down, eat them, and get back up. In fact, this relationship forms
the bottom of the upper layer’s robust food chain supporting the lake’s
legendary fish population. This unique ecology is more than
just a boon for Cadagno’s fishermen. Having access to an isolated
anaerobic ecosystem allows scientists to model the world
before the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. For example, when Chromatium okenii
form their blanket, they increase the density
of that thin layer of water. As the water sinks, these microorganisms
are forced to swim back up, creating a minute mixing of water
called bioconvection. This billions of years old phenomenon
might be a clue to how early life evolved
the ability to swim. And it’s just one of the many insights
that await researchers studying Cadagno’s mysterious depths.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although the question content is not identical, both questions relate to the behavior of Chromatium okenii. The ground truth MCQ asks what Chromatium okenii is able to do, and the correct answer is that it mixes the water through bioconvection. Question 8 asks about the significance of the bioconvection phenomenon, which is closely related to the behavior of Chromatium okenii. 

However, a more similar question would be one that directly asks about the behavior of Chromatium okenii. Among the provided options, Question 5 is the closest match in terms of content, but it only asks for the name of the bacterium, not its behavior.

If I had to choose the most similar question based on the provided options, I would choose Question 8, but I would like to note that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
In Jerusalem, on April 11th, 1961, Adolf Eichmann stood trial
for crimes against humanity. Eichmann had been a Nazi official
tasked with organizing the transport of over 1.5 million European Jews
to ghettos and concentration camps. He was popularly described
as an evil mastermind who orchestrated atrocities
from a cushy German office, and many were eager to see the so-called
“desk murderer” tried for his crimes. But the squeamish man who took the stand
seemed more like a dull bureaucrat than a sadistic killer. The disparity between Eichmann’s nature
and his actions was unsettling for many viewers, but for philosopher Hannah Arendt, this contradiction inspired
a disturbing revelation. Arendt was a German Jew who fled
her homeland in 1933 after being briefly imprisoned
by the German secret police. As a refugee in France
and then the United States, she dedicated herself to understanding
how the Nazi regime came to power, and more specifically,
how it inspired so many atrocities. A common opinion at the time was that
the Third Reich was a historical oddity; a perfect storm of uniquely evil leaders supported by German citizens
looking for revenge after their defeat in World War I. But Arendt believed the true conditions
behind this unprecedented rise of totalitarianism
weren’t specific to Germany. Throughout the 1950s, Arendt developed
a theory of the human condition that divided life into three facets: labor— in which we satisfy
our material needs and desires; work— in which we build the world’s
physical and cultural infrastructure; and action— in which we publicly
articulate our values to collectively shape the world around us. It was this last facet,
the life of action, that Arendt believed was under attack, both in Germany and many other
industrialized societies. She saw modernity as an age
ruled by labor, where individuals mainly appear
in the social world to produce and consume goods and services rather than share ideas
and shape communities. Arendt believed this had fostered
societies and ideologies where individuals were seen only
for their economic value, rather than their moral
and political capacities. She believed this isolated people from
their neighbors and their sense of self. And in her 1951 book,
“The Origins of Totalitarianism,” Arendt argued these conditions provided
fertile ground for totalitarian regimes, which use fear and violence
to increase isolation and make it dangerous to publicly engage
as freethinking political agents. In this lonely state,
participating in the regime becomes the only way to recover
a sense of identity and community. Arendt believed it was this
kind of environment where Eichmann committed his crimes. Most people expected
the Jewish German philosopher to judge the ex-Nazi harshly. But while she condemned
his monstrous actions, Arendt saw no evidence that Eichmann
himself was uniquely evil. She saw him as a distinctly ordinary man
who considered diligent obedience the highest form of civic duty. And for Arendt, it was exactly this
ordinariness that was most terrifying. Her point wasn't just that anyone
could do what Eichmann did, but that his story suggested
ordinary people could willingly accept
their societal role— even when it contributed to genocide. Arendt called this phenomenon
“the banality of evil,” and warned that it can emerge whenever
society inhibits our ability to think; or more specifically,
to question our beliefs and actions in a self-reflective internal dialogue. Arendt believed this kind of thinking is
the only way to confront moral problems, and that our responsibility
to self-reflect is especially important when independent thought is threatened. She acknowledged that critical thinking
in oppressive spaces is a defiant act that requires
personal courage. But it must be done regardless, which is why Arendt still held
Eichmann accountable. This thread runs throughout Arendt's work, where she continually insisted
that thinking was our greatest weapon against the threats of modernity. Namely, a relentless drive for economic
and technological development which would increase social alienation
and inhibit human freedom. To foster this essential value, Arendt believed we need to create
formal and informal forums that allowed for open conversations
about shaping our collective future. These might include townhall meetings,
self-governing workplaces, or student unions. But whatever shape they take, what’s most important to Arendt
is that they value open dialogue and critical self-reflection.

“desk murderer” tried for his crimes. But the squeamish man who took the stand
seemed more like a dull bureaucrat than a sadistic killer. The disparity between Eichmann’s nature
and his actions was unsettling for many viewers, but for philosopher Hannah Arendt, this contradiction inspired
a disturbing revelation. Arendt was a German Jew who fled
her homeland in 1933 after being briefly imprisoned
by the German secret police. As a refugee in France
and then the United States, she dedicated herself to understanding
how the Nazi regime came to power, and more specifically,
how it inspired so many atrocities. A common opinion at the time was that
the Third Reich was a historical oddity; a perfect storm of uniquely evil leaders supported by German citizens
looking for revenge after their defeat in World War I. But Arendt believed the true conditions
behind this unprecedented rise of totalitarianism
weren’t specific to Germany. Throughout the 1950s, Arendt developed
a theory of the human condition that divided life into three facets: labor— in which we satisfy
our material needs and desires; work— in which we build the world’s
physical and cultural infrastructure; and action— in which we publicly
articulate our values to collectively shape the world around us. It was this last facet,
the life of action, that Arendt believed was under attack, both in Germany and many other
industrialized societies. She saw modernity as an age
ruled by labor, where individuals mainly appear
in the social world to produce and consume goods and services rather than share ideas
and shape communities. Arendt believed this had fostered
societies and ideologies where individuals were seen only
for their economic value, rather than their moral
and political capacities. She believed this isolated people from
their neighbors and their sense of self. And in her 1951 book,
“The Origins of Totalitarianism,” Arendt argued these conditions provided
fertile ground for totalitarian regimes, which use fear and violence
to increase isolation and make it dangerous to publicly engage
as freethinking political agents. In this lonely state,
participating in the regime becomes the only way to recover
a sense of identity and community. Arendt believed it was this
kind of environment where Eichmann committed his crimes. Most people expected
the Jewish German philosopher to judge the ex-Nazi harshly. But while she condemned
his monstrous actions, Arendt saw no evidence that Eichmann
himself was uniquely evil. She saw him as a distinctly ordinary man
who considered diligent obedience the highest form of civic duty. And for Arendt, it was exactly this
ordinariness that was most terrifying. Her point wasn't just that anyone
could do what Eichmann did, but that his story suggested
ordinary people could willingly accept
their societal role— even when it contributed to genocide. Arendt called this phenomenon
“the banality of evil,” and warned that it can emerge whenever
society inhibits our ability to think; or more specifically,
to question our beliefs and actions in a self-reflective internal dialogue. Arendt believed this kind of thinking is
the only way to confront moral problems, and that our responsibility
to self-reflect is especially important when independent thought is threatened. She acknowledged that critical thinking
in oppressive spaces is a defiant act that requires
personal courage. But it must be done regardless, which is why Arendt still held
Eichmann accountable. This thread runs throughout Arendt's work, where she continually insisted
that thinking was our greatest weapon against the threats of modernity. Namely, a relentless drive for economic
and technological development which would increase social alienation
and inhibit human freedom. To foster this essential value, Arendt believed we need to create
formal and informal forums that allowed for open conversations
about shaping our collective future. These might include townhall meetings,
self-governing workplaces, or student unions. But whatever shape they take, what’s most important to Arendt
is that they value open dialogue and critical self-reflection.

In Jerusalem, on April 11th, 1961, Adolf Eichmann stood trial
for crimes against humanity. Eichmann had been a Nazi official
tasked with organizing the transport of over 1.5 million European Jews
to ghettos and concentration camps. He was popularly described
as an evil mastermind who orchestrated atrocities
from a cushy German office, and many were eager to see the so-called

**Transcript**:
Like so many winged insects, the world’s roughly 4,000 mayfly species
take to the skies for their annual reproductive ritual. These flights happen above every kind
of freshwater body on Earth, barring Antarctica
and a few remote islands. But whether the breeding mayflies
are large Hexagenia limbata, tiny Paracloeodes minutus,
or the thousands of species in between, their time on the wing will be brief. Very brief. For most mayflies,
adulthood lasts roughly one day. And for some species,
it’s only a matter of minutes. This isn’t because they’re all
eaten up by predators— though they are a favorite food
of many fish, birds, and larger insects. Rather, this abridged adulthood is
a natural part of their life cycle. A close look at these insects reveals
they've ditched functional mouths and digestive systems. Without these innards taking up space,
mayfly bodies can store more eggs, with some species producing
up to 12,000 per individual. This adaptation is essential
to mayfly survival since relatively few of these unborn flies
are likely to reach adulthood, and even fewer will successfully
reproduce themselves. In most of these flights,
male mayflies form dancing swarms, which female mayflies move
through until a male grasps them for some mid-air mating. Some all-female populations can
reproduce without joining in the dance, using a process called parthenogenesis
to produce viable offspring without the help of a male. And recent research suggests some mayfly
populations may even switch back and forth between these two forms of reproduction. But regardless of how the eggs
are made ready, the female will deposit them
on or under the water, and promptly perish. This might sound like a tragically
brief existence. And even mayflies’ scientific name, Ephemeroptera, refers to their
stunningly short lifespan. But for centuries, fishermen suspected
that mayflies live much longer than this short flight. And in 1681, scientists finally caught
up to their fishing friends with a published account
of the full mayfly life cycle. When the time is right,
these eggs will hatch. Depending on the kind of mayfly, this can happen as late as several months
after the egg is laid, or even before it’s completely left
the mother’s body. But whenever their egg opens up, the mayfly inside quickly finds
its way into fresh water, and it’s in this aquatic, nymph stage that mayflies spend
the majority of their lives. Inhabiting rivers, small streams,
ponds, lakes, and other places with clean fresh water, most mayfly species stay in this
nymph stage and feed underwater for nearly an entire year. In fact, some species live as nymphs
for up to two years before they metamorphose
into their winged adult state. A year is a long time for such
a small creature to stay alive. So to survive and thrive, mayfly species
have a wide variety of habits and corresponding body forms. Sprawlers are flat enough to stick
to surfaces despite the strength of a current, while clingers accomplish the same feat
with suckers and claws. Other species are swimmers,
crawlers, or borers. One of the most noticeable groups
are the burrowing mayflies; sizable specimens which use
their legs, tusks, and a scoop on their heads
to dig U-shaped tunnels. In these muddy dwellings,
the nymphs use their abdominal gills to accelerate water through their burrow,
filtering it for food along the way. After they metamorphose,
adult swarms can get so large they appear on weather radars like rain. Regardless of how they've adapted, each unique species plays
an essential role in their ecosystem. Plus, nearly all mayflies are a staple
of freshwater fish diets, and since they ingest the smallest
particulate matter in their environment, mayflies are also very sensitive
to water pollution. In fact, scientists can tell a lot
about a water body’s health based on which mayfly species they find. If they don't find mayflies at all, it's usually an indication
that something is wrong. So the next time you see a swarm
of mayflies over a pond, bridge, or park fountain, remember that their short aerial dance means a healthy world exists
below the surface.

of freshwater body on Earth, barring Antarctica
and a few remote islands. But whether the breeding mayflies
are large Hexagenia limbata, tiny Paracloeodes minutus,
or the thousands of species in between, their time on the wing will be brief. Very brief. For most mayflies,
adulthood lasts roughly one day. And for some species,
it’s only a matter of minutes. This isn’t because they’re all
eaten up by predators— though they are a favorite food
of many fish, birds, and larger insects. Rather, this abridged adulthood is
a natural part of their life cycle. A close look at these insects reveals
they've ditched functional mouths and digestive systems. Without these innards taking up space,
mayfly bodies can store more eggs, with some species producing
up to 12,000 per individual. This adaptation is essential
to mayfly survival since relatively few of these unborn flies
are likely to reach adulthood, and even fewer will successfully
reproduce themselves. In most of these flights,
male mayflies form dancing swarms, which female mayflies move
through until a male grasps them for some mid-air mating. Some all-female populations can
reproduce without joining in the dance, using a process called parthenogenesis
to produce viable offspring without the help of a male. And recent research suggests some mayfly
populations may even switch back and forth between these two forms of reproduction. But regardless of how the eggs
are made ready, the female will deposit them
on or under the water, and promptly perish. This might sound like a tragically
brief existence. And even mayflies’ scientific name, Ephemeroptera, refers to their
stunningly short lifespan. But for centuries, fishermen suspected
that mayflies live much longer than this short flight. And in 1681, scientists finally caught
up to their fishing friends with a published account
of the full mayfly life cycle. When the time is right,
these eggs will hatch. Depending on the kind of mayfly, this can happen as late as several months
after the egg is laid, or even before it’s completely left
the mother’s body. But whenever their egg opens up, the mayfly inside quickly finds
its way into fresh water, and it’s in this aquatic, nymph stage that mayflies spend
the majority of their lives. Inhabiting rivers, small streams,
ponds, lakes, and other places with clean fresh water, most mayfly species stay in this
nymph stage and feed underwater for nearly an entire year. In fact, some species live as nymphs
for up to two years before they metamorphose
into their winged adult state. A year is a long time for such
a small creature to stay alive. So to survive and thrive, mayfly species
have a wide variety of habits and corresponding body forms. Sprawlers are flat enough to stick
to surfaces despite the strength of a current, while clingers accomplish the same feat
with suckers and claws. Other species are swimmers,
crawlers, or borers. One of the most noticeable groups
are the burrowing mayflies; sizable specimens which use
their legs, tusks, and a scoop on their heads
to dig U-shaped tunnels. In these muddy dwellings,
the nymphs use their abdominal gills to accelerate water through their burrow,
filtering it for food along the way. After they metamorphose,
adult swarms can get so large they appear on weather radars like rain. Regardless of how they've adapted, each unique species plays
an essential role in their ecosystem. Plus, nearly all mayflies are a staple
of freshwater fish diets, and since they ingest the smallest
particulate matter in their environment, mayflies are also very sensitive
to water pollution. In fact, scientists can tell a lot
about a water body’s health based on which mayfly species they find. If they don't find mayflies at all, it's usually an indication
that something is wrong. So the next time you see a swarm
of mayflies over a pond, bridge, or park fountain, remember that their short aerial dance means a healthy world exists
below the surface.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the duration of the nymph stage of most mayfly species in water. The closest generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 9 talks about the adaptation of mayflies to their environment in terms of their body form and mentions that mayflies spend nearly an entire year in the nymph stage.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the duration of the nymph stage. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

What would make you happy? Can you imagine a milestone, a win,
or even a material possession that would unlock this feeling? In this animated version of
David Steindl-Rast’s popular TED Talk, Brother David explains how a simple
adjustment in how you move through the world might just change
what you see, how you feel, and how you act. Now my topic is gratefulness. What is the connection
between happiness and gratefulness? Many people would say, well,
that’s very easy. When you are happy, you’re grateful. But think again. Is it really the happy people
that are grateful? We all know quite a number of people
who have everything that it would take to be happy, and they are not happy,
because they want something else, or they want more of the same. And we all know people
who have lots of misfortune, misfortune that we ourselves
would not want to have, and they are deeply happy. They radiate happiness. You are surprised. Why? Because they are grateful. Now, we can ask, what really do we mean 
by gratefulness? And how does it work? Something’s given to us
that’s valuable to us. And it’s really given. These two things have to come together. It has to be something valuable,
and it's a real gift. And when these two things come together, then gratefulness spontaneously
rises in my heart, happiness spontaneously rises in my heart. That’s how gratefulness happens. Now, the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this
once in a while. We can be people who live gratefully. And how can we live gratefully? By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment
is a given moment, as we say. It’s a gift. You have no way of assuring that there
will be another moment given to you, and yet, that’s the most valuable thing
that can ever be given to us, this moment,
with all the opportunity that it contains. Does that mean that we can be grateful
for everything? Certainly not. We cannot be grateful for violence,
for war, for oppression, for exploitation. On the personal level, we cannot be grateful for the loss
of a friend, for unfaithfulness, for bereavement. But I didn’t say we can be grateful
for everything. I said we can be grateful in every
given moment for the opportunity, and even when we are confronted
with something that is terribly difficult, we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity
that is given to us. So how can each one of us find
a method for living gratefully, not just once in a while being grateful,
but moment by moment to be grateful? How can we do it? It’s a very simple method:
Stop. Look. Go. That’s all. But how often do we stop? We rush through life; we don’t stop. We miss the opportunity
because we don’t stop. We have to stop. We have to get quiet. And we have to build stop signs
into our lives. And when you stop, then the next thing
is to look. You look. You open your eyes.
You open your ears. You open your nose. You open all your senses for this
wonderful richness that is given to us. There is no end to it,
and that is what life is all about, to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us. And then we can also open our hearts,
our hearts for the opportunities, for the opportunities also to help others,
to make others happy, because nothing makes us more happy
than when all of us are happy. And when we open our hearts
to the opportunities, the opportunities invite us
to do something, and that is the third. Stop, look, and then go,
and really do something. And what we can do is whatever life offers
to you in that present moment. There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware
how important this is and how this can change our world, because if you’re grateful,
you’re not fearful. If you're not fearful, you're not violent. If you’re grateful, you act
out of a sense of enough and not of a sense of scarcity,
and you’re willing to share. If you're grateful, you are enjoying
the differences between people and you are respectful to everybody. And that changes this power pyramid
under which we live. What we need is a networking
of smaller groups, smaller and smaller groups
who know one another, who interact with one another, and that is a grateful world.

David Steindl-Rast’s popular TED Talk, Brother David explains how a simple
adjustment in how you move through the world might just change
what you see, how you feel, and how you act. Now my topic is gratefulness. What is the connection
between happiness and gratefulness? Many people would say, well,
that’s very easy. When you are happy, you’re grateful. But think again. Is it really the happy people
that are grateful? We all know quite a number of people
who have everything that it would take to be happy, and they are not happy,
because they want something else, or they want more of the same. And we all know people
who have lots of misfortune, misfortune that we ourselves
would not want to have, and they are deeply happy. They radiate happiness. You are surprised. Why? Because they are grateful. Now, we can ask, what really do we mean 
by gratefulness? And how does it work? Something’s given to us
that’s valuable to us. And it’s really given. These two things have to come together. It has to be something valuable,
and it's a real gift. And when these two things come together, then gratefulness spontaneously
rises in my heart, happiness spontaneously rises in my heart. That’s how gratefulness happens. Now, the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this
once in a while. We can be people who live gratefully. And how can we live gratefully? By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment
is a given moment, as we say. It’s a gift. You have no way of assuring that there
will be another moment given to you, and yet, that’s the most valuable thing
that can ever be given to us, this moment,
with all the opportunity that it contains. Does that mean that we can be grateful
for everything? Certainly not. We cannot be grateful for violence,
for war, for oppression, for exploitation. On the personal level, we cannot be grateful for the loss
of a friend, for unfaithfulness, for bereavement. But I didn’t say we can be grateful
for everything. I said we can be grateful in every
given moment for the opportunity, and even when we are confronted
with something that is terribly difficult, we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity
that is given to us. So how can each one of us find
a method for living gratefully, not just once in a while being grateful,
but moment by moment to be grateful? How can we do it? It’s a very simple method:
Stop. Look. Go. That’s all. But how often do we stop? We rush through life; we don’t stop. We miss the opportunity
because we don’t stop. We have to stop. We have to get quiet. And we have to build stop signs
into our lives. And when you stop, then the next thing
is to look. You look. You open your eyes.
You open your ears. You open your nose. You open all your senses for this
wonderful richness that is given to us. There is no end to it,
and that is what life is all about, to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us. And then we can also open our hearts,
our hearts for the opportunities, for the opportunities also to help others,
to make others happy, because nothing makes us more happy
than when all of us are happy. And when we open our hearts
to the opportunities, the opportunities invite us
to do something, and that is the third. Stop, look, and then go,
and really do something. And what we can do is whatever life offers
to you in that present moment. There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware
how important this is and how this can change our world, because if you’re grateful,
you’re not fearful. If you're not fearful, you're not violent. If you’re grateful, you act
out of a sense of enough and not of a sense of scarcity,
and you’re willing to share. If you're grateful, you are enjoying
the differences between people and you are respectful to everybody. And that changes this power pyramid
under which we live. What we need is a networking
of smaller groups, smaller and smaller groups
who know one another, who interact with one another, and that is a grateful world.

**Transcript**:
You might think of gas masks as
clunky, spooky, military-looking devices only found in spy movies
or World War I museums. But you probably already own a mask
that uses remarkably similar technology. And in the near future, we may
need to rely on these filters as part of our everyday lives. In addition to emerging diseases, wildfire frequency has more than tripled
from 1996 to 2021. As fires burn longer and cover more land,
their smoke affects more people each year. Climate change is also causing
more hot, sunny days, which accelerates the production
of toxic ground level ozone. So, how do these masks work, and can they protect us from new
and old airborne threats? Well, the first rule of filters is
making sure you have a tight seal. Without that, even the best mask
in the world is useless. So assuming your mask is on tight, this technology can capture pollutants
in one of two ways: filtering them out by size or
attracting specific chemical compounds. For an example of the first approach,
let’s look at wildfire smoke. When forests burn, they generate
a wide variety of chemicals. At close range, there are so many
different pollutants at such high concentrations
that no filter could help you— this is why firefighters travel
with their own air supply. But further away,
the situation is different. While there's still a range of chemicals, they’ve mostly aggregated into tiny solid
or liquid particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter. This particulate matter is much of what
you're seeing and smelling in smoke, and it's especially dangerous
for children, the elderly, and those with respiratory
or cardiovascular diseases. Luckily, the majority of these
particulates are still large enough to be captured by the most basic filters, which are made of polypropylene 
or glass strands roughly 1/10 the width of a human hair. Under a microscope,
they look like a thick forest, and at this scale, these branches
have a special property. Typically, when you use a sieve, you’re filtering out objects
larger than the sieve’s holes. But these polypropylene branches
can catch particles much smaller than the gaps between them. That’s because, when a particle
collides with a thread, van der Waals forces cause it to stick
as if it were made of Velcro. Plus, size-based filters can use
electrically charged fibers that attract particles not already
on a collision course. This is how even a simple N95 mask can
catch at least 95% of particulate matter. And why an N100 mask or an air purifier with a high efficiency
particulate air filter can catch at least 99.97% of particulates. With a tight seal, this level of protection will
filter out most airborne pollution. Unfortunately, some pollutants are still
too small for this approach, including ozone molecules. These are barely bigger than the oxygen
that we need to breathe and exposure is associated with asthma,
respiratory conditions, and even premature death. Our best chance to filter them
are activated carbon masks. At the microscopic level, activated carbon
looks like a vast black honeycomb, and it's highly microporous structure
can trap tiny ozone molecules. But this material still needs help
to capture other pollutants like hydrogen sulfide, chlorine,
and ammonia. For these threats, we need to combine
the activated carbon with some simple chemistry. If the pollutant is acidic, we can infuse
the filter with a basic chemical. Then when the two meet, they react,
and the gas is trapped. Similarly, we can use acids
to trap basic pollutants. Even with the right mask, it's still smart
to check air quality indicators and to stay indoors
when the threat level is high. And just like a mask, you'll want to make
sure your house is well sealed. You can do this by closing windows,
turning off fans that vent outside, and using HEPA filter equipped
air purifiers or their cheaper, DIY cousin,
the Corsi-Rosenthal box. Following these guidelines can help
us breathe easy as we work on preventing these pollutants
in the first place.

However, the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ is related to the frequency of wildfires (it has more than tripled), not the main reason for the increase. A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the change in wildfire frequency.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose the closest one, I would say it's Question 2, although it's not a perfect match.

If I were to create a new generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be:

Question: How has the frequency of wildfires changed from 1996 to 2021 according to the transcript? Options: A. It has decreased, B. It has remained the same, C. It has doubled, D. It has more than tripled.

Since this is not among the generated MCQs, I will choose the closest one:

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
You might think of gas masks as
clunky, spooky, military-looking devices only found in spy movies
or World War I museums. But you probably already own a mask
that uses remarkably similar technology. And in the near future, we may
need to rely on these filters as part of our everyday lives. In addition to emerging diseases, wildfire frequency has more than tripled
from 1996 to 2021. As fires burn longer and cover more land,
their smoke affects more people each year. Climate change is also causing
more hot, sunny days, which accelerates the production
of toxic ground level ozone. So, how do these masks work, and can they protect us from new
and old airborne threats? Well, the first rule of filters is
making sure you have a tight seal. Without that, even the best mask
in the world is useless. So assuming your mask is on tight, this technology can capture pollutants
in one of two ways: filtering them out by size or
attracting specific chemical compounds. For an example of the first approach,
let’s look at wildfire smoke. When forests burn, they generate
a wide variety of chemicals. At close range, there are so many
different pollutants at such high concentrations
that no filter could help you— this is why firefighters travel
with their own air supply. But further away,
the situation is different. While there's still a range of chemicals, they’ve mostly aggregated into tiny solid
or liquid particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter. This particulate matter is much of what
you're seeing and smelling in smoke, and it's especially dangerous
for children, the elderly, and those with respiratory
or cardiovascular diseases. Luckily, the majority of these
particulates are still large enough to be captured by the most basic filters, which are made of polypropylene 
or glass strands roughly 1/10 the width of a human hair. Under a microscope,
they look like a thick forest, and at this scale, these branches
have a special property. Typically, when you use a sieve, you’re filtering out objects
larger than the sieve’s holes. But these polypropylene branches
can catch particles much smaller than the gaps between them. That’s because, when a particle
collides with a thread, van der Waals forces cause it to stick
as if it were made of Velcro. Plus, size-based filters can use
electrically charged fibers that attract particles not already
on a collision course. This is how even a simple N95 mask can
catch at least 95% of particulate matter. And why an N100 mask or an air purifier with a high efficiency
particulate air filter can catch at least 99.97% of particulates. With a tight seal, this level of protection will
filter out most airborne pollution. Unfortunately, some pollutants are still
too small for this approach, including ozone molecules. These are barely bigger than the oxygen
that we need to breathe and exposure is associated with asthma,
respiratory conditions, and even premature death. Our best chance to filter them
are activated carbon masks. At the microscopic level, activated carbon
looks like a vast black honeycomb, and it's highly microporous structure
can trap tiny ozone molecules. But this material still needs help
to capture other pollutants like hydrogen sulfide, chlorine,
and ammonia. For these threats, we need to combine
the activated carbon with some simple chemistry. If the pollutant is acidic, we can infuse
the filter with a basic chemical. Then when the two meet, they react,
and the gas is trapped. Similarly, we can use acids
to trap basic pollutants. Even with the right mask, it's still smart
to check air quality indicators and to stay indoors
when the threat level is high. And just like a mask, you'll want to make
sure your house is well sealed. You can do this by closing windows,
turning off fans that vent outside, and using HEPA filter equipped
air purifiers or their cheaper, DIY cousin,
the Corsi-Rosenthal box. Following these guidelines can help
us breathe easy as we work on preventing these pollutants
in the first place.

However, this question does not directly address how an N95 mask functions to filter particulate matter. 

A more relevant question would be Question 3: What is the main difference between a N95 mask and an N100 mask? Options: A. The N95 mask is more expensive, B. The N95 mask can only filter out 95% of particulate matter, C. The N100 mask can filter out at least 99.97% of particulate matter, D. The N100 mask is only used for medical purposes Correct Option: C

But even this question does not directly address how an N95 mask functions.

Since none of the questions directly address the functioning of an N95 mask, the closest match would be Question 1: What is the primary function of a gas mask in relation to airborne pollutants? Options: A. To release toxic gases into the air, B. To capture pollutants by filtering them out by size or attracting specific chemical compounds, C. To produce ozone molecules, D. To make air quality worse Correct Option: B

This question addresses the primary function of a gas mask which is similar to an N95 mask, and it mentions "filtering them out by size" which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ mentions "electrically charged fibers attracting particles" which is not explicitly mentioned in Question 1.

Therefore, the most similar generated MCQ would be Question 1, but with some limitations.

**Transcript**:
During an important calendrical
celebration in 889 CE, Lord K’ak’ Upakal may have sat
atop his ornate palace and observed the bustling hub
he’d helped Chichen Itza become. The Maya city’s golden age would outlast
K’ak’ Upakal’s own life, but he couldn’t have known
the crises that lay ahead. A century before, warfare and failing
agriculture forced Maya people to abandon numerous
Central American settlements. This shifted the center
of their civilization north, to hotter, drier Yucatan. During the early 800s, cities like Chichen Itza, Izamal,
and Uxmal expanded. But Yucatan presented its own challenges. Surface water was scarce and the region’s limestone bedrock
rapidly absorbed rain. This forced many Yucatecan cities
to collect rainwater in cisterns. But the land surrounding Chichen Itza
is pocked with sinkholes, where collapsed bedrock reveals an
abundant supply of fresh groundwater. Because of this freshwater access, when
drought seized Yucatan in the early 900s, Chichen Itza survived to become
the most powerful Maya city. People immigrated from hundreds
of kilometers away, and, at its height, Chichen Itza’s
population possibly reached 50,000. The city came to reflect a diverse
international culture in all spheres of life. Its challenge then became sustaining
a large population in an unpredictable environment. During the 10th century,
following K’ak’ Upakal’s death, Chichen Itza’s government shifted
from a focus solely on the king to a more flexible system that also included ruling councils
of the city’s elite. Unlike traditional Maya kings, who reinforced their legitimacy with
destructive wars and costly monuments, the new rulers focused largely
on economic growth. They channeled the city’s military might
into establishing long-distance trade and political dominance. Merchant-warriors traveled from
coastal ports and captured valuable goods. Using obsidian, gold, copper,
turquoise, and jade from various parts
of Central and North America, Chichen Itza’s inhabitants crafted
sharp tools and precious ornaments. They traded food, textiles, feathers,
minerals, and metals, sometimes using cacao beans as currency. And they transported seafood
from the coast to supplement the city’s locally grown
staple crops. Farming was essential
to Chichen Itza’s survival. The city’s architecture and religious
practices reflected this importance by keeping track of time,
the transit of celestial bodies, and agricultural cycles. As the city grew, its citizens built
a vast platform to support new temples, pyramids, altars,
ballcourts, and colonnades. Builders carefully aligned a round temple
to mark solstices, equinoxes, and the passing of the planet Venus, an avatar of K’uk’ulkan,
the feathered serpent god. K’uk’ulkan became Chichen Itza’s
central deity, and his worship transformed the city
into a center of religious pilgrimage. Architects designed a stepped pyramid
and temple dedicated to K’uk’ulkan that towers 30 meters high, and features four stairs
with a total of 365 steps, each representing a day in the solar year. It’s oriented so that,
around each equinox, the setting sun creates snake-like shadows
that slither down the balustrades, evoking the serpent god. Several buildings feature representations
of Flower Mountain, the sacred paradise realm inhabited
by gods and ancestors. And rulers from far and wide were inaugurated
at Chichen Itza’s Great Ballcourt under the auspices of K’uk’ulkan and in the presence
of thousands of spectators. However, Chichen Itza’s
golden age wouldn’t last forever. Around 1020 CE, an intense drought hit
and lasted nearly a century. In an effort to end the disaster, people made offerings to rain deities
in nearby caves and sinkholes, which were seen as entrances to the
watery underworld realm of the gods. Despite Chichen Itza’s natural advantages
and the ingenuity of its people, the city couldn't support itself
through this extended drought. Population plummeted
during the 11th century, and many people resettled on the coast. At the end of the drought, the new city of Mayapan emerged and replaced Chichen Itza
as the principal city of Yucatan. Yet, Chichen Itza was never fully
abandoned or forgotten. When the Spanish arrived centuries later, it was still a small, local capital
of a Maya province. Chichen Itza’s original name
was preserved, and its ancient stone constructions
were still standing, as they do to this day.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since the ground truth MCQ asks about the location of the ancient Maya civilization, and none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the location, I will choose the generated MCQ that provides information about the geographical context of the Maya civilization.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 2, but it's not a direct match.

A more suitable answer can be provided if the generated MCQs include a question that directly asks about the location of the Maya civilization.

That being said, if I had to choose from the provided options, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the fame of Chichen Itza, and the correct option is "All of the above" (tall pyramids, carved sculpture with writing, astronomy, and observing the Sun). Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is related to the worship of the feathered serpent god K’uk’ulkan, which is associated with astronomy and the Sun. However, it does not cover the other aspects mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

A more relevant generated MCQ is Question 8, which asks about the significance of the Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza. Although it does not directly relate to the fame of Chichen Itza, it mentions the inauguration ceremonies for rulers, which might be indirectly related to the city's importance.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3, as it is related to astronomy and the worship of K’uk’ulkan, which is a key aspect of Chichen Itza's fame.

**Transcript**:
During an important calendrical
celebration in 889 CE, Lord K’ak’ Upakal may have sat
atop his ornate palace and observed the bustling hub
he’d helped Chichen Itza become. The Maya city’s golden age would outlast
K’ak’ Upakal’s own life, but he couldn’t have known
the crises that lay ahead. A century before, warfare and failing
agriculture forced Maya people to abandon numerous
Central American settlements. This shifted the center
of their civilization north, to hotter, drier Yucatan. During the early 800s, cities like Chichen Itza, Izamal,
and Uxmal expanded. But Yucatan presented its own challenges. Surface water was scarce and the region’s limestone bedrock
rapidly absorbed rain. This forced many Yucatecan cities
to collect rainwater in cisterns. But the land surrounding Chichen Itza
is pocked with sinkholes, where collapsed bedrock reveals an
abundant supply of fresh groundwater. Because of this freshwater access, when
drought seized Yucatan in the early 900s, Chichen Itza survived to become
the most powerful Maya city. People immigrated from hundreds
of kilometers away, and, at its height, Chichen Itza’s
population possibly reached 50,000. The city came to reflect a diverse
international culture in all spheres of life. Its challenge then became sustaining
a large population in an unpredictable environment. During the 10th century,
following K’ak’ Upakal’s death, Chichen Itza’s government shifted
from a focus solely on the king to a more flexible system that also included ruling councils
of the city’s elite. Unlike traditional Maya kings, who reinforced their legitimacy with
destructive wars and costly monuments, the new rulers focused largely
on economic growth. They channeled the city’s military might
into establishing long-distance trade and political dominance. Merchant-warriors traveled from
coastal ports and captured valuable goods. Using obsidian, gold, copper,
turquoise, and jade from various parts
of Central and North America, Chichen Itza’s inhabitants crafted
sharp tools and precious ornaments. They traded food, textiles, feathers,
minerals, and metals, sometimes using cacao beans as currency. And they transported seafood
from the coast to supplement the city’s locally grown
staple crops. Farming was essential
to Chichen Itza’s survival. The city’s architecture and religious
practices reflected this importance by keeping track of time,
the transit of celestial bodies, and agricultural cycles. As the city grew, its citizens built
a vast platform to support new temples, pyramids, altars,
ballcourts, and colonnades. Builders carefully aligned a round temple
to mark solstices, equinoxes, and the passing of the planet Venus, an avatar of K’uk’ulkan,
the feathered serpent god. K’uk’ulkan became Chichen Itza’s
central deity, and his worship transformed the city
into a center of religious pilgrimage. Architects designed a stepped pyramid
and temple dedicated to K’uk’ulkan that towers 30 meters high, and features four stairs
with a total of 365 steps, each representing a day in the solar year. It’s oriented so that,
around each equinox, the setting sun creates snake-like shadows
that slither down the balustrades, evoking the serpent god. Several buildings feature representations
of Flower Mountain, the sacred paradise realm inhabited
by gods and ancestors. And rulers from far and wide were inaugurated
at Chichen Itza’s Great Ballcourt under the auspices of K’uk’ulkan and in the presence
of thousands of spectators. However, Chichen Itza’s
golden age wouldn’t last forever. Around 1020 CE, an intense drought hit
and lasted nearly a century. In an effort to end the disaster, people made offerings to rain deities
in nearby caves and sinkholes, which were seen as entrances to the
watery underworld realm of the gods. Despite Chichen Itza’s natural advantages
and the ingenuity of its people, the city couldn't support itself
through this extended drought. Population plummeted
during the 11th century, and many people resettled on the coast. At the end of the drought, the new city of Mayapan emerged and replaced Chichen Itza
as the principal city of Yucatan. Yet, Chichen Itza was never fully
abandoned or forgotten. When the Spanish arrived centuries later, it was still a small, local capital
of a Maya province. Chichen Itza’s original name
was preserved, and its ancient stone constructions
were still standing, as they do to this day.

**Transcript**:
Consider this mathematician, with her standard-issue infinitely sharp
knife and a perfect ball. She frantically slices and distributes
the ball into an infinite number of boxes. She then recombines the parts
into five precise sections. Gently moving and rotating
these sections around, seemingly impossibly, she recombines them
to form two identical, flawless, and complete copies
of the original ball. This is a result known in mathematics
as the Banach-Tarski paradox. The paradox here is not
in the logic or the proof— which are, like the balls, flawless— but instead in the tension
between mathematics and our own experience of reality. And in this tension lives some beautiful
and fundamental truths about what mathematics actually is. We’ll come back to that in a moment,
but first, we need to examine the foundation
of every mathematical system: axioms. Every mathematical system
is built and advanced by using logic to reach new conclusions. But logic can’t be applied to nothing; we have to start with some basic
statements, called axioms, that we declare to be true,
and make deductions from there. Often these match our intuition
for how the world works— for instance, that adding zero to a number
has no effect is an axiom. If the goal of mathematics is to build
a house, axioms form its foundation— the first thing that’s laid down,
that supports everything else. Where things get interesting is that
by laying a slightly different foundation, you can get a vastly different
but equally sound structure. For example, when Euclid laid
his foundations for geometry, one of his axioms implied that given
a line and a point off the line, only one parallel line exists
going through that point. But later mathematicians, wanting to see if geometry was
still possible without this axiom, produced spherical
and hyperbolic geometry. Each valid, logically sound,
and useful in different contexts. One axiom common in modern mathematics
is the Axiom of Choice. It typically comes into play in proofs
that require choosing elements from sets— which we’ll grossly simplify
to marbles in boxes. For our choices to be valid,
they need to be consistent, meaning if we approach a box,
choose a marble, and then go back in time and choose again,
we'd know how to find the same marble. If we have a finite number of boxes,
that’s easy. It’s even straightforward
when there are infinite boxes if each contains a marble that’s readily
distinguishable from the others. It’s when there are infinite boxes
with indistinguishable marbles that we have trouble. But in these scenarios, the Axiom of Choice lets us summon
a mysterious omniscient chooser that will always select the same marbles— without us having to know anything
about how those choices are made. Our stab-happy mathematician,
following Banach and Tarski’s proof, reaches a step in constructing
the five sections where she has infinitely many boxes
filled with indistinguishable parts. So she needs the Axiom of Choice
to make their construction possible. If the Axiom of Choice can lead
to such a counterintuitive result, should we just reject it? Mathematicians today say no, because it’s load-bearing for a lot
of important results in mathematics. Fields like measure theory
and functional analysis, which are crucial
for statistics and physics, are built upon the Axiom of Choice. While it leads to some
impractical results, it also leads to extremely practical ones. Fortunately, just as Euclidean geometry
exists alongside hyperbolic geometry, mathematics with the Axiom of Choice
coexists with mathematics without it. The question for many mathematicians
isn’t whether the Axiom of Choice, or for that matter any given axiom,
is right or not, but whether it’s right
for what you’re trying to do. The fate of the Banach-Tarski paradox
lies in this choice. This is the freedom mathematics gives us. Not only is it a way to model
our physical universe using the axioms we intuit
from our daily experiences, but a way to venture into abstract
mathematical universes and explore arcane geometries and laws
unlike anything we can ever experience. If we ever meet aliens, axioms which seem
absurd and incomprehensible to us might be everyday common sense to them. To investigate, we might start by handing
them an infinitely sharp knife and a perfect ball, and see what they do.

has no effect is an axiom. If the goal of mathematics is to build
a house, axioms form its foundation— the first thing that’s laid down,
that supports everything else. Where things get interesting is that
by laying a slightly different foundation, you can get a vastly different
but equally sound structure. For example, when Euclid laid
his foundations for geometry, one of his axioms implied that given
a line and a point off the line, only one parallel line exists
going through that point. But later mathematicians, wanting to see if geometry was
still possible without this axiom, produced spherical
and hyperbolic geometry. Each valid, logically sound,
and useful in different contexts. One axiom common in modern mathematics
is the Axiom of Choice. It typically comes into play in proofs
that require choosing elements from sets— which we’ll grossly simplify
to marbles in boxes. For our choices to be valid,
they need to be consistent, meaning if we approach a box,
choose a marble, and then go back in time and choose again,
we'd know how to find the same marble. If we have a finite number of boxes,
that’s easy. It’s even straightforward
when there are infinite boxes if each contains a marble that’s readily
distinguishable from the others. It’s when there are infinite boxes
with indistinguishable marbles that we have trouble. But in these scenarios, the Axiom of Choice lets us summon
a mysterious omniscient chooser that will always select the same marbles— without us having to know anything
about how those choices are made. Our stab-happy mathematician,
following Banach and Tarski’s proof, reaches a step in constructing
the five sections where she has infinitely many boxes
filled with indistinguishable parts. So she needs the Axiom of Choice
to make their construction possible. If the Axiom of Choice can lead
to such a counterintuitive result, should we just reject it? Mathematicians today say no, because it’s load-bearing for a lot
of important results in mathematics. Fields like measure theory
and functional analysis, which are crucial
for statistics and physics, are built upon the Axiom of Choice. While it leads to some
impractical results, it also leads to extremely practical ones. Fortunately, just as Euclidean geometry
exists alongside hyperbolic geometry, mathematics with the Axiom of Choice
coexists with mathematics without it. The question for many mathematicians
isn’t whether the Axiom of Choice, or for that matter any given axiom,
is right or not, but whether it’s right
for what you’re trying to do. The fate of the Banach-Tarski paradox
lies in this choice. This is the freedom mathematics gives us. Not only is it a way to model
our physical universe using the axioms we intuit
from our daily experiences, but a way to venture into abstract
mathematical universes and explore arcane geometries and laws
unlike anything we can ever experience. If we ever meet aliens, axioms which seem
absurd and incomprehensible to us might be everyday common sense to them. To investigate, we might start by handing
them an infinitely sharp knife and a perfect ball, and see what they do.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although Question 3 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, its content and options are the most similar. Question 3 asks about the purpose of the Axiom of Choice in mathematics, and option B states that it is used "to select elements from sets in a consistent manner." This is similar to the ground truth MCQ, which asks when the Axiom of Choice is necessary and has a correct option stating that it is necessary "to assume the existence of a choice function on an arbitrary collection of sets." Both questions deal with the application of the Axiom of Choice in mathematics, specifically in relation to selecting elements from sets.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs either ask different questions or have different options, but Question 3 is the closest match in terms of content and intent.

**Transcript**:
Consider this mathematician, with her standard-issue infinitely sharp
knife and a perfect ball. She frantically slices and distributes
the ball into an infinite number of boxes. She then recombines the parts
into five precise sections. Gently moving and rotating
these sections around, seemingly impossibly, she recombines them
to form two identical, flawless, and complete copies
of the original ball. This is a result known in mathematics
as the Banach-Tarski paradox. The paradox here is not
in the logic or the proof— which are, like the balls, flawless— but instead in the tension
between mathematics and our own experience of reality. And in this tension lives some beautiful
and fundamental truths about what mathematics actually is. We’ll come back to that in a moment,
but first, we need to examine the foundation
of every mathematical system: axioms. Every mathematical system
is built and advanced by using logic to reach new conclusions. But logic can’t be applied to nothing; we have to start with some basic
statements, called axioms, that we declare to be true,
and make deductions from there. Often these match our intuition

**Transcript**:
Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean, no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it. It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden, but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost. I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us, and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost -- actually, we've taken, we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying, but it really should concern you. It does concern you, as well. I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child," asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time. Well, now is that time. I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and, in so doing, secure hope for humankind. Health to the ocean means health for us. And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. And I hope, Jill, that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet. (Laughter) Did I say that? I guess I did. For me, as a scientist, it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba. It's when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter. I actually love diving at night; you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime. Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970, when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time -- at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon. In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim. It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down. It's one of my favorite bathing suits. Since then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea. I led a five-year National Geographic expedition, the Sustainable Seas expeditions, using these little subs. They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it. And I'm living proof. Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature -- all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea. I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system." We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. The poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love; none without water." Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean. No blue, no green. If you think the ocean isn't important, imagine Earth without it. Mars comes to mind. No ocean, no life support system. I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said, "There it is! The World Bank!" That's where all the assets are! And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment. With every drop of water you drink, every breath you take, you're connected to the sea. No matter where on Earth you live. Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea. Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there, mostly by microbes. The ocean drives climate and weather, stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry. Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain, sleet and snow, and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world, maybe in the universe. No water, no life; no blue, no green. Yet we have this idea, we humans, that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies -- are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it. That may have been true 10,000 years ago, and maybe even 1,000 years ago but in the last 100, especially in the last 50, we've drawn down the assets, the air, the water, the wildlife that make our lives possible. New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature; the nature of what's happening, showing us our impact on the Earth. I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem. And fortunately, in our time, we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history. And with knowing comes caring. And with caring, there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us. But first we have to know. Three years ago, I met John Hanke, who's the head of Google Earth, and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously. But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it? You did a great job with the land, the dirt. What about the water?" Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers, with DOER Marine, with National Geographic, with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world, ones that we could enlist, to put the ocean in Google Earth. And as of just this week, last Monday, Google Earth is now whole. Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center, we can find the nearby aquarium, we can look at where we're sitting, and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean, and California's four national marine sanctuaries, and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands: not just the little bit that pokes through the surface, but also what's below. To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! -- right there, ha -- under the ocean, see what the whales see. We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands. We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales. These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater. There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale. We can pick up and fly to the deepest place: seven miles down, the Mariana Trench, where only two people have ever been. Imagine that. It's only seven miles, but only two people have been there, 49 years ago. One-way trips are easy. We need new deep-diving submarines. How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration? We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains, and understand life in the deep sea. We can now go to the Arctic. Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole. An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century. That's bad news for the polar bears. That's bad news for us too. Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming, it's also changing ocean chemistry, making the sea more acidic. That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton. Also it's bad news for us. We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea. Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets, gear that continues to kill. We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system, and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife, all carbon-based units. Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup, undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the oxygen cycle, the water cycle -- our life support system. We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead. All of these parts are part of our life support system. We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more. Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers, taking everything in their path. Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system, leaving plumes of death in their path. The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi, or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail, whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost. For every pound that goes to market, more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds, may be thrown away as bycatch. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000. The highest concentrations are in red. In my lifetime, imagine, 90 percent of the big fish have been killed. Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales are way down in numbers. But, there is good news. Ten percent of the big fish still remain. There are still some blue whales. There are still some krill in Antarctica. There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay. Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape, a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet. There's still time, but not a lot, to turn things around. But business as usual means that in 50 years, there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone. Imagine the ocean without fish. Imagine what that means to our life support system. Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too, but the problems are more obvious, and some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife. And in 1872, with Yellowstone National Park, the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had. About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected: safeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink, generating oxygen, protecting watersheds. And, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea, National Marine Sanctuaries. That's another great idea. The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world, that have some kind of protection. And you can find them on Google Earth. The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them. In the last three years, for example, the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments. But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally. Protected areas do rebound, but it takes a long time to restore 50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass, or 200-year-old orange roughy. We don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens. Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life, will live not just as a list, a photograph, or a paragraph. With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever -- to search out hope spots, and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future. Such as the Arctic -- we have one chance, right now, to get it right. Or the Antarctic, where the continent is protected, but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish. Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows. 97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected, but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing. It's true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble. The high seas, where whales, tuna and dolphins travel -- the largest, least protected, ecosystem on Earth, filled with luminous creatures, living in dark waters that average two miles deep. They flash, and sparkle, and glow with their own living light. There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child. The next 10 years may be the most important, and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life. To cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power. We need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease. We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place. But, nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean. Our fate and the ocean's are one. We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above. A global plan of action with a world conservation union, the IUCN, is underway to protect biodiversity, to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change, on the high seas and in coastal areas, wherever we can identify critical places. New technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see. The goal is to protect biodiversity, to provide stability and resilience. We need deep-diving subs, new technologies to explore the ocean. We need, maybe, an expedition -- a TED at sea -- that could help figure out the next steps. And so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is. I wish you would use all means at your disposal -- films, expeditions, the web, new submarines -- and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas -- hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean, the blue heart of the planet. How much? Some say 10 percent, some say 30 percent. You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect? Whatever it is, a fraction of one percent is not enough. My wish is a big wish, but if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world, and help ensure the survival of what actually -- as it turns out -- is my favorite species; that would be us. For the children of today, for tomorrow's child: as never again, now is the time. Thank you. (Applause)

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean, no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it. It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden, but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost. I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us, and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost -- actually, we've taken, we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying, but it really should concern you. It does concern you, as well. I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child," asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time. Well, now is that time. I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and, in so doing, secure hope for humankind. Health to the ocean means health for us. And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. And I hope, Jill, that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet. (Laughter) Did I say that? I guess I did. For me, as a scientist, it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba. It's when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter. I actually love diving at night; you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime. Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970, when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time -- at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon. In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim. It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down. It's one of my favorite bathing suits. Since then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea. I led a five-year National Geographic expedition, the Sustainable Seas expeditions, using these little subs. They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it. And I'm living proof. Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature -- all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea. I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system." We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. The poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love; none without water." Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean. No blue, no green. If you think the ocean isn't important, imagine Earth without it. Mars comes to mind. No ocean, no life support system. I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said, "There it is! The World Bank!" That's where all the assets are! And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment. With every drop of water you drink, every breath you take, you're connected to the sea. No matter where on Earth you live. Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea. Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there, mostly by microbes. The ocean drives climate and weather, stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry. Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain, sleet and snow, and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world, maybe in the universe. No water, no life; no blue, no green. Yet we have this idea, we humans, that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies -- are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it. That may have been true 10,000 years ago, and maybe even 1,000 years ago but in the last 100, especially in the last 50, we've drawn down the assets, the air, the water, the wildlife that make our lives possible. New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature; the nature of what's happening, showing us our impact on the Earth. I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem. And fortunately, in our time, we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history. And with knowing comes caring. And with caring, there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us. But first we have to know. Three years ago, I met John Hanke, who's the head of Google Earth, and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously. But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it? You did a great job with the land, the dirt. What about the water?" Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers, with DOER Marine, with National Geographic, with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world, ones that we could enlist, to put the ocean in Google Earth. And as of just this week, last Monday, Google Earth is now whole. Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center, we can find the nearby aquarium, we can look at where we're sitting, and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean, and California's four national marine sanctuaries, and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands: not just the little bit that pokes through the surface, but also what's below. To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! -- right there, ha -- under the ocean, see what the whales see. We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands. We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales. These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater. There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale. We can pick up and fly to the deepest place: seven miles down, the Mariana Trench, where only two people have ever been. Imagine that. It's only seven miles, but only two people have been there, 49 years ago. One-way trips are easy. We need new deep-diving submarines. How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration? We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains, and understand life in the deep sea. We can now go to the Arctic. Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole. An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century. That's bad news for the polar bears. That's bad news for us too. Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming, it's also changing ocean chemistry, making the sea more acidic. That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton. Also it's bad news for us. We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea. Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets, gear that continues to kill. We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system, and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife, all carbon-based units. Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup, undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the oxygen cycle, the water cycle -- our life support system. We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead. All of these parts are part of our life support system. We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more. Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers, taking everything in their path. Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system, leaving plumes of death in their path. The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi, or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail, whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost. For every pound that goes to market, more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds, may be thrown away as bycatch. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000. The highest concentrations are in red. In my lifetime, imagine, 90 percent of the big fish have been killed. Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales are way down in numbers. But, there is good news. Ten percent of the big fish still remain. There are still some blue whales. There are still some krill in Antarctica. There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay. Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape, a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet. There's still time, but not a lot, to turn things around. But business as usual means that in 50 years, there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone. Imagine the ocean without fish. Imagine what that means to our life support system. Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too, but the problems are more obvious, and some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife.

Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life, will live not just as a list, a photograph, or a paragraph. With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever -- to search out hope spots, and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future. Such as the Arctic -- we have one chance, right now, to get it right. Or the Antarctic, where the continent is protected, but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish. Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows. 97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected, but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing. It's true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble.

I led a five-year National Geographic expedition, the Sustainable Seas expeditions, using these little subs. They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it. And I'm living proof. Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature -- all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea. I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system." We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. The poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love; none without water." Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean. No blue, no green. If you think the ocean isn't important, imagine Earth without it. Mars comes to mind. No ocean, no life support system. I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said, "There it is! The World Bank!" That's where all the assets are! And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment. With every drop of water you drink, every breath you take, you're connected to the sea. No matter where on Earth you live. Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea. Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there, mostly by microbes. The ocean drives climate and weather, stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry. Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain, sleet and snow, and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world, maybe in the universe. No water, no life; no blue, no green. Yet we have this idea, we humans, that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies -- are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it. That may have been true 10,000 years ago, and maybe even 1,000 years ago but in the last 100, especially in the last 50, we've drawn down the assets, the air, the water, the wildlife that make our lives possible. New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature; the nature of what's happening, showing us our impact on the Earth. I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem. And fortunately, in our time, we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history. And with knowing comes caring. And with caring, there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us. But first we have to know. Three years ago, I met John Hanke, who's the head of Google Earth, and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously. But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it? You did a great job with the land, the dirt. What about the water?" Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers, with DOER Marine, with National Geographic, with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world, ones that we could enlist, to put the ocean in Google Earth. And as of just this week, last Monday, Google Earth is now whole. Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center, we can find the nearby aquarium, we can look at where we're sitting, and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean, and California's four national marine sanctuaries, and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands: not just the little bit that pokes through the surface, but also what's below. To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! -- right there, ha -- under the ocean, see what the whales see. We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands. We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales. These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater. There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale. We can pick up and fly to the deepest place: seven miles down, the Mariana Trench, where only two people have ever been. Imagine that. It's only seven miles, but only two people have been there, 49 years ago. One-way trips are easy. We need new deep-diving submarines. How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration? We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains, and understand life in the deep sea. We can now go to the Arctic. Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole. An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century. That's bad news for the polar bears. That's bad news for us too. Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming, it's also changing ocean chemistry, making the sea more acidic. That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton. Also it's bad news for us. We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea. Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets, gear that continues to kill. We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system, and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife, all carbon-based units. Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup, undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the oxygen cycle, the water cycle -- our life support system. We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead. All of these parts are part of our life support system. We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more. Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers, taking everything in their path. Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system, leaving plumes of death in their path. The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi, or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail, whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost. For every pound that goes to market, more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds, may be thrown away as bycatch. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000. The highest concentrations are in red. In my lifetime, imagine, 90 percent of the big fish have been killed. Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales are way down in numbers. But, there is good news. Ten percent of the big fish still remain. There are still some blue whales. There are still some krill in Antarctica. There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay. Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape, a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet. There's still time, but not a lot, to turn things around. But business as usual means that in 50 years, there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone. Imagine the ocean without fish. Imagine what that means to our life support system. Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too, but the problems are more obvious, and some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife. And in 1872, with Yellowstone National Park, the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had. About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected: safeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink, generating oxygen, protecting watersheds. And, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea, National Marine Sanctuaries. That's another great idea. The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world, that have some kind of protection. And you can find them on Google Earth. The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them. In the last three years, for example, the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments. But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally. Protected areas do rebound, but it takes a long time to restore 50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass, or 200-year-old orange roughy. We don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens. Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life, will live not just as a list, a photograph, or a paragraph. With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever -- to search out hope spots, and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future. Such as the Arctic -- we have one chance, right now, to get it right. Or the Antarctic, where the continent is protected, but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish. Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows. 97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected, but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing. It's true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble. The high seas, where whales, tuna and dolphins travel -- the largest, least protected, ecosystem on Earth, filled with luminous creatures, living in dark waters that average two miles deep. They flash, and sparkle, and glow with their own living light. There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child. The next 10 years may be the most important, and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life. To cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power. We need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease. We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place. But, nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean. Our fate and the ocean's are one. We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above. A global plan of action with a world conservation union, the IUCN, is underway to protect biodiversity, to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change, on the high seas and in coastal areas, wherever we can identify critical places. New technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see. The goal is to protect biodiversity, to provide stability and resilience. We need deep-diving subs, new technologies to explore the ocean. We need, maybe, an expedition -- a TED at sea -- that could help figure out the next steps. And so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is. I wish you would use all means at your disposal -- films, expeditions, the web, new submarines -- and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas -- hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean, the blue heart of the planet. How much? Some say 10 percent, some say 30 percent. You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect? Whatever it is, a fraction of one percent is not enough. My wish is a big wish, but if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world, and help ensure the survival of what actually -- as it turns out -- is my favorite species; that would be us. For the children of today, for tomorrow's child: as never again, now is the time. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean, no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it. It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden, but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost. I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us, and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost -- actually, we've taken, we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying, but it really should concern you. It does concern you, as well. I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child," asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time. Well, now is that time. I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and, in so doing, secure hope for humankind. Health to the ocean means health for us. And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. And I hope, Jill, that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet. (Laughter) Did I say that? I guess I did. For me, as a scientist, it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba. It's when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter. I actually love diving at night; you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime. Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970, when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time -- at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon. In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim. It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down. It's one of my favorite bathing suits. Since then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea. I led a five-year National Geographic expedition, the Sustainable Seas expeditions, using these little subs. They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it. And I'm living proof. Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature -- all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea. I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system." We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. The poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love; none without water." Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean. No blue, no green. If you think the ocean isn't important, imagine Earth without it. Mars comes to mind. No ocean, no life support system. I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said, "There it is! The World Bank!" That's where all the assets are! And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment. With every drop of water you drink, every breath you take, you're connected to the sea. No matter where on Earth you live. Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea. Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there, mostly by microbes. The ocean drives climate and weather, stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry. Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain, sleet and snow, and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world, maybe in the universe.

And fortunately, in our time, we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history. And with knowing comes caring. And with caring, there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us. But first we have to know. Three years ago, I met John Hanke, who's the head of Google Earth, and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously. But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it? You did a great job with the land, the dirt. What about the water?" Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers, with DOER Marine, with National Geographic, with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world, ones that we could enlist, to put the ocean in Google Earth. And as of just this week, last Monday, Google Earth is now whole. Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center, we can find the nearby aquarium, we can look at where we're sitting, and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean, and California's four national marine sanctuaries, and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands: not just the little bit that pokes through the surface, but also what's below. To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! -- right there, ha -- under the ocean, see what the whales see. We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands. We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales. These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater. There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale. We can pick up and fly to the deepest place: seven miles down, the Mariana Trench, where only two people have ever been. Imagine that. It's only seven miles, but only two people have been there, 49 years ago. One-way trips are easy. We need new deep-diving submarines. How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration? We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains, and understand life in the deep sea. We can now go to the Arctic. Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole. An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century. That's bad news for the polar bears. That's bad news for us too. Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming, it's also changing ocean chemistry, making the sea more acidic. That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton. Also it's bad news for us. We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea. Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets, gear that continues to kill. We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system, and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife, all carbon-based units. Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup, undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the oxygen cycle, the water cycle -- our life support system. We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead. All of these parts are part of our life support system. We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more. Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers, taking everything in their path. Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system, leaving plumes of death in their path. The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi, or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail, whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost. For every pound that goes to market, more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds, may be thrown away as bycatch. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000.

**Transcript**:
Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean, no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it. It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden, but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost. I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us, and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost -- actually, we've taken, we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying, but it really should concern you. It does concern you, as well. I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child," asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time. Well, now is that time. I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and, in so doing, secure hope for humankind. Health to the ocean means health for us. And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. And I hope, Jill, that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet. (Laughter) Did I say that? I guess I did. For me, as a scientist, it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba. It's when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter. I actually love diving at night; you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime. Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970, when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time -- at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon. In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim. It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down. It's one of my favorite bathing suits. Since then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea. I led a five-year National Geographic expedition, the Sustainable Seas expeditions, using these little subs. They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it. And I'm living proof. Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature -- all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea. I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system." We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. The poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love; none without water." Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean. No blue, no green. If you think the ocean isn't important, imagine Earth without it. Mars comes to mind. No ocean, no life support system. I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said, "There it is! The World Bank!" That's where all the assets are! And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment. With every drop of water you drink, every breath you take, you're connected to the sea. No matter where on Earth you live. Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea. Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there, mostly by microbes. The ocean drives climate and weather, stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry. Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain, sleet and snow, and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world, maybe in the universe. No water, no life; no blue, no green. Yet we have this idea, we humans, that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies -- are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it. That may have been true 10,000 years ago, and maybe even 1,000 years ago but in the last 100, especially in the last 50, we've drawn down the assets, the air, the water, the wildlife that make our lives possible. New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature; the nature of what's happening, showing us our impact on the Earth. I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem. And fortunately, in our time, we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history. And with knowing comes caring. And with caring, there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us. But first we have to know. Three years ago, I met John Hanke, who's the head of Google Earth, and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously. But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it? You did a great job with the land, the dirt. What about the water?" Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers, with DOER Marine, with National Geographic, with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world, ones that we could enlist, to put the ocean in Google Earth. And as of just this week, last Monday, Google Earth is now whole. Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center, we can find the nearby aquarium, we can look at where we're sitting, and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean, and California's four national marine sanctuaries, and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands: not just the little bit that pokes through the surface, but also what's below. To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! -- right there, ha -- under the ocean, see what the whales see. We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands. We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales. These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater. There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale. We can pick up and fly to the deepest place: seven miles down, the Mariana Trench, where only two people have ever been. Imagine that. It's only seven miles, but only two people have been there, 49 years ago. One-way trips are easy. We need new deep-diving submarines. How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration? We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains, and understand life in the deep sea. We can now go to the Arctic. Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole. An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century. That's bad news for the polar bears. That's bad news for us too. Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming, it's also changing ocean chemistry, making the sea more acidic. That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton. Also it's bad news for us. We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea. Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets, gear that continues to kill. We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system, and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife, all carbon-based units. Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup, undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the oxygen cycle, the water cycle -- our life support system. We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead. All of these parts are part of our life support system. We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more. Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers, taking everything in their path. Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system, leaving plumes of death in their path. The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi, or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail, whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost. For every pound that goes to market, more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds, may be thrown away as bycatch. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000. The highest concentrations are in red. In my lifetime, imagine, 90 percent of the big fish have been killed. Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales are way down in numbers. But, there is good news. Ten percent of the big fish still remain. There are still some blue whales. There are still some krill in Antarctica. There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay. Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape, a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet. There's still time, but not a lot, to turn things around. But business as usual means that in 50 years, there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone. Imagine the ocean without fish. Imagine what that means to our life support system. Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too, but the problems are more obvious, and some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife. And in 1872, with Yellowstone National Park, the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had. About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected: safeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink, generating oxygen, protecting watersheds. And, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea, National Marine Sanctuaries. That's another great idea. The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world, that have some kind of protection. And you can find them on Google Earth. The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them. In the last three years, for example, the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments. But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally. Protected areas do rebound, but it takes a long time to restore 50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass, or 200-year-old orange roughy. We don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens. Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life, will live not just as a list, a photograph, or a paragraph. With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever -- to search out hope spots, and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future. Such as the Arctic -- we have one chance, right now, to get it right. Or the Antarctic, where the continent is protected, but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish. Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows. 97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected, but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing. It's true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble. The high seas, where whales, tuna and dolphins travel -- the largest, least protected, ecosystem on Earth, filled with luminous creatures, living in dark waters that average two miles deep. They flash, and sparkle, and glow with their own living light. There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child. The next 10 years may be the most important, and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life. To cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power. We need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease. We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place. But, nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean. Our fate and the ocean's are one. We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above. A global plan of action with a world conservation union, the IUCN, is underway to protect biodiversity, to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change, on the high seas and in coastal areas, wherever we can identify critical places. New technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see. The goal is to protect biodiversity, to provide stability and resilience. We need deep-diving subs, new technologies to explore the ocean. We need, maybe, an expedition -- a TED at sea -- that could help figure out the next steps. And so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is. I wish you would use all means at your disposal -- films, expeditions, the web, new submarines -- and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas -- hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean, the blue heart of the planet. How much? Some say 10 percent, some say 30 percent. You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect? Whatever it is, a fraction of one percent is not enough. My wish is a big wish, but if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world, and help ensure the survival of what actually -- as it turns out -- is my favorite species; that would be us. For the children of today, for tomorrow's child: as never again, now is the time. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
You and a group of strangers have been
gathered to design a just society. And to ensure none of you rig the system
to benefit yourself, you’ve all been placed
under a “veil of ignorance.” Under this veil, you’re blind to certain
information about each other and yourselves. You don’t know your age or sex, your profession or natural talents,
how much wealth you have, or your religious
or philosophical beliefs. So, according to political philosopher
John Rawls, you should be motivated to consider
what’s most fair for all your society's citizens. When Rawls published this
thought experiment— known as “the original position”—
in his 1971 opus “A Theory of Justice,” he was trying to identify principles
to support a realistic utopia. This visionary society would ensure
everyone had the resources and opportunities required
to freely pursue their goals. Rawls was confident these principles could
only be realized in a democracy. But he felt existing social structures
weren’t the right path forward. He believed free market philosophies
and welfare capitalism led to unjust accumulations
of wealth and power. And he saw models inspired by Marxism as extreme reactions
to capitalism’s flaws, with unrealistic assumptions
about economies and human nature. So Rawls proposed a new kind of democracy. One where no person was considered
less valuable than another and all citizens could live
according to their own wills. And while the details of this vision
can seem radical, Rawls believed that,
under the veil of ignorance, free and equal people would
unanimously agree to his fair society. So, let’s play out this
thought experiment. The first step in designing our society
is deciding how to distribute what Rawls called primary goods. These include the basic liberties,
opportunities, and wealth necessary for pursuing most goals. Rawls believed our justice-architects
would agree to an “equal scheme
of basic liberties” for all, including freedom of speech and the freedom to associate
with whoever they choose. After all, without the freedom
to pursue one's goals, resources like wealth
and job opportunities lose their value. Citizens would also have equal political
liberties to vote and run for office. Next, Rawls believes the architects
would establish what he calls “fair equality of opportunity.” This means society must be arranged
so no one is unfairly deprived of the resources necessary to compete
for valued jobs and other positions. However, after agreeing upon equality
of liberty and opportunity, Rawls believes our justice-architects
would see the benefits of allowing for some wealth inequalities. For example, greater profits
can incentivize innovation, productivity, and investment. But Rawls also believes our designers
would want to limit differences in wealth with what he calls
“the difference principle.” This states that wealth inequalities
are only acceptable when they benefit
the least advantaged citizens, making them better off than they’d be
under conditions of strict equality. These tenets form the foundation
of Rawls’ just society, and he believed they could be achieved
through what he called “property owning democracy.” This model would guarantee equal access
to education and healthcare and rely on government regulation
to ensure a just distribution of property and wealth. Rawls knew fully adopting this approach
would require major changes for existing democracies. But he believed his principles
could at least inspire some immediate improvements. For example, Rawls advocated for limits
on campaign spending and political contributions to reduce the influence
of wealth on politics. He also endorsed policies
fighting discrimination and generous social safety nets
like unemployment benefits to ensure a good situation
for the worst-off. Some philosophers have
critiqued Rawls’ work. Ronald Dworkin argues that
the difference principle unfairly tethers society’s progress
to the status of the worst-off, even if they’re in that position
because of their own choices. Meanwhile, Martha Nussbaum believes
Rawls’ thought experiment overlooks real-life particulars. For example, the special needs
of a person with disabilities might not be satisfied by the
standard distribution of primary goods. And more generally, some argue the architects in Rawls’
harmonious thought experiment are simply too different
from the competing interests building real societies. But since its publication, this thought experiment has inspired
some very real consequences. Rawls’ rallying cry for social
and political equality and a more justly regulated form
of capitalism has impacted countless political
philosophers, activists, and policymakers. And this new school of thought about
justice continues to challenge people to look past their biases and consider
what a fair society might truly look like.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 5: According to Rawls, what is the primary good that should be distributed equally among citizens in a just society? Options: A. Wealth, B. Liberty, C. Opportunity, D. All of the above Correct Option: D**

This generated MCQ is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ because it:

1. Deals with the concept of primary goods and their distribution in a just society, which is the central theme of the ground truth MCQ.
2. Includes options that are related to the concept of primary goods, such as liberty, opportunity, and wealth, which are all relevant to the ground truth MCQ.
3. Has a correct option (D. All of the above) that aligns with Rawls' idea that the primary goods include basic liberties, opportunities, and wealth.

However, it's worth noting that the generated MCQ does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not specifically ask about the "equal scheme of basic liberties for all" or provide options that directly address the reasoning behind Rawls' first principle of justice.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar generated MCQ, but with some caveats.

Index: 5

**Transcript**:
You and a group of strangers have been
gathered to design a just society. And to ensure none of you rig the system
to benefit yourself, you’ve all been placed
under a “veil of ignorance.” Under this veil, you’re blind to certain
information about each other and yourselves. You don’t know your age or sex, your profession or natural talents,
how much wealth you have, or your religious
or philosophical beliefs. So, according to political philosopher
John Rawls, you should be motivated to consider
what’s most fair for all your society's citizens. When Rawls published this
thought experiment— known as “the original position”—
in his 1971 opus “A Theory of Justice,” he was trying to identify principles
to support a realistic utopia. This visionary society would ensure
everyone had the resources and opportunities required
to freely pursue their goals. Rawls was confident these principles could
only be realized in a democracy. But he felt existing social structures
weren’t the right path forward. He believed free market philosophies
and welfare capitalism led to unjust accumulations
of wealth and power. And he saw models inspired by Marxism as extreme reactions
to capitalism’s flaws, with unrealistic assumptions
about economies and human nature. So Rawls proposed a new kind of democracy. One where no person was considered
less valuable than another and all citizens could live
according to their own wills. And while the details of this vision
can seem radical, Rawls believed that,
under the veil of ignorance, free and equal people would
unanimously agree to his fair society. So, let’s play out this
thought experiment. The first step in designing our society
is deciding how to distribute what Rawls called primary goods. These include the basic liberties,
opportunities, and wealth necessary for pursuing most goals. Rawls believed our justice-architects
would agree to an “equal scheme
of basic liberties” for all, including freedom of speech and the freedom to associate
with whoever they choose. After all, without the freedom
to pursue one's goals, resources like wealth
and job opportunities lose their value. Citizens would also have equal political
liberties to vote and run for office. Next, Rawls believes the architects
would establish what he calls “fair equality of opportunity.” This means society must be arranged
so no one is unfairly deprived of the resources necessary to compete
for valued jobs and other positions. However, after agreeing upon equality
of liberty and opportunity, Rawls believes our justice-architects
would see the benefits of allowing for some wealth inequalities. For example, greater profits
can incentivize innovation, productivity, and investment. But Rawls also believes our designers
would want to limit differences in wealth with what he calls
“the difference principle.” This states that wealth inequalities
are only acceptable when they benefit
the least advantaged citizens, making them better off than they’d be
under conditions of strict equality. These tenets form the foundation
of Rawls’ just society, and he believed they could be achieved
through what he called “property owning democracy.” This model would guarantee equal access
to education and healthcare and rely on government regulation
to ensure a just distribution of property and wealth. Rawls knew fully adopting this approach
would require major changes for existing democracies. But he believed his principles
could at least inspire some immediate improvements. For example, Rawls advocated for limits
on campaign spending and political contributions to reduce the influence
of wealth on politics. He also endorsed policies
fighting discrimination and generous social safety nets
like unemployment benefits to ensure a good situation
for the worst-off. Some philosophers have
critiqued Rawls’ work. Ronald Dworkin argues that
the difference principle unfairly tethers society’s progress
to the status of the worst-off, even if they’re in that position
because of their own choices. Meanwhile, Martha Nussbaum believes
Rawls’ thought experiment overlooks real-life particulars. For example, the special needs
of a person with disabilities might not be satisfied by the
standard distribution of primary goods. And more generally, some argue the architects in Rawls’
harmonious thought experiment are simply too different
from the competing interests building real societies. But since its publication, this thought experiment has inspired
some very real consequences. Rawls’ rallying cry for social
and political equality and a more justly regulated form
of capitalism has impacted countless political
philosophers, activists, and policymakers. And this new school of thought about
justice continues to challenge people to look past their biases and consider
what a fair society might truly look like.

**Transcript**:
In May of 1945, the Third Reich
was in chaos. Adolf Hitler was dead,
German surrender was imminent, and Allied troops had already begun
divvying up German territory. But high-ranking Nazi engineer
Wernher von Braun wasn’t worried. In fact, he approached
the US government directly— informing them of his location
and waiting calmly for their arrival. As the brain behind the world’s first
long-range ballistic missile, von Braun knew his expertise made him
a highly valuable military asset. And sure enough, his so-called captors
gave him a decidedly warm welcome. Von Braun wasn't the only Nazi scientist
receiving this treatment. While World War II was almost over,
a new war was brewing. And the US was eager to recruit
the smartest minds in Germany before the Soviets got the chance. This became known as Operation Paperclip— a clandestine campaign that brought
over 1,500 German scientists to the US between 1945 and 1962. The program was named for the paperclips
attached to the files of early recruits— indicating that incriminating information
like Nazi affiliations or suspected war crimes
could be disregarded. Von Braun, for example,
had overseen an SS project that relied on forced labor from thousands
of concentration camp prisoners. While von Braun approached
the US directly, other scientists had to be
identified and located. One important asset in this effort was a Nazi-compiled list
of Germany’s top scientists, which someone had unsuccessfully tried
to dispose of by flushing down a toilet. But the US was just one player
in this scramble. The Soviets were also competing
to seize German brainpower, resorting to bribery
and forced relocation. The French and British lacked the money
to lure the best German brains, but that didn't stop them from kidnapping
the occasional scientist. They also stole patents and dismantled
factories to learn what they could. The US approach, however, featured
a different and particularly tempting brand of coercion: the promise to relocate entire German
families and grant them citizenship. This controversial offer
was one of the reasons Paperclip was initially shrouded
in secrecy. But the project became difficult to hide
when Germans started popping up all over the US. The military tried to get
ahead of any controversy by revealing the operation to the press
in late 1946. But the news immediately attracted
criticism from many prominent voices, including Albert Einstein,
Eleanor Roosevelt, and the NAACP, as well as many veteran’s organizations. These parties opposed granting

including survivors of Nazi atrocities, had no chance of coming to America. Most Americans were also against employing
former Nazis in sensitive national security positions. But as the Cold War ramped up, the military argument for keeping these
scientists out of Soviet hands overpowered popular objections. With his Nazi past largely hidden
from the public, von Braun became one of the US’s
most important engineers at the height of the Space Race. In 1958, his team responded
to the Soviet launch of Sputnik with the US’s own successful
satellite launch. And in the 60s, he was the chief architect
of Saturn V, the rocket that brought Americans
to the moon. Other Paperclip recruits contributed
to the development of chemical weapons such as Agent Orange,
pharmaceutical research, and the development of modern airplanes. These contributions helped the US
government present Paperclip as a success. But, in hindsight, it’s hard to gauge
how helpful the program really was. While von Braun saved the US years
of rocketry experimentation, there's no reason to think American
scientists couldn't have developed the same technology without him. Furthermore, very few Paperclippers
were as exceptional as von Braun. Many were average scientists
who either completed their contracts and returned to Germany, or took jobs alongside Americans
with equivalent expertise. But ultimately,
the issue of Paperclip’s success is just one of many questions raised
by its contentious approach to science, ethics, and national security. Can scientists working on military
technology be apolitical, or are they responsible

**Transcript**:
In May of 1945, the Third Reich
was in chaos. Adolf Hitler was dead,
German surrender was imminent, and Allied troops had already begun
divvying up German territory. But high-ranking Nazi engineer
Wernher von Braun wasn’t worried. In fact, he approached
the US government directly— informing them of his location
and waiting calmly for their arrival. As the brain behind the world’s first
long-range ballistic missile, von Braun knew his expertise made him
a highly valuable military asset. And sure enough, his so-called captors
gave him a decidedly warm welcome. Von Braun wasn't the only Nazi scientist
receiving this treatment. While World War II was almost over,
a new war was brewing. And the US was eager to recruit
the smartest minds in Germany before the Soviets got the chance. This became known as Operation Paperclip— a clandestine campaign that brought
over 1,500 German scientists to the US between 1945 and 1962. The program was named for the paperclips
attached to the files of early recruits— indicating that incriminating information
like Nazi affiliations or suspected war crimes
could be disregarded. Von Braun, for example,
had overseen an SS project that relied on forced labor from thousands
of concentration camp prisoners. While von Braun approached
the US directly, other scientists had to be
identified and located. One important asset in this effort was a Nazi-compiled list
of Germany’s top scientists, which someone had unsuccessfully tried
to dispose of by flushing down a toilet. But the US was just one player
in this scramble. The Soviets were also competing
to seize German brainpower, resorting to bribery
and forced relocation. The French and British lacked the money
to lure the best German brains, but that didn't stop them from kidnapping
the occasional scientist. They also stole patents and dismantled
factories to learn what they could. The US approach, however, featured
a different and particularly tempting brand of coercion: the promise to relocate entire German
families and grant them citizenship. This controversial offer
was one of the reasons Paperclip was initially shrouded
in secrecy. But the project became difficult to hide
when Germans started popping up all over the US. The military tried to get
ahead of any controversy by revealing the operation to the press
in late 1946. But the news immediately attracted
criticism from many prominent voices, including Albert Einstein,
Eleanor Roosevelt, and the NAACP, as well as many veteran’s organizations. These parties opposed granting
German scientists citizenship while millions of displaced persons,
including survivors of Nazi atrocities, had no chance of coming to America. Most Americans were also against employing
former Nazis in sensitive national security positions. But as the Cold War ramped up, the military argument for keeping these
scientists out of Soviet hands overpowered popular objections. With his Nazi past largely hidden

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify a generated MCQ that is related to Wernher von Braun's expertise.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 1, but it doesn't match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options. Question 1 asks about the identity of the high-ranking Nazi engineer, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about Wernher von Braun's expertise.

Unfortunately, there isn't a generated MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the closest, but it's not a good match.

Index: 1 (with the caveat that it's not a good match)

To create a good match, a generated MCQ should be created with the same question intent and options as the ground truth MCQ. For example:

Question: What expertise did Wernher von Braun possess that made him valuable to the United States?
Options: A. Jet aircraft, B. Ballistic missiles, C. Electric submarines, D. Chemical weapons

This would be a direct match to the ground truth MCQ.

and waiting calmly for their arrival. As the brain behind the world’s first
long-range ballistic missile, von Braun knew his expertise made him
a highly valuable military asset. And sure enough, his so-called captors
gave him a decidedly warm welcome. Von Braun wasn't the only Nazi scientist
receiving this treatment. While World War II was almost over,
a new war was brewing. And the US was eager to recruit
the smartest minds in Germany before the Soviets got the chance. This became known as Operation Paperclip— a clandestine campaign that brought
over 1,500 German scientists to the US between 1945 and 1962. The program was named for the paperclips
attached to the files of early recruits— indicating that incriminating information
like Nazi affiliations or suspected war crimes
could be disregarded. Von Braun, for example,
had overseen an SS project that relied on forced labor from thousands
of concentration camp prisoners. While von Braun approached
the US directly, other scientists had to be
identified and located. One important asset in this effort was a Nazi-compiled list
of Germany’s top scientists, which someone had unsuccessfully tried
to dispose of by flushing down a toilet. But the US was just one player
in this scramble. The Soviets were also competing
to seize German brainpower, resorting to bribery
and forced relocation. The French and British lacked the money
to lure the best German brains, but that didn't stop them from kidnapping
the occasional scientist. They also stole patents and dismantled
factories to learn what they could. The US approach, however, featured
a different and particularly tempting brand of coercion: the promise to relocate entire German
families and grant them citizenship. This controversial offer
was one of the reasons Paperclip was initially shrouded
in secrecy. But the project became difficult to hide
when Germans started popping up all over the US. The military tried to get
ahead of any controversy by revealing the operation to the press
in late 1946. But the news immediately attracted
criticism from many prominent voices, including Albert Einstein,
Eleanor Roosevelt, and the NAACP, as well as many veteran’s organizations. These parties opposed granting
German scientists citizenship while millions of displaced persons,
including survivors of Nazi atrocities, had no chance of coming to America. Most Americans were also against employing
former Nazis in sensitive national security positions. But as the Cold War ramped up, the military argument for keeping these
scientists out of Soviet hands overpowered popular objections. With his Nazi past largely hidden
from the public, von Braun became one of the US’s
most important engineers at the height of the Space Race. In 1958, his team responded
to the Soviet launch of Sputnik with the US’s own successful
satellite launch. And in the 60s, he was the chief architect
of Saturn V, the rocket that brought Americans
to the moon. Other Paperclip recruits contributed
to the development of chemical weapons such as Agent Orange,
pharmaceutical research, and the development of modern airplanes. These contributions helped the US
government present Paperclip as a success. But, in hindsight, it’s hard to gauge
how helpful the program really was. While von Braun saved the US years
of rocketry experimentation, there's no reason to think American
scientists couldn't have developed the same technology without him. Furthermore, very few Paperclippers
were as exceptional as von Braun. Many were average scientists
who either completed their contracts and returned to Germany, or took jobs alongside Americans
with equivalent expertise. But ultimately,
the issue of Paperclip’s success is just one of many questions raised
by its contentious approach to science, ethics, and national security. Can scientists working on military
technology be apolitical, or are they responsible
for their creations? Can pressing political and military
concerns justify overlooking war crimes? In many ways, von Braun’s obituary
sums up the operation’s murkiness: “A kind of Faustian shadow may be
discerned in [...] the fascinating career of Wernher von Braun: a man so possessed
of [...] intellectual hunger, that any accommodation may be justified.”

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

Although the wording of Question 6 is different from the ground truth MCQ, the intent and content are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks why Operation Paperclip was considered controversial, and the correct answer is that the US offered scientists with Nazi backgrounds American citizenship. Question 6 asks why the US military was able to justify keeping former Nazis in sensitive national security positions despite popular objections, and the correct answer is that the Cold War had made the threat of communism more pressing. However, Question 6 also mentions the controversy surrounding the US government's decision to grant citizenship to former Nazis, which is the core issue in the ground truth MCQ.

A more direct match would be a generated MCQ that explicitly asks about the controversy surrounding Operation Paperclip and provides options that include the US government's decision to grant citizenship to former Nazis. However, among the provided generated MCQs, Question 6 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
On October 23, 2015, Mcebisi Jonas,
South Africa’s deputy finance minister, faced a harrowing, yet enticing, decision. He had thought he was attending
a normal business meeting but ended up in the home
of the powerful Gupta family, sitting with the Gupta brothers
and the president, Jacob Zuma’s, son. Jonas was offered a promotion
and $45 million. In return, he would be expected
to use his position to advance the Gupta’s
many business interests. This included firing officials
who opposed the construction of new power plants, which were slated to run on fuel
from Gupta-owned mines. The deal was simple—
but would Jonas accept? This kind of corruption in politics
is nothing new. It plagued the ancient world— the “Arthasastra,”
an Indian political treatise that dates back to the 3rd century BCE, lists 40 types of embezzlement alone. So, what exactly is corruption,
and what can we do to combat it? Corruption is often defined as a misuse
of a position of power for personal gain. For example, this could be a city clerk
accepting bribes in exchange for issuing permits; or a mayor appointing a campaign donor
to an influential position. But corruption isn’t limited
to the political sphere; it can happen in schools, sports,
businesses, or religious institutions. In ancient Greece,
the power-hungry Alcmaeonid family notoriously bribed the priestesses
at Delphi to deliver false prophecies, like telling the Spartans
they should invade Athens. It may seem like all corruption
is driven by greed, but individual motives are often complex. There can be economic drivers, like family pressure
on an underpaid civil servant who exaggerates his expenses
to get more money back. This might not seem like a big problem,
but corruption can snowball. If anti-corruption laws aren’t enforced, or if loopholes are
continuously exploited, a larger culture of corruption can emerge. For example, in 2009,
numerous British MPs were exposed for using taxpayer money
to cover personal expenses, from home renovations to luxury purchases,
and even having a moat cleaned. And corruption isn't always
directly about money. In 2016, a Department of Justice
investigation found widespread patterns of unconstitutional policing,
abuse, and corruption within the Baltimore Police Department. In just one elite task force,
eight officers were convicted of crimes, including planting evidence
and robbing citizens during traffic stops. Corruption like this causes people
to lose faith in government and can deplete much needed resources. The more taxpayer money
that goes into people’s pockets, the less there is to spend on services
that benefit the community— like repairing roads, building schools,
or providing healthcare. In the case of South Africa, the Gupta family plundered billions
of dollars from the country’s funds through their wide-ranging
corruption schemes, devastating the nation's economy. In Baltimore, the police department cost
taxpayers more than $22 million in court settlements
and gravely eroded public trust. So, how can we prevent corruption? While it’s important that laws set
a high price for corrupt behavior, punishment is only one piece
of the puzzle. Transparency in terms of budget
and paper trails and support for freedom of the press
are hugely important. In Botswana, the government
has built public trust through their ongoing commitment
to respond to corruption openly, quickly, and decisively. In Denmark, government ministers must
publish monthly reports cataloging their spending
on entertainment, official travel,
and any gifts they’ve received. As citizens, we can vote out those
who engage in corruption and question officials who push
back against transparency measures. And we can stand up against corruption
when we see it. In South Africa,
Jonas refused the Guptas’ offer, and despite threats against his life,
spoke out, exposing a sprawling web of corruption
that toppled Zuma’s regime, and sent the Gupta family into exile. But it wasn’t just Jonas’ revelation
that mattered. Once the scale of corruption
was unearthed, everyday South Africans
took to the streets, insisting that “Zuma must fall.” By using our civic voices, we can fight back to ensure
that tax dollars don’t line pockets, but instead benefit everyone.

**Transcript**:
On October 23, 2015, Mcebisi Jonas,
South Africa’s deputy finance minister, faced a harrowing, yet enticing, decision. He had thought he was attending
a normal business meeting but ended up in the home
of the powerful Gupta family, sitting with the Gupta brothers
and the president, Jacob Zuma’s, son. Jonas was offered a promotion
and $45 million. In return, he would be expected
to use his position to advance the Gupta’s
many business interests. This included firing officials
who opposed the construction of new power plants, which were slated to run on fuel
from Gupta-owned mines. The deal was simple—
but would Jonas accept? This kind of corruption in politics
is nothing new. It plagued the ancient world— the “Arthasastra,”
an Indian political treatise that dates back to the 3rd century BCE, lists 40 types of embezzlement alone. So, what exactly is corruption,
and what can we do to combat it? Corruption is often defined as a misuse
of a position of power for personal gain. For example, this could be a city clerk
accepting bribes in exchange for issuing permits; or a mayor appointing a campaign donor
to an influential position. But corruption isn’t limited
to the political sphere; it can happen in schools, sports,
businesses, or religious institutions. In ancient Greece,
the power-hungry Alcmaeonid family notoriously bribed the priestesses
at Delphi to deliver false prophecies, like telling the Spartans
they should invade Athens. It may seem like all corruption
is driven by greed, but individual motives are often complex. There can be economic drivers, like family pressure
on an underpaid civil servant who exaggerates his expenses
to get more money back. This might not seem like a big problem,
but corruption can snowball. If anti-corruption laws aren’t enforced, or if loopholes are
continuously exploited, a larger culture of corruption can emerge. For example, in 2009,
numerous British MPs were exposed for using taxpayer money
to cover personal expenses, from home renovations to luxury purchases,
and even having a moat cleaned. And corruption isn't always
directly about money. In 2016, a Department of Justice
investigation found widespread patterns of unconstitutional policing,
abuse, and corruption within the Baltimore Police Department. In just one elite task force,
eight officers were convicted of crimes, including planting evidence
and robbing citizens during traffic stops. Corruption like this causes people
to lose faith in government and can deplete much needed resources. The more taxpayer money
that goes into people’s pockets, the less there is to spend on services
that benefit the community— like repairing roads, building schools,
or providing healthcare. In the case of South Africa, the Gupta family plundered billions
of dollars from the country’s funds through their wide-ranging
corruption schemes, devastating the nation's economy. In Baltimore, the police department cost
taxpayers more than $22 million in court settlements
and gravely eroded public trust. So, how can we prevent corruption? While it’s important that laws set
a high price for corrupt behavior, punishment is only one piece
of the puzzle. Transparency in terms of budget
and paper trails and support for freedom of the press
are hugely important. In Botswana, the government
has built public trust through their ongoing commitment
to respond to corruption openly, quickly, and decisively. In Denmark, government ministers must
publish monthly reports cataloging their spending
on entertainment, official travel,
and any gifts they’ve received. As citizens, we can vote out those
who engage in corruption and question officials who push
back against transparency measures. And we can stand up against corruption
when we see it. In South Africa,
Jonas refused the Guptas’ offer, and despite threats against his life,
spoke out, exposing a sprawling web of corruption
that toppled Zuma’s regime, and sent the Gupta family into exile. But it wasn’t just Jonas’ revelation
that mattered. Once the scale of corruption
was unearthed, everyday South Africans
took to the streets, insisting that “Zuma must fall.” By using our civic voices, we can fight back to ensure
that tax dollars don’t line pockets, but instead benefit everyone.

**Transcript**:
On March 14th, 1970, Robert White
and his team carted two small monkeys into an operating room. The neurosurgeon lay on the verge
of an ambitious experiment, decades in the making,
which was bizarre, if not pulled straight
from his own fever dream. White’s objective? Connect the head of Monkey A
to the body of Monkey B, in what he considered
a whole-body transplant. White’s ultimate goal was to one day
perform this surgery on humans. While disturbing,
the idea of a body transplant raises ethical, biological,
and philosophical questions— on the nature of life
and the limits of science— that are still discussed today. But first, is it even medically possible? White's surgery faced several
technical hurdles. For one thing, it guaranteed paralysis as no doctor then— or now—
could reconnect a severed spinal cord. But White,
a practicing neurosurgeon, thought the surgery could be life-saving for his patients with spinal cord injuries
or progressive mobility diseases like ALS. These patients often face
multi-organ failures and paralysis, so with a body transplant, he hoped to save their lives by replacing
all of their organs at once. But paralysis wasn't the only challenge. Due to their high energy demands, brain cells require a constant supply
of oxygenated blood to survive. Yet the transplant surgery would likely
interrupt the brain’s oxygen flow for hours. But White had an idea. When the brain is cold, its metabolism slows down
and it relies less on oxygen. Experimenting on dogs and monkeys, White optimized a brain-cooling technique where the brain’s blood flow was
selectively chilled and halted, while the rest of the body’s blood
remained warm and circulated. Then, in 1964, White successfully cooled
the brain of a human patient with a life-threatening brain tumor
into “suspended animation” at 11°C. Whereas normally the surgical team
would have just 3 to 5 minutes to remove the tumor, with this new technique, they operated for over an hour
without causing damage. Brain cooling revolutionized
the field of neurosurgery and put White one step closer
to his body transplant goal. But this vision was fraught
with serious ethical concerns. What conditions would justify
such an experimental surgery, that could result in debilitating pain
and neurological damage? And how many animals would have to die
to prove it was possible? At the time, bioethics
was still an emerging field. Nevertheless, numerous critics, including
many in the scientific community, recognized the cruelty of White's research
and strongly opposed it. Yet White continued to gain approval
from agencies like the NIH. And by 1970, he was ready to attempt
a monkey body transplant. First Monkey A was installed
with temporary blood vessels— coils of plastic tubes that tethered
the head to the body. Plastic tube by plastic tube,
the team connected Body B to Head A, and then waited for the subject
to awake from anesthesia. The monkey did— alive, paralyzed,
and extremely distressed. According to the team, the monkey
could see, smell, hear, and even tried to bite off
one of the doctors’ fingers. White felt this proved that the operation
could work. The brain appeared to survive
a head transplant and, with high doses of drugs,
could live without immune rejection. But had White performed
a body transplant on Monkey A? Or was it a head transplant on Monkey B? The surgery raises questions
about the mind-body divide that have been debated for millennia. While modern neuroscience supports
the central role of the brain in building out our consciousness, discoveries about gut neurons
and the microbiome suggest that the answer
may be more complicated. Does part of the “self” reside
outside of the mind? The body and brain are interconnected
by circuits and signaling systems; so, what is lost by separating the two? As a neurosurgeon, White performed
more than 10,000 brain operations before retiring in 1998— but never the human head transplant
he dreamed of. Since then, several scientists have
expressed interest in picking up where White left off,
reviving unfinished debates. Even if a doctor could successfully
connect a patient’s head to a donor’s body, who of the two would emerge? And is extending a life
always worth the cost?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What was Robert White’s ultimate goal with the surgery, according to interviews?
Options: A. To provide many organ transplants at once for people suffering from multi-system failure, B. To keep human brains alive during long, difficult brain surgeries, C. To find the soul so that humans can live forever, D. To prove the existence of a higher being through medicine

technical hurdles. For one thing, it guaranteed paralysis as no doctor then— or now—
could reconnect a severed spinal cord. But White,
a practicing neurosurgeon, thought the surgery could be life-saving for his patients with spinal cord injuries
or progressive mobility diseases like ALS. These patients often face
multi-organ failures and paralysis, so with a body transplant, he hoped to save their lives by replacing
all of their organs at once. But paralysis wasn't the only challenge. Due to their high energy demands, brain cells require a constant supply
of oxygenated blood to survive. Yet the transplant surgery would likely
interrupt the brain’s oxygen flow for hours. But White had an idea. When the brain is cold, its metabolism slows down
and it relies less on oxygen. Experimenting on dogs and monkeys, White optimized a brain-cooling technique where the brain’s blood flow was
selectively chilled and halted, while the rest of the body’s blood
remained warm and circulated. Then, in 1964, White successfully cooled
the brain of a human patient with a life-threatening brain tumor
into “suspended animation” at 11°C. Whereas normally the surgical team
would have just 3 to 5 minutes to remove the tumor, with this new technique, they operated for over an hour
without causing damage. Brain cooling revolutionized
the field of neurosurgery and put White one step closer
to his body transplant goal. But this vision was fraught
with serious ethical concerns. What conditions would justify
such an experimental surgery, that could result in debilitating pain
and neurological damage? And how many animals would have to die
to prove it was possible? At the time, bioethics
was still an emerging field. Nevertheless, numerous critics, including
many in the scientific community, recognized the cruelty of White's research
and strongly opposed it. Yet White continued to gain approval
from agencies like the NIH. And by 1970, he was ready to attempt
a monkey body transplant. First Monkey A was installed
with temporary blood vessels— coils of plastic tubes that tethered
the head to the body. Plastic tube by plastic tube,
the team connected Body B to Head A, and then waited for the subject
to awake from anesthesia. The monkey did— alive, paralyzed,
and extremely distressed. According to the team, the monkey
could see, smell, hear, and even tried to bite off
one of the doctors’ fingers. White felt this proved that the operation
could work. The brain appeared to survive
a head transplant and, with high doses of drugs,
could live without immune rejection. But had White performed
a body transplant on Monkey A? Or was it a head transplant on Monkey B? The surgery raises questions
about the mind-body divide that have been debated for millennia. While modern neuroscience supports
the central role of the brain in building out our consciousness, discoveries about gut neurons
and the microbiome suggest that the answer
may be more complicated. Does part of the “self” reside
outside of the mind? The body and brain are interconnected
by circuits and signaling systems; so, what is lost by separating the two? As a neurosurgeon, White performed
more than 10,000 brain operations before retiring in 1998— but never the human head transplant
he dreamed of. Since then, several scientists have
expressed interest in picking up where White left off,
reviving unfinished debates. Even if a doctor could successfully
connect a patient’s head to a donor’s body, who of the two would emerge? And is extending a life
always worth the cost?

**Transcript**:
On a hot spring afternoon in 1963, two men, sent by the American CIA, snuck into the cafeteria
of the Havana Libre Hotel. Their directive was to retrieve
a poison pill from the freezer and slip it into the chocolate milkshake
of Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader who was known to devour
up to 18 scoops of ice cream after lunch. While exact details of the story are
contested, it's rumored that the pill, however, froze to the freezer coils
and broke, foiling the CIA’s plan and granting Castro
many more days to satiate his sweet tooth. Ice cream has held a unique role in our
world’s history, culture, and cravings— but where did it come from? The first accounts of cold desserts
and iced drinks date back as early as the first century. In civilizations including ancient Rome,
Mughal India, and Tang dynasty China, these icy treats were mainly enjoyed
by the royal elites. And finding the means to freeze
these delicacies wasn’t always easy. Wealthy Mediterranean nobility sent
laborers to trek up high mountains to harvest glacial ice and snow. Meanwhile, ancient Persians built
shallow insulated pools of water and utilized a technique
known as sky cooling. At night, the shallow pools would
naturally radiate heat into the dry desert skies, causing them to dip below the
ambient temperature and freeze. Yet the cream-based treat we know today
made a much later debut. It was originally inspired by sherbet,
or sharbat in Arabic, an icy drink believed to have
originated in Persia, and subsequently gained popularity
in the Middle Ages. European travelers brought
sharbat recipes home, and began creating their own
chocolate, pinecone, and even eggplant flavored
takes on the refreshment. In 1692, Antonio Latini,
a Neapolitan chef, recorded a recipe for a
unique milk-based version, which some historians dub
the first ice cream. In the 18th century,
ice cream expanded its reach as these recipes set sail alongside
European settlers to North America. Yet it was still mainly enjoyed
by the upper classes as the process to make it
was quite laborious, and its main ingredients—
sugar, salt, and cream— were expensive. George Washington is said to have spent
the equivalent of $6,600 in today’s dollars on ice cream
in one summer alone. It was on American soil that the
frozen dessert entered its golden age, as inventors and entrepreneurs began to
engineer ways to bring it to the masses. In Philadelphia in 1843,
Nancy Johnson patented a revolutionary ice cream-making machine
featuring a crank and beater, which made the process easier
for any home cook. And storing ice cream was no longer
an obstacle, as by the mid-1830s, New England businessman “Ice King”
Frederic Tudor had greatly improved the ice trade, shipping thousands of tons of ice
to households across the globe. Soon, ice cream was
on every street corner. In the late 1880s, political turmoil
brought Italian immigrants to cities like London, Glasgow, and New York, where many took up jobs as street vendors
selling licks of ice cream for roughly a penny each. Meanwhile, American druggists discovered
the appeal of combining soda, a drink thought to have therapeutic
properties at the time, with ice cream, and a new social spot was born:
the soda fountain. When the sale of alcohol
was banned in 1920, many American saloons reinvented
themselves as soda fountains, and breweries like Anheuser-Busch
and Yuengling pivoted to producing ice cream. At the same time, refrigeration technology
was improving rapidly. By the end of World War II, the average American home had a freezer
that could house a quart of ice cream. Even trucks could be equipped
with freezers full of frozen treats. Today, ice cream continues
to take on new forms. And while some of its mysteries
may never be solved, one thing is certain:
our love for ice cream will never thaw.

**Transcript**:
On a hot spring afternoon in 1963, two men, sent by the American CIA, snuck into the cafeteria
of the Havana Libre Hotel. Their directive was to retrieve
a poison pill from the freezer and slip it into the chocolate milkshake
of Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader who was known to devour
up to 18 scoops of ice cream after lunch. While exact details of the story are
contested, it's rumored that the pill, however, froze to the freezer coils
and broke, foiling the CIA’s plan and granting Castro
many more days to satiate his sweet tooth. Ice cream has held a unique role in our
world’s history, culture, and cravings— but where did it come from? The first accounts of cold desserts
and iced drinks date back as early as the first century. In civilizations including ancient Rome,
Mughal India, and Tang dynasty China, these icy treats were mainly enjoyed
by the royal elites. And finding the means to freeze
these delicacies wasn’t always easy. Wealthy Mediterranean nobility sent
laborers to trek up high mountains to harvest glacial ice and snow. Meanwhile, ancient Persians built
shallow insulated pools of water and utilized a technique
known as sky cooling. At night, the shallow pools would
naturally radiate heat into the dry desert skies, causing them to dip below the
ambient temperature and freeze. Yet the cream-based treat we know today
made a much later debut. It was originally inspired by sherbet,
or sharbat in Arabic, an icy drink believed to have
originated in Persia, and subsequently gained popularity
in the Middle Ages. European travelers brought
sharbat recipes home, and began creating their own
chocolate, pinecone, and even eggplant flavored
takes on the refreshment. In 1692, Antonio Latini,
a Neapolitan chef, recorded a recipe for a
unique milk-based version, which some historians dub
the first ice cream. In the 18th century,
ice cream expanded its reach as these recipes set sail alongside
European settlers to North America. Yet it was still mainly enjoyed
by the upper classes as the process to make it
was quite laborious, and its main ingredients—
sugar, salt, and cream— were expensive. George Washington is said to have spent
the equivalent of $6,600 in today’s dollars on ice cream
in one summer alone. It was on American soil that the
frozen dessert entered its golden age, as inventors and entrepreneurs began to
engineer ways to bring it to the masses. In Philadelphia in 1843,
Nancy Johnson patented a revolutionary ice cream-making machine
featuring a crank and beater, which made the process easier
for any home cook. And storing ice cream was no longer
an obstacle, as by the mid-1830s, New England businessman “Ice King”
Frederic Tudor had greatly improved the ice trade, shipping thousands of tons of ice
to households across the globe. Soon, ice cream was
on every street corner. In the late 1880s, political turmoil
brought Italian immigrants to cities like London, Glasgow, and New York, where many took up jobs as street vendors
selling licks of ice cream for roughly a penny each. Meanwhile, American druggists discovered
the appeal of combining soda, a drink thought to have therapeutic
properties at the time, with ice cream, and a new social spot was born:
the soda fountain. When the sale of alcohol
was banned in 1920, many American saloons reinvented
themselves as soda fountains, and breweries like Anheuser-Busch
and Yuengling pivoted to producing ice cream. At the same time, refrigeration technology
was improving rapidly. By the end of World War II, the average American home had a freezer
that could house a quart of ice cream. Even trucks could be equipped
with freezers full of frozen treats. Today, ice cream continues
to take on new forms. And while some of its mysteries
may never be solved, one thing is certain:
our love for ice cream will never thaw.

**Transcript**:
Typically, with any piece of technology,
you get out what you put in. Pump one unit of energy
into an electric toaster and you get about one
out in the form of heat. That’s just the first law
of thermodynamics: energy has to be conserved. But there's a piece of technology
called a heat pump, where for every bit of energy you put in,
you get 3 to 5 times as much heat out. What wizardry is this? Heat pumps have been hailed
as a climate-friendly heating solution to traditional heaters, most of which operate
by burning fossil fuels. So much so that in 2021, heating buildings was responsible
for about 10% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Heat pumps reduce emissions in two ways— first, they run on electricity, meaning less fossil fuel use as grids
make the switch to renewable energy. And second, they're more efficient
than their counterparts, using less energy to produce
the same amount of heat. Where a typical oil or gas boiler is,
at best, about 90% efficient, some heat pumps can achieve
500% efficiency. Heat pumps rely on the same technology
as air conditioners. And in fact, they often double
as air conditioners, heating your home in the winter
and cooling it in the summer. How? Air conditioners take heat
from your home and move it outside. To do so, they harness the second law
of thermodynamics. That’s the one that says that heat will
always move from a hotter object to a colder one. When you turn on your A/C, a fan blows the hot air from your home
over coils containing a substance
called a refrigerant. A refrigerant’s molecules turn to gas
at relatively low temperatures, so as it collects thermal energy
from the hot air in your home, it boils. Then, it passes into a compressor, which pushes the gas molecules
closer together, heating them up even more. Now that gas is hot—
way hotter than the outside air. So when a fan blows over the refrigerant, thermal energy transfers to the
comparatively cold air outside. As the refrigerant releases heat,
it starts to liquefy. It goes through an expansion valve,
which decreases the pressure, causing it to get even colder. Now, it’s ready to pick up more heat
from your house and start the cycle again. In winter, heat pumps work
exactly the same way. But this time they pick up heat
from outside and move it into your home. Of course, it’s sometimes freezing outside
when you want to use your heater. But the air doesn’t need to be warm— it just needs to be warmer than the
refrigerant to transfer its heat. All this sounds great, but for now there
are some drawbacks to this technology. First, refrigerants can be
potent greenhouse gases. Hydrofluorocarbons are some
of the most popular refrigerants. But a single hydrofluorocarbon molecule
can have 2,000 times the global warming impact of CO2. While in use, the refrigerant stays
contained in a closed loop. But when heat pumps, A/Cs, and
refrigerators are improperly installed or thrown into landfills,
the refrigerant can leak out. So scientists are trying to create
new refrigerants that are better for the environment. Also, the colder it is outside, the less efficient an air-to-air
heat pump will be. Nevertheless, over half the buildings
in icy Norway use heat pumps. Some people there have opted for pumps
that draw heat from under the ground, which stays more consistently warm,
rather than heat from the air. Finally, there's the cost. In the US, installing a small heat pump
usually costs several thousand dollars, though some people need
more powerful systems, depending on the size of their home
or the temperature in winter. Often they’re only a little more expensive
than installing a new A/C system, and the heat pump can save money
on utilities in the long run. But replacing a working system requires
an upfront investment that a lot of people just don’t have. Still, as the risks
of climate change loom, many countries are offering subsidies
to help with the costs. And some cities are creatively harnessing
seas, sewage, and data centers as heat sources,
using heat pumps in manufacturing, and even creating giant heat pumps
for entire districts. So, are heat pumps actually breaking
the first law of thermodynamics? Of course not. They’re just not using
their electricity to make heat. They're using it to power the compressor
and spin the fans. They get the extra energy for free—
from heat in the air or underground. Which is how, by putting in 1 unit
of energy, you get 3 to 5 units of heat out. Seems like magic, but it's just physics.

called a heat pump, where for every bit of energy you put in,
you get 3 to 5 times as much heat out. What wizardry is this? Heat pumps have been hailed
as a climate-friendly heating solution to traditional heaters, most of which operate
by burning fossil fuels. So much so that in 2021, heating buildings was responsible
for about 10% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Heat pumps reduce emissions in two ways— first, they run on electricity, meaning less fossil fuel use as grids
make the switch to renewable energy. And second, they're more efficient
than their counterparts, using less energy to produce
the same amount of heat. Where a typical oil or gas boiler is,
at best, about 90% efficient, some heat pumps can achieve
500% efficiency. Heat pumps rely on the same technology
as air conditioners. And in fact, they often double
as air conditioners, heating your home in the winter
and cooling it in the summer. How? Air conditioners take heat
from your home and move it outside. To do so, they harness the second law
of thermodynamics. That’s the one that says that heat will
always move from a hotter object to a colder one. When you turn on your A/C, a fan blows the hot air from your home
over coils containing a substance
called a refrigerant. A refrigerant’s molecules turn to gas
at relatively low temperatures, so as it collects thermal energy
from the hot air in your home, it boils. Then, it passes into a compressor, which pushes the gas molecules
closer together, heating them up even more. Now that gas is hot—
way hotter than the outside air. So when a fan blows over the refrigerant, thermal energy transfers to the
comparatively cold air outside. As the refrigerant releases heat,
it starts to liquefy. It goes through an expansion valve,
which decreases the pressure, causing it to get even colder. Now, it’s ready to pick up more heat
from your house and start the cycle again. In winter, heat pumps work
exactly the same way. But this time they pick up heat
from outside and move it into your home. Of course, it’s sometimes freezing outside
when you want to use your heater. But the air doesn’t need to be warm— it just needs to be warmer than the
refrigerant to transfer its heat. All this sounds great, but for now there
are some drawbacks to this technology. First, refrigerants can be
potent greenhouse gases. Hydrofluorocarbons are some
of the most popular refrigerants. But a single hydrofluorocarbon molecule
can have 2,000 times the global warming impact of CO2. While in use, the refrigerant stays
contained in a closed loop. But when heat pumps, A/Cs, and
refrigerators are improperly installed or thrown into landfills,
the refrigerant can leak out. So scientists are trying to create
new refrigerants that are better for the environment. Also, the colder it is outside, the less efficient an air-to-air
heat pump will be. Nevertheless, over half the buildings
in icy Norway use heat pumps. Some people there have opted for pumps
that draw heat from under the ground, which stays more consistently warm,
rather than heat from the air. Finally, there's the cost. In the US, installing a small heat pump
usually costs several thousand dollars, though some people need
more powerful systems, depending on the size of their home
or the temperature in winter. Often they’re only a little more expensive
than installing a new A/C system, and the heat pump can save money
on utilities in the long run. But replacing a working system requires
an upfront investment that a lot of people just don’t have. Still, as the risks
of climate change loom, many countries are offering subsidies
to help with the costs. And some cities are creatively harnessing
seas, sewage, and data centers as heat sources,
using heat pumps in manufacturing, and even creating giant heat pumps
for entire districts. So, are heat pumps actually breaking
the first law of thermodynamics? Of course not. They’re just not using
their electricity to make heat. They're using it to power the compressor
and spin the fans. They get the extra energy for free—
from heat in the air or underground. Which is how, by putting in 1 unit
of energy, you get 3 to 5 units of heat out. Seems like magic, but it's just physics.

**Transcript**:
It was June 2010. Inside the Scripps National Spelling Bee, contestants between 8- and 15-years-old
wrestled words like brachydactylous and leguleian. Outside, a crowd protested the complexity
of English spelling conventions. Indeed, spelling reformers have
been around for centuries, advocating for overarching changes to make
English spelling more intuitive. The English language is chock-full
of irregularities. One commonly used example of this:
take the “g-h” sound from “enough,” the “o” sound from “women,”
and the “t-i” sound from “action,” and you could argue that
“g-h-o-t-i” spells “fish.” So, how did English get like this? English arose from old Germanic
tribes that invaded the British Isles more than 1,500 years ago. Their languages coalesced and evolved
into Old English. When Roman missionaries arrived
around 600 CE, they devised ways to write it
down using the Latin alphabet, supplementing it with some Germanic runes
for sounds they didn’t have letters for. Then came the Norman invasion of 1066
when French speakers conquered England. French became the language
of authority and high society. But English remained the dominant
spoken language. Over time, those descended from French
speakers also became English speakers, but some French words snuck
into the language. Some English speakers were also familiar
with Latin through the church and formal education. By the mid-1400s, people were writing
in English again— but it was unstandardized. They used a mix of influences to determine
word choice and spelling, including the French they knew,
the Latin they studied, and the English they spoke. So, things were already pretty messy. Then, in 1476, the printing press
arrived in England. Some of the people working the presses
may have mainly spoken Flemish— not English. And they were given manuscripts
that varied widely in their spelling. Without standardization, different writers
went with various spellings based in part on what they happened
to encounter while reading. Many words had a multitude of spellings. The word “dough,” for instance, used to be spelled in all these ways
and was originally pronounced “dach.” The guttural Germanic sound it ended with
was one the Latin alphabet didn’t cover. It eventually came to be
represented with “g-h.” But, for some “g-h” words, English speakers eventually dropped
the guttural sound altogether; for others, they ended up pronouncing
it as “f” instead, as exemplified in “dough” versus “tough.” Printing presses memorialized
the spelling even though the pronunciation
eventually changed. And this wasn’t just the case with “g-h.” Some letters in other words
also fell silent: words like knife, gnat, and wrong all contain the vestiges
of past pronunciations. But while the printing press
was solidifying spellings, the English language was also undergoing
what scholars call the Great Vowel Shift. Between the 14th and 18th centuries, the way English speakers pronounced
many vowels changed significantly. For instance, “bawt” became “boat.” This displaced the word for “boot,” which had up until then
been pronounced “boat,” and pushed it into the high “u” vowel
position it maintains today. Words that already had this high “u”
often became diphthongs, with two vowels in a single syllable. So, “hus” became “house.” As with so many linguistic matters,
there's no clear reason why this happened. But it did. And how the vowel shift affected a word
depended on various things, including the other sounds in the word. The word “tough” was once “tōh,”
among other variations. “Through” was once “thruch”
and “dough” “dah.” These words all started
with different vowel sounds that were then affected differently
by the vowel shift. The “o-u” spelling they all adopted was
a haphazardly applied French influence. So, eventually they wound up with
still distinct vowel sounds, but similar spellings
that don’t really make much sense. All this means English can be
a difficult language for non-native speakers to learn. And it reveals the many ways history,
in all its messiness, acted upon English,
making it especially tough.

**Transcript**:
It was June 2010. Inside the Scripps National Spelling Bee, contestants between 8- and 15-years-old
wrestled words like brachydactylous and leguleian. Outside, a crowd protested the complexity
of English spelling conventions. Indeed, spelling reformers have
been around for centuries, advocating for overarching changes to make
English spelling more intuitive. The English language is chock-full
of irregularities. One commonly used example of this:
take the “g-h” sound from “enough,” the “o” sound from “women,”
and the “t-i” sound from “action,” and you could argue that
“g-h-o-t-i” spells “fish.” So, how did English get like this? English arose from old Germanic
tribes that invaded the British Isles more than 1,500 years ago. Their languages coalesced and evolved
into Old English. When Roman missionaries arrived
around 600 CE, they devised ways to write it
down using the Latin alphabet, supplementing it with some Germanic runes

and “dough” “dah.” These words all started
with different vowel sounds that were then affected differently
by the vowel shift. The “o-u” spelling they all adopted was
a haphazardly applied French influence. So, eventually they wound up with
still distinct vowel sounds, but similar spellings
that don’t really make much sense. All this means English can be
a difficult language for non-native speakers to learn. And it reveals the many ways history,
in all its messiness, acted upon English,
making it especially tough.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 5, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 5
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You and your partner Alex have been in a
strong, loving relationship for years, and lately you're considering
getting engaged. Alex is enthusiastic about the idea,
but you can’t get over the statistics. You know a lot of marriages end
in divorce, often not amicably. And over 10% of couples
in their first marriage get divorced within the first five years. If your marriage wouldn’t
even last five years, you feel like tying the knot
would be a mistake. But you live in the near future, where a brand-new company just
released an AI-based model that can predict your likelihood
of divorce. The model is trained on data sets containing individuals’
social media activity, online search histories, spending habits,
and history of marriage and divorce. And using this information, the AI can predict if a couple
will divorce within the first five years of marriage
with 95% accuracy. The only catch is the model doesn’t offer
any reasons for its results— it simply predicts that you will or won’t
divorce without saying why. So, should you decide whether or not
to get married based on this AI’s prediction? Suppose the model predicts you and Alex would divorce within five years
of getting married. At this point, you'd have three options. You could get married anyway
and hope the prediction is wrong. You could break up now, though there’s no way to know if ending
your currently happy relationship would cause more harm than letting
the prediction run its course. Or, you could stay together
and remain unmarried, on the off-chance marriage itself
would be the problem. Though without understanding the reasons
for your predicted divorce, you’d never know if those mystery issues
would still emerge to ruin your relationship. The uncertainty undermining
all these options stems from a well known issue with AI
around explainability and transparency. This problem plagues tons of potentially
useful predictive models, such as those that could be used
to predict which bank customers are most likely to repay a loan, or which prisoners are most likely
to reoffend if granted parole. Without knowing why AI systems
reach their decisions, many worry we can’t think critically
about how to follow their advice. But the transparency problem
doesn’t just prevent us from understanding these models, it also impacts the user’s accountability. For example, if the AI's prediction
led you to break up with Alex, what explanation could you
reasonably offer them? That you want to end
your happy relationship because some mysterious machine
predicted its demise? That hardly seems fair to Alex. We don’t always owe people
an explanation for our actions, but when we do, AI’s lack of transparency can create
ethically challenging situations. And accountability is just one
of the tradeoffs we make by outsourcing important decisions to AI. If you’re comfortable deferring
your agency to an AI model it’s likely because you’re focused
on the accuracy of the prediction. In this mindset, it doesn’t really matter
why you and Alex might break up— simply that you likely will. But if you prioritize authenticity
over accuracy, then you'll need to understand
and appreciate the reasons for your future divorce
before ending things today. Authentic decision making like this is
essential for maintaining accountability, and it might be your best chance
to prove the prediction wrong. On the other hand,
it’s also possible the model already accounted for your attempts
to defy it, and you’re just setting yourself
up for failure. 95% accuracy is high, 
but it’s not perfect— that figure means 1 in 20 couples
will receive a false prediction. And as more people use this service, the likelihood increases that someone
who was predicted to divorce will do so just because the AI
predicted they would. If that happens to enough newlyweds, the AI's success rate could
be artificially maintained or even increased by these
self-fulfilling predictions. Of course, no matter what
the AI might tell you, whether you even ask for its prediction
is still up to you.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: When an AI model that has been trained on lots of data makes a prediction, which of the following are accurate?
Options: A. The AI’s prediction is correct since it is a higher form of intelligence. , B. The AI will always give a reason for why it made the prediction it made., C. The AI can be accurate in its prediction without also giving a reason for its prediction., D. All of the above
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
You and your partner Alex have been in a
strong, loving relationship for years, and lately you're considering
getting engaged. Alex is enthusiastic about the idea,
but you can’t get over the statistics. You know a lot of marriages end
in divorce, often not amicably. And over 10% of couples
in their first marriage get divorced within the first five years. If your marriage wouldn’t
even last five years, you feel like tying the knot
would be a mistake. But you live in the near future, where a brand-new company just
released an AI-based model that can predict your likelihood
of divorce. The model is trained on data sets containing individuals’
social media activity, online search histories, spending habits,
and history of marriage and divorce. And using this information, the AI can predict if a couple
will divorce within the first five years of marriage
with 95% accuracy. The only catch is the model doesn’t offer
any reasons for its results— it simply predicts that you will or won’t
divorce without saying why. So, should you decide whether or not
to get married based on this AI’s prediction? Suppose the model predicts you and Alex would divorce within five years
of getting married. At this point, you'd have three options. You could get married anyway
and hope the prediction is wrong. You could break up now, though there’s no way to know if ending
your currently happy relationship would cause more harm than letting
the prediction run its course. Or, you could stay together
and remain unmarried, on the off-chance marriage itself
would be the problem. Though without understanding the reasons
for your predicted divorce, you’d never know if those mystery issues
would still emerge to ruin your relationship. The uncertainty undermining
all these options stems from a well known issue with AI
around explainability and transparency. This problem plagues tons of potentially
useful predictive models, such as those that could be used
to predict which bank customers are most likely to repay a loan, or which prisoners are most likely
to reoffend if granted parole. Without knowing why AI systems
reach their decisions, many worry we can’t think critically
about how to follow their advice. But the transparency problem
doesn’t just prevent us from understanding these models, it also impacts the user’s accountability. For example, if the AI's prediction
led you to break up with Alex, what explanation could you
reasonably offer them? That you want to end
your happy relationship because some mysterious machine
predicted its demise? That hardly seems fair to Alex. We don’t always owe people
an explanation for our actions, but when we do, AI’s lack of transparency can create
ethically challenging situations. And accountability is just one
of the tradeoffs we make by outsourcing important decisions to AI. If you’re comfortable deferring
your agency to an AI model it’s likely because you’re focused
on the accuracy of the prediction. In this mindset, it doesn’t really matter
why you and Alex might break up— simply that you likely will. But if you prioritize authenticity
over accuracy, then you'll need to understand
and appreciate the reasons for your future divorce
before ending things today. Authentic decision making like this is
essential for maintaining accountability, and it might be your best chance
to prove the prediction wrong. On the other hand,
it’s also possible the model already accounted for your attempts
to defy it, and you’re just setting yourself
up for failure. 95% accuracy is high, 
but it’s not perfect— that figure means 1 in 20 couples
will receive a false prediction. And as more people use this service, the likelihood increases that someone
who was predicted to divorce will do so just because the AI
predicted they would. If that happens to enough newlyweds, the AI's success rate could
be artificially maintained or even increased by these
self-fulfilling predictions. Of course, no matter what
the AI might tell you, whether you even ask for its prediction
is still up to you.

**Transcript**:
According to legend, the ancient Roman
statesman Cincinnatus was plowing his fields
when news arrived that the Aequi, Rome’s powerful enemy to the east,
had invaded. Rome was in need of swift,
decisive action, and the senate had chosen him
to serve as dictator, with absolute power over the military
and government. Cincinnatus set down his plow,
took control and, in a matter of weeks,
saved Rome. This story reinforces the myth
of the “benevolent dictator”— the idea of a leader who
holds absolute power, yet only uses it for the common good, 
to address problems efficiently, and create a just regime. But can a truly benevolent dictator
exist in today’s world? Nations established modern democracies
to safeguard against the potentially destructive whims
of a single individual. When functioning properly,
democracies enable a society to be freer, and provide stability by protecting
against corruption and the abuse of power. This is accomplished by holding regular,
free, and fair elections, imposing term limits, and establishing strong legislative
branches and court systems. Maintaining a free press also helps keep
politicians accountable for their actions and encourages citizens to engage
in their governments and communities. In a dictatorship,
absolute or near-absolute power is held by a single individual who is free to impose their vision
on society. Under certain conditions, the idea
of a dictator can sound appealing, like when a democracy isn't functioning
as it should due to corruption, economic instability,
or extreme political polarization. At these moments, people may be willing to give up some
democratic rights and freedoms for hopes of a better future. Authoritarian-leaning leaders
present themselves as the ones who can fix everything. They distill complex problems
into simple talking points and promise quick solutions. Some of the most overt authoritarian
leaders have taken this strategy, including military dictators who seized
control through coups like Augusto Pinochet, Mobuto Sese Seko,
and Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi, for example, initially asserted
himself as a revolutionary hero, canceling the country's exploitative
foreign oil contracts. But the longer he was in power,
the more riddled with paranoia he became. Like Pinochet and Mobuto, he used his
position to target and torture opponents, embark on campaigns of mass violence
against everyday people, and build an enormous personal fortune. Other modern dictators were initially
elected democratically, then strategically accumulated power by
embracing authoritarian forms of control. Italy’s Benito Mussolini and
Germany’s Adolf Hitler, for example, gained popularity during waves
of mass discontent. Both channeled economic woes
into racist rhetoric and embraced fascism, a type of authoritarianism which exalts
the importance of one nation, or race, above all others. Once in office, such leaders gradually
dismantle checks on their power, including removing judges who might rule
against them, abolishing term limits, or refusing to acknowledge
unfavorable election results. Since they punish dissenting voices, dictators are often surrounded
with yes-men, who are promoted based on loyalty
over expertise, ultimately wreaking incalculable economic,
social, and environmental costs. But these costs can also
be hidden from view. Dictators build up cults of personality
by minimizing negative coverage and pushing positive propaganda
that presents them as strong or heroic. This can make it almost impossible
to accurately measure their success. Did Mussolini really make
the trains run on time? It’s hard to know, since he would have
punished those who said otherwise. While some modern dictators have
brought modest growth to their nation’s economies
and industries, most have enriched the few and left
widespread destruction in their wake. Even so-called benevolent dictators,
whose regimes lacked overt violence, stand accused of censoring journalists and limiting the rights
and freedoms of citizens. Back to ancient Rome. Perhaps the most important dimension of Cincinnatus’ legendary 
benevolent dictatorship is not that he held total power, but that he gave it up after only 16 days. Once Rome was safe,
he stepped down and retired to his fields. His willingness to relinquish control
to the senate was as important to the common good
as his ability to fend off invaders. In practice, no modern dictator
has lived up to this ideal. Dictators don’t willingly walk away
from power, they continuously crave more. That’s why institutions that provide
checks on leaders must be safeguarded: in the hands of an aspiring dictator, even seemingly robust democracies can sink into repressive,
authoritarian regimes.

**Transcript**:
According to legend, the ancient Roman
statesman Cincinnatus was plowing his fields
when news arrived that the Aequi, Rome’s powerful enemy to the east,
had invaded. Rome was in need of swift,
decisive action, and the senate had chosen him
to serve as dictator, with absolute power over the military
and government. Cincinnatus set down his plow,
took control and, in a matter of weeks,
saved Rome. This story reinforces the myth
of the “benevolent dictator”— the idea of a leader who
holds absolute power, yet only uses it for the common good, 
to address problems efficiently, and create a just regime. But can a truly benevolent dictator
exist in today’s world? Nations established modern democracies
to safeguard against the potentially destructive whims
of a single individual. When functioning properly,
democracies enable a society to be freer, and provide stability by protecting
against corruption and the abuse of power. This is accomplished by holding regular,
free, and fair elections, imposing term limits, and establishing strong legislative
branches and court systems. Maintaining a free press also helps keep
politicians accountable for their actions and encourages citizens to engage
in their governments and communities. In a dictatorship,
absolute or near-absolute power is held by a single individual who is free to impose their vision
on society. Under certain conditions, the idea
of a dictator can sound appealing, like when a democracy isn't functioning
as it should due to corruption, economic instability,
or extreme political polarization. At these moments, people may be willing to give up some
democratic rights and freedoms for hopes of a better future. Authoritarian-leaning leaders
present themselves as the ones who can fix everything. They distill complex problems
into simple talking points and promise quick solutions. Some of the most overt authoritarian
leaders have taken this strategy, including military dictators who seized
control through coups like Augusto Pinochet, Mobuto Sese Seko,
and Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi, for example, initially asserted
himself as a revolutionary hero, canceling the country's exploitative
foreign oil contracts. But the longer he was in power,
the more riddled with paranoia he became. Like Pinochet and Mobuto, he used his
position to target and torture opponents, embark on campaigns of mass violence
against everyday people, and build an enormous personal fortune. Other modern dictators were initially
elected democratically, then strategically accumulated power by
embracing authoritarian forms of control. Italy’s Benito Mussolini and
Germany’s Adolf Hitler, for example, gained popularity during waves
of mass discontent. Both channeled economic woes
into racist rhetoric and embraced fascism, a type of authoritarianism which exalts
the importance of one nation, or race, above all others. Once in office, such leaders gradually
dismantle checks on their power, including removing judges who might rule
against them, abolishing term limits, or refusing to acknowledge
unfavorable election results. Since they punish dissenting voices, dictators are often surrounded
with yes-men, who are promoted based on loyalty
over expertise, ultimately wreaking incalculable economic,
social, and environmental costs. But these costs can also
be hidden from view. Dictators build up cults of personality
by minimizing negative coverage and pushing positive propaganda
that presents them as strong or heroic. This can make it almost impossible
to accurately measure their success. Did Mussolini really make
the trains run on time? It’s hard to know, since he would have
punished those who said otherwise. While some modern dictators have
brought modest growth to their nation’s economies
and industries, most have enriched the few and left
widespread destruction in their wake. Even so-called benevolent dictators,
whose regimes lacked overt violence, stand accused of censoring journalists and limiting the rights
and freedoms of citizens. Back to ancient Rome. Perhaps the most important dimension of Cincinnatus’ legendary 
benevolent dictatorship is not that he held total power, but that he gave it up after only 16 days. Once Rome was safe,
he stepped down and retired to his fields. His willingness to relinquish control
to the senate was as important to the common good
as his ability to fend off invaders. In practice, no modern dictator
has lived up to this ideal. Dictators don’t willingly walk away
from power, they continuously crave more. That’s why institutions that provide
checks on leaders must be safeguarded: in the hands of an aspiring dictator, even seemingly robust democracies can sink into repressive,
authoritarian regimes.

**Transcript**:
Roughly 3 billion years ago, a single-celled photosynthetic bacterium
began burping a new chemical that was poisonous
to nearly every species on Earth. Over the following hundreds
of millions of years, more microorganisms began producing
this toxic gas, first saturating Earth's oceans
and eventually its atmosphere. Up here, this chemical changed
the composition of pre-existing gases so drastically that it caused
a global ice age. And the name of this powerful, poisonous,
world-changing gas? Oxygen. In the millions of years since
the Great Oxygen Catastrophe, most life, including all
multicellular organisms, have evolved to rely on this gas. However, there are some places
where oxygen-averse microorganisms, like those from Earth's earliest days,
have re-emerged. Many of these places are
in the ocean depths, beyond the reach of researchers. But there are other bodies of water
completely devoid of oxygen, yet close enough to the surface
to explore. And one such lake is hidden high
in the Swiss Alps’ Piora Valley. Formed over 10,000 years ago, Lake Cadagno is one of roughly 200
known meromictic lakes, meaning it's actually two distinct bodies
of water stacked on top of each other. The top layer functions like
a standard body of freshwater. It’s safe for swimming and known mostly
for a plump and plentiful fish population that’s been the subject
of local fishing legends for centuries. But just 13 meters beneath that bounty
is a dense, sulfurous, oxygen-free pool lethal to any multicellular life forms,
fish included. In a typical lake, the entire
body of water would gradually mix, diffusing oxygen
from the surface throughout. But these two layers never mix,
as is the case with any meromictic lake. And the reason for this divide in Cadagno is the waters’ unique
chemical compositions. Both layers are fed by rainwater
flowing down the mountains, however, this water can take two paths. The first is to trickle down the granitic
mountain directly into the top layer. The second is to seep into the
Piora Valley’s vein of dolomite— a porous rock full of salts
such as sulfate. Rainwater that sinks into the dolomite
will slowly inch towards the lake, all the while shedding its oxygen
and picking up salts. Finally, this heavier water will cascade
from sublacustrine springs below the lake’s surface, forming the dense,
salt-rich bottom layer. This lower layer is anoxic,
meaning oxygen free, and will suffocate any
oxygen-dependent life. But it’s ideal for the kind
of anaerobic bacteria that died off in the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. The flow from the sublacustrine springs
creates microenvironments which feed large aggregates
of microorganisms that emerge from the lakebed
in strange and otherworldly shapes. Various anaerobic microorganisms
take in the water's sulfate and emit toxic sulfide. And at the border of these layers, there’s a thin blanket mainly composed
of pink-bodied Chromatium okenii: a photosynthesizing bacterium
that relies on this sulfur the way most plants rely on oxygen. However, while neither water nor organisms
move between the layers, these ecosystems aren’t
completely out of touch. Chromatium okenii live
at the top of the bottom layer because they need to be as close
to the sun as possible. But while they never cross
into the deadly oxygenated waters, they’re close enough that organisms
like zooplankton can dive down, eat them, and get back up. In fact, this relationship forms
the bottom of the upper layer’s robust food chain supporting the lake’s
legendary fish population. This unique ecology is more than
just a boon for Cadagno’s fishermen. Having access to an isolated
anaerobic ecosystem allows scientists to model the world
before the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. For example, when Chromatium okenii
form their blanket, they increase the density
of that thin layer of water. As the water sinks, these microorganisms
are forced to swim back up, creating a minute mixing of water
called bioconvection. This billions of years old phenomenon
might be a clue to how early life evolved
the ability to swim. And it’s just one of the many insights
that await researchers studying Cadagno’s mysterious depths.

body of water would gradually mix, diffusing oxygen
from the surface throughout. But these two layers never mix,
as is the case with any meromictic lake. And the reason for this divide in Cadagno is the waters’ unique
chemical compositions. Both layers are fed by rainwater
flowing down the mountains, however, this water can take two paths. The first is to trickle down the granitic
mountain directly into the top layer. The second is to seep into the
Piora Valley’s vein of dolomite— a porous rock full of salts
such as sulfate. Rainwater that sinks into the dolomite
will slowly inch towards the lake, all the while shedding its oxygen
and picking up salts. Finally, this heavier water will cascade
from sublacustrine springs below the lake’s surface, forming the dense,
salt-rich bottom layer. This lower layer is anoxic,
meaning oxygen free, and will suffocate any
oxygen-dependent life. But it’s ideal for the kind
of anaerobic bacteria that died off in the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. The flow from the sublacustrine springs
creates microenvironments which feed large aggregates
of microorganisms that emerge from the lakebed
in strange and otherworldly shapes. Various anaerobic microorganisms
take in the water's sulfate and emit toxic sulfide. And at the border of these layers, there’s a thin blanket mainly composed
of pink-bodied Chromatium okenii: a photosynthesizing bacterium
that relies on this sulfur the way most plants rely on oxygen. However, while neither water nor organisms
move between the layers, these ecosystems aren’t
completely out of touch. Chromatium okenii live
at the top of the bottom layer because they need to be as close
to the sun as possible. But while they never cross
into the deadly oxygenated waters, they’re close enough that organisms
like zooplankton can dive down, eat them, and get back up. In fact, this relationship forms
the bottom of the upper layer’s robust food chain supporting the lake’s
legendary fish population. This unique ecology is more than
just a boon for Cadagno’s fishermen. Having access to an isolated
anaerobic ecosystem allows scientists to model the world
before the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. For example, when Chromatium okenii
form their blanket, they increase the density
of that thin layer of water. As the water sinks, these microorganisms
are forced to swim back up, creating a minute mixing of water
called bioconvection. This billions of years old phenomenon
might be a clue to how early life evolved
the ability to swim. And it’s just one of the many insights

**Transcript**:
Roughly 3 billion years ago, a single-celled photosynthetic bacterium
began burping a new chemical that was poisonous
to nearly every species on Earth. Over the following hundreds
of millions of years, more microorganisms began producing
this toxic gas, first saturating Earth's oceans
and eventually its atmosphere. Up here, this chemical changed
the composition of pre-existing gases so drastically that it caused
a global ice age. And the name of this powerful, poisonous,
world-changing gas? Oxygen. In the millions of years since
the Great Oxygen Catastrophe, most life, including all
multicellular organisms, have evolved to rely on this gas. However, there are some places
where oxygen-averse microorganisms, like those from Earth's earliest days,
have re-emerged. Many of these places are
in the ocean depths, beyond the reach of researchers. But there are other bodies of water
completely devoid of oxygen, yet close enough to the surface
to explore. And one such lake is hidden high
in the Swiss Alps’ Piora Valley. Formed over 10,000 years ago, Lake Cadagno is one of roughly 200
known meromictic lakes, meaning it's actually two distinct bodies
of water stacked on top of each other. The top layer functions like
a standard body of freshwater. It’s safe for swimming and known mostly
for a plump and plentiful fish population that’s been the subject
of local fishing legends for centuries. But just 13 meters beneath that bounty
is a dense, sulfurous, oxygen-free pool lethal to any multicellular life forms,
fish included. In a typical lake, the entire
body of water would gradually mix, diffusing oxygen

**Transcript**:
In Jerusalem, on April 11th, 1961, Adolf Eichmann stood trial
for crimes against humanity. Eichmann had been a Nazi official
tasked with organizing the transport of over 1.5 million European Jews
to ghettos and concentration camps. He was popularly described
as an evil mastermind who orchestrated atrocities
from a cushy German office, and many were eager to see the so-called
“desk murderer” tried for his crimes. But the squeamish man who took the stand
seemed more like a dull bureaucrat than a sadistic killer. The disparity between Eichmann’s nature
and his actions was unsettling for many viewers, but for philosopher Hannah Arendt, this contradiction inspired
a disturbing revelation. Arendt was a German Jew who fled
her homeland in 1933 after being briefly imprisoned
by the German secret police. As a refugee in France
and then the United States, she dedicated herself to understanding
how the Nazi regime came to power, and more specifically,
how it inspired so many atrocities. A common opinion at the time was that
the Third Reich was a historical oddity; a perfect storm of uniquely evil leaders supported by German citizens
looking for revenge after their defeat in World War I. But Arendt believed the true conditions
behind this unprecedented rise of totalitarianism
weren’t specific to Germany. Throughout the 1950s, Arendt developed
a theory of the human condition that divided life into three facets: labor— in which we satisfy
our material needs and desires; work— in which we build the world’s
physical and cultural infrastructure; and action— in which we publicly
articulate our values to collectively shape the world around us. It was this last facet,
the life of action, that Arendt believed was under attack, both in Germany and many other
industrialized societies. She saw modernity as an age
ruled by labor, where individuals mainly appear
in the social world to produce and consume goods and services rather than share ideas
and shape communities. Arendt believed this had fostered
societies and ideologies where individuals were seen only
for their economic value, rather than their moral
and political capacities. She believed this isolated people from
their neighbors and their sense of self. And in her 1951 book,
“The Origins of Totalitarianism,” Arendt argued these conditions provided
fertile ground for totalitarian regimes, which use fear and violence
to increase isolation and make it dangerous to publicly engage
as freethinking political agents. In this lonely state,
participating in the regime becomes the only way to recover
a sense of identity and community. Arendt believed it was this
kind of environment where Eichmann committed his crimes. Most people expected
the Jewish German philosopher to judge the ex-Nazi harshly. But while she condemned
his monstrous actions, Arendt saw no evidence that Eichmann
himself was uniquely evil. She saw him as a distinctly ordinary man
who considered diligent obedience the highest form of civic duty. And for Arendt, it was exactly this
ordinariness that was most terrifying. Her point wasn't just that anyone
could do what Eichmann did, but that his story suggested
ordinary people could willingly accept
their societal role— even when it contributed to genocide. Arendt called this phenomenon
“the banality of evil,” and warned that it can emerge whenever
society inhibits our ability to think; or more specifically,
to question our beliefs and actions in a self-reflective internal dialogue. Arendt believed this kind of thinking is
the only way to confront moral problems, and that our responsibility
to self-reflect is especially important when independent thought is threatened. She acknowledged that critical thinking
in oppressive spaces is a defiant act that requires
personal courage. But it must be done regardless, which is why Arendt still held
Eichmann accountable. This thread runs throughout Arendt's work, where she continually insisted
that thinking was our greatest weapon against the threats of modernity. Namely, a relentless drive for economic
and technological development which would increase social alienation
and inhibit human freedom. To foster this essential value, Arendt believed we need to create
formal and informal forums that allowed for open conversations
about shaping our collective future. These might include townhall meetings,
self-governing workplaces, or student unions. But whatever shape they take, what’s most important to Arendt
is that they value open dialogue and critical self-reflection.

**Transcript**:
In Jerusalem, on April 11th, 1961, Adolf Eichmann stood trial
for crimes against humanity. Eichmann had been a Nazi official
tasked with organizing the transport of over 1.5 million European Jews
to ghettos and concentration camps. He was popularly described
as an evil mastermind who orchestrated atrocities
from a cushy German office, and many were eager to see the so-called
“desk murderer” tried for his crimes. But the squeamish man who took the stand
seemed more like a dull bureaucrat than a sadistic killer. The disparity between Eichmann’s nature
and his actions was unsettling for many viewers, but for philosopher Hannah Arendt, this contradiction inspired
a disturbing revelation. Arendt was a German Jew who fled
her homeland in 1933 after being briefly imprisoned
by the German secret police. As a refugee in France
and then the United States, she dedicated herself to understanding
how the Nazi regime came to power, and more specifically,
how it inspired so many atrocities. A common opinion at the time was that
the Third Reich was a historical oddity; a perfect storm of uniquely evil leaders supported by German citizens
looking for revenge after their defeat in World War I. But Arendt believed the true conditions
behind this unprecedented rise of totalitarianism
weren’t specific to Germany. Throughout the 1950s, Arendt developed
a theory of the human condition that divided life into three facets: labor— in which we satisfy
our material needs and desires; work— in which we build the world’s
physical and cultural infrastructure; and action— in which we publicly
articulate our values to collectively shape the world around us. It was this last facet,
the life of action, that Arendt believed was under attack, both in Germany and many other
industrialized societies. She saw modernity as an age
ruled by labor, where individuals mainly appear
in the social world to produce and consume goods and services rather than share ideas
and shape communities. Arendt believed this had fostered
societies and ideologies where individuals were seen only
for their economic value, rather than their moral
and political capacities. She believed this isolated people from
their neighbors and their sense of self. And in her 1951 book,
“The Origins of Totalitarianism,” Arendt argued these conditions provided
fertile ground for totalitarian regimes, which use fear and violence
to increase isolation and make it dangerous to publicly engage
as freethinking political agents. In this lonely state,
participating in the regime becomes the only way to recover
a sense of identity and community. Arendt believed it was this
kind of environment where Eichmann committed his crimes. Most people expected
the Jewish German philosopher to judge the ex-Nazi harshly. But while she condemned
his monstrous actions, Arendt saw no evidence that Eichmann
himself was uniquely evil. She saw him as a distinctly ordinary man
who considered diligent obedience the highest form of civic duty. And for Arendt, it was exactly this
ordinariness that was most terrifying. Her point wasn't just that anyone
could do what Eichmann did, but that his story suggested
ordinary people could willingly accept
their societal role— even when it contributed to genocide. Arendt called this phenomenon
“the banality of evil,” and warned that it can emerge whenever
society inhibits our ability to think; or more specifically,
to question our beliefs and actions in a self-reflective internal dialogue. Arendt believed this kind of thinking is
the only way to confront moral problems, and that our responsibility
to self-reflect is especially important when independent thought is threatened. She acknowledged that critical thinking
in oppressive spaces is a defiant act that requires
personal courage. But it must be done regardless, which is why Arendt still held
Eichmann accountable. This thread runs throughout Arendt's work, where she continually insisted
that thinking was our greatest weapon against the threats of modernity. Namely, a relentless drive for economic

**Transcript**:
Like so many winged insects, the world’s roughly 4,000 mayfly species
take to the skies for their annual reproductive ritual. These flights happen above every kind
of freshwater body on Earth, barring Antarctica
and a few remote islands. But whether the breeding mayflies
are large Hexagenia limbata, tiny Paracloeodes minutus,
or the thousands of species in between, their time on the wing will be brief. Very brief. For most mayflies,
adulthood lasts roughly one day. And for some species,
it’s only a matter of minutes. This isn’t because they’re all
eaten up by predators— though they are a favorite food
of many fish, birds, and larger insects. Rather, this abridged adulthood is
a natural part of their life cycle. A close look at these insects reveals
they've ditched functional mouths and digestive systems. Without these innards taking up space,
mayfly bodies can store more eggs, with some species producing
up to 12,000 per individual. This adaptation is essential
to mayfly survival since relatively few of these unborn flies
are likely to reach adulthood, and even fewer will successfully
reproduce themselves. In most of these flights,
male mayflies form dancing swarms, which female mayflies move
through until a male grasps them for some mid-air mating. Some all-female populations can
reproduce without joining in the dance, using a process called parthenogenesis
to produce viable offspring without the help of a male. And recent research suggests some mayfly
populations may even switch back and forth between these two forms of reproduction. But regardless of how the eggs
are made ready, the female will deposit them
on or under the water, and promptly perish. This might sound like a tragically
brief existence. And even mayflies’ scientific name, Ephemeroptera, refers to their
stunningly short lifespan. But for centuries, fishermen suspected
that mayflies live much longer than this short flight. And in 1681, scientists finally caught
up to their fishing friends with a published account
of the full mayfly life cycle. When the time is right,
these eggs will hatch. Depending on the kind of mayfly, this can happen as late as several months
after the egg is laid, or even before it’s completely left
the mother’s body. But whenever their egg opens up, the mayfly inside quickly finds
its way into fresh water, and it’s in this aquatic, nymph stage that mayflies spend
the majority of their lives. Inhabiting rivers, small streams,
ponds, lakes, and other places with clean fresh water, most mayfly species stay in this
nymph stage and feed underwater for nearly an entire year. In fact, some species live as nymphs
for up to two years before they metamorphose
into their winged adult state. A year is a long time for such
a small creature to stay alive. So to survive and thrive, mayfly species
have a wide variety of habits and corresponding body forms. Sprawlers are flat enough to stick
to surfaces despite the strength of a current, while clingers accomplish the same feat
with suckers and claws. Other species are swimmers,
crawlers, or borers. One of the most noticeable groups
are the burrowing mayflies; sizable specimens which use
their legs, tusks, and a scoop on their heads
to dig U-shaped tunnels. In these muddy dwellings,
the nymphs use their abdominal gills to accelerate water through their burrow,
filtering it for food along the way. After they metamorphose,
adult swarms can get so large they appear on weather radars like rain. Regardless of how they've adapted, each unique species plays
an essential role in their ecosystem. Plus, nearly all mayflies are a staple
of freshwater fish diets, and since they ingest the smallest
particulate matter in their environment, mayflies are also very sensitive
to water pollution. In fact, scientists can tell a lot
about a water body’s health based on which mayfly species they find. If they don't find mayflies at all, it's usually an indication
that something is wrong. So the next time you see a swarm
of mayflies over a pond, bridge, or park fountain, remember that their short aerial dance means a healthy world exists
below the surface.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Like so many winged insects, the world’s roughly 4,000 mayfly species
take to the skies for their annual reproductive ritual. These flights happen above every kind
of freshwater body on Earth, barring Antarctica
and a few remote islands. But whether the breeding mayflies
are large Hexagenia limbata, tiny Paracloeodes minutus,
or the thousands of species in between, their time on the wing will be brief. Very brief. For most mayflies,
adulthood lasts roughly one day. And for some species,
it’s only a matter of minutes. This isn’t because they’re all
eaten up by predators— though they are a favorite food
of many fish, birds, and larger insects. Rather, this abridged adulthood is
a natural part of their life cycle. A close look at these insects reveals
they've ditched functional mouths and digestive systems. Without these innards taking up space,
mayfly bodies can store more eggs, with some species producing
up to 12,000 per individual. This adaptation is essential
to mayfly survival since relatively few of these unborn flies
are likely to reach adulthood, and even fewer will successfully
reproduce themselves. In most of these flights,
male mayflies form dancing swarms, which female mayflies move
through until a male grasps them for some mid-air mating. Some all-female populations can
reproduce without joining in the dance, using a process called parthenogenesis
to produce viable offspring without the help of a male. And recent research suggests some mayfly
populations may even switch back and forth between these two forms of reproduction. But regardless of how the eggs
are made ready, the female will deposit them
on or under the water, and promptly perish. This might sound like a tragically
brief existence. And even mayflies’ scientific name, Ephemeroptera, refers to their
stunningly short lifespan. But for centuries, fishermen suspected
that mayflies live much longer than this short flight. And in 1681, scientists finally caught
up to their fishing friends with a published account
of the full mayfly life cycle. When the time is right,
these eggs will hatch. Depending on the kind of mayfly, this can happen as late as several months
after the egg is laid, or even before it’s completely left
the mother’s body. But whenever their egg opens up, the mayfly inside quickly finds
its way into fresh water, and it’s in this aquatic, nymph stage that mayflies spend
the majority of their lives. Inhabiting rivers, small streams,
ponds, lakes, and other places with clean fresh water, most mayfly species stay in this
nymph stage and feed underwater for nearly an entire year. In fact, some species live as nymphs
for up to two years before they metamorphose
into their winged adult state. A year is a long time for such
a small creature to stay alive. So to survive and thrive, mayfly species
have a wide variety of habits and corresponding body forms. Sprawlers are flat enough to stick
to surfaces despite the strength of a current, while clingers accomplish the same feat
with suckers and claws. Other species are swimmers,
crawlers, or borers. One of the most noticeable groups
are the burrowing mayflies; sizable specimens which use
their legs, tusks, and a scoop on their heads
to dig U-shaped tunnels. In these muddy dwellings,
the nymphs use their abdominal gills to accelerate water through their burrow,
filtering it for food along the way. After they metamorphose,
adult swarms can get so large they appear on weather radars like rain. Regardless of how they've adapted, each unique species plays
an essential role in their ecosystem. Plus, nearly all mayflies are a staple
of freshwater fish diets, and since they ingest the smallest
particulate matter in their environment, mayflies are also very sensitive
to water pollution. In fact, scientists can tell a lot
about a water body’s health based on which mayfly species they find. If they don't find mayflies at all, it's usually an indication
that something is wrong. So the next time you see a swarm
of mayflies over a pond, bridge, or park fountain, remember that their short aerial dance means a healthy world exists
below the surface.

**Transcript**:
What would make you happy? Can you imagine a milestone, a win,
or even a material possession that would unlock this feeling? In this animated version of
David Steindl-Rast’s popular TED Talk, Brother David explains how a simple
adjustment in how you move through the world might just change
what you see, how you feel, and how you act. Now my topic is gratefulness. What is the connection
between happiness and gratefulness? Many people would say, well,
that’s very easy. When you are happy, you’re grateful. But think again. Is it really the happy people
that are grateful? We all know quite a number of people
who have everything that it would take to be happy, and they are not happy,
because they want something else, or they want more of the same. And we all know people
who have lots of misfortune, misfortune that we ourselves
would not want to have, and they are deeply happy. They radiate happiness. You are surprised. Why? Because they are grateful. Now, we can ask, what really do we mean 
by gratefulness? And how does it work? Something’s given to us
that’s valuable to us. And it’s really given. These two things have to come together. It has to be something valuable,
and it's a real gift. And when these two things come together, then gratefulness spontaneously
rises in my heart, happiness spontaneously rises in my heart. That’s how gratefulness happens. Now, the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this
once in a while. We can be people who live gratefully. And how can we live gratefully? By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment
is a given moment, as we say. It’s a gift. You have no way of assuring that there
will be another moment given to you, and yet, that’s the most valuable thing
that can ever be given to us, this moment,
with all the opportunity that it contains. Does that mean that we can be grateful
for everything? Certainly not. We cannot be grateful for violence,
for war, for oppression, for exploitation. On the personal level, we cannot be grateful for the loss
of a friend, for unfaithfulness, for bereavement. But I didn’t say we can be grateful
for everything. I said we can be grateful in every
given moment for the opportunity, and even when we are confronted
with something that is terribly difficult, we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity
that is given to us. So how can each one of us find
a method for living gratefully, not just once in a while being grateful,
but moment by moment to be grateful? How can we do it? It’s a very simple method:
Stop. Look. Go. That’s all. But how often do we stop? We rush through life; we don’t stop. We miss the opportunity
because we don’t stop. We have to stop. We have to get quiet. And we have to build stop signs
into our lives. And when you stop, then the next thing
is to look. You look. You open your eyes.
You open your ears. You open your nose. You open all your senses for this
wonderful richness that is given to us. There is no end to it,
and that is what life is all about, to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us. And then we can also open our hearts,
our hearts for the opportunities, for the opportunities also to help others,
to make others happy, because nothing makes us more happy
than when all of us are happy. And when we open our hearts
to the opportunities, the opportunities invite us
to do something, and that is the third. Stop, look, and then go,
and really do something. And what we can do is whatever life offers
to you in that present moment. There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware
how important this is and how this can change our world, because if you’re grateful,
you’re not fearful. If you're not fearful, you're not violent. If you’re grateful, you act
out of a sense of enough and not of a sense of scarcity,
and you’re willing to share. If you're grateful, you are enjoying
the differences between people and you are respectful to everybody. And that changes this power pyramid
under which we live. What we need is a networking
of smaller groups, smaller and smaller groups
who know one another, who interact with one another, and that is a grateful world.

**Transcript**:
You might think of gas masks as
clunky, spooky, military-looking devices only found in spy movies
or World War I museums. But you probably already own a mask
that uses remarkably similar technology. And in the near future, we may
need to rely on these filters as part of our everyday lives. In addition to emerging diseases, wildfire frequency has more than tripled
from 1996 to 2021. As fires burn longer and cover more land,
their smoke affects more people each year. Climate change is also causing
more hot, sunny days, which accelerates the production
of toxic ground level ozone. So, how do these masks work, and can they protect us from new
and old airborne threats? Well, the first rule of filters is
making sure you have a tight seal. Without that, even the best mask
in the world is useless. So assuming your mask is on tight, this technology can capture pollutants
in one of two ways: filtering them out by size or
attracting specific chemical compounds. For an example of the first approach,
let’s look at wildfire smoke. When forests burn, they generate
a wide variety of chemicals. At close range, there are so many
different pollutants at such high concentrations
that no filter could help you— this is why firefighters travel
with their own air supply. But further away,
the situation is different. While there's still a range of chemicals, they’ve mostly aggregated into tiny solid
or liquid particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter. This particulate matter is much of what
you're seeing and smelling in smoke, and it's especially dangerous
for children, the elderly, and those with respiratory
or cardiovascular diseases. Luckily, the majority of these
particulates are still large enough to be captured by the most basic filters, which are made of polypropylene 
or glass strands roughly 1/10 the width of a human hair. Under a microscope,
they look like a thick forest, and at this scale, these branches
have a special property. Typically, when you use a sieve, you’re filtering out objects
larger than the sieve’s holes. But these polypropylene branches
can catch particles much smaller than the gaps between them. That’s because, when a particle
collides with a thread, van der Waals forces cause it to stick
as if it were made of Velcro. Plus, size-based filters can use
electrically charged fibers that attract particles not already
on a collision course. This is how even a simple N95 mask can
catch at least 95% of particulate matter. And why an N100 mask or an air purifier with a high efficiency
particulate air filter can catch at least 99.97% of particulates. With a tight seal, this level of protection will
filter out most airborne pollution. Unfortunately, some pollutants are still
too small for this approach, including ozone molecules. These are barely bigger than the oxygen
that we need to breathe and exposure is associated with asthma,
respiratory conditions, and even premature death. Our best chance to filter them
are activated carbon masks. At the microscopic level, activated carbon
looks like a vast black honeycomb, and it's highly microporous structure
can trap tiny ozone molecules. But this material still needs help
to capture other pollutants like hydrogen sulfide, chlorine,
and ammonia. For these threats, we need to combine
the activated carbon with some simple chemistry. If the pollutant is acidic, we can infuse
the filter with a basic chemical. Then when the two meet, they react,
and the gas is trapped. Similarly, we can use acids
to trap basic pollutants. Even with the right mask, it's still smart
to check air quality indicators and to stay indoors
when the threat level is high. And just like a mask, you'll want to make
sure your house is well sealed. You can do this by closing windows,
turning off fans that vent outside, and using HEPA filter equipped
air purifiers or their cheaper, DIY cousin,
the Corsi-Rosenthal box. Following these guidelines can help
us breathe easy as we work on preventing these pollutants
in the first place.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You might think of gas masks as
clunky, spooky, military-looking devices only found in spy movies
or World War I museums. But you probably already own a mask
that uses remarkably similar technology. And in the near future, we may
need to rely on these filters as part of our everyday lives. In addition to emerging diseases, wildfire frequency has more than tripled
from 1996 to 2021. As fires burn longer and cover more land,
their smoke affects more people each year. Climate change is also causing
more hot, sunny days, which accelerates the production
of toxic ground level ozone. So, how do these masks work, and can they protect us from new
and old airborne threats? Well, the first rule of filters is
making sure you have a tight seal. Without that, even the best mask
in the world is useless. So assuming your mask is on tight, this technology can capture pollutants
in one of two ways: filtering them out by size or
attracting specific chemical compounds. For an example of the first approach,
let’s look at wildfire smoke. When forests burn, they generate
a wide variety of chemicals. At close range, there are so many
different pollutants at such high concentrations
that no filter could help you— this is why firefighters travel
with their own air supply. But further away,
the situation is different. While there's still a range of chemicals, they’ve mostly aggregated into tiny solid
or liquid particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter. This particulate matter is much of what
you're seeing and smelling in smoke, and it's especially dangerous
for children, the elderly, and those with respiratory
or cardiovascular diseases. Luckily, the majority of these
particulates are still large enough to be captured by the most basic filters, which are made of polypropylene 
or glass strands roughly 1/10 the width of a human hair. Under a microscope,

**Transcript**:
During an important calendrical
celebration in 889 CE, Lord K’ak’ Upakal may have sat
atop his ornate palace and observed the bustling hub
he’d helped Chichen Itza become. The Maya city’s golden age would outlast
K’ak’ Upakal’s own life, but he couldn’t have known
the crises that lay ahead. A century before, warfare and failing
agriculture forced Maya people to abandon numerous
Central American settlements. This shifted the center
of their civilization north, to hotter, drier Yucatan. During the early 800s, cities like Chichen Itza, Izamal,
and Uxmal expanded. But Yucatan presented its own challenges. Surface water was scarce and the region’s limestone bedrock
rapidly absorbed rain. This forced many Yucatecan cities
to collect rainwater in cisterns. But the land surrounding Chichen Itza
is pocked with sinkholes, where collapsed bedrock reveals an
abundant supply of fresh groundwater. Because of this freshwater access, when
drought seized Yucatan in the early 900s, Chichen Itza survived to become
the most powerful Maya city. People immigrated from hundreds
of kilometers away, and, at its height, Chichen Itza’s
population possibly reached 50,000. The city came to reflect a diverse
international culture in all spheres of life. Its challenge then became sustaining
a large population in an unpredictable environment. During the 10th century,
following K’ak’ Upakal’s death, Chichen Itza’s government shifted
from a focus solely on the king to a more flexible system that also included ruling councils
of the city’s elite. Unlike traditional Maya kings, who reinforced their legitimacy with
destructive wars and costly monuments, the new rulers focused largely
on economic growth. They channeled the city’s military might
into establishing long-distance trade and political dominance. Merchant-warriors traveled from
coastal ports and captured valuable goods. Using obsidian, gold, copper,
turquoise, and jade from various parts
of Central and North America, Chichen Itza’s inhabitants crafted
sharp tools and precious ornaments. They traded food, textiles, feathers,
minerals, and metals, sometimes using cacao beans as currency. And they transported seafood
from the coast to supplement the city’s locally grown
staple crops. Farming was essential
to Chichen Itza’s survival. The city’s architecture and religious
practices reflected this importance by keeping track of time,
the transit of celestial bodies, and agricultural cycles. As the city grew, its citizens built
a vast platform to support new temples, pyramids, altars,
ballcourts, and colonnades. Builders carefully aligned a round temple
to mark solstices, equinoxes, and the passing of the planet Venus, an avatar of K’uk’ulkan,
the feathered serpent god. K’uk’ulkan became Chichen Itza’s
central deity, and his worship transformed the city
into a center of religious pilgrimage. Architects designed a stepped pyramid
and temple dedicated to K’uk’ulkan that towers 30 meters high, and features four stairs
with a total of 365 steps, each representing a day in the solar year. It’s oriented so that,
around each equinox, the setting sun creates snake-like shadows
that slither down the balustrades, evoking the serpent god. Several buildings feature representations
of Flower Mountain, the sacred paradise realm inhabited
by gods and ancestors. And rulers from far and wide were inaugurated
at Chichen Itza’s Great Ballcourt under the auspices of K’uk’ulkan and in the presence
of thousands of spectators. However, Chichen Itza’s
golden age wouldn’t last forever. Around 1020 CE, an intense drought hit
and lasted nearly a century. In an effort to end the disaster, people made offerings to rain deities
in nearby caves and sinkholes, which were seen as entrances to the
watery underworld realm of the gods. Despite Chichen Itza’s natural advantages
and the ingenuity of its people, the city couldn't support itself
through this extended drought. Population plummeted
during the 11th century, and many people resettled on the coast. At the end of the drought, the new city of Mayapan emerged and replaced Chichen Itza
as the principal city of Yucatan. Yet, Chichen Itza was never fully
abandoned or forgotten. When the Spanish arrived centuries later, it was still a small, local capital
of a Maya province. Chichen Itza’s original name
was preserved, and its ancient stone constructions
were still standing, as they do to this day.

**Transcript**:
During an important calendrical
celebration in 889 CE, Lord K’ak’ Upakal may have sat
atop his ornate palace and observed the bustling hub
he’d helped Chichen Itza become. The Maya city’s golden age would outlast
K’ak’ Upakal’s own life, but he couldn’t have known
the crises that lay ahead. A century before, warfare and failing
agriculture forced Maya people to abandon numerous
Central American settlements. This shifted the center
of their civilization north, to hotter, drier Yucatan. During the early 800s, cities like Chichen Itza, Izamal,
and Uxmal expanded. But Yucatan presented its own challenges. Surface water was scarce and the region’s limestone bedrock
rapidly absorbed rain. This forced many Yucatecan cities
to collect rainwater in cisterns. But the land surrounding Chichen Itza
is pocked with sinkholes, where collapsed bedrock reveals an
abundant supply of fresh groundwater. Because of this freshwater access, when
drought seized Yucatan in the early 900s, Chichen Itza survived to become
the most powerful Maya city. People immigrated from hundreds
of kilometers away, and, at its height, Chichen Itza’s
population possibly reached 50,000. The city came to reflect a diverse
international culture in all spheres of life. Its challenge then became sustaining
a large population in an unpredictable environment. During the 10th century,
following K’ak’ Upakal’s death, Chichen Itza’s government shifted
from a focus solely on the king to a more flexible system that also included ruling councils
of the city’s elite. Unlike traditional Maya kings, who reinforced their legitimacy with
destructive wars and costly monuments, the new rulers focused largely
on economic growth. They channeled the city’s military might
into establishing long-distance trade and political dominance. Merchant-warriors traveled from
coastal ports and captured valuable goods. Using obsidian, gold, copper,
turquoise, and jade from various parts
of Central and North America, Chichen Itza’s inhabitants crafted
sharp tools and precious ornaments. They traded food, textiles, feathers,
minerals, and metals, sometimes using cacao beans as currency. And they transported seafood
from the coast to supplement the city’s locally grown
staple crops. Farming was essential
to Chichen Itza’s survival. The city’s architecture and religious
practices reflected this importance by keeping track of time,
the transit of celestial bodies, and agricultural cycles. As the city grew, its citizens built
a vast platform to support new temples, pyramids, altars,
ballcourts, and colonnades. Builders carefully aligned a round temple
to mark solstices, equinoxes, and the passing of the planet Venus, an avatar of K’uk’ulkan,
the feathered serpent god. K’uk’ulkan became Chichen Itza’s
central deity, and his worship transformed the city
into a center of religious pilgrimage. Architects designed a stepped pyramid
and temple dedicated to K’uk’ulkan that towers 30 meters high, and features four stairs
with a total of 365 steps, each representing a day in the solar year. It’s oriented so that,
around each equinox, the setting sun creates snake-like shadows
that slither down the balustrades, evoking the serpent god. Several buildings feature representations
of Flower Mountain, the sacred paradise realm inhabited
by gods and ancestors. And rulers from far and wide were inaugurated
at Chichen Itza’s Great Ballcourt under the auspices of K’uk’ulkan and in the presence
of thousands of spectators. However, Chichen Itza’s
golden age wouldn’t last forever. Around 1020 CE, an intense drought hit
and lasted nearly a century. In an effort to end the disaster, people made offerings to rain deities
in nearby caves and sinkholes, which were seen as entrances to the
watery underworld realm of the gods. Despite Chichen Itza’s natural advantages
and the ingenuity of its people, the city couldn't support itself
through this extended drought. Population plummeted
during the 11th century, and many people resettled on the coast. At the end of the drought, the new city of Mayapan emerged and replaced Chichen Itza
as the principal city of Yucatan. Yet, Chichen Itza was never fully
abandoned or forgotten. When the Spanish arrived centuries later, it was still a small, local capital
of a Maya province. Chichen Itza’s original name
was preserved, and its ancient stone constructions
were still standing, as they do to this day.

**Transcript**:
Consider this mathematician, with her standard-issue infinitely sharp
knife and a perfect ball. She frantically slices and distributes
the ball into an infinite number of boxes. She then recombines the parts
into five precise sections. Gently moving and rotating
these sections around, seemingly impossibly, she recombines them
to form two identical, flawless, and complete copies
of the original ball. This is a result known in mathematics
as the Banach-Tarski paradox. The paradox here is not
in the logic or the proof— which are, like the balls, flawless— but instead in the tension
between mathematics and our own experience of reality. And in this tension lives some beautiful
and fundamental truths about what mathematics actually is. We’ll come back to that in a moment,
but first, we need to examine the foundation
of every mathematical system: axioms. Every mathematical system
is built and advanced by using logic to reach new conclusions. But logic can’t be applied to nothing; we have to start with some basic
statements, called axioms, that we declare to be true,
and make deductions from there. Often these match our intuition
for how the world works— for instance, that adding zero to a number
has no effect is an axiom. If the goal of mathematics is to build
a house, axioms form its foundation— the first thing that’s laid down,
that supports everything else. Where things get interesting is that
by laying a slightly different foundation, you can get a vastly different
but equally sound structure. For example, when Euclid laid
his foundations for geometry, one of his axioms implied that given
a line and a point off the line, only one parallel line exists
going through that point. But later mathematicians, wanting to see if geometry was
still possible without this axiom, produced spherical
and hyperbolic geometry. Each valid, logically sound,
and useful in different contexts. One axiom common in modern mathematics
is the Axiom of Choice. It typically comes into play in proofs
that require choosing elements from sets— which we’ll grossly simplify
to marbles in boxes. For our choices to be valid,
they need to be consistent, meaning if we approach a box,
choose a marble, and then go back in time and choose again,
we'd know how to find the same marble. If we have a finite number of boxes,
that’s easy. It’s even straightforward
when there are infinite boxes if each contains a marble that’s readily
distinguishable from the others. It’s when there are infinite boxes
with indistinguishable marbles that we have trouble. But in these scenarios, the Axiom of Choice lets us summon
a mysterious omniscient chooser that will always select the same marbles— without us having to know anything
about how those choices are made. Our stab-happy mathematician,
following Banach and Tarski’s proof, reaches a step in constructing
the five sections where she has infinitely many boxes
filled with indistinguishable parts. So she needs the Axiom of Choice
to make their construction possible. If the Axiom of Choice can lead
to such a counterintuitive result, should we just reject it? Mathematicians today say no, because it’s load-bearing for a lot
of important results in mathematics. Fields like measure theory
and functional analysis, which are crucial
for statistics and physics, are built upon the Axiom of Choice. While it leads to some
impractical results, it also leads to extremely practical ones. Fortunately, just as Euclidean geometry
exists alongside hyperbolic geometry, mathematics with the Axiom of Choice
coexists with mathematics without it. The question for many mathematicians
isn’t whether the Axiom of Choice, or for that matter any given axiom,
is right or not, but whether it’s right
for what you’re trying to do. The fate of the Banach-Tarski paradox
lies in this choice. This is the freedom mathematics gives us. Not only is it a way to model
our physical universe using the axioms we intuit
from our daily experiences, but a way to venture into abstract
mathematical universes and explore arcane geometries and laws
unlike anything we can ever experience. If we ever meet aliens, axioms which seem
absurd and incomprehensible to us might be everyday common sense to them. To investigate, we might start by handing
them an infinitely sharp knife and a perfect ball, and see what they do.

for how the world works— for instance, that adding zero to a number
has no effect is an axiom. If the goal of mathematics is to build
a house, axioms form its foundation— the first thing that’s laid down,
that supports everything else. Where things get interesting is that
by laying a slightly different foundation, you can get a vastly different
but equally sound structure. For example, when Euclid laid
his foundations for geometry, one of his axioms implied that given
a line and a point off the line, only one parallel line exists
going through that point. But later mathematicians, wanting to see if geometry was
still possible without this axiom, produced spherical
and hyperbolic geometry. Each valid, logically sound,
and useful in different contexts. One axiom common in modern mathematics
is the Axiom of Choice. It typically comes into play in proofs
that require choosing elements from sets— which we’ll grossly simplify
to marbles in boxes. For our choices to be valid,
they need to be consistent, meaning if we approach a box,
choose a marble, and then go back in time and choose again,
we'd know how to find the same marble. If we have a finite number of boxes,
that’s easy. It’s even straightforward
when there are infinite boxes if each contains a marble that’s readily
distinguishable from the others. It’s when there are infinite boxes
with indistinguishable marbles that we have trouble. But in these scenarios, the Axiom of Choice lets us summon
a mysterious omniscient chooser that will always select the same marbles— without us having to know anything
about how those choices are made. Our stab-happy mathematician,
following Banach and Tarski’s proof, reaches a step in constructing
the five sections where she has infinitely many boxes
filled with indistinguishable parts. So she needs the Axiom of Choice
to make their construction possible. If the Axiom of Choice can lead
to such a counterintuitive result, should we just reject it? Mathematicians today say no, because it’s load-bearing for a lot
of important results in mathematics. Fields like measure theory
and functional analysis, which are crucial
for statistics and physics, are built upon the Axiom of Choice. While it leads to some
impractical results, it also leads to extremely practical ones. Fortunately, just as Euclidean geometry
exists alongside hyperbolic geometry, mathematics with the Axiom of Choice
coexists with mathematics without it. The question for many mathematicians
isn’t whether the Axiom of Choice, or for that matter any given axiom,
is right or not, but whether it’s right
for what you’re trying to do. The fate of the Banach-Tarski paradox
lies in this choice. This is the freedom mathematics gives us. Not only is it a way to model
our physical universe using the axioms we intuit
from our daily experiences, but a way to venture into abstract
mathematical universes and explore arcane geometries and laws
unlike anything we can ever experience. If we ever meet aliens, axioms which seem
absurd and incomprehensible to us might be everyday common sense to them. To investigate, we might start by handing
them an infinitely sharp knife and a perfect ball, and see what they do.

**Transcript**:
Consider this mathematician, with her standard-issue infinitely sharp
knife and a perfect ball. She frantically slices and distributes
the ball into an infinite number of boxes. She then recombines the parts
into five precise sections. Gently moving and rotating
these sections around, seemingly impossibly, she recombines them
to form two identical, flawless, and complete copies
of the original ball. This is a result known in mathematics
as the Banach-Tarski paradox. The paradox here is not
in the logic or the proof— which are, like the balls, flawless— but instead in the tension
between mathematics and our own experience of reality. And in this tension lives some beautiful
and fundamental truths about what mathematics actually is. We’ll come back to that in a moment,
but first, we need to examine the foundation
of every mathematical system: axioms. Every mathematical system
is built and advanced by using logic to reach new conclusions. But logic can’t be applied to nothing; we have to start with some basic
statements, called axioms, that we declare to be true,
and make deductions from there. Often these match our intuition
for how the world works— for instance, that adding zero to a number
has no effect is an axiom. If the goal of mathematics is to build

**Transcript**:
Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean, no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it. It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden, but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost. I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us, and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost -- actually, we've taken, we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying, but it really should concern you. It does concern you, as well. I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child," asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time. Well, now is that time. I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and, in so doing, secure hope for humankind. Health to the ocean means health for us. And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. And I hope, Jill, that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet. (Laughter) Did I say that? I guess I did. For me, as a scientist, it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba. It's when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter. I actually love diving at night; you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime. Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970, when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time -- at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon. In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim. It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down. It's one of my favorite bathing suits. Since then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea. I led a five-year National Geographic expedition, the Sustainable Seas expeditions, using these little subs. They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it. And I'm living proof. Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature -- all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea. I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system." We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. The poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love; none without water." Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean. No blue, no green. If you think the ocean isn't important, imagine Earth without it. Mars comes to mind. No ocean, no life support system. I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said, "There it is! The World Bank!" That's where all the assets are! And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment. With every drop of water you drink, every breath you take, you're connected to the sea. No matter where on Earth you live. Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea. Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there, mostly by microbes. The ocean drives climate and weather, stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry. Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain, sleet and snow, and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world, maybe in the universe. No water, no life; no blue, no green. Yet we have this idea, we humans, that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies -- are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it. That may have been true 10,000 years ago, and maybe even 1,000 years ago but in the last 100, especially in the last 50, we've drawn down the assets, the air, the water, the wildlife that make our lives possible. New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature; the nature of what's happening, showing us our impact on the Earth. I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem. And fortunately, in our time, we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history. And with knowing comes caring. And with caring, there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us. But first we have to know. Three years ago, I met John Hanke, who's the head of Google Earth, and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously. But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it? You did a great job with the land, the dirt. What about the water?" Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers, with DOER Marine, with National Geographic, with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world, ones that we could enlist, to put the ocean in Google Earth. And as of just this week, last Monday, Google Earth is now whole. Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center, we can find the nearby aquarium, we can look at where we're sitting, and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean, and California's four national marine sanctuaries, and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands: not just the little bit that pokes through the surface, but also what's below. To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! -- right there, ha -- under the ocean, see what the whales see. We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands. We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales. These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater. There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale. We can pick up and fly to the deepest place: seven miles down, the Mariana Trench, where only two people have ever been. Imagine that. It's only seven miles, but only two people have been there, 49 years ago. One-way trips are easy. We need new deep-diving submarines. How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration? We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains, and understand life in the deep sea. We can now go to the Arctic. Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole. An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century. That's bad news for the polar bears. That's bad news for us too. Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming, it's also changing ocean chemistry, making the sea more acidic. That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton. Also it's bad news for us. We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea. Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets, gear that continues to kill. We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system, and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife, all carbon-based units. Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup, undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the oxygen cycle, the water cycle -- our life support system. We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead. All of these parts are part of our life support system. We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more. Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers, taking everything in their path. Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system, leaving plumes of death in their path. The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi, or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail, whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost. For every pound that goes to market, more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds, may be thrown away as bycatch. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000. The highest concentrations are in red. In my lifetime, imagine, 90 percent of the big fish have been killed. Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales are way down in numbers. But, there is good news. Ten percent of the big fish still remain. There are still some blue whales. There are still some krill in Antarctica. There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay. Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape, a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet. There's still time, but not a lot, to turn things around. But business as usual means that in 50 years, there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone. Imagine the ocean without fish. Imagine what that means to our life support system. Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too, but the problems are more obvious, and some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife. And in 1872, with Yellowstone National Park, the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had. About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected: safeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink, generating oxygen, protecting watersheds. And, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea, National Marine Sanctuaries. That's another great idea. The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world, that have some kind of protection. And you can find them on Google Earth. The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them. In the last three years, for example, the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments. But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally. Protected areas do rebound, but it takes a long time to restore 50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass, or 200-year-old orange roughy. We don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens. Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life, will live not just as a list, a photograph, or a paragraph. With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever -- to search out hope spots, and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future. Such as the Arctic -- we have one chance, right now, to get it right. Or the Antarctic, where the continent is protected, but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish. Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows. 97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected, but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing. It's true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble. The high seas, where whales, tuna and dolphins travel -- the largest, least protected, ecosystem on Earth, filled with luminous creatures, living in dark waters that average two miles deep. They flash, and sparkle, and glow with their own living light. There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child. The next 10 years may be the most important, and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life. To cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power. We need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease. We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place. But, nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean. Our fate and the ocean's are one. We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above. A global plan of action with a world conservation union, the IUCN, is underway to protect biodiversity, to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change, on the high seas and in coastal areas, wherever we can identify critical places. New technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see. The goal is to protect biodiversity, to provide stability and resilience. We need deep-diving subs, new technologies to explore the ocean. We need, maybe, an expedition -- a TED at sea -- that could help figure out the next steps. And so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is. I wish you would use all means at your disposal -- films, expeditions, the web, new submarines -- and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas -- hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean, the blue heart of the planet. How much? Some say 10 percent, some say 30 percent. You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect? Whatever it is, a fraction of one percent is not enough. My wish is a big wish, but if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world, and help ensure the survival of what actually -- as it turns out -- is my favorite species; that would be us. For the children of today, for tomorrow's child: as never again, now is the time. Thank you. (Applause)

I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child," asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time. Well, now is that time. I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and, in so doing, secure hope for humankind. Health to the ocean means health for us. And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. And I hope, Jill, that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet. (Laughter) Did I say that? I guess I did. For me, as a scientist, it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba. It's when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter. I actually love diving at night; you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime. Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970, when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time -- at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon. In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim. It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down. It's one of my favorite bathing suits. Since then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea. I led a five-year National Geographic expedition, the Sustainable Seas expeditions, using these little subs. They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it. And I'm living proof. Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature -- all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea. I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system." We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. The poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love; none without water." Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean. No blue, no green. If you think the ocean isn't important, imagine Earth without it. Mars comes to mind. No ocean, no life support system. I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said, "There it is! The World Bank!" That's where all the assets are! And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment. With every drop of water you drink, every breath you take, you're connected to the sea. No matter where on Earth you live. Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea. Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there, mostly by microbes. The ocean drives climate and weather, stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry. Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain, sleet and snow, and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world, maybe in the universe. No water, no life; no blue, no green. Yet we have this idea, we humans, that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies -- are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it. That may have been true 10,000 years ago, and maybe even 1,000 years ago but in the last 100, especially in the last 50, we've drawn down the assets, the air, the water, the wildlife that make our lives possible. New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature; the nature of what's happening, showing us our impact on the Earth. I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem. And fortunately, in our time, we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history. And with knowing comes caring. And with caring, there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us. But first we have to know. Three years ago, I met John Hanke, who's the head of Google Earth, and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously. But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it? You did a great job with the land, the dirt. What about the water?" Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers, with DOER Marine, with National Geographic, with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world, ones that we could enlist, to put the ocean in Google Earth. And as of just this week, last Monday, Google Earth is now whole. Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center, we can find the nearby aquarium, we can look at where we're sitting, and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean, and California's four national marine sanctuaries, and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands: not just the little bit that pokes through the surface, but also what's below. To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! -- right there, ha -- under the ocean, see what the whales see. We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands. We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales. These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater. There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale. We can pick up and fly to the deepest place: seven miles down, the Mariana Trench, where only two people have ever been. Imagine that. It's only seven miles, but only two people have been there, 49 years ago. One-way trips are easy. We need new deep-diving submarines. How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration? We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains, and understand life in the deep sea. We can now go to the Arctic. Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole. An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century. That's bad news for the polar bears. That's bad news for us too. Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming, it's also changing ocean chemistry, making the sea more acidic. That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton. Also it's bad news for us. We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea. Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets, gear that continues to kill. We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system, and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife, all carbon-based units. Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup, undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the oxygen cycle, the water cycle -- our life support system. We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead. All of these parts are part of our life support system. We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more. Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers, taking everything in their path. Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system, leaving plumes of death in their path. The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi, or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail, whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost. For every pound that goes to market, more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds, may be thrown away as bycatch. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000. The highest concentrations are in red. In my lifetime, imagine, 90 percent of the big fish have been killed. Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales are way down in numbers. But, there is good news. Ten percent of the big fish still remain. There are still some blue whales. There are still some krill in Antarctica. There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay. Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape, a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet. There's still time, but not a lot, to turn things around. But business as usual means that in 50 years, there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone. Imagine the ocean without fish. Imagine what that means to our life support system. Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too, but the problems are more obvious, and some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife. And in 1872, with Yellowstone National Park, the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had. About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected: safeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink, generating oxygen, protecting watersheds. And, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea, National Marine Sanctuaries. That's another great idea. The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world, that have some kind of protection. And you can find them on Google Earth. The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them. In the last three years, for example, the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments. But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally. Protected areas do rebound, but it takes a long time to restore 50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass, or 200-year-old orange roughy. We don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens. Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life, will live not just as a list, a photograph, or a paragraph. With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever -- to search out hope spots, and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future. Such as the Arctic -- we have one chance, right now, to get it right. Or the Antarctic, where the continent is protected, but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish. Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows. 97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected, but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing. It's true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble. The high seas, where whales, tuna and dolphins travel -- the largest, least protected, ecosystem on Earth, filled with luminous creatures, living in dark waters that average two miles deep. They flash, and sparkle, and glow with their own living light. There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child. The next 10 years may be the most important, and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life. To cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power. We need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease. We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place. But, nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean. Our fate and the ocean's are one. We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above. A global plan of action with a world conservation union, the IUCN, is underway to protect biodiversity, to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change, on the high seas and in coastal areas, wherever we can identify critical places. New technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see. The goal is to protect biodiversity, to provide stability and resilience. We need deep-diving subs, new technologies to explore the ocean. We need, maybe, an expedition -- a TED at sea -- that could help figure out the next steps. And so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is. I wish you would use all means at your disposal -- films, expeditions, the web, new submarines -- and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas -- hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean, the blue heart of the planet. How much? Some say 10 percent, some say 30 percent. You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect? Whatever it is, a fraction of one percent is not enough. My wish is a big wish, but if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world, and help ensure the survival of what actually -- as it turns out -- is my favorite species; that would be us. For the children of today, for tomorrow's child: as never again, now is the time. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean, no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it. It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden, but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost. I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us, and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost -- actually, we've taken, we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying, but it really should concern you. It does concern you, as well. I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child," asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time. Well, now is that time. I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and, in so doing, secure hope for humankind. Health to the ocean means health for us. And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. And I hope, Jill, that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet. (Laughter) Did I say that? I guess I did. For me, as a scientist, it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba. It's when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter. I actually love diving at night; you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime. Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970, when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time -- at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon. In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim. It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down. It's one of my favorite bathing suits. Since then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea. I led a five-year National Geographic expedition, the Sustainable Seas expeditions, using these little subs. They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it. And I'm living proof. Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature -- all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea. I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system." We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. The poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love; none without water." Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean. No blue, no green. If you think the ocean isn't important, imagine Earth without it. Mars comes to mind. No ocean, no life support system. I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said, "There it is! The World Bank!" That's where all the assets are! And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment. With every drop of water you drink, every breath you take, you're connected to the sea. No matter where on Earth you live. Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea. Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there, mostly by microbes. The ocean drives climate and weather, stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry.

And with caring, there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us. But first we have to know. Three years ago, I met John Hanke, who's the head of Google Earth, and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously. But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it? You did a great job with the land, the dirt. What about the water?" Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers, with DOER Marine, with National Geographic, with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world, ones that we could enlist, to put the ocean in Google Earth. And as of just this week, last Monday, Google Earth is now whole. Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center, we can find the nearby aquarium, we can look at where we're sitting, and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean, and California's four national marine sanctuaries, and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands: not just the little bit that pokes through the surface, but also what's below. To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! -- right there, ha -- under the ocean, see what the whales see. We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands. We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales. These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater. There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale. We can pick up and fly to the deepest place: seven miles down, the Mariana Trench, where only two people have ever been. Imagine that. It's only seven miles, but only two people have been there, 49 years ago. One-way trips are easy. We need new deep-diving submarines. How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration? We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains, and understand life in the deep sea. We can now go to the Arctic. Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole. An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century. That's bad news for the polar bears. That's bad news for us too. Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming, it's also changing ocean chemistry, making the sea more acidic. That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton.

Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system, leaving plumes of death in their path. The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi, or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail, whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost. For every pound that goes to market, more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds, may be thrown away as bycatch. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000. The highest concentrations are in red. In my lifetime, imagine, 90 percent of the big fish have been killed. Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales are way down in numbers.

**Transcript**:
Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean, no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it. It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden, but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost. I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us, and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost -- actually, we've taken, we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying, but it really should concern you. It does concern you, as well. I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child," asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time. Well, now is that time. I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and, in so doing, secure hope for humankind. Health to the ocean means health for us. And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. And I hope, Jill, that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet. (Laughter) Did I say that? I guess I did. For me, as a scientist, it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba. It's when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter. I actually love diving at night; you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime. Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970, when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time -- at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon. In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim. It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down. It's one of my favorite bathing suits. Since then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea. I led a five-year National Geographic expedition, the Sustainable Seas expeditions, using these little subs. They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it. And I'm living proof. Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature -- all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea. I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system." We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. The poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love; none without water." Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean. No blue, no green. If you think the ocean isn't important, imagine Earth without it. Mars comes to mind. No ocean, no life support system. I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said, "There it is! The World Bank!" That's where all the assets are! And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment. With every drop of water you drink, every breath you take, you're connected to the sea. No matter where on Earth you live. Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea. Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there, mostly by microbes. The ocean drives climate and weather, stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry. Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain, sleet and snow, and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world, maybe in the universe. No water, no life; no blue, no green. Yet we have this idea, we humans, that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies -- are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it. That may have been true 10,000 years ago, and maybe even 1,000 years ago but in the last 100, especially in the last 50, we've drawn down the assets, the air, the water, the wildlife that make our lives possible. New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature; the nature of what's happening, showing us our impact on the Earth. I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem. And fortunately, in our time, we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history. And with knowing comes caring. And with caring, there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us. But first we have to know. Three years ago, I met John Hanke, who's the head of Google Earth, and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously. But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it? You did a great job with the land, the dirt. What about the water?" Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers, with DOER Marine, with National Geographic, with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world, ones that we could enlist, to put the ocean in Google Earth. And as of just this week, last Monday, Google Earth is now whole. Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center, we can find the nearby aquarium, we can look at where we're sitting, and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean, and California's four national marine sanctuaries, and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands: not just the little bit that pokes through the surface, but also what's below. To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! -- right there, ha -- under the ocean, see what the whales see. We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands. We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales. These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater. There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale. We can pick up and fly to the deepest place: seven miles down, the Mariana Trench, where only two people have ever been. Imagine that. It's only seven miles, but only two people have been there, 49 years ago. One-way trips are easy. We need new deep-diving submarines. How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration? We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains, and understand life in the deep sea. We can now go to the Arctic. Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole. An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century. That's bad news for the polar bears. That's bad news for us too. Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming, it's also changing ocean chemistry, making the sea more acidic. That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton. Also it's bad news for us. We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea. Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets, gear that continues to kill. We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system, and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife, all carbon-based units. Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup, undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the oxygen cycle, the water cycle -- our life support system. We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead. All of these parts are part of our life support system. We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more. Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers, taking everything in their path. Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system, leaving plumes of death in their path. The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi, or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail, whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost. For every pound that goes to market, more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds, may be thrown away as bycatch. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000. The highest concentrations are in red. In my lifetime, imagine, 90 percent of the big fish have been killed. Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales are way down in numbers. But, there is good news. Ten percent of the big fish still remain. There are still some blue whales. There are still some krill in Antarctica. There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay. Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape, a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet. There's still time, but not a lot, to turn things around. But business as usual means that in 50 years, there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone. Imagine the ocean without fish. Imagine what that means to our life support system. Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too, but the problems are more obvious, and some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife. And in 1872, with Yellowstone National Park, the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had. About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected: safeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink, generating oxygen, protecting watersheds. And, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea, National Marine Sanctuaries. That's another great idea. The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world, that have some kind of protection. And you can find them on Google Earth. The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them. In the last three years, for example, the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments. But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally. Protected areas do rebound, but it takes a long time to restore 50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass, or 200-year-old orange roughy. We don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens. Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life, will live not just as a list, a photograph, or a paragraph. With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever -- to search out hope spots, and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future. Such as the Arctic -- we have one chance, right now, to get it right. Or the Antarctic, where the continent is protected, but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish. Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows. 97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected, but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing. It's true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble. The high seas, where whales, tuna and dolphins travel -- the largest, least protected, ecosystem on Earth, filled with luminous creatures, living in dark waters that average two miles deep. They flash, and sparkle, and glow with their own living light. There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child. The next 10 years may be the most important, and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life. To cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power. We need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease. We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place. But, nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean. Our fate and the ocean's are one. We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above. A global plan of action with a world conservation union, the IUCN, is underway to protect biodiversity, to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change, on the high seas and in coastal areas, wherever we can identify critical places. New technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see. The goal is to protect biodiversity, to provide stability and resilience. We need deep-diving subs, new technologies to explore the ocean. We need, maybe, an expedition -- a TED at sea -- that could help figure out the next steps. And so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is. I wish you would use all means at your disposal -- films, expeditions, the web, new submarines -- and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas -- hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean, the blue heart of the planet. How much? Some say 10 percent, some say 30 percent. You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect? Whatever it is, a fraction of one percent is not enough. My wish is a big wish, but if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world, and help ensure the survival of what actually -- as it turns out -- is my favorite species; that would be us. For the children of today, for tomorrow's child: as never again, now is the time. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
You and a group of strangers have been
gathered to design a just society. And to ensure none of you rig the system
to benefit yourself, you’ve all been placed
under a “veil of ignorance.” Under this veil, you’re blind to certain
information about each other and yourselves. You don’t know your age or sex, your profession or natural talents,
how much wealth you have, or your religious
or philosophical beliefs. So, according to political philosopher
John Rawls, you should be motivated to consider
what’s most fair for all your society's citizens. When Rawls published this
thought experiment— known as “the original position”—
in his 1971 opus “A Theory of Justice,” he was trying to identify principles
to support a realistic utopia. This visionary society would ensure
everyone had the resources and opportunities required
to freely pursue their goals. Rawls was confident these principles could
only be realized in a democracy. But he felt existing social structures
weren’t the right path forward. He believed free market philosophies
and welfare capitalism led to unjust accumulations
of wealth and power. And he saw models inspired by Marxism as extreme reactions
to capitalism’s flaws, with unrealistic assumptions
about economies and human nature. So Rawls proposed a new kind of democracy. One where no person was considered
less valuable than another and all citizens could live
according to their own wills. And while the details of this vision
can seem radical, Rawls believed that,
under the veil of ignorance, free and equal people would
unanimously agree to his fair society. So, let’s play out this
thought experiment. The first step in designing our society
is deciding how to distribute what Rawls called primary goods. These include the basic liberties,
opportunities, and wealth necessary for pursuing most goals. Rawls believed our justice-architects
would agree to an “equal scheme
of basic liberties” for all, including freedom of speech and the freedom to associate
with whoever they choose. After all, without the freedom
to pursue one's goals, resources like wealth
and job opportunities lose their value. Citizens would also have equal political
liberties to vote and run for office. Next, Rawls believes the architects
would establish what he calls “fair equality of opportunity.” This means society must be arranged
so no one is unfairly deprived of the resources necessary to compete
for valued jobs and other positions. However, after agreeing upon equality
of liberty and opportunity, Rawls believes our justice-architects
would see the benefits of allowing for some wealth inequalities. For example, greater profits
can incentivize innovation, productivity, and investment. But Rawls also believes our designers
would want to limit differences in wealth with what he calls
“the difference principle.” This states that wealth inequalities
are only acceptable when they benefit
the least advantaged citizens, making them better off than they’d be
under conditions of strict equality. These tenets form the foundation
of Rawls’ just society, and he believed they could be achieved
through what he called “property owning democracy.” This model would guarantee equal access
to education and healthcare and rely on government regulation
to ensure a just distribution of property and wealth. Rawls knew fully adopting this approach
would require major changes for existing democracies. But he believed his principles
could at least inspire some immediate improvements. For example, Rawls advocated for limits
on campaign spending and political contributions to reduce the influence
of wealth on politics. He also endorsed policies
fighting discrimination and generous social safety nets
like unemployment benefits to ensure a good situation
for the worst-off. Some philosophers have
critiqued Rawls’ work. Ronald Dworkin argues that
the difference principle unfairly tethers society’s progress
to the status of the worst-off, even if they’re in that position
because of their own choices. Meanwhile, Martha Nussbaum believes
Rawls’ thought experiment overlooks real-life particulars. For example, the special needs
of a person with disabilities might not be satisfied by the
standard distribution of primary goods. And more generally, some argue the architects in Rawls’
harmonious thought experiment are simply too different
from the competing interests building real societies. But since its publication, this thought experiment has inspired
some very real consequences. Rawls’ rallying cry for social
and political equality and a more justly regulated form
of capitalism has impacted countless political
philosophers, activists, and policymakers. And this new school of thought about
justice continues to challenge people to look past their biases and consider
what a fair society might truly look like.

**Transcript**:
You and a group of strangers have been
gathered to design a just society. And to ensure none of you rig the system
to benefit yourself, you’ve all been placed
under a “veil of ignorance.” Under this veil, you’re blind to certain
information about each other and yourselves. You don’t know your age or sex, your profession or natural talents,
how much wealth you have, or your religious
or philosophical beliefs. So, according to political philosopher
John Rawls, you should be motivated to consider
what’s most fair for all your society's citizens. When Rawls published this
thought experiment— known as “the original position”—
in his 1971 opus “A Theory of Justice,” he was trying to identify principles
to support a realistic utopia. This visionary society would ensure
everyone had the resources and opportunities required
to freely pursue their goals. Rawls was confident these principles could
only be realized in a democracy. But he felt existing social structures
weren’t the right path forward. He believed free market philosophies
and welfare capitalism led to unjust accumulations
of wealth and power. And he saw models inspired by Marxism as extreme reactions
to capitalism’s flaws, with unrealistic assumptions
about economies and human nature. So Rawls proposed a new kind of democracy. One where no person was considered
less valuable than another and all citizens could live
according to their own wills. And while the details of this vision
can seem radical, Rawls believed that,
under the veil of ignorance, free and equal people would
unanimously agree to his fair society. So, let’s play out this
thought experiment. The first step in designing our society
is deciding how to distribute what Rawls called primary goods. These include the basic liberties,
opportunities, and wealth necessary for pursuing most goals. Rawls believed our justice-architects
would agree to an “equal scheme
of basic liberties” for all, including freedom of speech and the freedom to associate
with whoever they choose. After all, without the freedom
to pursue one's goals, resources like wealth
and job opportunities lose their value. Citizens would also have equal political
liberties to vote and run for office. Next, Rawls believes the architects
would establish what he calls “fair equality of opportunity.” This means society must be arranged
so no one is unfairly deprived of the resources necessary to compete
for valued jobs and other positions. However, after agreeing upon equality
of liberty and opportunity, Rawls believes our justice-architects
would see the benefits of allowing for some wealth inequalities. For example, greater profits
can incentivize innovation, productivity, and investment. But Rawls also believes our designers
would want to limit differences in wealth with what he calls
“the difference principle.” This states that wealth inequalities
are only acceptable when they benefit
the least advantaged citizens, making them better off than they’d be
under conditions of strict equality. These tenets form the foundation
of Rawls’ just society, and he believed they could be achieved
through what he called “property owning democracy.” This model would guarantee equal access
to education and healthcare and rely on government regulation
to ensure a just distribution of property and wealth. Rawls knew fully adopting this approach
would require major changes for existing democracies. But he believed his principles
could at least inspire some immediate improvements. For example, Rawls advocated for limits
on campaign spending and political contributions to reduce the influence
of wealth on politics. He also endorsed policies
fighting discrimination and generous social safety nets
like unemployment benefits to ensure a good situation
for the worst-off. Some philosophers have
critiqued Rawls’ work. Ronald Dworkin argues that
the difference principle unfairly tethers society’s progress
to the status of the worst-off, even if they’re in that position
because of their own choices. Meanwhile, Martha Nussbaum believes
Rawls’ thought experiment overlooks real-life particulars. For example, the special needs
of a person with disabilities might not be satisfied by the
standard distribution of primary goods. And more generally, some argue the architects in Rawls’
harmonious thought experiment are simply too different
from the competing interests building real societies. But since its publication, this thought experiment has inspired
some very real consequences. Rawls’ rallying cry for social
and political equality and a more justly regulated form
of capitalism has impacted countless political
philosophers, activists, and policymakers. And this new school of thought about
justice continues to challenge people to look past their biases and consider
what a fair society might truly look like.

**Transcript**:
In May of 1945, the Third Reich
was in chaos. Adolf Hitler was dead,
German surrender was imminent, and Allied troops had already begun
divvying up German territory. But high-ranking Nazi engineer
Wernher von Braun wasn’t worried. In fact, he approached
the US government directly— informing them of his location
and waiting calmly for their arrival. As the brain behind the world’s first
long-range ballistic missile, von Braun knew his expertise made him
a highly valuable military asset. And sure enough, his so-called captors
gave him a decidedly warm welcome. Von Braun wasn't the only Nazi scientist
receiving this treatment. While World War II was almost over,
a new war was brewing. And the US was eager to recruit
the smartest minds in Germany before the Soviets got the chance. This became known as Operation Paperclip— a clandestine campaign that brought
over 1,500 German scientists to the US between 1945 and 1962. The program was named for the paperclips
attached to the files of early recruits— indicating that incriminating information
like Nazi affiliations or suspected war crimes
could be disregarded. Von Braun, for example,
had overseen an SS project that relied on forced labor from thousands
of concentration camp prisoners. While von Braun approached
the US directly, other scientists had to be
identified and located. One important asset in this effort was a Nazi-compiled list
of Germany’s top scientists, which someone had unsuccessfully tried
to dispose of by flushing down a toilet. But the US was just one player
in this scramble. The Soviets were also competing
to seize German brainpower, resorting to bribery
and forced relocation. The French and British lacked the money
to lure the best German brains, but that didn't stop them from kidnapping
the occasional scientist. They also stole patents and dismantled
factories to learn what they could. The US approach, however, featured
a different and particularly tempting brand of coercion: the promise to relocate entire German
families and grant them citizenship. This controversial offer
was one of the reasons Paperclip was initially shrouded
in secrecy. But the project became difficult to hide
when Germans started popping up all over the US. The military tried to get
ahead of any controversy by revealing the operation to the press
in late 1946. But the news immediately attracted
criticism from many prominent voices, including Albert Einstein,
Eleanor Roosevelt, and the NAACP, as well as many veteran’s organizations. These parties opposed granting
German scientists citizenship while millions of displaced persons,
including survivors of Nazi atrocities, had no chance of coming to America. Most Americans were also against employing
former Nazis in sensitive national security positions. But as the Cold War ramped up, the military argument for keeping these
scientists out of Soviet hands overpowered popular objections. With his Nazi past largely hidden
from the public, von Braun became one of the US’s
most important engineers at the height of the Space Race. In 1958, his team responded
to the Soviet launch of Sputnik with the US’s own successful
satellite launch. And in the 60s, he was the chief architect
of Saturn V, the rocket that brought Americans
to the moon. Other Paperclip recruits contributed
to the development of chemical weapons such as Agent Orange,
pharmaceutical research, and the development of modern airplanes. These contributions helped the US
government present Paperclip as a success. But, in hindsight, it’s hard to gauge
how helpful the program really was. While von Braun saved the US years
of rocketry experimentation, there's no reason to think American
scientists couldn't have developed the same technology without him. Furthermore, very few Paperclippers
were as exceptional as von Braun. Many were average scientists
who either completed their contracts and returned to Germany, or took jobs alongside Americans
with equivalent expertise. But ultimately,
the issue of Paperclip’s success is just one of many questions raised
by its contentious approach to science, ethics, and national security. Can scientists working on military
technology be apolitical, or are they responsible
for their creations? Can pressing political and military
concerns justify overlooking war crimes? In many ways, von Braun’s obituary
sums up the operation’s murkiness: “A kind of Faustian shadow may be
discerned in [...] the fascinating career of Wernher von Braun: a man so possessed
of [...] intellectual hunger, that any accommodation may be justified.”

**Transcript**:
In May of 1945, the Third Reich
was in chaos. Adolf Hitler was dead,
German surrender was imminent, and Allied troops had already begun
divvying up German territory. But high-ranking Nazi engineer
Wernher von Braun wasn’t worried. In fact, he approached
the US government directly— informing them of his location
and waiting calmly for their arrival. As the brain behind the world’s first
long-range ballistic missile, von Braun knew his expertise made him
a highly valuable military asset. And sure enough, his so-called captors
gave him a decidedly warm welcome. Von Braun wasn't the only Nazi scientist
receiving this treatment. While World War II was almost over,
a new war was brewing. And the US was eager to recruit
the smartest minds in Germany before the Soviets got the chance. This became known as Operation Paperclip— a clandestine campaign that brought
over 1,500 German scientists to the US between 1945 and 1962. The program was named for the paperclips
attached to the files of early recruits— indicating that incriminating information
like Nazi affiliations or suspected war crimes
could be disregarded. Von Braun, for example,
had overseen an SS project that relied on forced labor from thousands
of concentration camp prisoners. While von Braun approached
the US directly, other scientists had to be
identified and located. One important asset in this effort was a Nazi-compiled list
of Germany’s top scientists, which someone had unsuccessfully tried
to dispose of by flushing down a toilet. But the US was just one player
in this scramble. The Soviets were also competing
to seize German brainpower, resorting to bribery
and forced relocation. The French and British lacked the money
to lure the best German brains, but that didn't stop them from kidnapping
the occasional scientist. They also stole patents and dismantled
factories to learn what they could. The US approach, however, featured
a different and particularly tempting brand of coercion: the promise to relocate entire German
families and grant them citizenship. This controversial offer
was one of the reasons Paperclip was initially shrouded
in secrecy. But the project became difficult to hide
when Germans started popping up all over the US. The military tried to get
ahead of any controversy by revealing the operation to the press
in late 1946. But the news immediately attracted
criticism from many prominent voices, including Albert Einstein,
Eleanor Roosevelt, and the NAACP, as well as many veteran’s organizations. These parties opposed granting
German scientists citizenship while millions of displaced persons,
including survivors of Nazi atrocities, had no chance of coming to America. Most Americans were also against employing
former Nazis in sensitive national security positions. But as the Cold War ramped up, the military argument for keeping these
scientists out of Soviet hands overpowered popular objections. With his Nazi past largely hidden
from the public, von Braun became one of the US’s
most important engineers at the height of the Space Race. In 1958, his team responded
to the Soviet launch of Sputnik with the US’s own successful
satellite launch. And in the 60s, he was the chief architect
of Saturn V, the rocket that brought Americans
to the moon. Other Paperclip recruits contributed
to the development of chemical weapons such as Agent Orange,
pharmaceutical research, and the development of modern airplanes. These contributions helped the US
government present Paperclip as a success. But, in hindsight, it’s hard to gauge
how helpful the program really was. While von Braun saved the US years
of rocketry experimentation, there's no reason to think American
scientists couldn't have developed the same technology without him. Furthermore, very few Paperclippers
were as exceptional as von Braun. Many were average scientists
who either completed their contracts and returned to Germany, or took jobs alongside Americans
with equivalent expertise. But ultimately,
the issue of Paperclip’s success is just one of many questions raised
by its contentious approach to science, ethics, and national security. Can scientists working on military
technology be apolitical, or are they responsible
for their creations? Can pressing political and military
concerns justify overlooking war crimes? In many ways, von Braun’s obituary
sums up the operation’s murkiness: “A kind of Faustian shadow may be
discerned in [...] the fascinating career of Wernher von Braun: a man so possessed
of [...] intellectual hunger, that any accommodation may be justified.”

**Transcript**:
On October 23, 2015, Mcebisi Jonas,
South Africa’s deputy finance minister, faced a harrowing, yet enticing, decision. He had thought he was attending
a normal business meeting but ended up in the home
of the powerful Gupta family, sitting with the Gupta brothers
and the president, Jacob Zuma’s, son. Jonas was offered a promotion
and $45 million. In return, he would be expected
to use his position to advance the Gupta’s
many business interests. This included firing officials
who opposed the construction of new power plants, which were slated to run on fuel
from Gupta-owned mines. The deal was simple—
but would Jonas accept? This kind of corruption in politics
is nothing new. It plagued the ancient world— the “Arthasastra,”
an Indian political treatise that dates back to the 3rd century BCE, lists 40 types of embezzlement alone. So, what exactly is corruption,
and what can we do to combat it? Corruption is often defined as a misuse
of a position of power for personal gain. For example, this could be a city clerk
accepting bribes in exchange for issuing permits; or a mayor appointing a campaign donor
to an influential position. But corruption isn’t limited
to the political sphere; it can happen in schools, sports,
businesses, or religious institutions. In ancient Greece,
the power-hungry Alcmaeonid family notoriously bribed the priestesses
at Delphi to deliver false prophecies, like telling the Spartans
they should invade Athens. It may seem like all corruption
is driven by greed, but individual motives are often complex. There can be economic drivers, like family pressure
on an underpaid civil servant who exaggerates his expenses
to get more money back. This might not seem like a big problem,
but corruption can snowball. If anti-corruption laws aren’t enforced, or if loopholes are
continuously exploited, a larger culture of corruption can emerge. For example, in 2009,
numerous British MPs were exposed for using taxpayer money
to cover personal expenses, from home renovations to luxury purchases,
and even having a moat cleaned. And corruption isn't always
directly about money. In 2016, a Department of Justice
investigation found widespread patterns of unconstitutional policing,
abuse, and corruption within the Baltimore Police Department. In just one elite task force,
eight officers were convicted of crimes, including planting evidence
and robbing citizens during traffic stops. Corruption like this causes people
to lose faith in government and can deplete much needed resources. The more taxpayer money
that goes into people’s pockets, the less there is to spend on services
that benefit the community— like repairing roads, building schools,
or providing healthcare. In the case of South Africa, the Gupta family plundered billions
of dollars from the country’s funds through their wide-ranging
corruption schemes, devastating the nation's economy. In Baltimore, the police department cost
taxpayers more than $22 million in court settlements
and gravely eroded public trust. So, how can we prevent corruption? While it’s important that laws set
a high price for corrupt behavior, punishment is only one piece
of the puzzle. Transparency in terms of budget
and paper trails and support for freedom of the press
are hugely important. In Botswana, the government
has built public trust through their ongoing commitment
to respond to corruption openly, quickly, and decisively. In Denmark, government ministers must
publish monthly reports cataloging their spending
on entertainment, official travel,
and any gifts they’ve received. As citizens, we can vote out those
who engage in corruption and question officials who push
back against transparency measures. And we can stand up against corruption
when we see it. In South Africa,
Jonas refused the Guptas’ offer, and despite threats against his life,
spoke out, exposing a sprawling web of corruption
that toppled Zuma’s regime, and sent the Gupta family into exile. But it wasn’t just Jonas’ revelation
that mattered. Once the scale of corruption
was unearthed, everyday South Africans
took to the streets, insisting that “Zuma must fall.” By using our civic voices, we can fight back to ensure
that tax dollars don’t line pockets, but instead benefit everyone.

an Indian political treatise that dates back to the 3rd century BCE, lists 40 types of embezzlement alone. So, what exactly is corruption,
and what can we do to combat it? Corruption is often defined as a misuse
of a position of power for personal gain. For example, this could be a city clerk
accepting bribes in exchange for issuing permits; or a mayor appointing a campaign donor
to an influential position. But corruption isn’t limited
to the political sphere; it can happen in schools, sports,
businesses, or religious institutions. In ancient Greece,
the power-hungry Alcmaeonid family notoriously bribed the priestesses
at Delphi to deliver false prophecies, like telling the Spartans
they should invade Athens. It may seem like all corruption
is driven by greed, but individual motives are often complex. There can be economic drivers, like family pressure
on an underpaid civil servant who exaggerates his expenses
to get more money back. This might not seem like a big problem,
but corruption can snowball. If anti-corruption laws aren’t enforced, or if loopholes are
continuously exploited, a larger culture of corruption can emerge. For example, in 2009,
numerous British MPs were exposed for using taxpayer money
to cover personal expenses, from home renovations to luxury purchases,
and even having a moat cleaned. And corruption isn't always
directly about money. In 2016, a Department of Justice
investigation found widespread patterns of unconstitutional policing,
abuse, and corruption within the Baltimore Police Department. In just one elite task force,
eight officers were convicted of crimes, including planting evidence
and robbing citizens during traffic stops. Corruption like this causes people
to lose faith in government and can deplete much needed resources. The more taxpayer money
that goes into people’s pockets, the less there is to spend on services
that benefit the community— like repairing roads, building schools,
or providing healthcare. In the case of South Africa, the Gupta family plundered billions
of dollars from the country’s funds through their wide-ranging
corruption schemes, devastating the nation's economy. In Baltimore, the police department cost
taxpayers more than $22 million in court settlements
and gravely eroded public trust. So, how can we prevent corruption? While it’s important that laws set
a high price for corrupt behavior, punishment is only one piece
of the puzzle. Transparency in terms of budget
and paper trails and support for freedom of the press
are hugely important. In Botswana, the government
has built public trust through their ongoing commitment
to respond to corruption openly, quickly, and decisively. In Denmark, government ministers must
publish monthly reports cataloging their spending
on entertainment, official travel,
and any gifts they’ve received. As citizens, we can vote out those
who engage in corruption and question officials who push
back against transparency measures. And we can stand up against corruption
when we see it. In South Africa,
Jonas refused the Guptas’ offer, and despite threats against his life,
spoke out, exposing a sprawling web of corruption
that toppled Zuma’s regime, and sent the Gupta family into exile. But it wasn’t just Jonas’ revelation
that mattered. Once the scale of corruption
was unearthed, everyday South Africans
took to the streets, insisting that “Zuma must fall.” By using our civic voices, we can fight back to ensure
that tax dollars don’t line pockets, but instead benefit everyone.

**Transcript**:
On October 23, 2015, Mcebisi Jonas,
South Africa’s deputy finance minister, faced a harrowing, yet enticing, decision. He had thought he was attending
a normal business meeting but ended up in the home
of the powerful Gupta family, sitting with the Gupta brothers
and the president, Jacob Zuma’s, son. Jonas was offered a promotion
and $45 million. In return, he would be expected
to use his position to advance the Gupta’s
many business interests. This included firing officials
who opposed the construction of new power plants, which were slated to run on fuel
from Gupta-owned mines. The deal was simple—
but would Jonas accept? This kind of corruption in politics
