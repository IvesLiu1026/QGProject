**Transcript**:
Whether you love it or hate it, the listicle
– a blend of list and article – has quickly become a very popular content format. 22 brain facts, 29 Things Australians Say
(That Americans Don't), 17 things humanity ruined in 2015. Pets? Really?! Listicles are everywhere. So, why are they so popular? There are some ideas, based in science, that
explain why. Listicles are readable and easy to digest,
they’re kind of like the graphic novel of the internet. And they play a role in curating information. Researchers estimated that in 2008, people
consumed 60% more information than they did in 1960. Back then, the average American spent 7.4
hours a day, outside of work, watching, reading and listening to things; on the phone and
having conversations with other people. In 2008 that number was a 11.8 hours a day,
and today it’s closer to 13 hours. Because we consume so much stuff, we’re
pretty distracted. A curated list appeals to us. Part of this appeal is being able to skim
or quickly look at a listicle and process all of it’s content. The headlines help by telling us exactly what
we’re going to get: The 25 Most Huggable Pokémon. So, we’re satisfied. But this ease of processing information can
lead to some interesting effects. At the core of this is cognitive fluency–it’s
a measure of how easy it is to think about something. People like thinking about things that are
easier to think about, compared to things that are hard to think about. No surprises there. And generally, the more fluently you can process
an object, the more positive your response is to it. Let’s take a closer look. In one study, researchers showed participants
a statement, like “Osorno is in Chile” in colours that made it easy or difficult
to read. Moderately visible statements were judged
as true, and highly visible statements were judged as true significantly above what people
would choose by chance. The researchers concluded that fluently we
perceive things affects our judgments of truth. Another study found when participants looked
at images that were easier to process, they twitched their muscles into a little subconscious
smile. We can’t infer that reading listicles make
us smile, but consuming easier to process information just might. And easy-to-process information isn’t new
to the “internet age”, it’s had an important role throughout culture. “It certainly has” Okay here’s Mike, from Idea Channel. “Hey Vanessa! Yeah, it’s really easy to look our current,
list-laden moment and feel overwhelmed! Or like the internet, with all its distractions
and blinking animated GIFs and pictures of cute cats, has given rise to this particular
and particularly easy to digest format. The listicle FEELS like it’s VERY INTERNET. Mark O’Connell, for the New York Times,
writes that online browsing often seems like “a comic nightmare of futile enumeration. The point of counting is, in a way, to get
to the end of counting; but this is a counting that admits of no conclusion—a bottomless
inventory of everything and nothing.” Mark may be more right than he realizes. The listicle has been around for much, much
longer than the internet has, and may be on one of the central ways we’ve cataloged
and organized the world for a long time. It’s just that, with the internet, we realize
the true infinity of whats available for sorting and cataloging, and lists doing so. Like, 5 genius trashcan lifehacks or The 21
Most Important Raccoons Of 2015 or 159 Disney Quotes For When You Need An Instagram Caption
or 6 Video Games That Failed Before You Pressed Start or OK OK I’m gonna stop before this
becomes a listicle listicle. If you wanna hear more about the 29 different
ways listicles have been perhaps flawed–but definitely important and interesting–throughout
history, head on over to Idea Channel when you’re done here. Thanks, Vanessa!” Of course! But as much as we’ve liked lists throughout
history, it’s not a perfect format. Sure, some people will say “listicles are
ruining journalism”, but we don’t speak of the impact of the format as much as the
way it’s written. In my humble opinion, you don’t remember
listicles. You don’t learn things from them. I’ve tried to think about any list article
or video that I’ve read or watched in my entire life, and I can only remember two from
the past two years: 37 Signs You Grew Up In Australia In The ’90s and 20 Facts about
the Muppets. And I probably remember these because Agro’s
cartoon connection, zooper doopers and Kermit resonate with me on a deep emotional level. And this is the thing about listicles: they’re
just like a zooper dooper or a popsicle in that they’re appealing, you can start and
finish it in two minutes, and you’ll be somewhat satisfied. Some people even say that listicles activate
your brain's reward system, so you’ll finish wanting more. In his TED talk, psychology professor Peter
Dolittle says that your working memory is about the size of a pea. You need to use it to make sense of all the
information you encounter every day and it’s limited in its capacity, duration and focus. You tend to remember about 4 things for 10-20
seconds unless you do something with it–like apply that knowledge to something you already
know or talk to someone about it. Otherwise, any bite of information, is (in
a manner of speaking) in one ear and out the other. Don’t get me wrong, the listicle isn’t
a bad thing! It has a well-deserved place in the media
landscape as a piece of entertainment and our brains love that we can fluently process
them. But as pieces of education, I’m not convinced. And if you want to hear Mike’s voice again,
and even see his face, head over to Idea Channel for his take on humanity and the listicle. And, maybe to see 15 hedgehogs with things

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage of people who consumed more information in 2008 compared to 1960. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask about this specific topic.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of information consumption, I would suggest Question 2: "Why are listicles so popular, according to the transcript?" Options: A. Because they are easy to read and digest., B. Because they are a new format on the internet., C. Because they are a way to curate information., D. Because they are a way to get to the end of counting.

This question is related to the topic of information consumption because it mentions that listicles are a way to curate information, which is relevant to the idea that people are consuming more information.

But, I must emphasize that this is a weak match, and none of the generated MCQs truly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: 2 (with the caveat that it's a weak match).

It would be better to generate new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

However, the options provided for Question 3 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses the relationship between cognitive fluency and positive response.

A closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 3 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

If I had to choose an index, I would choose Question 3 (Index 3), but with the caveat that the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

To create a more accurate match, a new generated MCQ could be created that directly addresses the relationship between cognitive fluency and positive response, such as:

Question: What is the relationship between cognitive fluency and our response to an object?
Options: A. The more fluently we can process an object, the more negative our response is to it., B. The more fluently we can process an object, the more positive our response is to it., C. The more fluently we can process an object, the more neutral our response is to it., D. There is no relationship between cognitive fluency and our response to an object.

This new generated MCQ would more accurately match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent.

**Transcript**:
Grammatical tense 
is how languages talk about time without explicitly naming time periods by, instead, modifying verbs 
to specify when action occurs. So how many different tenses are there
in a language like English? At first, the answer seems obvious: there's past, present, and future. But thanks to something called
grammatical aspect, each of those time periods 
actually divides further. There are four kinds of aspect. In the continuous or progressive aspect, the actions are still happening 
at the time of reference. The perfect aspect describes actions
that are finished. The perfect progressive aspect 
is a combination, describing a completed part 
of a continuous action. And finally, there's the simple aspect, the basic form of the past, 
present, and future tense, where an action is not specified
as continuous or discrete. That's all a little hard to follow,
so let's see how it works in action. Let's say your friends tell you
they went on a secret naval mission to collect evidence 
of a mysterious sea creature. The tense sets the overall frame
of reference in the past, but within that, there are many options. Your friends might say a creature
attacked their boat, that's the past simple,
the most general aspect, which gives no further clarification. They were sleeping when it happened, a continuous process 
underway at that point. They might also tell you they had departed
from Nantucket to describe an action 
completed even earlier. That's an example of the past perfect. Or that they had been sailing 
for three weeks, something that was ongoing 
up until that point. In the present, they tell you that 
they still search for the creature today, their present simple activity. Perhaps they are preparing for their
next mission continuously as they speak. And they have built a special 
submarine for it, a completed achievement. Plus, if they have been researching
possible sightings of the creature, it's something they've been doing 
for a while and are still doing now making it present perfect progressive. So what does this next mission hold? You know it still hasn't happened
because they will depart next week, the future simple. Your friends will be searching 
for the elusive creature, an extended continuous undertaking. They tell you the submarine will have
reached uncharted depths a month from now. That's a confident prediction about what will be achieved 
by a specific point in the future, a point at which they 
will have been voyaging for three weeks in the future perfect progressive. The key insight to all these 
different tenses is that each sentence takes place
in a specific moment, whether it's past, present, or future. The point of aspects is that they tell you
as of that moment the status of the action. In total, they give us twelve 
possibilities in English. What about other languages? Some, like French, Swahili, and Russian
take a similar approach to English. Others describe 
and divide time differently. Some have fewer grammatical tenses,
like Japanese, which only distinguishes past 
from non-past, Buli and Tukang Basi, which only distinguish future 
from non-future, and Mandarin Chinese 
with no verb tenses at all, only aspect. On the other hand, languages like Yagwa
split past tense into multiple degrees, like whether something happened hours, 
weeks, or years ago. In others, tenses are intertwined
with moods that can convey urgency, necessity, or probability of events. This makes translation difficult
but not impossible. Speakers of most languages without certain
tenses can express the same ideas with auxiliary words, 
like would or did, or by specifying the time they mean. Are the variations 
from language to language just differents ways of describing
the same fundamental reality? Or do their diverse structures reflect
different ways of thinking about the world and even time itself? And if so, what other ways 
of conceiving time may be out there?

The ground truth MCQ asks about the use of the Past Continuous form to show the timing of an action, while Question 3 asks about the tense used to describe an action that was completed even earlier. 

However, a more similar question would be one that specifically asks about the Past Continuous form. Since such a question is not available, Question 3 is the closest match based on its focus on applying grammatical tenses in a similar context.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 3.

**Transcript**:
Grammatical tense 
is how languages talk about time without explicitly naming time periods by, instead, modifying verbs 
to specify when action occurs. So how many different tenses are there
in a language like English? At first, the answer seems obvious: there's past, present, and future. But thanks to something called
grammatical aspect, each of those time periods 
actually divides further. There are four kinds of aspect. In the continuous or progressive aspect, the actions are still happening 
at the time of reference. The perfect aspect describes actions
that are finished. The perfect progressive aspect 
is a combination, describing a completed part 
of a continuous action. And finally, there's the simple aspect, the basic form of the past, 
present, and future tense, where an action is not specified
as continuous or discrete. That's all a little hard to follow,
so let's see how it works in action. Let's say your friends tell you
they went on a secret naval mission to collect evidence 
of a mysterious sea creature. The tense sets the overall frame
of reference in the past, but within that, there are many options. Your friends might say a creature
attacked their boat, that's the past simple,
the most general aspect, which gives no further clarification. They were sleeping when it happened, a continuous process 
underway at that point. They might also tell you they had departed
from Nantucket to describe an action 
completed even earlier. That's an example of the past perfect. Or that they had been sailing 
for three weeks, something that was ongoing 
up until that point. In the present, they tell you that 
they still search for the creature today, their present simple activity. Perhaps they are preparing for their
next mission continuously as they speak. And they have built a special 
submarine for it, a completed achievement. Plus, if they have been researching
possible sightings of the creature, it's something they've been doing 
for a while and are still doing now making it present perfect progressive. So what does this next mission hold? You know it still hasn't happened
because they will depart next week, the future simple. Your friends will be searching 
for the elusive creature, an extended continuous undertaking. They tell you the submarine will have
reached uncharted depths a month from now. That's a confident prediction about what will be achieved 
by a specific point in the future, a point at which they 
will have been voyaging for three weeks in the future perfect progressive. The key insight to all these 
different tenses is that each sentence takes place
in a specific moment, whether it's past, present, or future. The point of aspects is that they tell you
as of that moment the status of the action. In total, they give us twelve 
possibilities in English. What about other languages? Some, like French, Swahili, and Russian
take a similar approach to English. Others describe 
and divide time differently. Some have fewer grammatical tenses,
like Japanese, which only distinguishes past 
from non-past, Buli and Tukang Basi, which only distinguish future 
from non-future, and Mandarin Chinese 
with no verb tenses at all, only aspect. On the other hand, languages like Yagwa
split past tense into multiple degrees, like whether something happened hours, 
weeks, or years ago. In others, tenses are intertwined
with moods that can convey urgency, necessity, or probability of events. This makes translation difficult
but not impossible. Speakers of most languages without certain
tenses can express the same ideas with auxiliary words, 
like would or did, or by specifying the time they mean. Are the variations 
from language to language just differents ways of describing
the same fundamental reality? Or do their diverse structures reflect
different ways of thinking about the world and even time itself? And if so, what other ways 
of conceiving time may be out there?

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC] [MUSIC] Hey guys! I just learned about a dog named
Chaser. Chaser is a border collie who has a vocabulary of more than 1,000 words, that’s
like the same as a 4-year-old child. What makes Chaser even more special is that he
can even separate nouns from verbs. "take lips. Do it girl!"
"Good girl, good girl." "Paw lamb, paw lamb, Chaser"
"Good girl, good girl" "Nose ABC, nose ABC."
"Good girl, good girl!" This is Oliver. Oliver, you think you're smarter
than Chaser? What do you say? Yeah, let's go find out. Come on! Get your ball. Where's your ball? Get your bone. Where's your bone? Nope, that's your ball.
Where's your bone? Bone. Bone. Nope. Find your bone? Where's your bone?
Okay, so maybe Oliver's not that good at this particular test, but the fact that we even
try to communicate with dogs, and that they communicate back with us, means that the human-dog
relationship is truly something special. "Who's the best boy? (baby talk)" I… have been known to talk to dogs a little. (baby talk)
(baby talk) Or a lot. (baby talk) It’s hard to know if they’re responding
to the words, or just the emotion in my voice. Or the fact that I sound ridiculous. One recent
study suggests it’s both. Or all three. Researchers at the University of Sussex played
sounds out of speakers on both sides of a dog. When dogs heard commands stripped of
their emotional context, they turned their head to the right, suggesting they process
verbal meaning in their left hemisphere. And when they heard the emotional sounds in the
voice, but the words were jumbled, they turned to the left, suggesting they process emotional
sounds on the right. These experiments show that dogs can definitely
separate the meaning of words from the emotion attached. But how much information do they
take from each? When I ask my dogs “Do you want to go for
a walk?” they aren’t processing the real meaning of that sentence the way we do, like
“Hmm, lemme see, do I want to go for a walk right now? Get some exercise? Maybe I’m
just not feeling it today? I mean, I’m a dog, what does it even mean to WANT something?” As good as dogs are with words, in many of
our interactions there’s probably a good amount of Clever Hans at play. In the early
1900’s a horse named Hans was said to be able to solve simple math problems by tapping
his hoof to represent numbers. 2 + 3? Smart horse! It was later found, though, that
Hans couldn’t do math at all. He was just responding to tiny cues from his handlers,
maybe their facial expressions would tense as he got close to the right answer, or they
would exhale when he tapped the right number. Clever Hans demonstrates that while we might
think of language as something we experience mainly through our ears, we communicate meaning
using more than just sound frequencies. In his book "The Expression of the Emotions
in Man and Animals", Charles Darwin argued that the way that we outwardly express and
interpret emotions evolved from animals, and that our ability to recognize fear, happiness,
sadness, even across species, is universal, and innate. It’s something that we’re
born with. Today, scientists are still debating whether
Darwin was right, but recent research suggests that we do share one special bit of emotional
intuition with our canine companions. Dogs are the only non-primate animals that
seek out eye contact with humans. Their wolf ancestors, even tame ones, although they’re
close enough genetically to interbreed with dogs, won’t look us in the eye… which
is why you can never, ever trust a wolf. "How am I doing?" When reading emotions in other people we tend
to look disproportionately and unconsciously to the right side of their face.
Dogs share this so-called left-gaze bias, but only when looking at human faces, not
when they look at other dogs. It seems like they genuinely want to understand what we’re
telling them and what it means. We seem to understand them too, or at least
we think we do. Researchers in Hungary tested people’s ability to interpret the meaning
of recorded dog barks, and found that many people really can speak dog. What do you think this bark means?
[barking] [barking]
Okay, that dog's angry. That's pretty easy. What about this one?
[barking] [barking]
Okay, that dog wants to go for a walk. One more.
[strange noises] I have no idea what that means. If you think about it, this dog-human language
connection makes a lot of sense. We've co-evolved with these creatures for the past 10,000 years
or so. We've molded them from wolves into puppies with our hands and our brains, and
our voices. Even if we don't always understand each other,
well, they're always there to listen, and that's the real meaning of a best friend.
Isn't it buddy? [phone ringing] Wait a second. Sorry. Hello? Um, yeah, sure. It's for you. "Hello? This is Oliver."
"Hello. This is dog." "Oh, hey Luna!"
"Have you seen Vanessa? She's been out for hours! I miss her."
"Ruh roh!" Um, thanks Luna! If you want to find out more
about dog behavior head on over to BrainCraft and find out if they really miss us when we're
gone. Stay curious. Good boy. Oh, and special thanks to Oliver. [MUSIC]

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the options in Question 2 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ.

A more similar generated MCQ would be one that asks about how dogs process verbal meaning and emotional sounds. However, such a question is not present in the list.

But among the given options, Question 2 has some similarity with the ground truth MCQ.

However, another generated MCQ, i.e., Question 6, also has some similarity with the ground truth MCQ in terms of understanding dog communication.

But if we carefully examine the generated MCQs again, we can see that Question 7, which describes the Clever Hans effect, is related to how dogs (or animals) respond to human cues, which can be emotional or verbal.

So, the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: What is the term for the phenomenon where animals respond to tiny cues from their handlers?

However, the options in Question 7 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ.

If we again examine the generated MCQs, we can see that Question 2 and Question 7 have some elements of the ground truth MCQ, but they do not exactly match.

However, if we were to choose one generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be Question 2 or Question 7.

But since the options in Question 2 and Question 7 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ, and if we were to choose one, I would say that Question 2 and Question 7 are not the best matches.

However, among the given options, I think Question 2 and Question 7 are the closest matches.

But again, if I were to choose one, I would say that the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not among the given options.

However, I must provide an answer, so I will re-evaluate the generated MCQs.

Upon re-evaluation, I realize that I missed one important aspect: the ground truth MCQ asks about how dogs respond to human questions.

With this in mind, I re-evaluated the generated MCQs and found that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must provide an answer.

So, the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2.

However, I want to emphasize that Question 2 is not an exact match.

But among the given options, I think Question 2 is the closest match.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 2

1900’s a horse named Hans was said to be able to solve simple math problems by tapping
his hoof to represent numbers. 2 + 3? Smart horse! It was later found, though, that
Hans couldn’t do math at all. He was just responding to tiny cues from his handlers,
maybe their facial expressions would tense as he got close to the right answer, or they
would exhale when he tapped the right number. Clever Hans demonstrates that while we might
think of language as something we experience mainly through our ears, we communicate meaning
using more than just sound frequencies. In his book "The Expression of the Emotions
in Man and Animals", Charles Darwin argued that the way that we outwardly express and
interpret emotions evolved from animals, and that our ability to recognize fear, happiness,
sadness, even across species, is universal, and innate. It’s something that we’re
born with. Today, scientists are still debating whether
Darwin was right, but recent research suggests that we do share one special bit of emotional
intuition with our canine companions. Dogs are the only non-primate animals that
seek out eye contact with humans. Their wolf ancestors, even tame ones, although they’re
close enough genetically to interbreed with dogs, won’t look us in the eye… which
is why you can never, ever trust a wolf. "How am I doing?" When reading emotions in other people we tend
to look disproportionately and unconsciously to the right side of their face.
Dogs share this so-called left-gaze bias, but only when looking at human faces, not
when they look at other dogs. It seems like they genuinely want to understand what we’re
telling them and what it means. We seem to understand them too, or at least
we think we do. Researchers in Hungary tested people’s ability to interpret the meaning
of recorded dog barks, and found that many people really can speak dog. What do you think this bark means?
[barking] [barking]
Okay, that dog's angry. That's pretty easy. What about this one?
[barking] [barking]
Okay, that dog wants to go for a walk. One more.
[strange noises] I have no idea what that means. If you think about it, this dog-human language
connection makes a lot of sense. We've co-evolved with these creatures for the past 10,000 years
or so. We've molded them from wolves into puppies with our hands and our brains, and
our voices. Even if we don't always understand each other,
well, they're always there to listen, and that's the real meaning of a best friend.
Isn't it buddy? [phone ringing] Wait a second. Sorry. Hello? Um, yeah, sure. It's for you. "Hello? This is Oliver."
"Hello. This is dog." "Oh, hey Luna!"
"Have you seen Vanessa? She's been out for hours! I miss her."
"Ruh roh!" Um, thanks Luna! If you want to find out more
about dog behavior head on over to BrainCraft and find out if they really miss us when we're
gone. Stay curious. Good boy. Oh, and special thanks to Oliver. [MUSIC]

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC] [MUSIC] Hey guys! I just learned about a dog named
Chaser. Chaser is a border collie who has a vocabulary of more than 1,000 words, that’s
like the same as a 4-year-old child. What makes Chaser even more special is that he
can even separate nouns from verbs. "take lips. Do it girl!"
"Good girl, good girl." "Paw lamb, paw lamb, Chaser"
"Good girl, good girl" "Nose ABC, nose ABC."
"Good girl, good girl!" This is Oliver. Oliver, you think you're smarter
than Chaser? What do you say? Yeah, let's go find out. Come on! Get your ball. Where's your ball? Get your bone. Where's your bone? Nope, that's your ball.
Where's your bone? Bone. Bone. Nope. Find your bone? Where's your bone?
Okay, so maybe Oliver's not that good at this particular test, but the fact that we even
try to communicate with dogs, and that they communicate back with us, means that the human-dog
relationship is truly something special. "Who's the best boy? (baby talk)" I… have been known to talk to dogs a little. (baby talk)
(baby talk) Or a lot. (baby talk) It’s hard to know if they’re responding
to the words, or just the emotion in my voice. Or the fact that I sound ridiculous. One recent
study suggests it’s both. Or all three. Researchers at the University of Sussex played
sounds out of speakers on both sides of a dog. When dogs heard commands stripped of
their emotional context, they turned their head to the right, suggesting they process
verbal meaning in their left hemisphere. And when they heard the emotional sounds in the
voice, but the words were jumbled, they turned to the left, suggesting they process emotional
sounds on the right. These experiments show that dogs can definitely
separate the meaning of words from the emotion attached. But how much information do they
take from each? When I ask my dogs “Do you want to go for
a walk?” they aren’t processing the real meaning of that sentence the way we do, like
“Hmm, lemme see, do I want to go for a walk right now? Get some exercise? Maybe I’m
just not feeling it today? I mean, I’m a dog, what does it even mean to WANT something?” As good as dogs are with words, in many of
our interactions there’s probably a good amount of Clever Hans at play. In the early

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the options in Question 2 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ.

A more similar generated MCQ would be one that asks about how dogs process verbal meaning and emotional sounds. However, such a question is not present in the list.

But among the given options, Question 2 has some similarity with the ground truth MCQ.

However, another generated MCQ, i.e., Question 6, also has some similarity with the ground truth MCQ in terms of understanding dog communication.

But if we carefully examine the generated MCQs again, we can see that Question 7, which describes the Clever Hans effect, is related to how dogs (or animals) respond to human cues, which can be emotional or verbal.

So, the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: What is the term for the phenomenon where animals respond to tiny cues from their handlers?

However, the options in Question 7 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ.

If we again examine the generated MCQs, we can see that Question 2 and Question 7 have some elements of the ground truth MCQ, but they do not exactly match.

However, if we were to choose one generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be Question 2 or Question 7.

But since the options in Question 2 and Question 7 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ, and if we were to choose one, I would say that Question 2 and Question 7 are not the best matches.

However, among the given options, I think Question 2 and Question 7 are the closest matches.

But again, if I were to choose one, I would say that the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not among the given options.

However, I must provide an answer, so I will re-evaluate the generated MCQs.

Upon re-evaluation, I realize that I missed one important aspect: the ground truth MCQ asks about how dogs respond to human questions.

With this in mind, I re-evaluated the generated MCQs and found that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must provide an answer.

So, the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2.

However, I want to emphasize that Question 2 is not an exact match.

But among the given options, I think Question 2 is the closest match.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 2

**Transcript**:
Every two seconds, someone somewhere 
in the world experiences a stroke. And one out of every six people will have 
one at some point in their lives. Strokes deprive brain cells of oxygen and are one of the most 
common causes of death and a leading cause 
of preventable disability. When someone experiences a stroke,
quick medical care is critical, and can often help avoid 
permanent brain damage. But what causes strokes 
in the first place? And what can doctors do to treat them? The brain makes up just 2% 
of your body’s mass but consumes more than 20%
of the oxygen in your blood. That oxygen is carried to the brain
through a system of arteries. Carotid arteries supply 
the front of the brain, and vertebral arteries supply the back. These are connected to each other, and divide into smaller 
and smaller vessels that get billions of neurons 
the oxygen they need. If the blood flow is interrupted, 
oxygen delivery stops and brain cells die. There are two ways this can happen. Hemorrhagic strokes are when a perforated
vessel allows blood to leak out. But the more common type 
is the ischemic stroke, when a clot blocks a vessel 
and brings blood flow to a halt. Where do these clots come from? On rare occasions,
a sudden change in heart rhythm prevents the upper chambers of the heart
from contracting normally. This slows down blood flow, allowing platelets, clotting factors, 
and fibrin to stick together. The clot can be carried up towards the arteries
and blood vessels supplying the brain until it gets to one 
it can’t squeeze through. This is called an embolism and it cuts off the oxygen supply 
to all the cells downstream. The brain doesn't have pain receptors,
so you can't feel the blockage itself. But oxygen deprivation 
slows brain function and can have sudden, noticeable effects. For example, if the affected area 
is responsible for speech, an individual’s words may be slurred. If the stroke affects a part of the brain 
that controls muscle movement, it can cause weakness, 
often just on one side of the body. When this happens, the body 
will immediately try to compensate by diverting blood flow 
to the affected area, but this isn’t a perfect solution. Eventually, the oxygen-deprived cells 
will start to die, leading to brain damage 
that may be severe or permanent. That’s why it’s important to get
medical care as fast as possible. The first line of treatment
is an intravenous medication called Tissue Plasminogen Activator, which can break up the blood clot and allow blood to flow again
in the compromised artery. If it’s delivered within a few hours, this medication greatly increases
the chance of surviving the stroke and avoiding permanent consequences. If Tissue Plasminogen Activator
cannot be given because the patient 
is on certain medications, has history of major bleeding, or the clot is particularly large, doctors can perform a procedure
called an endovascular thrombectomy. Using a fluorescent dye that illuminates 
the blood vessels under a strong x-ray, the physician inserts a long, 
thin, flexible tube called a catheter into an artery in the leg and maneuvers
it all the way to the blockage. A retriever is passed
through this catheter. It expands and anchors into the clot 
when it’s just past it. The catheter then pulls the clot out 
when it’s removed. These treatments need to be delivered
as soon as possible to preserve brain function, which means figuring out fast 
if someone is having a stroke. So how can you tell? Here are three quick things to try: 1. Ask the person to smile. A crooked mouth or facial drooping 
can indicate muscle weakness. 2. Ask them to raise their arms. If one drifts downward, that arm weakness
is also a sign of a stroke. 3. Ask them to repeat a
simple word or phrase. If their speech sounds
slurred or strange, it could mean that the language area 
of their brain is oxygen-deprived. This is sometimes called the FAST test,
and the T stands for time. If you see any of those signs, 
call emergency services right away. Lives may depend on it.

**Transcript**:
Every two seconds, someone somewhere 
in the world experiences a stroke. And one out of every six people will have 
one at some point in their lives. Strokes deprive brain cells of oxygen and are one of the most 
common causes of death and a leading cause 
of preventable disability. When someone experiences a stroke,
quick medical care is critical, and can often help avoid 
permanent brain damage. But what causes strokes 
in the first place? And what can doctors do to treat them? The brain makes up just 2% 
of your body’s mass but consumes more than 20%
of the oxygen in your blood. That oxygen is carried to the brain
through a system of arteries. Carotid arteries supply 
the front of the brain, and vertebral arteries supply the back. These are connected to each other, and divide into smaller 
and smaller vessels that get billions of neurons 
the oxygen they need. If the blood flow is interrupted, 
oxygen delivery stops and brain cells die. There are two ways this can happen. Hemorrhagic strokes are when a perforated
vessel allows blood to leak out. But the more common type 
is the ischemic stroke, when a clot blocks a vessel 
and brings blood flow to a halt. Where do these clots come from? On rare occasions,
a sudden change in heart rhythm prevents the upper chambers of the heart
from contracting normally. This slows down blood flow, allowing platelets, clotting factors, 
and fibrin to stick together. The clot can be carried up towards the arteries
and blood vessels supplying the brain until it gets to one 
it can’t squeeze through. This is called an embolism and it cuts off the oxygen supply 
to all the cells downstream. The brain doesn't have pain receptors,
so you can't feel the blockage itself. But oxygen deprivation 
slows brain function and can have sudden, noticeable effects. For example, if the affected area 
is responsible for speech, an individual’s words may be slurred. If the stroke affects a part of the brain 
that controls muscle movement, it can cause weakness, 
often just on one side of the body. When this happens, the body 
will immediately try to compensate by diverting blood flow 
to the affected area, but this isn’t a perfect solution. Eventually, the oxygen-deprived cells 
will start to die, leading to brain damage 
that may be severe or permanent. That’s why it’s important to get
medical care as fast as possible. The first line of treatment
is an intravenous medication called Tissue Plasminogen Activator, which can break up the blood clot and allow blood to flow again
in the compromised artery. If it’s delivered within a few hours, this medication greatly increases
the chance of surviving the stroke and avoiding permanent consequences. If Tissue Plasminogen Activator
cannot be given because the patient 
is on certain medications, has history of major bleeding, or the clot is particularly large, doctors can perform a procedure
called an endovascular thrombectomy. Using a fluorescent dye that illuminates 
the blood vessels under a strong x-ray, the physician inserts a long, 
thin, flexible tube called a catheter into an artery in the leg and maneuvers
it all the way to the blockage. A retriever is passed
through this catheter. It expands and anchors into the clot 
when it’s just past it. The catheter then pulls the clot out 
when it’s removed. These treatments need to be delivered
as soon as possible to preserve brain function, which means figuring out fast 
if someone is having a stroke. So how can you tell? Here are three quick things to try: 1. Ask the person to smile. A crooked mouth or facial drooping 
can indicate muscle weakness. 2. Ask them to raise their arms. If one drifts downward, that arm weakness
is also a sign of a stroke. 3. Ask them to repeat a
simple word or phrase. If their speech sounds
slurred or strange, it could mean that the language area 
of their brain is oxygen-deprived. This is sometimes called the FAST test,
and the T stands for time. If you see any of those signs, 
call emergency services right away. Lives may depend on it.

Question 2: What is the primary cause of strokes? Options: A. Heart failure, B. High blood pressure, C. Deprivation of brain cells of oxygen, D. Cancer Correct Option: C

However, this question does not specifically ask about the arteries that supply blood to the brain.

A more relevant question would be one that specifically asks about the arteries or blood supply to the brain. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

However, I can suggest a possible generated MCQ that could be a good match:

Question: What arteries are responsible for supplying blood to the front and back of the brain? Options: A. Carotid and vertebral arteries, B. Subclavian and axillary arteries, C. Artery of Adamkiewicz, D. Ascending pharyngeal artery Correct Option: A

This question is not present in the generated MCQs, but it would be a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

Since I have to provide an index, I will provide -1 to indicate that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Somewhere between the orbits 
of Mars and Jupiter, about 500 million kilometers 
away from Earth, floats a metallic orb 
the size of Massachusetts. That’s no moon...it’s 16 Psyche, one of the most massive
asteroids in the solar system. And it is the asteroid 
our droids are looking for. We humans have managed 
to send robotic spacecraft to all sorts of environments in space – the gas clouds of Saturn and Jupiter, the icy wastes of Europa, and the rocky dunes of Mars. But Psyche’s surface 
isn’t just hard rock – it’s heavy metal. The asteroid mostly consists 
of nickel and iron, by far the largest known body 
with such a composition. But we don’t yet know what it looks like; our best current radar images 
show a pixelated smudge. That’ll change in 2026, when an unmanned spacecraft sent as
part of NASA’s Discovery Program is scheduled to arrive. So why is NASA so interested in Psyche? Are we going to mine all that metal, 
or build a giant space magnet? Actually, the real reason 
is right under our feet. The core of the Earth is thought 
to consist of a solid nickel-iron center with a molten outer layer. But we’re prevented from studying it up
close by 2,800 kilometers of solid rock. The deepest we’ve been able 
to drill is 12 kilometers. Even if we could go further, the pressure at the core is three million
times higher than at the surface, with a temperature 
of 5,000 degrees Celsius. Simply put, a journey to the center of
the Earth is out of the question for now. So scientists have had to resort 
to indirect ways of studying the core, like measuring earthquake waves 
that pass through it, or studying minerals thought 
to have formed there. But what if the best way to study 
Earth’s inner space is by visiting outer space? After all, we have a pretty
good idea of how our planets formed. Dust and gas orbiting our young Sun 
cooled and collided to form a few thousand miniature bodies 
we call planetesimals. As these continued to orbit,
some combined to grow larger, eventually forming our planets. Others experienced impacts 
that broke them apart into smaller chunks– the asteroids we see today 
in the belt between Mars and Jupiter. What makes Psyche so special is that it appears 
to have been a planetesimal well on its way to becoming a planet, with a rocky exterior 
surrounding a metal core. But its progress was cut short 
by a series of hit-and-run collisions with other planetesimals that knocked off the rocky crust 
until only the core remained. Experiencing that many 
destructive collisions with no additive ones in between 
is statistically very unlikely, making Psyche an amazingly 
rare opportunity to study an exposed metallic core. To do that, NASA’s robotic orbiter 
will be equipped with an array of advanced instruments. A spectrometer will analyze 
the gamma rays and neutrons produced when Psyche 
is struck by cosmic rays. Each element in the periodic table releases gamma rays 
of specific wavelengths, so these measurements will tell us 
what elements are found on the surface. A magnetometer will measure 
Psyche’s magnetic field, allowing us to learn more about how Earth’s magnetic field 
is generated at its core. And of course, an imager will give us 
a closer look at the surface than ever before. Visiting a whole new kind of world 
is exciting enough on its own. But the mission to Psyche gives us 
a unique chance to discover our own planet’s innermost 
secrets in an orbit far, far away.

**Transcript**:
Somewhere between the orbits 
of Mars and Jupiter, about 500 million kilometers 
away from Earth, floats a metallic orb 
the size of Massachusetts. That’s no moon...it’s 16 Psyche, one of the most massive
asteroids in the solar system. And it is the asteroid 
our droids are looking for. We humans have managed 
to send robotic spacecraft to all sorts of environments in space – the gas clouds of Saturn and Jupiter, the icy wastes of Europa, and the rocky dunes of Mars. But Psyche’s surface 
isn’t just hard rock – it’s heavy metal. The asteroid mostly consists 
of nickel and iron, by far the largest known body 
with such a composition. But we don’t yet know what it looks like; our best current radar images 
show a pixelated smudge. That’ll change in 2026, when an unmanned spacecraft sent as
part of NASA’s Discovery Program is scheduled to arrive. So why is NASA so interested in Psyche? Are we going to mine all that metal, 
or build a giant space magnet? Actually, the real reason 
is right under our feet. The core of the Earth is thought 
to consist of a solid nickel-iron center with a molten outer layer. But we’re prevented from studying it up
close by 2,800 kilometers of solid rock. The deepest we’ve been able 
to drill is 12 kilometers. Even if we could go further, the pressure at the core is three million
times higher than at the surface, with a temperature 
of 5,000 degrees Celsius. Simply put, a journey to the center of
the Earth is out of the question for now. So scientists have had to resort 
to indirect ways of studying the core, like measuring earthquake waves 
that pass through it, or studying minerals thought 
to have formed there. But what if the best way to study 
Earth’s inner space is by visiting outer space? After all, we have a pretty
good idea of how our planets formed. Dust and gas orbiting our young Sun 
cooled and collided to form a few thousand miniature bodies 
we call planetesimals. As these continued to orbit,
some combined to grow larger, eventually forming our planets. Others experienced impacts 
that broke them apart into smaller chunks– the asteroids we see today 
in the belt between Mars and Jupiter. What makes Psyche so special is that it appears 
to have been a planetesimal well on its way to becoming a planet, with a rocky exterior 
surrounding a metal core. But its progress was cut short 
by a series of hit-and-run collisions with other planetesimals that knocked off the rocky crust 
until only the core remained. Experiencing that many 
destructive collisions with no additive ones in between 
is statistically very unlikely, making Psyche an amazingly 
rare opportunity to study an exposed metallic core. To do that, NASA’s robotic orbiter 
will be equipped with an array of advanced instruments. A spectrometer will analyze 
the gamma rays and neutrons produced when Psyche 
is struck by cosmic rays. Each element in the periodic table releases gamma rays 
of specific wavelengths, so these measurements will tell us 
what elements are found on the surface. A magnetometer will measure 
Psyche’s magnetic field, allowing us to learn more about how Earth’s magnetic field 
is generated at its core. And of course, an imager will give us 
a closer look at the surface than ever before. Visiting a whole new kind of world 
is exciting enough on its own. But the mission to Psyche gives us 
a unique chance to discover our own planet’s innermost 
secrets in an orbit far, far away.

**Transcript**:
Here's an intriguing fact. In the developed world, everywhere, women live an average
of six to eight years longer than men do. Six to eight years longer. That's, like, a huge gap. In 2015, the "Lancet" published an article showing that men in rich countries are twice as likely to die as women are at any age. But there is one place in the world where men live as long as women. It's a remote, mountainous zone, a blue zone, where super longevity is common to both sexes. This is the blue zone in Sardinia, an Italian island in the Mediterranean, between Corsica and Tunisia, where there are six times
as many centenarians as on the Italian mainland, less than 200 miles away. There are 10 times as many centenarians as there are in North America. It's the only place
where men live as long as women. But why? My curiosity was piqued. I decided to research the science
and the habits of the place, and I started with the genetic profile. I discovered soon enough that genes account for just
25 percent of their longevity. The other 75 percent is lifestyle. So what does it take
to live to 100 or beyond? What are they doing right? What you're looking at
is an aerial view of Villagrande. It's a village at the epicenter
of the blue zone where I went to investigate this, and as you can see, architectural beauty
is not its main virtue, density is: tightly spaced houses, interwoven alleys and streets. It means that the villagers' lives
constantly intersect. And as I walked through the village, I could feel hundreds
of pairs of eyes watching me from behind doorways and curtains, from behind shutters. Because like all ancient villages, Villagrande couldn't have survived without this structure,
without its walls, without its cathedral, without its village square, because defense and social cohesion
defined its design. Urban priorities changed as we moved
towards the industrial revolution because infectious disease
became the risk of the day. But what about now? Now, social isolation
is the public health risk of our time. Now, a third of the population says they have two or fewer people to lean on. But let's go to Villagrande
now as a contrast to meet some centenarians. Meet Giuseppe Murinu.
He's 102, a supercentenarian and a lifelong resident
of the village of Villagrande. He was a gregarious man. He loved to recount stories such as how he lived like a bird from what he could find
on the forest floor during not one but two world wars, how he and his wife,
who also lived past 100, raised six children
in a small, homey kitchen where I interviewed him. Here he is with his sons
Angelo and Domenico, both in their 70s
and looking after their father, and who were quite frankly
very suspicious of me and my daughter who came along with me
on this research trip, because the flip side of social cohesion is a wariness of strangers and outsiders. But Giuseppe, he wasn't suspicious at all. He was a happy-go-lucky guy, very outgoing with a positive outlook. And I wondered: so is that what it takes
to live to be 100 or beyond, thinking positively? Actually, no. (Laughter) Meet Giovanni Corrias. He's 101, the grumpiest person I have ever met. (Laughter) And he put a lie to the notion that you have to be positive
to live a long life. And there is evidence for this. When I asked him why he lived so long, he kind of looked at me
under hooded eyelids and he growled, "Nobody has to know my secrets." (Laughter) But despite being a sourpuss, the niece who lived with him
and looked after him called him "Il Tesoro," "my treasure." And she respected him and loved him, and she told me, when I questioned
this obvious loss of her freedom, "You just don't understand, do you? Looking after this man is a pleasure. It's a huge privilege for me. This is my heritage." And indeed, wherever I went
to interview these centenarians, I found a kitchen party. Here's Giovanni with his two nieces, Maria above him and beside him his great-niece Sara, who came when I was there
to bring fresh fruits and vegetables. And I quickly discovered by being there that in the blue zone, as people age, and indeed across their lifespans, they're always surrounded
by extended family, by friends, by neighbors, the priest,
the barkeeper, the grocer. People are always there or dropping by. They are never left
to live solitary lives. This is unlike the rest
of the developed world, where as George Burns quipped, "Happiness is having a large,
loving, caring family in another city." (Laughter) Now, so far we've only met men, long-living men, but I met women too, and here you see Zia Teresa. She, at over 100, taught me
how to make the local specialty, which is called culurgiones, which are these large pasta pockets like ravioli about this size, this size, and they're filled
with high-fat ricotta and mint and drenched in tomato sauce. And she showed me
how to make just the right crimp so they wouldn't open, and she makes them
with her daughters every Sunday and distributes them
by the dozens to neighbors and friends. And that's when I discovered
a low-fat, gluten-free diet is not what it takes
to live to 100 in the blue zone. (Applause) Now, these centenarians' stories
along with the science that underpins them prompted me to ask myself
some questions too, such as, when am I going to die
and how can I put that day off? And as you will see,
the answer is not what we expect. Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a researcher
at Brigham Young University and she addressed this very question in a series of studies of tens of thousands of middle aged people much like this audience here. And she looked at every
aspect of their lifestyle: their diet, their exercise, their marital status, how often they went to the doctor, whether they smoked or drank, etc. She recorded all of this and then she and her colleagues
sat tight and waited for seven years to see who would still be breathing. And of the people left standing, what reduced their chances
of dying the most? That was her question. So let's now look at her data in summary, going from the least powerful
predictor to the strongest. OK? So clean air, which is great, it doesn't predict how long you will live. Whether you have your hypertension treated is good. Still not a strong predictor. Whether you're lean or overweight,
you can stop feeling guilty about this, because it's only in third place. How much exercise you get is next, still only a moderate predictor. Whether you've had a cardiac event
and you're in rehab and exercising, getting higher now. Whether you've had a flu vaccine. Did anybody here know that having a flu vaccine
protects you more than doing exercise? Whether you were drinking and quit, or whether you're a moderate drinker, whether you don't smoke,
or if you did, whether you quit, and getting towards the top predictors are two features of your social life. First, your close relationships. These are the people
that you can call on for a loan if you need money suddenly, who will call the doctor
if you're not feeling well or who will take you to the hospital, or who will sit with you
if you're having an existential crisis, if you're in despair. Those people, that little clutch of people are a strong predictor, if you have them,
of how long you'll live. And then something that surprised me, something that's called
social integration. This means how much
you interact with people as you move through your day. How many people do you talk to? And these mean both
your weak and your strong bonds, so not just the people
you're really close to, who mean a lot to you, but, like, do you talk to the guy
who every day makes you your coffee? Do you talk to the postman? Do you talk to the woman who walks
by your house every day with her dog? Do you play bridge or poker,
have a book club? Those interactions
are one of the strongest predictors of how long you'll live. Now, this leads me to the next question: if we now spend more time online
than on any other activity, including sleeping, we're now up to 11 hours a day, one hour more than last year, by the way, does it make a difference? Why distinguish
between interacting in person and interacting via social media? Is it the same thing as being there if you're in contact constantly
with your kids through text, for example? Well, the short answer
to the question is no, it's not the same thing. Face-to-face contact releases
a whole cascade of neurotransmitters, and like a vaccine,
they protect you now in the present and well into the future. So simply making
eye contact with somebody, shaking hands, giving somebody a high-five is enough to release oxytocin, which increases your level of trust and it lowers your cortisol levels. So it lowers your stress. And dopamine is generated,
which gives us a little high and it kills pain. It's like a naturally produced morphine. Now, all of this passes
under our conscious radar, which is why we conflate
online activity with the real thing. But we do have evidence now,
fresh evidence, that there is a difference. So let's look at some of the neuroscience. Elizabeth Redcay, a neuroscientist
at the University of Maryland, tried to map the difference between what goes on in our brains
when we interact in person versus when we're watching
something that's static. And what she did was
she compared the brain function of two groups of people, those interacting live with her or with one of her research associates in a dynamic conversation, and she compared that
to the brain activity of people who were watching her talk
about the same subject but in a canned video, like on YouTube. And by the way, if you want to know how she fit two people
in an MRI scanner at the same time, talk to me later. So what's the difference? This is your brain
on real social interaction. What you're seeing
is the difference in brain activity between interacting in person
and taking in static content. In orange, you see the brain areas
that are associated with attention, social intelligence -- that means anticipating
what somebody else is thinking and feeling and planning -- and emotional reward. And these areas become much more engaged when we're interacting
with a live partner. Now, these richer brain signatures might be why recruiters
from Fortune 500 companies evaluating candidates thought that the candidates were smarter when they heard their voices compared to when they just
read their pitches in a text, for example, or an email or a letter. Now, our voices and body language
convey a rich signal. It shows that we're thinking, feeling, sentient human beings who are much more than an algorithm. Now, this research by Nicholas Epley at the University of Chicago
Business School is quite amazing because
it tells us a simple thing. If somebody hears your voice, they think you're smarter. I mean, that's quite a simple thing. Now, to return to the beginning, why do women live longer than men? And one major reason
is that women are more likely to prioritize and groom
their face-to-face relationships over their lifespans. Fresh evidence shows that these in-person friendships create a biological force field
against disease and decline. And it's not just true of humans but their primate relations,
our primate relations as well. Anthropologist Joan Silk's work
shows that female baboons who have a core of female friends show lower levels of stress
via their cortisol levels, they live longer and they have
more surviving offspring. At least three stable relationships. That was the magic number. Think about it. I hope you guys have three. The power of such face-to-face contact is really why there are
the lowest rates of dementia among people who are socially engaged. It's why women who have breast cancer are four times more likely
to survive their disease than loners are. Why men who've had a stroke
who meet regularly to play poker or to have coffee or to play old-timer's hockey -- I'm Canadian, after all -- (Laughter) are better protected
by that social contact than they are by medication. Why men who've had a stroke
who meet regularly -- this is something very
powerful they can do. This face-to-face contact
provides stunning benefits, yet now almost a quarter of the population
says they have no one to talk to. We can do something about this. Like Sardinian villagers, it's a biological imperative
to know we belong, and not just the women among us. Building in-person interaction
into our cities, into our workplaces, into our agendas bolsters the immune system, sends feel-good hormones
surging through the bloodstream and brain and helps us live longer. I call this building your village, and building it and sustaining it
is a matter of life and death. Thank you. (Applause) Helen Walters: Susan, come back.
I have a question for you. I'm wondering if there's a middle path. So you talk about the neurotransmitters
connecting when in face-to-face, but what about digital technology? We've seen enormous improvements
in digital technology like FaceTime, things like that. Does that work too? I mean, I see my nephew. He plays Minecraft
and he's yelling at his friends. It seems like he's connecting pretty well. Is that useful? Is that helpful? Susan Pinker: Some of the data
are just emerging. The data are so fresh
that the digital revolution happened and the health data trailed behind. So we're just learning, but I would say
there are some improvements that we could make in the technology. For example, the camera on your laptop
is at the top of the screen, so for example, when you're
looking into the screen, you're not actually making eye contact. So something as simple
as even just looking into the camera can increase those neurotransmitters, or maybe changing
the position of the camera. So it's not identical, but I think
we are getting closer with the technology. HW: Great. Thank you so much. SP: Thank you. (Applause)

to bring fresh fruits and vegetables. And I quickly discovered by being there that in the blue zone, as people age, and indeed across their lifespans, they're always surrounded
by extended family, by friends, by neighbors, the priest,
the barkeeper, the grocer. People are always there or dropping by. They are never left
to live solitary lives. This is unlike the rest
of the developed world, where as George Burns quipped, "Happiness is having a large,
loving, caring family in another city." (Laughter) Now, so far we've only met men, long-living men, but I met women too, and here you see Zia Teresa. She, at over 100, taught me
how to make the local specialty, which is called culurgiones, which are these large pasta pockets like ravioli about this size, this size, and they're filled
with high-fat ricotta and mint and drenched in tomato sauce. And she showed me
how to make just the right crimp so they wouldn't open, and she makes them
with her daughters every Sunday and distributes them
by the dozens to neighbors and friends. And that's when I discovered
a low-fat, gluten-free diet is not what it takes

if you're having an existential crisis, if you're in despair. Those people, that little clutch of people are a strong predictor, if you have them,
of how long you'll live. And then something that surprised me, something that's called
social integration. This means how much
you interact with people as you move through your day. How many people do you talk to? And these mean both
your weak and your strong bonds, so not just the people
you're really close to, who mean a lot to you, but, like, do you talk to the guy
who every day makes you your coffee? Do you talk to the postman? Do you talk to the woman who walks
by your house every day with her dog? Do you play bridge or poker,
have a book club? Those interactions
are one of the strongest predictors of how long you'll live. Now, this leads me to the next question: if we now spend more time online
than on any other activity, including sleeping, we're now up to 11 hours a day, one hour more than last year, by the way, does it make a difference? Why distinguish
between interacting in person and interacting via social media? Is it the same thing as being there if you're in contact constantly
with your kids through text, for example? Well, the short answer
to the question is no, it's not the same thing. Face-to-face contact releases
a whole cascade of neurotransmitters, and like a vaccine,
they protect you now in the present and well into the future. So simply making
eye contact with somebody, shaking hands, giving somebody a high-five is enough to release oxytocin, which increases your level of trust and it lowers your cortisol levels. So it lowers your stress. And dopamine is generated,
which gives us a little high and it kills pain. It's like a naturally produced morphine. Now, all of this passes
under our conscious radar, which is why we conflate
online activity with the real thing. But we do have evidence now,
fresh evidence, that there is a difference. So let's look at some of the neuroscience. Elizabeth Redcay, a neuroscientist
at the University of Maryland, tried to map the difference between what goes on in our brains
when we interact in person versus when we're watching
something that's static. And what she did was
she compared the brain function of two groups of people, those interacting live with her or with one of her research associates in a dynamic conversation, and she compared that
to the brain activity of people who were watching her talk
about the same subject but in a canned video, like on YouTube. And by the way, if you want to know how she fit two people
in an MRI scanner at the same time, talk to me later. So what's the difference? This is your brain
on real social interaction. What you're seeing
is the difference in brain activity between interacting in person
and taking in static content. In orange, you see the brain areas
that are associated with attention, social intelligence -- that means anticipating
what somebody else is thinking and feeling and planning -- and emotional reward. And these areas become much more engaged when we're interacting
with a live partner. Now, these richer brain signatures might be why recruiters
from Fortune 500 companies evaluating candidates thought that the candidates were smarter when they heard their voices compared to when they just
read their pitches in a text, for example, or an email or a letter. Now, our voices and body language
convey a rich signal. It shows that we're thinking, feeling, sentient human beings who are much more than an algorithm. Now, this research by Nicholas Epley at the University of Chicago
Business School is quite amazing because
it tells us a simple thing. If somebody hears your voice, they think you're smarter. I mean, that's quite a simple thing. Now, to return to the beginning, why do women live longer than men? And one major reason
is that women are more likely to prioritize and groom
their face-to-face relationships over their lifespans. Fresh evidence shows that these in-person friendships create a biological force field
against disease and decline. And it's not just true of humans but their primate relations,
our primate relations as well. Anthropologist Joan Silk's work
shows that female baboons who have a core of female friends show lower levels of stress
via their cortisol levels, they live longer and they have
more surviving offspring. At least three stable relationships. That was the magic number. Think about it. I hope you guys have three. The power of such face-to-face contact is really why there are
the lowest rates of dementia among people who are socially engaged. It's why women who have breast cancer are four times more likely
to survive their disease than loners are. Why men who've had a stroke
who meet regularly to play poker or to have coffee or to play old-timer's hockey -- I'm Canadian, after all -- (Laughter) are better protected
by that social contact than they are by medication. Why men who've had a stroke
who meet regularly -- this is something very
powerful they can do. This face-to-face contact
provides stunning benefits, yet now almost a quarter of the population
says they have no one to talk to. We can do something about this. Like Sardinian villagers, it's a biological imperative
to know we belong, and not just the women among us. Building in-person interaction
into our cities, into our workplaces, into our agendas bolsters the immune system, sends feel-good hormones
surging through the bloodstream and brain and helps us live longer. I call this building your village, and building it and sustaining it
is a matter of life and death. Thank you. (Applause) Helen Walters: Susan, come back.
I have a question for you. I'm wondering if there's a middle path. So you talk about the neurotransmitters
connecting when in face-to-face, but what about digital technology? We've seen enormous improvements
in digital technology like FaceTime, things like that. Does that work too? I mean, I see my nephew. He plays Minecraft
and he's yelling at his friends. It seems like he's connecting pretty well. Is that useful? Is that helpful? Susan Pinker: Some of the data
are just emerging. The data are so fresh
that the digital revolution happened and the health data trailed behind. So we're just learning, but I would say
there are some improvements that we could make in the technology. For example, the camera on your laptop
is at the top of the screen, so for example, when you're
looking into the screen, you're not actually making eye contact. So something as simple
as even just looking into the camera can increase those neurotransmitters, or maybe changing
the position of the camera. So it's not identical, but I think
we are getting closer with the technology. HW: Great. Thank you so much. SP: Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
When historians talk about 
the atrocities of the 20th century, we often think of those that took place
during and between the two World Wars. Along with the Armenian genocide 
in modern-day Turkey, the Rape of Nanking in China, and Kristallnacht in Germany, another horrific ethnic cleansing campaign occurred on an island between 
the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The roots of this conflict 
go back to 1492, when Christopher Columbus stumbled 
onto the Caribbean island that would come to be named Hispaniola,
launching a wave of European colonization. The island’s Taíno natives were decimated 
by violence and disease and the Europeans imported large numbers
of enslaved Africans to toil in profitable sugar plantations. By 1777, the island had become divided between a French-controlled West 
and a Spanish-controlled East. A mass slave revolt won Haiti 
its independence from France in 1804 and it became the world’s 
first Black republic. But the new nation paid dearly, shut out of the world economy and 
saddled with debt by its former masters. Meanwhile, the Dominican Republic 
would declare independence by first overthrowing Haitian rule 
of eastern Hispaniola and later Spanish 
and American colonialism. Despite the long and collaborative history
shared by these two countries, many Dominican elites saw Haiti 
as a racial threat that imperiled political and commercial
relations with white western nations. In the years following World War I, the United States occupied 
both parts of the island. It did so to secure its power 
in the Western hemisphere by destroying local opposition 
and installing US-friendly governments. The brutal and racist nature 
of the US occupation, particularly along the remote
Dominican-Haitian border, laid the foundation for bigger atrocities 
after its withdrawal. In 1930, liberal Dominican president 
Horacio Vásquez was overthrown by the chief of his army, 
Rafael Trujillo. Despite being a quarter Haitian himself, Trujillo saw the presence of a bicultural 
Haitian and Dominican borderland as both a threat to his power and an escape route 
for political revolutionaries. In a chilling speech on October 2, 1937, he left no doubt about his intentions 
for the region. Claiming to be protecting Dominican
farmers from theft and incursion, Trujillo announced the killing 
of 300 Haitians along the border and promised that this so-called "remedy" 
would continue. Over the next few weeks, 
the Dominican military, acting on Trujillo’s orders, murdered thousands of Haitian men 
and women, and even their Dominican-born children. The military targeted Black Haitians, even though many Dominicans themselves 
were also dark-skinned. Some accounts say that to distinguish
the residents of one country from the other, the killers forced their victims 
to say the Spanish word for parsley. Dominicans pronounce it perejil, 
with a trilled Spanish "r." The primary Haitian language, however,
is Kreyol, which doesn’t use a trilled r. So if people struggled to say perejil, they were judged to be Haitian 
and immediately killed. Yet recent scholarship suggests 
that tests like this weren’t the sole factor used to determine
who would be murdered, especially because many of the border 
residents were bilingual. The Dominican government censored
any news of the massacre, while bodies were thrown in ravines, dumped in rivers, or burned to dispose of the evidence. This is why no one knows exactly 
how many people were murdered, though contemporary estimates 
range from about 4,000 to 15,000. Yet the extent of the carnage 
was clear to many observers. As the US Ambassador to 
the Dominican Republic at the time noted, “The entire northwest of the frontier
on the Dajabón side is absolutely devoid of Haitians. Those not slain either fled across the
frontier or are still hiding in the bush.” The government tried 
to disclaim responsibility and blame the killings 
on vigilante civilians, but Trujillo was condemned 
internationally. Eventually, the Dominican government was forced to pay only $525,000 
in reparations to Haiti, but due to corrupt bureaucracy, barely any of these funds reached 
survivors or their families. Neither Trujillo nor anyone 
in his government was ever punished for this crime 
against humanity. The legacy of the massacre remains 
a source of tension between the two countries. Activists on both sides of the border 
have tried to heal the wounds of the past. But the Dominican state has done little, 
if anything, to officially commemorate 
the massacre or its victims. Meanwhile, the memory of the Haitian
massacre remains a chilling reminder of how power-hungry leaders
can manipulate people into turning against 
their lifelong neighbors.

internationally. Eventually, the Dominican government was forced to pay only $525,000 
in reparations to Haiti, but due to corrupt bureaucracy, barely any of these funds reached 
survivors or their families. Neither Trujillo nor anyone 
in his government was ever punished for this crime 
against humanity. The legacy of the massacre remains 
a source of tension between the two countries. Activists on both sides of the border 
have tried to heal the wounds of the past. But the Dominican state has done little, 
if anything, to officially commemorate 
the massacre or its victims. Meanwhile, the memory of the Haitian
massacre remains a chilling reminder of how power-hungry leaders
can manipulate people into turning against 
their lifelong neighbors.

**Transcript**:
When historians talk about 
the atrocities of the 20th century, we often think of those that took place
during and between the two World Wars. Along with the Armenian genocide 
in modern-day Turkey, the Rape of Nanking in China, and Kristallnacht in Germany, another horrific ethnic cleansing campaign occurred on an island between 
the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The roots of this conflict 
go back to 1492, when Christopher Columbus stumbled 
onto the Caribbean island that would come to be named Hispaniola,
launching a wave of European colonization. The island’s Taíno natives were decimated 
by violence and disease and the Europeans imported large numbers
of enslaved Africans to toil in profitable sugar plantations. By 1777, the island had become divided between a French-controlled West 
and a Spanish-controlled East. A mass slave revolt won Haiti 
its independence from France in 1804 and it became the world’s 
first Black republic. But the new nation paid dearly, shut out of the world economy and 
saddled with debt by its former masters. Meanwhile, the Dominican Republic 
would declare independence by first overthrowing Haitian rule 
of eastern Hispaniola and later Spanish 
and American colonialism. Despite the long and collaborative history
shared by these two countries, many Dominican elites saw Haiti 
as a racial threat that imperiled political and commercial
relations with white western nations. In the years following World War I, the United States occupied 
both parts of the island. It did so to secure its power 
in the Western hemisphere by destroying local opposition 
and installing US-friendly governments. The brutal and racist nature 
of the US occupation, particularly along the remote
Dominican-Haitian border, laid the foundation for bigger atrocities 
after its withdrawal. In 1930, liberal Dominican president 
Horacio Vásquez was overthrown by the chief of his army, 
Rafael Trujillo. Despite being a quarter Haitian himself, Trujillo saw the presence of a bicultural 
Haitian and Dominican borderland as both a threat to his power and an escape route 
for political revolutionaries. In a chilling speech on October 2, 1937, he left no doubt about his intentions 
for the region. Claiming to be protecting Dominican
farmers from theft and incursion, Trujillo announced the killing 
of 300 Haitians along the border and promised that this so-called "remedy" 
would continue. Over the next few weeks, 
the Dominican military, acting on Trujillo’s orders, murdered thousands of Haitian men 
and women, and even their Dominican-born children. The military targeted Black Haitians, even though many Dominicans themselves 
were also dark-skinned. Some accounts say that to distinguish
the residents of one country from the other, the killers forced their victims 
to say the Spanish word for parsley. Dominicans pronounce it perejil, 
with a trilled Spanish "r." The primary Haitian language, however,
is Kreyol, which doesn’t use a trilled r. So if people struggled to say perejil, they were judged to be Haitian 
and immediately killed. Yet recent scholarship suggests 
that tests like this weren’t the sole factor used to determine
who would be murdered, especially because many of the border 
residents were bilingual. The Dominican government censored
any news of the massacre, while bodies were thrown in ravines, dumped in rivers, or burned to dispose of the evidence. This is why no one knows exactly 
how many people were murdered, though contemporary estimates 
range from about 4,000 to 15,000. Yet the extent of the carnage 
was clear to many observers. As the US Ambassador to 
the Dominican Republic at the time noted, “The entire northwest of the frontier
on the Dajabón side is absolutely devoid of Haitians. Those not slain either fled across the
frontier or are still hiding in the bush.” The government tried 
to disclaim responsibility and blame the killings 
on vigilante civilians, but Trujillo was condemned 
internationally. Eventually, the Dominican government was forced to pay only $525,000 
in reparations to Haiti, but due to corrupt bureaucracy, barely any of these funds reached 
survivors or their families. Neither Trujillo nor anyone 
in his government was ever punished for this crime 
against humanity. The legacy of the massacre remains 
a source of tension between the two countries. Activists on both sides of the border 
have tried to heal the wounds of the past. But the Dominican state has done little,

can manipulate people into turning against

**Transcript**:
You heard the traveler's tales, you followed the crumbling maps, and now, after a long and dangerous quest, you have some good news and some bad news. The good news is you've managed to locate
the legendary dungeon containing the stash 
of ancient Stygian coins and the eccentric wizard 
who owns the castle has even generously
agreed to let you have them. The bad news is that he's not
quite as generous about letting you leave the dungeon,
unless you solve his puzzle. The task sounds simple enough. Both faces of each coin bear
the fearsome scorpion crest, one in silver, one in gold. And all you have to do is separate them
into two piles so that each has the same number
of coins facing silver side up. You're about to begin when all
of the torches suddenly blow out and you're left in total darkness. There are hundreds 
of coins in front of you and each one feels the same on both sides. You try to remember 
where the silver-facing coins were, but it's hopeless. You've lost track. But you do know one thing for certain. When there was still light, you counted exactly 
20 silver-side-up coins in the pile. What can you do? Are you doomed to remain in the dungeon
with your newfound treasure forever? You're tempted to kick the pile of coins and curse the curiosity 
that brought you here. But at the last moment, you stop yourself. You just realized there's 
a surprisingly easy solution. What is it? Pause here if you want to figure
it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You carefully move aside 20 coins
one by one. It doesn't matter which ones:
any coins will do, and then flip each one of them over. That's all there is to it. Why does such a simple solution work? Well, it doesn't matter how many
coins there are to start with. What matters is that only 20
of the total are facing silver side up. When you take 20 coins in the darkness, you have no way of knowing how many
of these silver-facing coins have ended up in your new pile. But let's suppose you got 7 of them. This means that there are 13
silver-facing coins left in the original pile. It also means that the other
13 coins in your new pile are facing gold side up. So what happens when you flip
all of the coins in the new pile over? Seven gold-facing coins and
13 silver-facing coins to match the ones in the original pile. It turns out this works no matter how
many of the silver-facing coins you grab, whether it's all of them, 
a few, or none at all. That's because of what's known
as complementary events. We know that each coin only has
two possible options. If it's not facing silver side up,
it must be gold side up, and vice versa, and in any combination of 20 coins, the number of gold-facing
and silver-facing coins must add up to 20. We can prove this mathematically
using algebra. The number of silver-facing coins
remaining in the original pile will always be 20 minus
however many you moved to the new pile. And since your new pile also
has a total of 20 coins, its number of gold-facing coins will be 20 minus the amount of 
silver-facing coins you moved. When all the coins in the new pile
are flipped, these gold-facing coins become
silver-facing coins, so now the number of silver-facing
coins in both piles is the same. The gate swings open
and you hurry away with your treasure before the wizard changes his mind. At the next crossroads, you flip
one of your hard-earned coins to determine the way 
to your next adventure. But before you go, we have another 
quick coin riddle for you – one that comes from this video 
sponsor’s excellent website. Here we have 8 arrangements of coins. You can flip over adjacent pairs of coins 
as many times as you like. A flip always changes gold to silver, 
and silver to gold. Can you figure out how to tell, 
at a glance, which arrangements can be made all gold? You can try an interactive version of

The correct answer, "They are complementary," implies that the number of silver-side-up coins in the original pile and the number of gold-side-up coins in the new pile add up to 20, which is the same as the total number of silver-side-up coins initially.

Although this question does not directly ask if the total number of coins matters, it addresses the underlying concept that makes the solution work, regardless of the total number of coins.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 5 (index 5) is the most similar generated MCQ. However, please note that this is an indirect match, and a more direct question about the total number of coins would be a better match.

To create a direct match, a generated MCQ could be:

Question: Does the total number of coins affect the solution to the problem? Options: A. Yes, B. No Correct Option: B

Unfortunately, this question is not present in the list of generated MCQs.

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 9, Question 2
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
You heard the traveler's tales, you followed the crumbling maps, and now, after a long and dangerous quest, you have some good news and some bad news. The good news is you've managed to locate
the legendary dungeon containing the stash 
of ancient Stygian coins and the eccentric wizard 
who owns the castle has even generously
agreed to let you have them. The bad news is that he's not
quite as generous about letting you leave the dungeon,
unless you solve his puzzle. The task sounds simple enough. Both faces of each coin bear
the fearsome scorpion crest, one in silver, one in gold. And all you have to do is separate them
into two piles so that each has the same number
of coins facing silver side up. You're about to begin when all
of the torches suddenly blow out and you're left in total darkness. There are hundreds 
of coins in front of you and each one feels the same on both sides. You try to remember 
where the silver-facing coins were, but it's hopeless. You've lost track. But you do know one thing for certain. When there was still light, you counted exactly 
20 silver-side-up coins in the pile. What can you do? Are you doomed to remain in the dungeon
with your newfound treasure forever? You're tempted to kick the pile of coins and curse the curiosity 
that brought you here. But at the last moment, you stop yourself. You just realized there's 
a surprisingly easy solution. What is it? Pause here if you want to figure
it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You carefully move aside 20 coins
one by one. It doesn't matter which ones:
any coins will do, and then flip each one of them over. That's all there is to it. Why does such a simple solution work? Well, it doesn't matter how many
coins there are to start with. What matters is that only 20
of the total are facing silver side up. When you take 20 coins in the darkness, you have no way of knowing how many
of these silver-facing coins have ended up in your new pile. But let's suppose you got 7 of them. This means that there are 13
silver-facing coins left in the original pile. It also means that the other
13 coins in your new pile are facing gold side up. So what happens when you flip
all of the coins in the new pile over? Seven gold-facing coins and
13 silver-facing coins to match the ones in the original pile. It turns out this works no matter how
many of the silver-facing coins you grab, whether it's all of them, 
a few, or none at all. That's because of what's known
as complementary events. We know that each coin only has
two possible options. If it's not facing silver side up,
it must be gold side up, and vice versa, and in any combination of 20 coins, the number of gold-facing
and silver-facing coins must add up to 20. We can prove this mathematically
using algebra. The number of silver-facing coins
remaining in the original pile will always be 20 minus
however many you moved to the new pile. And since your new pile also
has a total of 20 coins, its number of gold-facing coins will be 20 minus the amount of 
silver-facing coins you moved. When all the coins in the new pile
are flipped, these gold-facing coins become
silver-facing coins, so now the number of silver-facing
coins in both piles is the same. The gate swings open
and you hurry away with your treasure before the wizard changes his mind. At the next crossroads, you flip
one of your hard-earned coins to determine the way 
to your next adventure. But before you go, we have another 
quick coin riddle for you – one that comes from this video 
sponsor’s excellent website. Here we have 8 arrangements of coins. You can flip over adjacent pairs of coins 
as many times as you like. A flip always changes gold to silver, 
and silver to gold. Can you figure out how to tell, 
at a glance, which arrangements can be made all gold? You can try an interactive version of 
this puzzle and confirm your solution on Brilliant’s website. We love Brilliant.org because the site 
gives you tools to approach problem-solving in

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of silver-facing coins the traveler originally sees before the total darkness in the dungeon. 

A somewhat related generated MCQ is Question 3, which asks what the traveler needs to do to solve the problem in the darkness and mentions moving aside 20 coins. However, it does not directly ask about the number of silver-facing coins.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 3. However, I want to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 6: What is the result of flipping all the coins in the new pile over? Options: A. The number of silver-side-up coins in both piles is different, B. The number of gold-side-up coins in both piles is different, C. The number of silver-side-up coins in both piles is the same, D. The number of gold-side-up coins in both piles is the same Correct Option: C**

This generated MCQ is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ because:

1. Both questions are related to the outcome of flipping the coins in the new pile.
2. Both questions have options that refer to the number of silver-side-up coins in both piles.
3. Both questions have the correct option stating that the number of silver-side-up coins in both piles is the same.

However, I must note that the ground truth MCQ asks about the specific number of coins facing silver side up, whereas the generated MCQ asks about the result of flipping the coins in general. Therefore, while Question 6 is the most similar, it is not an exact match.

If I had to choose an exact match, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the closest match, I would choose Question 6.

two possible options. If it's not facing silver side up,
it must be gold side up, and vice versa, and in any combination of 20 coins, the number of gold-facing
and silver-facing coins must add up to 20. We can prove this mathematically

remaining in the original pile will always be 20 minus
however many you moved to the new pile. And since your new pile also
has a total of 20 coins, its number of gold-facing coins will be 20 minus the amount of 
silver-facing coins you moved. When all the coins in the new pile
are flipped, these gold-facing coins become
silver-facing coins, so now the number of silver-facing
coins in both piles is the same. The gate swings open
and you hurry away with your treasure before the wizard changes his mind. At the next crossroads, you flip
one of your hard-earned coins to determine the way 
to your next adventure. But before you go, we have another 
quick coin riddle for you – one that comes from this video 
sponsor’s excellent website. Here we have 8 arrangements of coins. You can flip over adjacent pairs of coins 
as many times as you like. A flip always changes gold to silver, 
and silver to gold. Can you figure out how to tell, 
at a glance, which arrangements can be made all gold? You can try an interactive version of 
this puzzle and confirm your solution on Brilliant’s website. We love Brilliant.org because the site

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 3: What is the traveler needs to do to solve the problem in the darkness? Options: A. Count the number of silver-side-up coins, B. Flip all the coins over, C. Move aside 20 coins and flip each one of them over, D. Try to remember where the silver-side-up coins were Correct Option: C**

This generated MCQ matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. Both questions are asking about the solution to the problem, and the correct option in both cases involves moving aside a certain number of coins and flipping them over.

However, it's worth noting that the ground truth MCQ asks about the general case ("In general, how many coins would you need to count out in a new pile and flip over?"), while the generated MCQ is more specific to the situation described in the transcript ("What is the traveler needs to do to solve the problem in the darkness?"). Nevertheless, the generated MCQ is the closest match among the options provided.

**Transcript**:
This pencil-eraser-sized mass of cells 
is something called a brain organoid. It’s a collection of lab-grown neurons 
and other brain tissue that scientists can use to
learn about full-grown human brains. And it can be grown from 
a sample of your skin cells. Why would we need such a thing? Neuroscientists face a challenge: shielded by our thick skulls and
swaddled in layers of protective tissue, the human brain is
extremely difficult to observe in action. For centuries, scientists have tried to
understand them using autopsies, animal models, and, in recent years, imaging techniques. We’ve learned a lot through 
all these methods, but they have limitations. Conditions like Alzheimer’s 
and schizophrenia, and the effect on
the human brain of diseases like Zika, continue to hide beyond our view,
and our understanding. Enter brain organoids, 
which function like human brains but aren’t part of an organism. Each one comes from 
an undifferentiated stem cell, which is a cell that
can develop into any tissue in the body, from bone to brain. Scientists can make undifferentiated 
stem cells from skin cells. That means they can take a skin sample 
from a person with a particular condition and generate brain organoids
from that person. The hardest part of growing 
a brain organoid, which stumped scientists for years, was finding the perfect combination of
sugars, proteins, vitamins, and minerals that would induce the stem cell 
to develop a neural identity. That was only discovered recently, 
in 2013. The rest of the process 
is surprisingly easy. A neural stem cell essentially 
grows itself, similar to how a seed grows into a plant, all it needs are the brain’s equivalents 
of soil, water, and sunlight. A special gel to simulate 
embryonic tissue, a warm incubator set at body temperature, and a bit of motion to mimic blood flow. The stem cell grows into 
a very small version of an early-developing human brain, complete with neurons that can connect
to one another and make simplified neural networks. As mini brains grow, they follow 
all the steps of fetal brain development. By observing this process, 
we can learn how our neurons develop, as well as how we end up with 
so many more of them in our cortex, the part responsible for higher cognition
like logic and reasoning, than other species. Being able to grow brains in the lab,
even tiny ones, raises ethical questions, like: Can they think for themselves, 
or develop consciousness? And the answer is no, for several reasons. A brain organoid has the same tissue types
as a full-sized brain, but isn’t organized the same way. The organoid is similar to an airplane that’s been taken apart 
and reassembled at random; you could still study the wings, 
the engine, and other parts, but the plane could never fly. Similarly, a brain organoid allows us 
to study different types of brain tissue, but can’t think. And even if mini brains were organized 
like a real brain, they still wouldn’t be able 
to reason or develop consciousness. A big part of what makes our brains so
smart is their size, and mini brains have only 
about 100,000 neurons compared to the 86 billion 
in a full-sized brain. Scientists aren’t likely to grow larger 
brain organoids anytime soon. Without blood vessels to feed them, their size is limited 
to one centimeter at most. Finally, mini brains aren’t able 
to interact with the outside world. We learn by interacting 
with our environments: receiving inputs through our eyes, ears, and other 
sensory organs, and reacting in turn. The complex neural networks that underlie 
conscious thoughts and actions develop from this feedback loop. Without it, the organoids 
can never form a functional network. There’s nothing quite like 
the actual human brain, but mini brains are an unprecedented tool for studying everything 
from development to disease. With luck, these humble 
organoids can help us discover what makes the human brain unique, and maybe bring us closer 
to answering the age-old question: what makes us human?

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the size of a brain organoid, while the generated MCQs do not have a direct match for this question. However, Question 1 mentions that a brain organoid is "a collection of lab-grown neurons and other brain tissue" and is described in the transcript as being "pencil-eraser-sized". 

Although not a perfect match, the closest generated MCQ that mentions a descriptive aspect of brain organoids is Question 1.

as a full-sized brain, but isn’t organized the same way. The organoid is similar to an airplane that’s been taken apart 
and reassembled at random; you could still study the wings, 
the engine, and other parts, but the plane could never fly. Similarly, a brain organoid allows us 
to study different types of brain tissue, but can’t think. And even if mini brains were organized 
like a real brain, they still wouldn’t be able 
to reason or develop consciousness. A big part of what makes our brains so
smart is their size, and mini brains have only 
about 100,000 neurons compared to the 86 billion 
in a full-sized brain. Scientists aren’t likely to grow larger 
brain organoids anytime soon. Without blood vessels to feed them, their size is limited 
to one centimeter at most. Finally, mini brains aren’t able 
to interact with the outside world. We learn by interacting 
with our environments: receiving inputs through our eyes, ears, and other 
sensory organs, and reacting in turn. The complex neural networks that underlie 
conscious thoughts and actions develop from this feedback loop. Without it, the organoids 
can never form a functional network. There’s nothing quite like 
the actual human brain, but mini brains are an unprecedented tool for studying everything 
from development to disease. With luck, these humble 
organoids can help us discover what makes the human brain unique, and maybe bring us closer 
to answering the age-old question: what makes us human?

**Transcript**:
This pencil-eraser-sized mass of cells 
is something called a brain organoid. It’s a collection of lab-grown neurons 
and other brain tissue that scientists can use to
learn about full-grown human brains. And it can be grown from 
a sample of your skin cells. Why would we need such a thing? Neuroscientists face a challenge: shielded by our thick skulls and
swaddled in layers of protective tissue, the human brain is
extremely difficult to observe in action. For centuries, scientists have tried to
understand them using autopsies, animal models, and, in recent years, imaging techniques. We’ve learned a lot through 
all these methods, but they have limitations. Conditions like Alzheimer’s 
and schizophrenia, and the effect on
the human brain of diseases like Zika, continue to hide beyond our view,
and our understanding. Enter brain organoids, 
which function like human brains but aren’t part of an organism. Each one comes from 
an undifferentiated stem cell, which is a cell that
can develop into any tissue in the body, from bone to brain. Scientists can make undifferentiated 
stem cells from skin cells. That means they can take a skin sample 
from a person with a particular condition and generate brain organoids
from that person. The hardest part of growing 
a brain organoid, which stumped scientists for years, was finding the perfect combination of
sugars, proteins, vitamins, and minerals that would induce the stem cell 
to develop a neural identity. That was only discovered recently, 
in 2013. The rest of the process 
is surprisingly easy. A neural stem cell essentially 
grows itself, similar to how a seed grows into a plant, all it needs are the brain’s equivalents 
of soil, water, and sunlight. A special gel to simulate 
embryonic tissue, a warm incubator set at body temperature, and a bit of motion to mimic blood flow. The stem cell grows into 
a very small version of an early-developing human brain, complete with neurons that can connect
to one another and make simplified neural networks. As mini brains grow, they follow 
all the steps of fetal brain development. By observing this process, 
we can learn how our neurons develop, as well as how we end up with 
so many more of them in our cortex, the part responsible for higher cognition
like logic and reasoning, than other species. Being able to grow brains in the lab,
even tiny ones, raises ethical questions, like: Can they think for themselves, 
or develop consciousness? And the answer is no, for several reasons. A brain organoid has the same tissue types
as a full-sized brain, but isn’t organized the same way. The organoid is similar to an airplane that’s been taken apart 
and reassembled at random; you could still study the wings,

**Transcript**:
Health is the most valuable thing we have in life, but we tend to forget that until we lose it. We're living longer than ever before, which is great, but an unforeseen consequence of this is that we also spend a larger and larger portion of our lives being sick. Getting old currently means spending more time in pain. So scientists are trying to shift the attention of the medical community from optimizing lifespans to optimizing healthspans, the part of our lives during which we're disease free. To do this, we need to attack the root cause of almost all bodily defects: aging itself. Unbeknown to most people, the science of aging has made enormous progress In the last few years, with human trials about to begin in the near future. Let's look at three examples of discoveries that might benefit people who are alive right now INTRO 1: senescent cells. Your cells have an expiration date. Each time one of your cells divides, it copies its chromosomes. Because of the way this works, they lose a tiny bit of DNA at the ends. This could be catastrophic, so to protect themselves we have long segments of DNA called telomeres that sort of act like the stiff bits at the end of shoelaces, but they shrink with every cell division. In some cells, after a number of divisions the telomeres are gone, and the cell becomes a zombie, a senescent cell. Senescent cells stay around and don't die. The older you get the more of them are inside you. They harmed tissue around them and are linked to many diseases that accompany old age like diabetes and kidney failure. But what if you could kill them off? Scientists genetically engineered mice so that they could destroy their senescent cells as they pleased. Older mice without senescent cells were more active. Their hearts and kidneys worked better, and they were less prone to cancer. Overall, they lived up to 30 percent longer and in better health than average mice. Since we can't genetically engineer all the cells in the human body, we need to find another way to get rid of our senescent cells. But how do we kill them without harming healthy cells? Most cells in the body commit a programmed cell suicide when they're damaged, but senescent cells don't. It turns out that they underproduce a protein that tells them when it's time to die. So in a late 2016 study, mice were given an injection of this protein. It killed 80 % of all their senescent cells, while causing almost no harm to healthy cells. The treated mice became generally healthier and even regrew lost hair. As a result, there are a number of new companies looking at treatments involving senescent cells and the first human trials will start soon. 2: NAD+ Cells are made of hundreds of millions of parts. They're the structures, machines, messages, and the catalysts that make reactions happen. All these parts constantly need to be destroyed, cleaned up, and rebuilt. As we age, this process becomes less effective and so parts become crumpled, bunched up, or are removed slower, or they are no longer produced in the quantities we need. One of these parts is NAD+, a coenzyme that tells ourselves to look after themselves. At age 50, we only have about half as much in our bodies as we do at age 20. Low amounts of it are linked to a whole bunch of diseases from skin cancer to Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. But NAD+ can't enter cells so we can't get it as a pill. But scientists notice that other more flexible substances could enter cells and would then turn into an NAD+ inside. In 2016, multiple trials on mice showed that they boosted the multiplication of skin, brain, and muscle stem cells. They were rejuvenated, had a higher ability to repair their DNA, and had a slightly increased lifespan, This even got NASA interested, which is looking for a way to minimize the DNA damage astronauts would be exposed to from cosmic radiation on Mars missions. There are human trials being planned right now, but it's too soon to say if this will boost our healthspan or even lifespan. But NAD+ is a serious candidate and could become the first human anti-aging pill. 3: stem cells Stem cells are like cell blueprints that sit at various places in the body and copy themselves to produce a steady flow of fresh young cells, but they decline as we age and so we decline too. Without new parts, human bodies break. In mice, scientists observed that as the stem cells in their brains disappeared, they started to develop diseases So they took stem cells from baby mice brains and injected them directly into the brains of middle-aged mice, more specifically the hypothalamus, a polyp that's involved in regulating a lot of bodily functions. The fresh stem cells reinvigorated older brain cells by secreting micro RNAs that regulated their metabolism. After 4 months, brain and muscles worked better than those of untreated mice and on average, they lived ten percent longer. Another study took stem cells from mice embryos and injected them directly into the hearts of older mice. As a consequence, they had improved heart function, could exercise 20% longer, and weirdly enough their hair regrew faster. Conclusion What all of this tells us is that there is not a single magic bullet with which to cure aging. It requires a complex array of different therapies. We can kill off senescent cells to clear away the junk, give ourselves fresh new stem cells to fill the gap, all while regulating the metabolism of the other cells using medication. This video comes with a big caveat. After all, these studies have been carried out on mice. There's no guarantee the same therapies would work in us to the same extent, but they are proof of concepts. To learn more about how we can modify our own healthspan, we need human trials. We've only covered a tiny part of the research that's being done right now, and only scratched the surface of these ideas. The field of healthspan extension needs more attention and funding. If it gets it, all of us might enjoy growing old without pain If you now want to support the research on aging directly, you can do so at lifespan.io, a community of people actively supporting the scientists working to cure aging.

**Transcript**:
If you were to lay your digestive tract
out in a straight line, it would form a tube 
spanning nearly ten meters. The last 1.5 meters of that
are called the colon, or large intestine. Cells in this organ's lining 
constantly renew themselves, but the genes that moderate this process
occasionally go awry, leading to the excessive growth 
of new cells. That results in small growths
or abnormal clumps of cells called polyps. The majority of these polyps 
won't do any harm, but some can become cancerous
when their cells begin to grow and divide rapidly, projecting further into the colon. At that point, they can transform
into colon cancer, one of the most prevalent and
preventable forms of cancer in the world. That's a slow process: though growth times vary, it often takes around ten years
for a small polyp to grow and develop into a cancerous one. We don't know exactly what causes the majority of colon polyps 
and colon cancers. We do know in general that colon cancer
involves the activation of what's called oncogenes in the polyp, and/or the loss of tumor-suppressor genes
that usually keep cancer cells in check. Most cells have proto-oncogenes
that help them grow. When a proto-oncogene mutates,
or there are two many copies of it, it can become a permanently 
active oncogene with cells that grow out of control. While we don't yet know exactly what
underlying factors cause these changes, experts suspect a combination
of both environmental and inherited genetic factors. In the worst cases, when cells within
polyps divide and spread unchecked, they eventually break through
the lining of the colon. Lymph and blood vessels carry
those cells all over the body, and they can go on to form tumors. Despite these challenges,
there's a solution. We've become extremely good at
detecting and removing offending polyps before they can cause cancer. This happens through a process
called screening, and when we do it regularly,
we can prevent many cases of colon cancer. So, who's at risk? Most cases occur in people 
aged 50 years or older. This group is considered at average risk
for colon cancer or colon polyps. There's also a higher risk group
that includes people with personal or family histories 
of colon polyps or cancer, and those who suffer 
from inherited genetic syndromes, or inflammatory diseases, like Crohn’s disease 
and ulcerative colitis. So the best age to initiate screening
varies from person to person. If you have access to healthcare, it's best to consult a doctor
to find out when you should begin. Screening can be done with various tests. Colonoscopy involves 
a long, thin, flexible tube that's fitted with a video camera
and light at the end and placed internally to examine
the colon for polyps. If polyps are found, a doctor
can do a polypectomy, a procedure that removes polyps
from the colonic wall. Doctors can also then test
the polyp for cancerous cells. Colonoscopy is the only test that can
be used to both find and remove polyps. There are, however, 
other useful screening tests, including imaging and at-home tests that can allow patients to examine their stool 
for small amounts of blood. Occasionally, polyps are too large
to be removed during a colonoscopy, in which case, the next step is surgery. If blood and imaging tests then reveal that cancerous cells 
have spread outside the colon, then a special treatment,
like chemotherapy, may also be required to stop
the cancer from escalating. We can also take on certain habits to reduce our likelihood of developing
colon cancer in the first place. There's evidence that maintaining
a healthy weight, not smoking, and being physically active can help. But most importantly, 
access to healthcare and regular screenings 
at crucial times in life are the best ways to prevent colon cancer.

detecting and removing offending polyps before they can cause cancer. This happens through a process
called screening, and when we do it regularly,
we can prevent many cases of colon cancer. So, who's at risk? Most cases occur in people 
aged 50 years or older. This group is considered at average risk
for colon cancer or colon polyps. There's also a higher risk group
that includes people with personal or family histories 
of colon polyps or cancer, and those who suffer 
from inherited genetic syndromes, or inflammatory diseases, like Crohn’s disease 
and ulcerative colitis. So the best age to initiate screening
varies from person to person. If you have access to healthcare, it's best to consult a doctor
to find out when you should begin. Screening can be done with various tests. Colonoscopy involves 
a long, thin, flexible tube that's fitted with a video camera
and light at the end and placed internally to examine
the colon for polyps. If polyps are found, a doctor
can do a polypectomy, a procedure that removes polyps
from the colonic wall. Doctors can also then test
the polyp for cancerous cells. Colonoscopy is the only test that can
be used to both find and remove polyps. There are, however, 
other useful screening tests, including imaging and at-home tests that can allow patients to examine their stool 
for small amounts of blood. Occasionally, polyps are too large
to be removed during a colonoscopy, in which case, the next step is surgery. If blood and imaging tests then reveal that cancerous cells 
have spread outside the colon, then a special treatment,
like chemotherapy, may also be required to stop
the cancer from escalating. We can also take on certain habits to reduce our likelihood of developing
colon cancer in the first place. There's evidence that maintaining
a healthy weight, not smoking, and being physically active can help. But most importantly, 
access to healthcare and regular screenings 
at crucial times in life are the best ways to prevent colon cancer.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
If you were to lay your digestive tract
out in a straight line, it would form a tube 
spanning nearly ten meters. The last 1.5 meters of that
are called the colon, or large intestine. Cells in this organ's lining 
constantly renew themselves, but the genes that moderate this process
occasionally go awry, leading to the excessive growth 
of new cells. That results in small growths
or abnormal clumps of cells called polyps. The majority of these polyps 
won't do any harm, but some can become cancerous
when their cells begin to grow and divide rapidly, projecting further into the colon. At that point, they can transform
into colon cancer, one of the most prevalent and
preventable forms of cancer in the world. That's a slow process: though growth times vary, it often takes around ten years
for a small polyp to grow and develop into a cancerous one. We don't know exactly what causes the majority of colon polyps 
and colon cancers. We do know in general that colon cancer
involves the activation of what's called oncogenes in the polyp, and/or the loss of tumor-suppressor genes
that usually keep cancer cells in check. Most cells have proto-oncogenes
that help them grow. When a proto-oncogene mutates,
or there are two many copies of it, it can become a permanently 
active oncogene with cells that grow out of control. While we don't yet know exactly what
underlying factors cause these changes, experts suspect a combination
of both environmental and inherited genetic factors. In the worst cases, when cells within
polyps divide and spread unchecked, they eventually break through
the lining of the colon. Lymph and blood vessels carry
those cells all over the body, and they can go on to form tumors. Despite these challenges,
there's a solution. We've become extremely good at

**Transcript**:
In the summer of 1997, NASA's Pathfinder spacecraft landed 
on the surface of Mars, and began transmitting incredible,
iconic images back to Earth. But several days in, 
something went terribly wrong. The transmissions stopped. Pathfinder was, in effect, 
procrastinating: keeping itself fully occupied 
but failing to do its most important work. What was going on? There was a bug, it turned out, 
in its scheduler. Every operating system has something 
called the scheduler that tells the CPU how long
to work on each task before switching, and what to switch to. Done right, computers move so fluidly 
between their various responsibilities, they give the illusion 
of doing everything simultaneously. But we all know what happens
when things go wrong. This should give us, if nothing else, 
some measure of consolation. Even computers get overwhelmed sometimes. Maybe learning about the computer science 
of scheduling can give us some ideas about our own
human struggles with time. One of the first insights is that all 
the time you spend prioritizing your work is time you aren't spending doing it. For instance, let's say when you check 
your inbox, you scan all the messages, choosing which is the most important. Once you've dealt with that one, 
you repeat. Seems sensible, 
but there's a problem here. This is what's known 
as a quadratic-time algorithm. With an inbox that's twice as
full, these passes will take twice as long and you'll need to do 
twice as many of them! This means four times the work. The programmers 
of the operating system Linux encountered a similar problem in 2003. Linux would rank every single 
one of its tasks in order of importance, and sometimes spent more time 
ranking tasks than doing them. The programmers’ counterintuitive solution
was to replace this full ranking with a limited number 
of priority “buckets.” The system was less precise 
about what to do next but more than made up for it 
by spending more time making progress. So with your emails, insisting on always 
doing the very most important thing first could lead to a meltdown. Waking up to an inbox three times fuller 
than normal could take nine times longer to clear. You’d be better off replying 
in chronological order, or even at random! Surprisingly, sometimes giving up 
on doing things in the perfect order may be the key to getting them done. Another insight that emerges 
from computer scheduling has to do with one of the most prevalent 
features of modern life: interruptions. When a computer goes 
from one task to another, it has to do what's called 
a context switch, bookmarking its place in one task, moving old data out of its memory 
and new data in. Each of these actions comes at a cost. The insight here is that there’s 
a fundamental tradeoff between productivity and responsiveness. Getting serious work done 
means minimizing context switches. But being responsive means reacting 
anytime something comes up. These two principles 
are fundamentally in tension. Recognizing this tension allows us to decide where 
we want to strike that balance. The obvious solution 
is to minimize interruptions. The less obvious one is to group them. If no notification 
or email requires a response more urgently than once an hour, say, then that’s exactly how often 
you should check them. No more. In computer science, this idea goes by 
the name of interrupt coalescing. Rather than dealing with 
things as they come up – Oh, the mouse was moved? A key was pressed? More of that file downloaded? – the system groups these

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although Question 3 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the time it takes to answer emails on a day with four times as many messages, following a quadratic-time algorithm. Question 3 asks about what happens when we prioritize our work in a quadratic-time algorithm, and one of the options mentions that it takes twice as long and requires twice as many passes. 

However, if we apply the same logic as the ground truth MCQ, we can infer that if the number of messages is four times as many, it would take 16 times longer (2 times longer and 2 times as many passes for twice the messages, and then again for another two times the messages). 

Therefore, while not an exact match, Question 3 is the closest match in terms of question intent and content.

**Transcript**:
In the summer of 1997, NASA's Pathfinder spacecraft landed 
on the surface of Mars, and began transmitting incredible,
iconic images back to Earth. But several days in, 
something went terribly wrong. The transmissions stopped. Pathfinder was, in effect, 
procrastinating: keeping itself fully occupied 
but failing to do its most important work. What was going on? There was a bug, it turned out, 
in its scheduler. Every operating system has something 
called the scheduler that tells the CPU how long
to work on each task before switching, and what to switch to. Done right, computers move so fluidly 
between their various responsibilities, they give the illusion 
of doing everything simultaneously. But we all know what happens
when things go wrong. This should give us, if nothing else, 
some measure of consolation. Even computers get overwhelmed sometimes. Maybe learning about the computer science 
of scheduling can give us some ideas about our own
human struggles with time. One of the first insights is that all 
the time you spend prioritizing your work is time you aren't spending doing it. For instance, let's say when you check 
your inbox, you scan all the messages, choosing which is the most important. Once you've dealt with that one, 
you repeat. Seems sensible, 
but there's a problem here. This is what's known 
as a quadratic-time algorithm. With an inbox that's twice as
full, these passes will take twice as long and you'll need to do 
twice as many of them! This means four times the work. The programmers 
of the operating system Linux encountered a similar problem in 2003. Linux would rank every single 
one of its tasks in order of importance, and sometimes spent more time 
ranking tasks than doing them. The programmers’ counterintuitive solution
was to replace this full ranking with a limited number 
of priority “buckets.” The system was less precise 
about what to do next but more than made up for it 
by spending more time making progress. So with your emails, insisting on always 
doing the very most important thing first could lead to a meltdown. Waking up to an inbox three times fuller 
than normal could take nine times longer to clear. You’d be better off replying 
in chronological order, or even at random! Surprisingly, sometimes giving up 
on doing things in the perfect order may be the key to getting them done. Another insight that emerges 
from computer scheduling has to do with one of the most prevalent 
features of modern life: interruptions. When a computer goes 
from one task to another, it has to do what's called 
a context switch, bookmarking its place in one task, moving old data out of its memory 
and new data in. Each of these actions comes at a cost. The insight here is that there’s 
a fundamental tradeoff between productivity and responsiveness. Getting serious work done 
means minimizing context switches. But being responsive means reacting 
anytime something comes up. These two principles 
are fundamentally in tension. Recognizing this tension allows us to decide where 
we want to strike that balance. The obvious solution 
is to minimize interruptions. The less obvious one is to group them. If no notification 
or email requires a response more urgently than once an hour, say, then that’s exactly how often 
you should check them. No more. In computer science, this idea goes by 
the name of interrupt coalescing. Rather than dealing with 
things as they come up – Oh, the mouse was moved? A key was pressed? More of that file downloaded? – the system groups these 
interruptions together based on how long they can afford to wait. In 2013, interrupt coalescing triggered a massive improvement 
in laptop battery life. This is because deferring interruptions

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In the summer of 1997, NASA's Pathfinder spacecraft landed 
on the surface of Mars, and began transmitting incredible,
iconic images back to Earth. But several days in, 
something went terribly wrong. The transmissions stopped. Pathfinder was, in effect, 
procrastinating: keeping itself fully occupied 
but failing to do its most important work. What was going on? There was a bug, it turned out, 
in its scheduler. Every operating system has something 
called the scheduler that tells the CPU how long
to work on each task before switching, and what to switch to. Done right, computers move so fluidly 
between their various responsibilities, they give the illusion 
of doing everything simultaneously. But we all know what happens
when things go wrong. This should give us, if nothing else, 
some measure of consolation. Even computers get overwhelmed sometimes. Maybe learning about the computer science 
of scheduling can give us some ideas about our own
human struggles with time. One of the first insights is that all 
the time you spend prioritizing your work is time you aren't spending doing it. For instance, let's say when you check 
your inbox, you scan all the messages, choosing which is the most important. Once you've dealt with that one, 
you repeat. Seems sensible, 
but there's a problem here. This is what's known 
as a quadratic-time algorithm. With an inbox that's twice as
full, these passes will take twice as long and you'll need to do 
twice as many of them! This means four times the work. The programmers 
of the operating system Linux encountered a similar problem in 2003. Linux would rank every single 
one of its tasks in order of importance, and sometimes spent more time 
ranking tasks than doing them. The programmers’ counterintuitive solution
was to replace this full ranking with a limited number 
of priority “buckets.” The system was less precise 
about what to do next but more than made up for it 
by spending more time making progress. So with your emails, insisting on always 
doing the very most important thing first could lead to a meltdown. Waking up to an inbox three times fuller

in chronological order, or even at random! Surprisingly, sometimes giving up 
on doing things in the perfect order may be the key to getting them done. Another insight that emerges 
from computer scheduling has to do with one of the most prevalent 
features of modern life: interruptions. When a computer goes 
from one task to another, it has to do what's called 
a context switch, bookmarking its place in one task, moving old data out of its memory 
and new data in. Each of these actions comes at a cost. The insight here is that there’s 
a fundamental tradeoff between productivity and responsiveness. Getting serious work done 
means minimizing context switches. But being responsive means reacting 
anytime something comes up. These two principles 
are fundamentally in tension. Recognizing this tension allows us to decide where 
we want to strike that balance. The obvious solution 
is to minimize interruptions. The less obvious one is to group them. If no notification 
or email requires a response more urgently than once an hour, say, then that’s exactly how often 
you should check them. No more. In computer science, this idea goes by 
the name of interrupt coalescing. Rather than dealing with 
things as they come up – Oh, the mouse was moved? A key was pressed? More of that file downloaded? – the system groups these 
interruptions together based on how long they can afford to wait. In 2013, interrupt coalescing triggered a massive improvement 
in laptop battery life. This is because deferring interruptions 
lets a system check everything at once, then quickly re-enter a low-power state. As with computers, so it is with us. Perhaps adopting a similar approach might allow us users

**Transcript**:
In the summer of 1997, NASA's Pathfinder spacecraft landed 
on the surface of Mars, and began transmitting incredible,
iconic images back to Earth. But several days in, 
something went terribly wrong. The transmissions stopped. Pathfinder was, in effect, 
procrastinating: keeping itself fully occupied 
but failing to do its most important work. What was going on? There was a bug, it turned out, 
in its scheduler. Every operating system has something 
called the scheduler that tells the CPU how long
to work on each task before switching, and what to switch to. Done right, computers move so fluidly 
between their various responsibilities, they give the illusion 
of doing everything simultaneously. But we all know what happens
when things go wrong. This should give us, if nothing else, 
some measure of consolation. Even computers get overwhelmed sometimes. Maybe learning about the computer science 
of scheduling can give us some ideas about our own
human struggles with time. One of the first insights is that all 
the time you spend prioritizing your work is time you aren't spending doing it. For instance, let's say when you check 
your inbox, you scan all the messages, choosing which is the most important. Once you've dealt with that one, 
you repeat. Seems sensible, 
but there's a problem here. This is what's known 
as a quadratic-time algorithm. With an inbox that's twice as
full, these passes will take twice as long and you'll need to do 
twice as many of them! This means four times the work. The programmers 
of the operating system Linux encountered a similar problem in 2003. Linux would rank every single 
one of its tasks in order of importance, and sometimes spent more time 
ranking tasks than doing them. The programmers’ counterintuitive solution
was to replace this full ranking with a limited number 
of priority “buckets.” The system was less precise 
about what to do next but more than made up for it 
by spending more time making progress. So with your emails, insisting on always 
doing the very most important thing first could lead to a meltdown. Waking up to an inbox three times fuller 
than normal could take nine times longer to clear. You’d be better off replying 
in chronological order, or even at random! Surprisingly, sometimes giving up 
on doing things in the perfect order may be the key to getting them done. Another insight that emerges 
from computer scheduling has to do with one of the most prevalent 
features of modern life: interruptions. When a computer goes 
from one task to another, it has to do what's called

**Transcript**:
When desert locusts are well fed,
they're solitary creatures. But when food becomes scarce, hungry, desperate locusts
crowd onto small patches of land where they can still find 
something to eat. Contact between different locusts'
hind legs set off a slew of reactions that change their appearance and behavior. Now, instead of shunning their peers,
they seek each other out. The locusts eventually start marching
and then fly away in large numbers seeking a better habitat. These gigantic swarms can host
millions of insects and travel thousands of miles, devastating vegetation and crops. They stay close to each other,
but not too close, or they might get eaten
by their hungry neighbors. When many individual organisms, like locusts, bacteria, anchovies, or bats, come together and move 
as one coordinated entity, that's a swarm. From a handful of birds 
to billions of insects, swarms can be almost any size. But what they have in common
is that there's no leader. Members of the swarm interact
only with their nearest neighbors or through indirect cues. Each individual follows simple rules: Travel in the same direction 
as those around you, stay close, and avoid collisions. There are many benefits to traveling
in a group like this. Small prey may fool predators
by assembling into a swarm that looks like a much bigger organism. And congregating in a large group reduces the chance that any single 
individual will be captured. Moving in the same direction
as your neighbors saves energy by sharing the effort
of fighting wind or water resistance. It may even be easier 
to find a mate in a swarm. Swarming can also allow groups of animals to accomplish tasks 
they couldn’t do individually. When hundreds or millions or organisms
follow the same simple rules, sophisticated behavior called
swarm intelligence may arise. A single ant can't do much on its own, but an ant colony 
can solve complex problems, like building a nest and finding the shortest path
to a food source. But sometimes, things can go wrong. In a crowd, diseases spread more easily, and some swarming organisms may start
eating each other if food is scarce. Even some of the benefits of swarms,
like more efficient navigation, can have catastrophic consequences. Army ants are one example. They lay down chemicals called pheromones which signal their neighbors 
to follow the trail. This is good if the head of the group
is marching towards a food source. But occasionally the ants in the front
can veer off course. The whole swarm can get caught
in a loop following the pheromone trail until they die of exhaustion. Humans are notoriously individualistic,
though social, animals. But is there anything we can learn
from collective swarm-based organization? When it comes to technology,
the answer is definitely yes. Bats can teach drones how to navigate
confined spaces without colliding, fish can help design software
for safer driving, and insects are inspiring robot teams that
can assist search and rescue missions. For swarms of humans, 
it's perhaps more complicated and depends on the motives and leadership. Swarm behavior in human populations can
sometimes manifest as a destructive mob. But collective action can also produce
a crowd-sourced scientific breakthrough and artistic expression, or a peaceful global revolution.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks which group of organisms listed below swarm, with options including bacteria, locusts, anchovies, bats, and all of the above. The correct answer is "all of the above."

Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is the most similar in terms of content, as it mentions benefits of swarming that are applicable to multiple organisms, including small prey (which could refer to anchovies or other small animals), congregating in a large group (which could refer to locusts, bats, or other organisms), and moving in the same direction as neighbors (which could refer to any of the mentioned organisms). However, Question 9 does not directly ask which organisms swarm.

A more direct match is not available among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar, but it's still not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
When desert locusts are well fed,
they're solitary creatures. But when food becomes scarce, hungry, desperate locusts
crowd onto small patches of land where they can still find 
something to eat. Contact between different locusts'
hind legs set off a slew of reactions that change their appearance and behavior. Now, instead of shunning their peers,
they seek each other out. The locusts eventually start marching
and then fly away in large numbers seeking a better habitat. These gigantic swarms can host
millions of insects and travel thousands of miles, devastating vegetation and crops. They stay close to each other,
but not too close, or they might get eaten
by their hungry neighbors. When many individual organisms, like locusts, bacteria, anchovies, or bats, come together and move 
as one coordinated entity, that's a swarm. From a handful of birds 
to billions of insects, swarms can be almost any size. But what they have in common
is that there's no leader. Members of the swarm interact
only with their nearest neighbors or through indirect cues. Each individual follows simple rules: Travel in the same direction 
as those around you, stay close, and avoid collisions. There are many benefits to traveling
in a group like this. Small prey may fool predators
by assembling into a swarm that looks like a much bigger organism. And congregating in a large group reduces the chance that any single 
individual will be captured. Moving in the same direction
as your neighbors saves energy by sharing the effort
of fighting wind or water resistance. It may even be easier 
to find a mate in a swarm. Swarming can also allow groups of animals to accomplish tasks 
they couldn’t do individually. When hundreds or millions or organisms
follow the same simple rules, sophisticated behavior called
swarm intelligence may arise. A single ant can't do much on its own, but an ant colony 
can solve complex problems, like building a nest and finding the shortest path
to a food source. But sometimes, things can go wrong. In a crowd, diseases spread more easily, and some swarming organisms may start
eating each other if food is scarce. Even some of the benefits of swarms,
like more efficient navigation, can have catastrophic consequences. Army ants are one example. They lay down chemicals called pheromones which signal their neighbors 
to follow the trail. This is good if the head of the group
is marching towards a food source. But occasionally the ants in the front
can veer off course. The whole swarm can get caught
in a loop following the pheromone trail until they die of exhaustion. Humans are notoriously individualistic,
though social, animals. But is there anything we can learn
from collective swarm-based organization? When it comes to technology,
the answer is definitely yes. Bats can teach drones how to navigate
confined spaces without colliding, fish can help design software
for safer driving, and insects are inspiring robot teams that
can assist search and rescue missions. For swarms of humans, 
it's perhaps more complicated and depends on the motives and leadership. Swarm behavior in human populations can
sometimes manifest as a destructive mob. But collective action can also produce
a crowd-sourced scientific breakthrough and artistic expression, or a peaceful global revolution.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 4 does not cover all the disadvantages mentioned in the ground truth MCQ, I also considered other questions that might match the intent and content.

Question 3 mentions some benefits of traveling in a swarm, but Question 6 and Question 9 also mention some benefits. Question 4 mentions a situation where swarm behavior can have catastrophic consequences, which is related to the disadvantages mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

Considering the options and content, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match, but it would need to be modified to include more options to match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Giant gold-digging ants, a furious king who orders
the sea to be whipped 300 times, and a dolphin that saves
a famous poet from drowning. These are just some of the stories
from The Histories by Herodotus, an Ancient Greek writer from
the 5th century BCE. Not all the events in the text 
may have happened exactly as Herodotus reported them, but this work revolutionized
the way the past was recorded. Before Herodotus, the past was documented
as a list of events with little or no attempt to explain
their causes beyond accepting things
as the will of the gods. Herodotus wanted a deeper,
more rational understanding, so he took a new approach: looking at events from both sides
to understand the reasons for them. Though he was Greek, Herodotus's
hometown of Halicarnassus was part of the Persian Empire. He grew up during a series of wars
between the powerful Persians and the smaller Greeks, and decided to find out all he could
about the subject. In Herodotus's telling, the Persian Wars
began in 499 BCE, when the Athenians assisted a rebellion
by Greeks living under Persian rule. In 490, the Persian King, Darius,
sent his army to take revenge on Athens. But at the Battle of Marathon,
the Athenians won an unexpected victory. Ten years later, the Persians returned,
planning to conquer the whole of Greece under the leadership 
of Darius's son, Xerxes. According to Herodotus,
when Xerxes arrived, his million man army was initially
opposed by a Greek force led by 300 Spartans at the mountain pass
of Thermopylae. At great cost to the Persians, the Spartans and their king, Leonidas,
were killed. This heroic defeat has been an inspiration
to underdogs ever since. A few weeks later, the Greek navy
tricked the Persian fleet into fighting in a narrow sea channel
near Athens. The Persians were defeated and Xerxes
fled, never to return. To explain how these wars broke out
and why the Greeks triumphed, Herodotus collected stories
from all around the Mediterranean. He recorded the achievements of both
Greeks and non-Greeks before they were lost
to the passage of time. The Histories opens 
with the famous sentence: "Herodotus, of Halicarnassus, 
here displays his inquiries." By framing the book as an “inquiry,” Herodotus allowed it to contain 
many different stories, some serious, others less so. He recorded the internal debates
of the Persian court but also tales of Egyptian flying snakes and practical advice 
on how to catch a crocodile. The Greek word for this method
of research is "autopsy," meaning "seeing for oneself." Herodotus was the first writer
to examine the past by combining the different kinds
of evidence he collected: opsis, or eyewitness accounts, akoe, or hearsay, and ta legomena, or tradition. He then used gnome, or reason, to reach conclusions 
about what actually happened. Many of the book's early readers
were actually listeners. The Histories was originally written
in 28 sections, each of which took about 
four hours to read aloud. As the Greeks increased in influence
and power, Herodotus's writing and the idea of history
spread across the Mediterranean. As the first proper historian,
Herodotus wasn't perfect. On occasions, he favored
the Greeks over the Persians and was too quick to believe
some of the stories that he heard, which made for inaccuracies. However, modern evidence 
has actually explained some of his apparently extreme claims. For instance, there's a species 
of marmot in the Himalayas that spreads gold dust while digging. The ancient Persian word for marmot
is quite close to the word for ant, so Herodotus may have just fallen prey
to a translation error. All in all, for someone who was writing
in an entirely new style, Herodotus did remarkably well. History, right down to the present day, 
has always suffered from the partiality and mistakes of historians. Herodotus’s method 
and creativity earned him the title that the Roman author Cicero 
gave him several hundred years later: "The Father of History."

from The Histories by Herodotus, an Ancient Greek writer from
the 5th century BCE. Not all the events in the text 
may have happened exactly as Herodotus reported them, but this work revolutionized
the way the past was recorded. Before Herodotus, the past was documented
as a list of events with little or no attempt to explain
their causes beyond accepting things
as the will of the gods. Herodotus wanted a deeper,
more rational understanding, so he took a new approach: looking at events from both sides
to understand the reasons for them. Though he was Greek, Herodotus's
hometown of Halicarnassus was part of the Persian Empire. He grew up during a series of wars
between the powerful Persians and the smaller Greeks, and decided to find out all he could
about the subject. In Herodotus's telling, the Persian Wars
began in 499 BCE, when the Athenians assisted a rebellion
by Greeks living under Persian rule. In 490, the Persian King, Darius,
sent his army to take revenge on Athens. But at the Battle of Marathon,
the Athenians won an unexpected victory. Ten years later, the Persians returned,
planning to conquer the whole of Greece under the leadership 
of Darius's son, Xerxes. According to Herodotus,
when Xerxes arrived, his million man army was initially
opposed by a Greek force led by 300 Spartans at the mountain pass
of Thermopylae. At great cost to the Persians, the Spartans and their king, Leonidas,
were killed. This heroic defeat has been an inspiration
to underdogs ever since. A few weeks later, the Greek navy
tricked the Persian fleet into fighting in a narrow sea channel
near Athens. The Persians were defeated and Xerxes
fled, never to return. To explain how these wars broke out
and why the Greeks triumphed, Herodotus collected stories
from all around the Mediterranean. He recorded the achievements of both
Greeks and non-Greeks before they were lost
to the passage of time. The Histories opens 
with the famous sentence: "Herodotus, of Halicarnassus, 
here displays his inquiries." By framing the book as an “inquiry,” Herodotus allowed it to contain 
many different stories, some serious, others less so. He recorded the internal debates
of the Persian court but also tales of Egyptian flying snakes and practical advice 
on how to catch a crocodile. The Greek word for this method
of research is "autopsy," meaning "seeing for oneself." Herodotus was the first writer
to examine the past by combining the different kinds
of evidence he collected: opsis, or eyewitness accounts, akoe, or hearsay, and ta legomena, or tradition. He then used gnome, or reason, to reach conclusions 
about what actually happened. Many of the book's early readers
were actually listeners. The Histories was originally written
in 28 sections, each of which took about 
four hours to read aloud. As the Greeks increased in influence
and power, Herodotus's writing and the idea of history
spread across the Mediterranean. As the first proper historian,
Herodotus wasn't perfect. On occasions, he favored
the Greeks over the Persians and was too quick to believe
some of the stories that he heard, which made for inaccuracies. However, modern evidence 
has actually explained some of his apparently extreme claims. For instance, there's a species 
of marmot in the Himalayas that spreads gold dust while digging. The ancient Persian word for marmot
is quite close to the word for ant, so Herodotus may have just fallen prey
to a translation error. All in all, for someone who was writing
in an entirely new style, Herodotus did remarkably well. History, right down to the present day, 
has always suffered from the partiality and mistakes of historians. Herodotus’s method 
and creativity earned him the title that the Roman author Cicero 
gave him several hundred years later: "The Father of History."

**Transcript**:
Every year, the world uses 
35 billion barrels of oil. This massive scale of fossil fuel 
dependence pollutes the Earth and it won't last forever. Scientists estimate that we've consumed
about 40% of the world's oil. According to present estimates, at this rate, we'll run out of oil
and gas in 50 years or so, and in about a century for coal. On the flip side, we have abundant
sun, water, and wind. These are renewable energy sources, meaning that we won't use them up
over time. What if we could exchange 
our fossil fuel dependence for an existence based 
solely on renewables? We've pondered that question for decades, and yet, renewable energy still
only provides about 13% of our needs. That's because reaching 100% requires
renewable energy that's inexpensive and accessible. This represents a huge challenge, even if we ignore the politics involved
and focus on the science and engineering. We can better understand the problem
by understanding how we use energy. Global energy use is a diverse 
and complex system, and the different elements 
require their own solutions. But for now, we'll focus on two
of the most familiar in everyday life: electricity and liquid fuels. Electricity powers blast furnaces, 
elevators, computers, and all manner of things in homes,
businesses, and manufacturing. Meanwhile, liquid fuels 
play a crucial role in almost all forms of transportation. Let's consider the electrical 
portion first. The great news is that our technology
is already advanced enough to capture all that energy 
from renewables, and there's an ample supply. The sun continuously radiates about 173 quadrillion watts 
of solar energy at the Earth, which is almost 10,000 times
our present needs. It's been estimated that a surface that
spans several hundred thousand kilometers would be needed to power humanity
at our present usage levels. So why don't we build that? Because there are other 
hurdles in the way, like efficiency and energy transportation. To maximize efficiency, solar plants must be located in areas 
with lots of sunshine year round, like deserts. But those are far away 
from densely populated regions where energy demand is high. There are other forms of renewable energy
we could draw from, such as hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomasses, but they also have limits based on
availability and location. In principle, a connected electrical
energy network with power lines crisscrossing the globe would enable us to transport power
from where it's generated to where it's needed. But building a system on this scale
faces an astronomical price tag. We could lower the cost by developing
advanced technologies to capture energy more efficiently. The infrastructure for transporting energy
would also have to change drastically. Present-day power lines lose about 6-8%
of the energy they carry because wire material dissipates energy
through resistance. Longer power lines would mean
more energy loss. Superconductors could be one solution. Such materials can transport electricity
without dissipation. Unfortunately, they only work
if cooled to low temperatures, which requires energy 
and defeats the purpose. To benefit from that technology, we'd need to discover 
new superconducting materials that operate at room temperature. And what about the all-important,
oil-derived liquid fuels? The scientific challenge there is to store
renewable energy in an easily transportable form. Recently, we've gotten better
at producing lithium ion batteries, which are lightweight 
and have high-energy density. But even the best of these
store about 2.5 megajoules per kilogram. That's about 20 times less than the energy
in one kilogram of gasoline. To be truly competitive, car batteries
would have to store much more energy without adding cost. The challenges only increase 
for bigger vessels, like ships and planes. To power a cross-Atlantic 
flight for a jet, we'd need a battery weighing
about 1,000 tons. This, too, demands a technological leap
towards new materials, higher energy density, and better storage. One promising solution would be
to find efficient ways to convert solar into chemical energy. This is already happening in labs, but the efficiency is still too low
to allow it to reach the market. To find novel solutions, we'll need
lots of creativity, innovation, and powerful incentives. The transition towards all-renewable 
energies is a complex problem involving technology, 
economics, and politics. Priorities on how to tackle this challenge
depend on the specific assumptions we have to make when trying to solve
such a multifaceted problem. But there's ample reason to be optimistic
that we'll get there. Top scientific minds around the world
are working on these problems and making breakthroughs all the time. And many governments and businesses
are investing in technologies that harness the energy all around us.

we could draw from, such as hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomasses, but they also have limits based on
availability and location. In principle, a connected electrical
energy network with power lines crisscrossing the globe would enable us to transport power
from where it's generated to where it's needed. But building a system on this scale
faces an astronomical price tag. We could lower the cost by developing
advanced technologies to capture energy more efficiently. The infrastructure for transporting energy
would also have to change drastically. Present-day power lines lose about 6-8%
of the energy they carry because wire material dissipates energy
through resistance. Longer power lines would mean
more energy loss. Superconductors could be one solution. Such materials can transport electricity
without dissipation. Unfortunately, they only work
if cooled to low temperatures, which requires energy 
and defeats the purpose. To benefit from that technology, we'd need to discover 
new superconducting materials that operate at room temperature. And what about the all-important,
oil-derived liquid fuels? The scientific challenge there is to store
renewable energy in an easily transportable form. Recently, we've gotten better
at producing lithium ion batteries, which are lightweight 
and have high-energy density. But even the best of these
store about 2.5 megajoules per kilogram. That's about 20 times less than the energy
in one kilogram of gasoline. To be truly competitive, car batteries
would have to store much more energy without adding cost. The challenges only increase 
for bigger vessels, like ships and planes. To power a cross-Atlantic 
flight for a jet, we'd need a battery weighing
about 1,000 tons. This, too, demands a technological leap
towards new materials, higher energy density, and better storage. One promising solution would be
to find efficient ways to convert solar into chemical energy. This is already happening in labs, but the efficiency is still too low
to allow it to reach the market. To find novel solutions, we'll need
lots of creativity, innovation, and powerful incentives. The transition towards all-renewable 
energies is a complex problem involving technology, 
economics, and politics. Priorities on how to tackle this challenge
depend on the specific assumptions we have to make when trying to solve
such a multifaceted problem. But there's ample reason to be optimistic
that we'll get there. Top scientific minds around the world
are working on these problems and making breakthroughs all the time. And many governments and businesses
are investing in technologies that harness the energy all around us.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content of the transcript, Question 3 is the closest match in terms of discussing a quantitative comparison related to energy consumption.

However, since none of the generated MCQs discuss the specific comparison of the sun's energy to the earth's consumption, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say that the closest match is not present in the generated MCQs, but if I really had to pick one, I would say Question 7, which is a quantitative comparison of energy density, but this is still a very poor match.

Therefore, I will not provide an index of the most similar generated MCQ as none of them match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Every year, the world uses 
35 billion barrels of oil. This massive scale of fossil fuel 
dependence pollutes the Earth and it won't last forever. Scientists estimate that we've consumed
about 40% of the world's oil. According to present estimates, at this rate, we'll run out of oil
and gas in 50 years or so, and in about a century for coal. On the flip side, we have abundant
sun, water, and wind. These are renewable energy sources, meaning that we won't use them up
over time. What if we could exchange 
our fossil fuel dependence for an existence based 
solely on renewables? We've pondered that question for decades, and yet, renewable energy still
only provides about 13% of our needs. That's because reaching 100% requires
renewable energy that's inexpensive and accessible. This represents a huge challenge, even if we ignore the politics involved
and focus on the science and engineering. We can better understand the problem
by understanding how we use energy. Global energy use is a diverse 
and complex system, and the different elements 
require their own solutions. But for now, we'll focus on two
of the most familiar in everyday life: electricity and liquid fuels. Electricity powers blast furnaces, 
elevators, computers, and all manner of things in homes,
businesses, and manufacturing. Meanwhile, liquid fuels 
play a crucial role in almost all forms of transportation. Let's consider the electrical 
portion first. The great news is that our technology
is already advanced enough to capture all that energy 
from renewables, and there's an ample supply. The sun continuously radiates about 173 quadrillion watts 
of solar energy at the Earth, which is almost 10,000 times
our present needs. It's been estimated that a surface that
spans several hundred thousand kilometers would be needed to power humanity
at our present usage levels. So why don't we build that? Because there are other 
hurdles in the way, like efficiency and energy transportation. To maximize efficiency, solar plants must be located in areas 
with lots of sunshine year round, like deserts. But those are far away 
from densely populated regions where energy demand is high. There are other forms of renewable energy
we could draw from, such as hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomasses, but they also have limits based on
availability and location. In principle, a connected electrical
energy network with power lines crisscrossing the globe would enable us to transport power
from where it's generated to where it's needed. But building a system on this scale

Imagine aliens land on the planet
a million years from now and look into the geologic record. What will these curious searchers
find of us? They will find what geologists, 
scientists, and other experts are increasingly calling
the Anthropocene, or new age of mankind. The impacts that we humans make
have become so pervasive, profound, and permanent that some geologists argue
we merit our own epoch. That would be a new unit
in the geologic time scale that stretches back 
more than 4.5 billion years, or ever since the Earth took shape. Modern humans may be on par
with the glaciers behind various ice ages or the asteroid that doomed
most of the dinosaurs. What is an epoch? Most simply, it's a unit of geologic time. There's the Pleistocene, an icy epoch that saw the evolution
of modern humans. Or there's the Eocene, 
more than 34 million years ago, a hothouse time during which the continents drifted 
into their present configuration. Changes in climate or fossils
found in the rock record help distinguish these epochs
and help geologists tell deep time. So what will be the record 
of modern people's impact on the planet? It doesn't rely on the things
that may seem most obvious to us today, like sprawling cities. Even New York or Shanghai 
may prove hard to find buried in the rocks 
a million years from now. But humans have put new things
into the world that never existed on Earth before, like plutonium and plastics. In fact, the geologists 
known as stratigraphers who determine the geologic timescale, have proposed a start date
for the Anthropocene around 1950. That’s when people started blowing
up nuclear bombs all around the world and scattering novel elements 
to the winds. Those elements will last 
in the rock record, even in our bones and teeth
for millions of years. And in just 50 years, 
we've made enough plastic, at least 8 billion metric tons, to cover the whole world in a thin film. People's farming, fishing, and forestry
will also show up as a before and after in any such strata because it's those kinds of activities that are causing unique species 
of plants and animals to die out. This die-off started perhaps
more than 40,000 years ago as humanity spread out of Africa and reached places like Australia, kicking off the disappearance
of big, likable, and edible animals. This is true of Europe and Asia,
think woolly mammoth, as well as North and South America, too. For a species that has only roamed the planet for 
a few hundred thousand years, Homo sapiens has had a big impact
on the future fossil record. That also means that even if people
were to disappear tomorrow, evolution would be driven 
by our choices to date. We're making a new homogenous world
of certain favored plants and animals, like corn and rats. But it's a world that's not as resilient
as the one it replaces. As the fossil record shows, it's a diversity of plants and animals that allows unique pairings 
of flora and fauna to respond to environmental challenges,
and even thrive after an apocalypse. That goes for people, too. If the microscopic plants 
of the ocean suffer as a result of too much 
carbon dioxide, say, we'll lose the source of as much as half
of the oxygen we need to breathe. Then there's the smudge in future rocks. People's penchant for burning coal,
oil, and natural gas has spread tiny bits of soot
all over the planet. That smudge corresponds 
with a meteoric rise in the amount 
of carbon dioxide in the air, now beyond 400 parts per million, or higher than any other Homo sapiens
has ever breathed. Similar soot can still 
be found in ancient rocks from volcanic fires 
of 66 million years ago, a record of the cataclysm touched
off by an asteroid at the end of the late Cretaceous epoch. So odds are our soot will still be here
66 million years from now, easy enough to find for any aliens
who care to look. Of course, there's an important
difference between us and an asteroid. A space rock has no choice
but to follow gravity. We can choose to do differently. And if we do, there might still be
some kind of human civilization thousands or even millions
of years from now. Not a bad record to hope for.

Imagine aliens land on the planet
a million years from now and look into the geologic record. What will these curious searchers
find of us? They will find what geologists, 
scientists, and other experts are increasingly calling
the Anthropocene, or new age of mankind. The impacts that we humans make
have become so pervasive, profound, and permanent that some geologists argue
we merit our own epoch. That would be a new unit
in the geologic time scale that stretches back 
more than 4.5 billion years, or ever since the Earth took shape. Modern humans may be on par
with the glaciers behind various ice ages or the asteroid that doomed
most of the dinosaurs. What is an epoch? Most simply, it's a unit of geologic time. There's the Pleistocene, an icy epoch that saw the evolution
of modern humans. Or there's the Eocene, 
more than 34 million years ago, a hothouse time during which the continents drifted 
into their present configuration. Changes in climate or fossils
found in the rock record help distinguish these epochs

**Transcript**:
Imagine aliens land on the planet
a million years from now and look into the geologic record. What will these curious searchers
find of us? They will find what geologists, 
scientists, and other experts are increasingly calling
the Anthropocene, or new age of mankind. The impacts that we humans make
have become so pervasive, profound, and permanent that some geologists argue
we merit our own epoch. That would be a new unit
in the geologic time scale that stretches back 
more than 4.5 billion years, or ever since the Earth took shape. Modern humans may be on par
with the glaciers behind various ice ages or the asteroid that doomed
most of the dinosaurs. What is an epoch? Most simply, it's a unit of geologic time. There's the Pleistocene, an icy epoch that saw the evolution
of modern humans. Or there's the Eocene, 
more than 34 million years ago, a hothouse time during which the continents drifted 
into their present configuration. Changes in climate or fossils
found in the rock record help distinguish these epochs
and help geologists tell deep time. So what will be the record 
of modern people's impact on the planet? It doesn't rely on the things
that may seem most obvious to us today, like sprawling cities. Even New York or Shanghai 
may prove hard to find buried in the rocks 
a million years from now. But humans have put new things
into the world that never existed on Earth before, like plutonium and plastics. In fact, the geologists 
known as stratigraphers who determine the geologic timescale, have proposed a start date
for the Anthropocene around 1950. That’s when people started blowing
up nuclear bombs all around the world and scattering novel elements 
to the winds. Those elements will last 
in the rock record, even in our bones and teeth
for millions of years. And in just 50 years, 
we've made enough plastic, at least 8 billion metric tons, to cover the whole world in a thin film. People's farming, fishing, and forestry
will also show up as a before and after in any such strata because it's those kinds of activities that are causing unique species 
of plants and animals to die out. This die-off started perhaps
more than 40,000 years ago as humanity spread out of Africa and reached places like Australia, kicking off the disappearance
of big, likable, and edible animals. This is true of Europe and Asia,
think woolly mammoth, as well as North and South America, too. For a species that has only roamed the planet for 
a few hundred thousand years, Homo sapiens has had a big impact
on the future fossil record. That also means that even if people
were to disappear tomorrow, evolution would be driven 
by our choices to date. We're making a new homogenous world
of certain favored plants and animals, like corn and rats. But it's a world that's not as resilient
as the one it replaces. As the fossil record shows, it's a diversity of plants and animals that allows unique pairings 
of flora and fauna to respond to environmental challenges,
and even thrive after an apocalypse. That goes for people, too. If the microscopic plants 
of the ocean suffer as a result of too much 
carbon dioxide, say, we'll lose the source of as much as half
of the oxygen we need to breathe. Then there's the smudge in future rocks. People's penchant for burning coal,
oil, and natural gas has spread tiny bits of soot
all over the planet. That smudge corresponds 
with a meteoric rise in the amount 
of carbon dioxide in the air, now beyond 400 parts per million, or higher than any other Homo sapiens
has ever breathed. Similar soot can still 
be found in ancient rocks from volcanic fires 
of 66 million years ago, a record of the cataclysm touched
off by an asteroid at the end of the late Cretaceous epoch. So odds are our soot will still be here
66 million years from now, easy enough to find for any aliens
who care to look. Of course, there's an important
difference between us and an asteroid. A space rock has no choice
but to follow gravity. We can choose to do differently. And if we do, there might still be
some kind of human civilization thousands or even millions
of years from now. Not a bad record to hope for.

**Transcript**:
His face is recognized all over the world. The young medical student
who became a revolutionary icon. But was Che Guevara 
a heroic champion of the poor or a ruthless warlord 
who left a legacy of repression? Order, order. Hey, where have I seen that guy before? Ahem, your Honor, this is Ernesto Che Guevara. In the early 1950s, he left behind a privileged life 
as a medical student in Argentina to travel through rural Latin America. The poverty and misery he witnessed
convinced him that saving lives required more than medicine. So he became a terrorist seeking to violently overthrow 
the region's governments. What? The region's governments 
were brutal oligarchies. Colonialism may have formally ended, but elites still controlled 
all the wealth. American corporations bought up land
originally seized from indigenous people and used it for profit and export, even keeping most of it uncultivated
while locals starved. Couldn't they vote to change that? Oh, they tried, your Honor. In 1953, Che came to Guatemala under the democratically-elected 
government of President Árbenz. Árbenz passed reforms to redistribute some of this uncultivated 
land back to the people while compensating the landowners. But he was overthrown 
in a CIA-sponsored coup. The military was protecting against
the seizure of private property and communist takeover. They were protecting corporate profits and Che saw that they would use
the fear of communism to overthrow any government
that threatened those profits. So he took the lessons of Guatemala
with him to Mexico. There, he met exiled Cuban revolutionaries and decided to help them 
liberate their country. You mean help Fidel Castro 
turn a vibrant Cuba into a dictatorship. Dictatorship was what Cuba 
had before the revolution. Fulgencio Batista was a tyrant
who came to power in a military coup. He turned Havana into a luxury playground
for foreigners while keeping Cubans mired in poverty and
killing thousands in police crackdowns. Even President Kennedy called it
the worst example of "economic colonization, humiliation,
and exploitation in the world." Whatever Batista's faults, it can't compare to the totalitarian
nightmare Castro would create. Forced labor camps, torture of prisoners,
no freedom to speak or to leave. But this isn't the trial 
of Fidel Castro, is it? Che Guevara was instrumental in helping
Castro seize power. As a commander in his guerilla army, he unleashed a reign of terror
across the countryside, killing any suspected spies or dissenters. He also helped peasants build
health clinics and schools, taught them to read, and even recited poetry to them. His harsh discipline was necessary
against a much stronger enemy who didn't hesitate to burn entire
villages suspected of aiding the rebels. Let's not forget that the new regime
held mass executions and killed hundreds 
of people without trial as soon as they took power in 1959. The executed were officials
and collaborators who had tormented 
the masses under Batista. The people supported 
this revolutionary justice. Which people? An angry mob crying for blood
does not a democracy make. And that's not even mentioning
the forced labor camps, arbitrary arrests, and repression of LGBT people
that continued long after the revolution. There's a reason people kept
risking their lives to flee, often with nothing but the clothes
on their backs. So was that all this Che brought to Cuba? Just another violent dictatorship? Not at all. He oversaw land redistribution, helped established universal education, and organized volunteer literacy brigades
that raised Cuba's literacy rate to 96%, still one of the highest in the world. Which allowed the government to control
what information everyone received. Guevara's idealistic incompetence
as Finance Minister caused massive drops in productivity when he replaced worker pay raises
with moral certificates. He suppressed all press freedom, declaring that newspapers 
were instruments of the oligarchy. And it was he who urged Castro
to host Soviet nuclear weapons, leading to the Cuban Missile Crisis that brought the world
to the brink of destruction. He was a leader, not a bureaucrat. That's why he eventually left to spread
the revolution abroad. Which didn't go well. He failed to rally rebels in the Congo and went to Bolivia 
even when the Soviets disapproved. The Bolivian Government, 
with the help of the CIA, was able to capture and neutralize
this terrorist in 1967, before he could do much damage. While doing plenty of damage themselves
in the process. So that was the end of it? Not at all. As Che said, 
the revolution is immortal. He was publicly mourned in cities
all over the world. Not by the Cubans who managed to escape. And his story would inspire 
young activists for generations to come. Ha. A trendy symbol of rebellion for those
who never had to live under his regime. Symbols of revolution 
may become commodified, but the idea of a more just world remains. Maybe, but I'm not sharing my coffee. Che Guevara was captured and
executed by government forces in Bolivia. His remains would not be found
for another 30 years. But did he die a hero 
or had he already become a villain? And should revolutions be judged
by their ideals or their outcomes? These are the questions we face
when we put history on trial.

to the brink of destruction. He was a leader, not a bureaucrat. That's why he eventually left to spread
the revolution abroad. Which didn't go well. He failed to rally rebels in the Congo and went to Bolivia 
even when the Soviets disapproved. The Bolivian Government, 
with the help of the CIA, was able to capture and neutralize
this terrorist in 1967, before he could do much damage. While doing plenty of damage themselves
in the process. So that was the end of it? Not at all. As Che said, 
the revolution is immortal. He was publicly mourned in cities
all over the world. Not by the Cubans who managed to escape. And his story would inspire 
young activists for generations to come. Ha. A trendy symbol of rebellion for those
who never had to live under his regime. Symbols of revolution 
may become commodified, but the idea of a more just world remains. Maybe, but I'm not sharing my coffee. Che Guevara was captured and
executed by government forces in Bolivia. His remains would not be found
for another 30 years. But did he die a hero 
or had he already become a villain? And should revolutions be judged
by their ideals or their outcomes? These are the questions we face
when we put history on trial.

**Transcript**:
His face is recognized all over the world. The young medical student
who became a revolutionary icon. But was Che Guevara 
a heroic champion of the poor or a ruthless warlord 
who left a legacy of repression? Order, order. Hey, where have I seen that guy before? Ahem, your Honor, this is Ernesto Che Guevara. In the early 1950s, he left behind a privileged life 
as a medical student in Argentina to travel through rural Latin America. The poverty and misery he witnessed
convinced him that saving lives required more than medicine. So he became a terrorist seeking to violently overthrow 
the region's governments. What? The region's governments 
were brutal oligarchies. Colonialism may have formally ended, but elites still controlled 
all the wealth. American corporations bought up land
originally seized from indigenous people and used it for profit and export, even keeping most of it uncultivated
while locals starved. Couldn't they vote to change that? Oh, they tried, your Honor. In 1953, Che came to Guatemala under the democratically-elected 
government of President Árbenz. Árbenz passed reforms to redistribute some of this uncultivated 
land back to the people while compensating the landowners. But he was overthrown 
in a CIA-sponsored coup. The military was protecting against
the seizure of private property and communist takeover. They were protecting corporate profits and Che saw that they would use
the fear of communism to overthrow any government
that threatened those profits. So he took the lessons of Guatemala
with him to Mexico. There, he met exiled Cuban revolutionaries and decided to help them 
liberate their country. You mean help Fidel Castro 
turn a vibrant Cuba into a dictatorship. Dictatorship was what Cuba 
had before the revolution. Fulgencio Batista was a tyrant
who came to power in a military coup. He turned Havana into a luxury playground
for foreigners while keeping Cubans mired in poverty and
killing thousands in police crackdowns. Even President Kennedy called it
the worst example of "economic colonization, humiliation,
and exploitation in the world." Whatever Batista's faults, it can't compare to the totalitarian
nightmare Castro would create. Forced labor camps, torture of prisoners,
no freedom to speak or to leave. But this isn't the trial 
of Fidel Castro, is it? Che Guevara was instrumental in helping
Castro seize power. As a commander in his guerilla army, he unleashed a reign of terror
across the countryside, killing any suspected spies or dissenters. He also helped peasants build
health clinics and schools, taught them to read, and even recited poetry to them. His harsh discipline was necessary
against a much stronger enemy who didn't hesitate to burn entire
villages suspected of aiding the rebels. Let's not forget that the new regime
held mass executions and killed hundreds 
of people without trial as soon as they took power in 1959. The executed were officials
and collaborators who had tormented 
the masses under Batista. The people supported 
this revolutionary justice. Which people? An angry mob crying for blood
does not a democracy make. And that's not even mentioning
the forced labor camps, arbitrary arrests, and repression of LGBT people
that continued long after the revolution. There's a reason people kept
risking their lives to flee, often with nothing but the clothes
on their backs. So was that all this Che brought to Cuba? Just another violent dictatorship? Not at all. He oversaw land redistribution, helped established universal education, and organized volunteer literacy brigades
that raised Cuba's literacy rate to 96%, still one of the highest in the world. Which allowed the government to control
what information everyone received. Guevara's idealistic incompetence
as Finance Minister caused massive drops in productivity when he replaced worker pay raises
with moral certificates. He suppressed all press freedom, declaring that newspapers 
were instruments of the oligarchy. And it was he who urged Castro
to host Soviet nuclear weapons, leading to the Cuban Missile Crisis that brought the world
to the brink of destruction. He was a leader, not a bureaucrat. That's why he eventually left to spread
the revolution abroad. Which didn't go well. He failed to rally rebels in the Congo and went to Bolivia

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 6: What were some of the consequences of Che Guevara's actions in Cuba, and how did they relate to his ideals?**

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it also discusses the impact of the revolution on Cuba, specifically in relation to Che Guevara's actions. Although the options are not identical, they both touch on the idea that the revolution had both positive and negative consequences.

However, upon closer inspection, I found that **Question 6** does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the specific area where the revolution did NOT improve Cuba, whereas Question 6 asks about the consequences of Che Guevara's actions in general.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that **Question 6** is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
Imagine as a thought experiment
that you live in a small village and depend on the local fish pond
for food. You share the pond 
with three other villagers. The pond starts off with a dozen fish,
and the fish reproduce. For every two fish, there will be 
one baby added each night. So, in order to maximize 
your supply of food, how many fish should you catch each day? Take a moment to think about it. Assume baby fish grow 
to full size immediately and that the pond begins at full capacity, and ignore factors 
like the sex of the fish you catch. The answer? One, and it's not just you. The best way to maximize 
every villager's food supply is for each fisherman
to take just one fish each day. Here's how the math works. If each villager takes one fish,
there will be eight fish left over night. Each pair of fish produces one baby, and the next day, the pond 
will be fully restocked with twelve fish. If anyone takes more than one,
the number of reproductive pairs drops, and the population 
won't be able to bounce back. Eventually, the fish in the lake 
will be gone, leaving all four villagers to starve. This fish pond is just one example
of a classic problem called the tragedy of the commons. The phenomenon was first described 
in a pamphlet by economist William Forster Lloyd in 1833 in a discussion of 
the overgrazing of cattle on village common areas. More than 100 years later, ecologist
Garrett Hardin revived the concept to describe what happens 
when many individuals all share a limited resource, like grazing land, fishing areas, living space, even clean air. Hardin argued that these situations
pit short-term self-interest against the common good, and they end badly for everyone, resulting in overgrazing, overfishing, overpopulation, pollution, and other social 
and environmental problems. The key feature of 
a tragedy of the commons is that it provides an opportunity for
an individual to benefit him or herself while spreading out any negative effects 
across the larger population. To see what that means,
let's revisit our fish pond. Each individual fisherman is motivated to take as many fish 
as he can for himself. Meanwhile, any decline 
in fish reproduction is shared by the entire village. Anxious to avoid 
losing out to his neighbors, a fisherman will conclude that it's in his
best interest to take an extra fish, or two, or three. Unfortunately, this is the same conclusion
reached by the other fisherman, and that's the tragedy. Optimizing for the self in the short term
isn't optimal for anyone in the long term. That's a simplified example,
but the tragedy of the commons plays out in the more complex systems
of real life, too. The overuse of antibiotics has led to
short-term gains in livestock production and in treating common illnesses, but it's also resulted in the evolution
of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which threaten the entire population. A coal-fired power plant produces
cheap electricity for its customers and profits for its owners. These local benefits are helpful
in the short term, but pollution from mining and burning coal
is spread across the entire atmosphere and sticks around for thousands of years. There are other examples, too. Littering, water shortages, deforestation, traffic jams, even the purchase of bottled water. But human civilization has proven it's
capable of doing something remarkable. We form social contracts, we make communal agreements, we elect governments, and we pass laws. All this to save our collective selves
from our own individual impulses. It isn't easy, and we certainly 
don't get it right nearly all of the time. But humans at our best have shown
that we can solve these problems and we can continue to do so
if we remember Hardin's lesson. When the tragedy of the commons applies, what's good for all of us 
is good for each of us.

**Transcript**:
Imagine as a thought experiment
that you live in a small village and depend on the local fish pond
for food. You share the pond 
with three other villagers. The pond starts off with a dozen fish,
and the fish reproduce. For every two fish, there will be 
one baby added each night. So, in order to maximize 
your supply of food, how many fish should you catch each day? Take a moment to think about it. Assume baby fish grow 
to full size immediately and that the pond begins at full capacity, and ignore factors 
like the sex of the fish you catch. The answer? One, and it's not just you. The best way to maximize 
every villager's food supply is for each fisherman
to take just one fish each day. Here's how the math works. If each villager takes one fish,
there will be eight fish left over night. Each pair of fish produces one baby, and the next day, the pond 
will be fully restocked with twelve fish. If anyone takes more than one,
the number of reproductive pairs drops, and the population 
won't be able to bounce back. Eventually, the fish in the lake 
will be gone, leaving all four villagers to starve. This fish pond is just one example
of a classic problem called the tragedy of the commons. The phenomenon was first described 
in a pamphlet by economist William Forster Lloyd in 1833 in a discussion of 
the overgrazing of cattle on village common areas. More than 100 years later, ecologist
Garrett Hardin revived the concept to describe what happens 
when many individuals all share a limited resource, like grazing land, fishing areas, living space, even clean air. Hardin argued that these situations
pit short-term self-interest against the common good, and they end badly for everyone, resulting in overgrazing, overfishing, overpopulation, pollution, and other social 
and environmental problems. The key feature of 
a tragedy of the commons is that it provides an opportunity for
an individual to benefit him or herself while spreading out any negative effects 
across the larger population. To see what that means,
let's revisit our fish pond. Each individual fisherman is motivated to take as many fish 
as he can for himself. Meanwhile, any decline 
in fish reproduction is shared by the entire village. Anxious to avoid 
losing out to his neighbors, a fisherman will conclude that it's in his
best interest to take an extra fish, or two, or three. Unfortunately, this is the same conclusion
reached by the other fisherman, and that's the tragedy. Optimizing for the self in the short term
isn't optimal for anyone in the long term. That's a simplified example,
but the tragedy of the commons plays out in the more complex systems
of real life, too. The overuse of antibiotics has led to
short-term gains in livestock production and in treating common illnesses, but it's also resulted in the evolution
of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which threaten the entire population. A coal-fired power plant produces
cheap electricity for its customers and profits for its owners. These local benefits are helpful
in the short term, but pollution from mining and burning coal
is spread across the entire atmosphere and sticks around for thousands of years. There are other examples, too. Littering, water shortages, deforestation, traffic jams, even the purchase of bottled water. But human civilization has proven it's
capable of doing something remarkable. We form social contracts, we make communal agreements, we elect governments, and we pass laws. All this to save our collective selves
from our own individual impulses. It isn't easy, and we certainly 
don't get it right nearly all of the time. But humans at our best have shown
that we can solve these problems and we can continue to do so
if we remember Hardin's lesson. When the tragedy of the commons applies, what's good for all of us 
is good for each of us.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: **Analysis**: What is the key feature of a tragedy of the commons? 

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks for examples of the tragedy of the commons, while the generated MCQs ask about various aspects of the concept, such as its definition, consequences, and applications.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 8: **Comprehension**: What happens when individuals prioritize their short-term self-interest over the common good in a tragedy of the commons? is the closest match. This question is related to the concept of the tragedy of the commons and its consequences, which is similar to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must note that the options in Question 8 do not provide specific examples of the tragedy of the commons, unlike the ground truth MCQ. Therefore, the match is not perfect.

**Transcript**:
All year long, researchers at hundreds
of hospitals around the world collect samples from flu patients and send them to top virology experts
with one goal: to design the vaccine 
for the next flu season. But why do we need a new one every year? Vaccines for diseases like mumps
and rubella offer a lifetime of protection with two shots early in life. What's so special about the flu? Two factors make the flu a tough target. First, there are more than 100 subtypes
of the influenza virus, and the ones in circulation 
change from season to season. And second, the flu's genetic code
allows it to mutate more quickly than many other viruses. The flu spreads by turning a host's own 
cells into viral production factories. When the virus is engulfed by a host cell,
it expels its genetic material, which makes its way to the nucleus. There, cellular machinery that normally
copies the host's genes starts replicating viral genes instead, creating more and more copies
of the virus. New viruses are repackaged 
and crammed into the cell until it bursts, sending freshly minted influenza viruses
out to infect additional cells. Most viruses follow this script. The trick with the flu is that its genetic
material isn't DNA but a similar compound called RNA. And RNA viruses can mutate much faster. When cells synthesize DNA, a built-in proofreader recognizes 
and corrects mistakes, but the RNA synthesis mechanism
doesn't have this fail-safe. If errors creep in, they stick around
creating new variants of the virus. Why is this a problem? Because vaccines depend on recognition. The flu vaccine includes some of the same
substances, called antigens, found on the surface of the virus itself. The body identifies those fragments
as foreign and responds by producing compounds
called antibodies, tailor-made to match the antigens. When a vaccinated person
encounters the actual virus, the preprogrammed antibodies
help the immune system identify the threat and mobilize quickly 
to prevent an infection. Those antigens are different 
for every strain of influenza. If vaccination has prepared 
the immune system for one strain, a different one may still 
be able to sneak by. Even within the same strain of flu, those rapid genetic mutations
can change the surface compounds enough that the antibodies 
may not recognize them. To make things even more complicated, sometimes two different strains combine
to create an entirely new hybrid virus. All of this makes vaccinating for the flu like trying to hit a moving 
transforming target. That's why scientists are constantly
collecting data about which strains are circulating and checking to see how much those
strains have mutated from previous years' versions. Twice annually, the World 
Health Organization pulls together experts to analyze all that data, holding one meeting for each hemisphere. The scientists determine which strains
to include in that season's vaccine, picking four for the quadrivalent vaccine
in use today. In spite of the flu's evasive maneuvers, in recent years, the group's predictions
have been almost always correct. Even when flu strains mutate further,
the vaccine is often close enough that a vaccinated person who catches
the flu anyway will have a milder and shorter illness
than they would otherwise. Vaccination also helps protect
other people in the community who may not be medically eligible 
for the shot by preventing those around them
from carrying the virus. This is called herd immunity. The flu shot can't give you the flu. It contains an inactivated virus
that isn't capable of making you sick. You might feel tired 
and achy after getting it, but that's not an infection. It's your normal immune response
to the vaccine. Some parts of the world use, 
instead of a shot, an inhaled vaccine that contains a weakened live virus. This is also safe for 
the vast majority of people. Only those with impaired immune systems
would be at risk, but they're typically 
not given live vaccines. Meanwhile, scientists are working
to develop a universal flu vaccine that would protect against any strain,
even mutated ones. But until then, the hunt 
for next year's vaccine is on.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 2, but only in the sense that it talks about the replication of the flu virus, which is somewhat related to the genetic material of the flu virus.

However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the genetic material of the flu virus, I would say Question 3. It talks about the flu virus mutating quickly, which is related to the fact that the flu virus has RNA as its genetic material, which allows it to mutate quickly.

But if I'm being completely honest, none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the genetic material of the flu virus, and none of the generated MCQs are asking about that specific topic.

If I had to choose, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present, but if I really had to choose from the given options, I would say Question 3, with the caveat that it's not a very good match.

help the immune system identify the threat and mobilize quickly 
to prevent an infection. Those antigens are different 
for every strain of influenza. If vaccination has prepared 
the immune system for one strain, a different one may still 
be able to sneak by. Even within the same strain of flu, those rapid genetic mutations
can change the surface compounds enough that the antibodies 
may not recognize them. To make things even more complicated, sometimes two different strains combine
to create an entirely new hybrid virus. All of this makes vaccinating for the flu like trying to hit a moving 
transforming target. That's why scientists are constantly
collecting data about which strains are circulating and checking to see how much those
strains have mutated from previous years' versions. Twice annually, the World 
Health Organization pulls together experts to analyze all that data, holding one meeting for each hemisphere. The scientists determine which strains
to include in that season's vaccine, picking four for the quadrivalent vaccine
in use today. In spite of the flu's evasive maneuvers, in recent years, the group's predictions
have been almost always correct. Even when flu strains mutate further,
the vaccine is often close enough that a vaccinated person who catches
the flu anyway will have a milder and shorter illness
than they would otherwise. Vaccination also helps protect
other people in the community who may not be medically eligible 
for the shot by preventing those around them
from carrying the virus. This is called herd immunity. The flu shot can't give you the flu. It contains an inactivated virus
that isn't capable of making you sick. You might feel tired 
and achy after getting it, but that's not an infection. It's your normal immune response
to the vaccine. Some parts of the world use, 
instead of a shot, an inhaled vaccine that contains a weakened live virus. This is also safe for 
the vast majority of people. Only those with impaired immune systems
would be at risk, but they're typically 
not given live vaccines. Meanwhile, scientists are working
to develop a universal flu vaccine that would protect against any strain,
even mutated ones. But until then, the hunt 
for next year's vaccine is on.

**Transcript**:
All year long, researchers at hundreds
of hospitals around the world collect samples from flu patients and send them to top virology experts
with one goal: to design the vaccine 
for the next flu season. But why do we need a new one every year? Vaccines for diseases like mumps
and rubella offer a lifetime of protection with two shots early in life. What's so special about the flu? Two factors make the flu a tough target. First, there are more than 100 subtypes
of the influenza virus, and the ones in circulation 
change from season to season. And second, the flu's genetic code
allows it to mutate more quickly than many other viruses. The flu spreads by turning a host's own 
cells into viral production factories. When the virus is engulfed by a host cell,
it expels its genetic material, which makes its way to the nucleus. There, cellular machinery that normally
copies the host's genes starts replicating viral genes instead, creating more and more copies
of the virus. New viruses are repackaged 
and crammed into the cell until it bursts, sending freshly minted influenza viruses
out to infect additional cells. Most viruses follow this script. The trick with the flu is that its genetic
material isn't DNA but a similar compound called RNA. And RNA viruses can mutate much faster. When cells synthesize DNA, a built-in proofreader recognizes 
and corrects mistakes, but the RNA synthesis mechanism
doesn't have this fail-safe. If errors creep in, they stick around
creating new variants of the virus. Why is this a problem? Because vaccines depend on recognition. The flu vaccine includes some of the same
substances, called antigens, found on the surface of the virus itself. The body identifies those fragments
as foreign and responds by producing compounds
called antibodies, tailor-made to match the antigens. When a vaccinated person
encounters the actual virus, the preprogrammed antibodies
help the immune system identify the threat and mobilize quickly 
to prevent an infection. Those antigens are different 
for every strain of influenza. If vaccination has prepared 
the immune system for one strain, a different one may still 
be able to sneak by. Even within the same strain of flu, those rapid genetic mutations
can change the surface compounds enough that the antibodies 
may not recognize them. To make things even more complicated, sometimes two different strains combine
to create an entirely new hybrid virus. All of this makes vaccinating for the flu like trying to hit a moving

**Transcript**:
Are you as good at things 
as you think you are? How good are you at managing money? What about reading people's emotions? How healthy are you 
compared to other people you know? Are you better than average at grammar? Knowing how competent we are and how are skill stack up 
against other people's is more than a self-esteem boost. It helps us figure out when we can forge
ahead on our own decisions and instincts and when we need, instead, 
to seek out advice. But psychological research suggests
that we're not very good at evaluating ourselves accurately. In fact, we frequently overestimate
our own abilities. Researchers have a name 
for this phenomena, the Dunning-Kruger effect. This effect explains 
why more than 100 studies have shown that people display 
illusory superiority. We judge ourselves as better than others to a degree that violates 
the laws of math. When software engineers at two companies
were asked to rate their performance, 32% of the engineers at one company
and 42% at the other put themselves in the top 5%. In another study, 88% of American drivers described themselves 
as having above average driving skills. These aren't isolated findings. On average, people tend to rate
themselves better than most in disciplines ranging from health,
leadership skills, ethics, and beyond. What's particularly interesting
is that those with the least ability are often the most likely to overrate
their skills to the greatest extent. People measurably poor 
at logical reasoning, grammar, financial knowledge, math, emotional intelligence, running medical lab tests, and chess all tend to rate their expertise almost
as favorably as actual experts do. So who's most vulnerable to this delusion? Sadly, all of us because we all have
pockets of incompetence we don't recognize. But why? When psychologists Dunning and Kruger
first described the effect in 1999, they argued that people lacking
knowledge and skill in particular areas suffer a double curse. First, they make mistakes
and reach poor decisions. But second, those same knowledge gaps also
prevent them from catching their errors. In other words, poor performers lack
the very expertise needed to recognize how badly they're doing. For example, when the researchers studied participants in 
a college debate tournament, the bottom 25% of teams 
in preliminary rounds lost nearly four 
out of every five matches. But they thought they were winning
almost 60%. WIthout a strong grasp 
of the rules of debate, the students simply couldn't recognize
when or how often their arguments broke down. The Dunning-Kruger effect isn't a question
of ego blinding us to our weaknesses. People usually do admit their deficits
once they can spot them. In one study, students who had initially
done badly on a logic quiz and then took a mini course on logic were quite willing to label
their original performances as awful. That may be why people with a moderate
amount of experience or expertise often have less confidence
in their abilities. They know enough to know that 
there's a lot they don't know. Meanwhile, experts tend to be aware
of just how knowledgeable they are. But they often make a different mistake: they assume that everyone else 
is knowledgeable, too. The result is that people, 
whether they're inept or highly skilled, are often caught in a bubble
of inaccurate self-perception. When they're unskilled, 
they can't see their own faults. When they're exceptionally competent, they don't perceive how unusual 
their abilities are. So if the Dunning-Kruger effect 
is invisible to those experiencing it, what can you do to find out how good
you actually are at various things? First, ask for feedback from other people, and consider it, 
even if it's hard to hear. Second, and more important, keep learning. The more knowledgeable we become, the less likely we are to have
invisible holes in our competence. Perhaps it all boils down 
to that old proverb: When arguing with a fool, first make sure the other person
isn't doing the same thing.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 2: Comprehension**

This question is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ because it:

1. Deals with the same topic of people's self-perception and estimation of their abilities.
2. Has a similar question intent, which is to understand how people tend to rate themselves.
3. Has options that are similar in meaning to the ground truth MCQ, with option B specifically mentioning that people tend to overrate themselves.

However, I must note that Question 2 is not an exact match to the ground truth MCQ, as it focuses on a specific study of software engineers rather than the general tendency of people to overrate themselves.

A more exact match would be a generated MCQ that asks a more general question about people's self-perception, such as:

**Question 4: Analysis**

This question is also similar to the ground truth MCQ, as it deals with the same topic and has a similar question intent. However, its options are more focused on the reasons why people overrate themselves, rather than the general tendency to do so.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose **Question 4: Analysis**, but with the caveat that it's not an exact match.

However, another generated MCQ caught my attention:

**Question 5 is not the best match but Question 6: Evaluation** has the sentence  "Do you think the Dunning-Kruger effect is a result of ego or a lack of knowledge and skill? " which contains the idea of overestimation of one's abilities.

But the best match is actually **Question 4: Analysis**

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4: Analysis**

This question matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. Both questions ask about the reason why people fail to recognize their deficits and shortcomings, and both provide similar options. The correct option in both cases is related to the lack of knowledge and skill needed to recognize one's own errors.

**Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4**

Additionally, Question 6: Evaluation also matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content, but its format is different as it requires a more open-ended answer. However, if I had to choose another question that closely matches the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 6.

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 23, Question 3
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Are you as good at things 
as you think you are? How good are you at managing money? What about reading people's emotions? How healthy are you 
compared to other people you know? Are you better than average at grammar? Knowing how competent we are and how are skill stack up 
against other people's is more than a self-esteem boost. It helps us figure out when we can forge
ahead on our own decisions and instincts and when we need, instead, 
to seek out advice. But psychological research suggests
that we're not very good at evaluating ourselves accurately. In fact, we frequently overestimate
our own abilities. Researchers have a name 
for this phenomena, the Dunning-Kruger effect. This effect explains 
why more than 100 studies have shown that people display 
illusory superiority. We judge ourselves as better than others to a degree that violates 
the laws of math. When software engineers at two companies
were asked to rate their performance, 32% of the engineers at one company
and 42% at the other put themselves in the top 5%. In another study, 88% of American drivers described themselves 
as having above average driving skills. These aren't isolated findings. On average, people tend to rate
themselves better than most in disciplines ranging from health,
leadership skills, ethics, and beyond. What's particularly interesting
is that those with the least ability are often the most likely to overrate
their skills to the greatest extent. People measurably poor 
at logical reasoning, grammar, financial knowledge, math, emotional intelligence, running medical lab tests, and chess all tend to rate their expertise almost
as favorably as actual experts do. So who's most vulnerable to this delusion? Sadly, all of us because we all have
pockets of incompetence we don't recognize. But why? When psychologists Dunning and Kruger
first described the effect in 1999, they argued that people lacking
knowledge and skill in particular areas suffer a double curse. First, they make mistakes
and reach poor decisions. But second, those same knowledge gaps also
prevent them from catching their errors. In other words, poor performers lack
the very expertise needed to recognize how badly they're doing. For example, when the researchers studied participants in 
a college debate tournament, the bottom 25% of teams 
in preliminary rounds lost nearly four 
out of every five matches. But they thought they were winning
almost 60%. WIthout a strong grasp 
of the rules of debate, the students simply couldn't recognize
when or how often their arguments broke down. The Dunning-Kruger effect isn't a question
of ego blinding us to our weaknesses. People usually do admit their deficits
once they can spot them. In one study, students who had initially
done badly on a logic quiz and then took a mini course on logic were quite willing to label
their original performances as awful. That may be why people with a moderate
amount of experience or expertise often have less confidence
in their abilities. They know enough to know that 
there's a lot they don't know. Meanwhile, experts tend to be aware
of just how knowledgeable they are. But they often make a different mistake: they assume that everyone else 
is knowledgeable, too. The result is that people, 
whether they're inept or highly skilled, are often caught in a bubble
of inaccurate self-perception. When they're unskilled, 
they can't see their own faults. When they're exceptionally competent, they don't perceive how unusual 
their abilities are. So if the Dunning-Kruger effect 
is invisible to those experiencing it, what can you do to find out how good
you actually are at various things? First, ask for feedback from other people, and consider it, 
even if it's hard to hear. Second, and more important, keep learning. The more knowledgeable we become, the less likely we are to have
invisible holes in our competence. Perhaps it all boils down 
to that old proverb: When arguing with a fool, first make sure the other person
isn't doing the same thing.

**Transcript**:
The city has just opened its
one-of-a-kind Fabergé Egg Museum with a single egg displayed on each floor
of a 100-story building. And the world's most notorious jewel thief
already has her eyes on the prize. Because security is tight
and the eggs are so large, she'll only get the chance to steal one by dropping it out the window
into her waiting truck and repelling down 
before the police can arrive. All eggs are identical in weight
and construction, but each floor's egg is more rare 
and valuable than the one below it. While the thief would naturally like
to take the priceless egg at the top, she suspects it won't survive
a 100-story drop. Being pragmatic, she decides to settle
for the most expensive egg she can get. In the museum's gift shop, 
she finds two souvenir eggs, perfect replicas 
that are perfectly worthless. The plan is to test drop them to find the highest floor 
at which an egg will survive the fall without breaking. Of course, the experiment 
can only be repeated until both replica eggs are smashed. And throwing souvenirs out the window
too many times is probably going to draw 
the guards' attention. What's the least number of tries
it would take to guarantee that 
she find the right floor? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If you're having trouble getting started
on the solution, it might help to start 
with a simpler scenario. Imagine our thief only 
had one replica egg. She'd have a single option: To start by dropping it 
from the first floor and go up one by one until it breaks. Then she'd know that the floor below that is the one she needs 
to target for the real heist. But this could require 
as many as 100 tries. Having an additional replica egg
gives the thief a better option. She can drop the first egg from different
floors at larger intervals in order to narrow down the range
where the critical floor can be found. And once the first breaks, she can use the second egg to explore
that interval floor by floor. Large floor intervals don't work great. In the worst case scenario, they require
many tests with the second egg. Smaller intervals work much better. For example, if she starts by dropping
the first egg from every 10th floor, once it breaks, she'll only have to test
the nine floors below. That means it'll take at most
19 tries to find the right floor. But can she do even better? After all, there's no reason 
every interval has to be the same size. Let's say there were only ten floors. The thief could test this whole building
with just four total throws by dropping the first egg
at floors four, seven, and nine. If it broke at floor four, it would take
up to three throws of the second egg to find the exact floor. If it broke at seven, it would take up to two throws
with the second egg. And if it broke at floor nine, it would take just one more
throw of the second egg. Intuitively, what we're trying to do here
is divide the building into sections where no matter which floor is correct, it takes up to the same number
of throws to find it. We want each interval to be one floor
smaller than the last. This equation can help us solve
for the first floor we need to start with in the 100 floor building. There are several ways 
to solve this equation, including trial and error. If we plug in two for n,
that equation would look like this. If we plug in three, we get this. So we can find the first n to pass 100 by adding more terms 
until we get to our answer, which is 14. And so our thief starts on the 14th floor, moving up to the 27th, the 39th, and so on, for a maximum of 14 drops. Like the old saying goes, you can't 
pull a heist without breaking a few eggs.

**Transcript**:
The city has just opened its
one-of-a-kind Fabergé Egg Museum with a single egg displayed on each floor
of a 100-story building. And the world's most notorious jewel thief
already has her eyes on the prize. Because security is tight
and the eggs are so large, she'll only get the chance to steal one by dropping it out the window
into her waiting truck and repelling down 
before the police can arrive. All eggs are identical in weight
and construction, but each floor's egg is more rare 
and valuable than the one below it. While the thief would naturally like
to take the priceless egg at the top, she suspects it won't survive
a 100-story drop. Being pragmatic, she decides to settle
for the most expensive egg she can get. In the museum's gift shop, 
she finds two souvenir eggs, perfect replicas 
that are perfectly worthless. The plan is to test drop them to find the highest floor 
at which an egg will survive the fall without breaking. Of course, the experiment 
can only be repeated until both replica eggs are smashed. And throwing souvenirs out the window
too many times is probably going to draw 
the guards' attention. What's the least number of tries
it would take to guarantee that 
she find the right floor? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If you're having trouble getting started
on the solution, it might help to start 
with a simpler scenario. Imagine our thief only 
had one replica egg. She'd have a single option: To start by dropping it 
from the first floor and go up one by one until it breaks. Then she'd know that the floor below that is the one she needs

where the critical floor can be found. And once the first breaks, she can use the second egg to explore
that interval floor by floor. Large floor intervals don't work great. In the worst case scenario, they require
many tests with the second egg. Smaller intervals work much better. For example, if she starts by dropping
the first egg from every 10th floor, once it breaks, she'll only have to test
the nine floors below. That means it'll take at most
19 tries to find the right floor. But can she do even better? After all, there's no reason

up to three throws of the second egg to find the exact floor. If it broke at seven, it would take up to two throws
with the second egg. And if it broke at floor nine, it would take just one more
throw of the second egg. Intuitively, what we're trying to do here
is divide the building into sections where no matter which floor is correct, it takes up to the same number

**Transcript**:
The city has just opened its
one-of-a-kind Fabergé Egg Museum with a single egg displayed on each floor
of a 100-story building. And the world's most notorious jewel thief
already has her eyes on the prize. Because security is tight
and the eggs are so large, she'll only get the chance to steal one by dropping it out the window
into her waiting truck and repelling down 
before the police can arrive. All eggs are identical in weight
and construction, but each floor's egg is more rare 
and valuable than the one below it. While the thief would naturally like
to take the priceless egg at the top, she suspects it won't survive
a 100-story drop. Being pragmatic, she decides to settle
for the most expensive egg she can get. In the museum's gift shop, 
she finds two souvenir eggs, perfect replicas 
that are perfectly worthless. The plan is to test drop them to find the highest floor 
at which an egg will survive the fall without breaking. Of course, the experiment 
can only be repeated until both replica eggs are smashed. And throwing souvenirs out the window
too many times is probably going to draw 
the guards' attention. What's the least number of tries
it would take to guarantee that 
she find the right floor? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If you're having trouble getting started
on the solution, it might help to start 
with a simpler scenario. Imagine our thief only 
had one replica egg. She'd have a single option: To start by dropping it 
from the first floor and go up one by one until it breaks. Then she'd know that the floor below that is the one she needs 
to target for the real heist. But this could require 
as many as 100 tries. Having an additional replica egg
gives the thief a better option. She can drop the first egg from different
floors at larger intervals in order to narrow down the range
where the critical floor can be found. And once the first breaks, she can use the second egg to explore
that interval floor by floor. Large floor intervals don't work great. In the worst case scenario, they require
many tests with the second egg. Smaller intervals work much better. For example, if she starts by dropping
the first egg from every 10th floor, once it breaks, she'll only have to test
the nine floors below. That means it'll take at most
19 tries to find the right floor. But can she do even better? After all, there's no reason 
every interval has to be the same size. Let's say there were only ten floors. The thief could test this whole building
with just four total throws by dropping the first egg
at floors four, seven, and nine. If it broke at floor four, it would take
up to three throws of the second egg to find the exact floor. If it broke at seven, it would take up to two throws
with the second egg. And if it broke at floor nine, it would take just one more
throw of the second egg. Intuitively, what we're trying to do here
is divide the building into sections where no matter which floor is correct, it takes up to the same number
of throws to find it. We want each interval to be one floor
smaller than the last. This equation can help us solve
for the first floor we need to start with in the 100 floor building. There are several ways 
to solve this equation, including trial and error. If we plug in two for n,
that equation would look like this. If we plug in three, we get this. So we can find the first n to pass 100 by adding more terms 
until we get to our answer, which is 14. And so our thief starts on the 14th floor, moving up to the 27th, the 39th, and so on, for a maximum of 14 drops. Like the old saying goes, you can't 
pull a heist without breaking a few eggs.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 8. 

The ground truth MCQ asks about the maximum height of a building whose critical floor can be determined with 14 throws, and the correct answer is 105 (A). 

Question 8 asks about the maximum number of drops the thief needs to make to guarantee finding the right floor, and the correct answer is 14 (D). Although the question content is not identical, the intent and the options are related to the number of attempts (throws or drops) needed to achieve a specific goal. 

However, it's worth noting that there isn't a perfect match among the generated MCQs, as none of them directly ask about the maximum height of a building. But Question 8 is the closest in terms of question intent and options.

Whether you love it or hate it, the listicle
– a blend of list and article – has quickly become a very popular content format. 22 brain facts, 29 Things Australians Say
(That Americans Don't), 17 things humanity ruined in 2015. Pets? Really?! Listicles are everywhere. So, why are they so popular? There are some ideas, based in science, that
explain why. Listicles are readable and easy to digest,
they’re kind of like the graphic novel of the internet. And they play a role in curating information. Researchers estimated that in 2008, people
consumed 60% more information than they did in 1960. Back then, the average American spent 7.4
hours a day, outside of work, watching, reading and listening to things; on the phone and
having conversations with other people. In 2008 that number was a 11.8 hours a day,
and today it’s closer to 13 hours. Because we consume so much stuff, we’re
pretty distracted. A curated list appeals to us. Part of this appeal is being able to skim
or quickly look at a listicle and process all of it’s content. The headlines help by telling us exactly what
we’re going to get: The 25 Most Huggable Pokémon. So, we’re satisfied. But this ease of processing information can
lead to some interesting effects. At the core of this is cognitive fluency–it’s
a measure of how easy it is to think about something. People like thinking about things that are
easier to think about, compared to things that are hard to think about. No surprises there. And generally, the more fluently you can process
an object, the more positive your response is to it. Let’s take a closer look. In one study, researchers showed participants
a statement, like “Osorno is in Chile” in colours that made it easy or difficult
to read. Moderately visible statements were judged
as true, and highly visible statements were judged as true significantly above what people
would choose by chance. The researchers concluded that fluently we
perceive things affects our judgments of truth. Another study found when participants looked
at images that were easier to process, they twitched their muscles into a little subconscious
smile. We can’t infer that reading listicles make
us smile, but consuming easier to process information just might. And easy-to-process information isn’t new
to the “internet age”, it’s had an important role throughout culture. “It certainly has” Okay here’s Mike, from Idea Channel. “Hey Vanessa! Yeah, it’s really easy to look our current,
list-laden moment and feel overwhelmed! Or like the internet, with all its distractions
and blinking animated GIFs and pictures of cute cats, has given rise to this particular
and particularly easy to digest format. The listicle FEELS like it’s VERY INTERNET. Mark O’Connell, for the New York Times,
writes that online browsing often seems like “a comic nightmare of futile enumeration. The point of counting is, in a way, to get
to the end of counting; but this is a counting that admits of no conclusion—a bottomless
inventory of everything and nothing.” Mark may be more right than he realizes. The listicle has been around for much, much
longer than the internet has, and may be on one of the central ways we’ve cataloged
and organized the world for a long time. It’s just that, with the internet, we realize
the true infinity of whats available for sorting and cataloging, and lists doing so. Like, 5 genius trashcan lifehacks or The 21
Most Important Raccoons Of 2015 or 159 Disney Quotes For When You Need An Instagram Caption
or 6 Video Games That Failed Before You Pressed Start or OK OK I’m gonna stop before this
becomes a listicle listicle. If you wanna hear more about the 29 different
ways listicles have been perhaps flawed–but definitely important and interesting–throughout
history, head on over to Idea Channel when you’re done here. Thanks, Vanessa!” Of course! But as much as we’ve liked lists throughout
history, it’s not a perfect format. Sure, some people will say “listicles are
ruining journalism”, but we don’t speak of the impact of the format as much as the
way it’s written. In my humble opinion, you don’t remember
listicles. You don’t learn things from them. I’ve tried to think about any list article
or video that I’ve read or watched in my entire life, and I can only remember two from
the past two years: 37 Signs You Grew Up In Australia In The ’90s and 20 Facts about
the Muppets. And I probably remember these because Agro’s
cartoon connection, zooper doopers and Kermit resonate with me on a deep emotional level. And this is the thing about listicles: they’re
just like a zooper dooper or a popsicle in that they’re appealing, you can start and
finish it in two minutes, and you’ll be somewhat satisfied. Some people even say that listicles activate
your brain's reward system, so you’ll finish wanting more. In his TED talk, psychology professor Peter
Dolittle says that your working memory is about the size of a pea. You need to use it to make sense of all the
information you encounter every day and it’s limited in its capacity, duration and focus. You tend to remember about 4 things for 10-20
seconds unless you do something with it–like apply that knowledge to something you already
know or talk to someone about it. Otherwise, any bite of information, is (in
a manner of speaking) in one ear and out the other. Don’t get me wrong, the listicle isn’t
a bad thing! It has a well-deserved place in the media
landscape as a piece of entertainment and our brains love that we can fluently process
them. But as pieces of education, I’m not convinced. And if you want to hear Mike’s voice again,
and even see his face, head over to Idea Channel for his take on humanity and the listicle. And, maybe to see 15 hedgehogs with things
that look like hedgehogs. See you next week.

**Transcript**:
Grammatical tense 
is how languages talk about time without explicitly naming time periods by, instead, modifying verbs 
to specify when action occurs. So how many different tenses are there
in a language like English? At first, the answer seems obvious: there's past, present, and future. But thanks to something called
grammatical aspect, each of those time periods 
actually divides further. There are four kinds of aspect. In the continuous or progressive aspect, the actions are still happening 
at the time of reference. The perfect aspect describes actions
that are finished. The perfect progressive aspect 
is a combination, describing a completed part 
of a continuous action. And finally, there's the simple aspect, the basic form of the past, 
present, and future tense, where an action is not specified
as continuous or discrete. That's all a little hard to follow,
so let's see how it works in action. Let's say your friends tell you
they went on a secret naval mission to collect evidence 
of a mysterious sea creature. The tense sets the overall frame
of reference in the past, but within that, there are many options. Your friends might say a creature
attacked their boat, that's the past simple,
the most general aspect, which gives no further clarification. They were sleeping when it happened, a continuous process 
underway at that point. They might also tell you they had departed
from Nantucket to describe an action 
completed even earlier. That's an example of the past perfect. Or that they had been sailing 
for three weeks, something that was ongoing 
up until that point. In the present, they tell you that 
they still search for the creature today, their present simple activity. Perhaps they are preparing for their
next mission continuously as they speak. And they have built a special 
submarine for it, a completed achievement. Plus, if they have been researching
possible sightings of the creature, it's something they've been doing 
for a while and are still doing now making it present perfect progressive. So what does this next mission hold? You know it still hasn't happened
because they will depart next week, the future simple. Your friends will be searching 
for the elusive creature, an extended continuous undertaking. They tell you the submarine will have
reached uncharted depths a month from now. That's a confident prediction about what will be achieved 
by a specific point in the future, a point at which they 
will have been voyaging for three weeks in the future perfect progressive. The key insight to all these 
different tenses is that each sentence takes place
in a specific moment, whether it's past, present, or future. The point of aspects is that they tell you
as of that moment the status of the action. In total, they give us twelve 
possibilities in English. What about other languages? Some, like French, Swahili, and Russian
take a similar approach to English. Others describe 
and divide time differently. Some have fewer grammatical tenses,
like Japanese, which only distinguishes past 
from non-past, Buli and Tukang Basi, which only distinguish future 
from non-future, and Mandarin Chinese 
with no verb tenses at all, only aspect. On the other hand, languages like Yagwa
split past tense into multiple degrees, like whether something happened hours, 
weeks, or years ago. In others, tenses are intertwined
with moods that can convey urgency, necessity, or probability of events. This makes translation difficult
but not impossible. Speakers of most languages without certain
tenses can express the same ideas with auxiliary words, 
like would or did, or by specifying the time they mean. Are the variations 
from language to language just differents ways of describing
the same fundamental reality? Or do their diverse structures reflect
different ways of thinking about the world and even time itself? And if so, what other ways 
of conceiving time may be out there?

**Transcript**:
Grammatical tense 
is how languages talk about time without explicitly naming time periods by, instead, modifying verbs 
to specify when action occurs. So how many different tenses are there
in a language like English? At first, the answer seems obvious: there's past, present, and future. But thanks to something called
grammatical aspect, each of those time periods 
actually divides further. There are four kinds of aspect. In the continuous or progressive aspect, the actions are still happening 
at the time of reference. The perfect aspect describes actions
that are finished. The perfect progressive aspect 
is a combination, describing a completed part 
of a continuous action. And finally, there's the simple aspect, the basic form of the past, 
present, and future tense, where an action is not specified
as continuous or discrete. That's all a little hard to follow,
so let's see how it works in action. Let's say your friends tell you
they went on a secret naval mission to collect evidence 
of a mysterious sea creature. The tense sets the overall frame
of reference in the past, but within that, there are many options. Your friends might say a creature
attacked their boat, that's the past simple,
the most general aspect, which gives no further clarification. They were sleeping when it happened, a continuous process 
underway at that point. They might also tell you they had departed
from Nantucket to describe an action 
completed even earlier. That's an example of the past perfect. Or that they had been sailing 
for three weeks, something that was ongoing 
up until that point. In the present, they tell you that 
they still search for the creature today, their present simple activity. Perhaps they are preparing for their
next mission continuously as they speak. And they have built a special 
submarine for it, a completed achievement. Plus, if they have been researching
possible sightings of the creature, it's something they've been doing

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC] [MUSIC] Hey guys! I just learned about a dog named
Chaser. Chaser is a border collie who has a vocabulary of more than 1,000 words, that’s
like the same as a 4-year-old child. What makes Chaser even more special is that he
can even separate nouns from verbs. "take lips. Do it girl!"
"Good girl, good girl." "Paw lamb, paw lamb, Chaser"
"Good girl, good girl" "Nose ABC, nose ABC."
"Good girl, good girl!" This is Oliver. Oliver, you think you're smarter
than Chaser? What do you say? Yeah, let's go find out. Come on! Get your ball. Where's your ball? Get your bone. Where's your bone? Nope, that's your ball.
Where's your bone? Bone. Bone. Nope. Find your bone? Where's your bone?
Okay, so maybe Oliver's not that good at this particular test, but the fact that we even
try to communicate with dogs, and that they communicate back with us, means that the human-dog
relationship is truly something special. "Who's the best boy? (baby talk)" I… have been known to talk to dogs a little. (baby talk)
(baby talk) Or a lot. (baby talk) It’s hard to know if they’re responding
to the words, or just the emotion in my voice. Or the fact that I sound ridiculous. One recent
study suggests it’s both. Or all three. Researchers at the University of Sussex played
sounds out of speakers on both sides of a dog. When dogs heard commands stripped of
their emotional context, they turned their head to the right, suggesting they process
verbal meaning in their left hemisphere. And when they heard the emotional sounds in the
voice, but the words were jumbled, they turned to the left, suggesting they process emotional
sounds on the right. These experiments show that dogs can definitely
separate the meaning of words from the emotion attached. But how much information do they
take from each? When I ask my dogs “Do you want to go for
a walk?” they aren’t processing the real meaning of that sentence the way we do, like
“Hmm, lemme see, do I want to go for a walk right now? Get some exercise? Maybe I’m
just not feeling it today? I mean, I’m a dog, what does it even mean to WANT something?” As good as dogs are with words, in many of
our interactions there’s probably a good amount of Clever Hans at play. In the early
1900’s a horse named Hans was said to be able to solve simple math problems by tapping
his hoof to represent numbers. 2 + 3? Smart horse! It was later found, though, that
Hans couldn’t do math at all. He was just responding to tiny cues from his handlers,
maybe their facial expressions would tense as he got close to the right answer, or they
would exhale when he tapped the right number. Clever Hans demonstrates that while we might
think of language as something we experience mainly through our ears, we communicate meaning
using more than just sound frequencies. In his book "The Expression of the Emotions
in Man and Animals", Charles Darwin argued that the way that we outwardly express and
interpret emotions evolved from animals, and that our ability to recognize fear, happiness,
sadness, even across species, is universal, and innate. It’s something that we’re
born with. Today, scientists are still debating whether
Darwin was right, but recent research suggests that we do share one special bit of emotional
intuition with our canine companions. Dogs are the only non-primate animals that
seek out eye contact with humans. Their wolf ancestors, even tame ones, although they’re
close enough genetically to interbreed with dogs, won’t look us in the eye… which
is why you can never, ever trust a wolf. "How am I doing?" When reading emotions in other people we tend
to look disproportionately and unconsciously to the right side of their face.
Dogs share this so-called left-gaze bias, but only when looking at human faces, not
when they look at other dogs. It seems like they genuinely want to understand what we’re
telling them and what it means. We seem to understand them too, or at least
we think we do. Researchers in Hungary tested people’s ability to interpret the meaning
of recorded dog barks, and found that many people really can speak dog. What do you think this bark means?
[barking] [barking]
Okay, that dog's angry. That's pretty easy. What about this one?
[barking] [barking]
Okay, that dog wants to go for a walk. One more.
[strange noises] I have no idea what that means. If you think about it, this dog-human language
connection makes a lot of sense. We've co-evolved with these creatures for the past 10,000 years
or so. We've molded them from wolves into puppies with our hands and our brains, and
our voices. Even if we don't always understand each other,
well, they're always there to listen, and that's the real meaning of a best friend.
Isn't it buddy? [phone ringing] Wait a second. Sorry. Hello? Um, yeah, sure. It's for you. "Hello? This is Oliver."
"Hello. This is dog." "Oh, hey Luna!"
"Have you seen Vanessa? She's been out for hours! I miss her."
"Ruh roh!" Um, thanks Luna! If you want to find out more
about dog behavior head on over to BrainCraft and find out if they really miss us when we're
gone. Stay curious. Good boy. Oh, and special thanks to Oliver. [MUSIC]

Okay, that dog's angry. That's pretty easy. What about this one?
[barking] [barking]
Okay, that dog wants to go for a walk. One more.
[strange noises] I have no idea what that means. If you think about it, this dog-human language
connection makes a lot of sense. We've co-evolved with these creatures for the past 10,000 years
or so. We've molded them from wolves into puppies with our hands and our brains, and
our voices. Even if we don't always understand each other,
well, they're always there to listen, and that's the real meaning of a best friend.
Isn't it buddy? [phone ringing] Wait a second. Sorry. Hello? Um, yeah, sure. It's for you. "Hello? This is Oliver."
"Hello. This is dog." "Oh, hey Luna!"
"Have you seen Vanessa? She's been out for hours! I miss her."
"Ruh roh!" Um, thanks Luna! If you want to find out more
about dog behavior head on over to BrainCraft and find out if they really miss us when we're
gone. Stay curious. Good boy. Oh, and special thanks to Oliver. [MUSIC]

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 4, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 2
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Every two seconds, someone somewhere 
in the world experiences a stroke. And one out of every six people will have 
one at some point in their lives. Strokes deprive brain cells of oxygen and are one of the most 
common causes of death and a leading cause 
of preventable disability. When someone experiences a stroke,
quick medical care is critical, and can often help avoid 
permanent brain damage. But what causes strokes 
in the first place? And what can doctors do to treat them? The brain makes up just 2% 
of your body’s mass but consumes more than 20%
of the oxygen in your blood. That oxygen is carried to the brain
through a system of arteries. Carotid arteries supply 
the front of the brain, and vertebral arteries supply the back. These are connected to each other, and divide into smaller 
and smaller vessels that get billions of neurons 
the oxygen they need. If the blood flow is interrupted, 
oxygen delivery stops and brain cells die. There are two ways this can happen. Hemorrhagic strokes are when a perforated
vessel allows blood to leak out. But the more common type 
is the ischemic stroke, when a clot blocks a vessel 
and brings blood flow to a halt. Where do these clots come from? On rare occasions,
a sudden change in heart rhythm prevents the upper chambers of the heart
from contracting normally. This slows down blood flow, allowing platelets, clotting factors, 
and fibrin to stick together. The clot can be carried up towards the arteries
and blood vessels supplying the brain until it gets to one 
it can’t squeeze through. This is called an embolism and it cuts off the oxygen supply 
to all the cells downstream. The brain doesn't have pain receptors,
so you can't feel the blockage itself. But oxygen deprivation 
slows brain function and can have sudden, noticeable effects. For example, if the affected area 
is responsible for speech, an individual’s words may be slurred. If the stroke affects a part of the brain 
that controls muscle movement, it can cause weakness, 
often just on one side of the body. When this happens, the body 
will immediately try to compensate by diverting blood flow 
to the affected area, but this isn’t a perfect solution. Eventually, the oxygen-deprived cells 
will start to die, leading to brain damage 
that may be severe or permanent. That’s why it’s important to get
medical care as fast as possible. The first line of treatment
is an intravenous medication called Tissue Plasminogen Activator, which can break up the blood clot and allow blood to flow again
in the compromised artery. If it’s delivered within a few hours, this medication greatly increases
the chance of surviving the stroke and avoiding permanent consequences. If Tissue Plasminogen Activator
cannot be given because the patient 
is on certain medications, has history of major bleeding, or the clot is particularly large, doctors can perform a procedure
called an endovascular thrombectomy. Using a fluorescent dye that illuminates 
the blood vessels under a strong x-ray, the physician inserts a long, 
thin, flexible tube called a catheter into an artery in the leg and maneuvers
it all the way to the blockage. A retriever is passed
through this catheter. It expands and anchors into the clot 
when it’s just past it. The catheter then pulls the clot out 
when it’s removed. These treatments need to be delivered
as soon as possible to preserve brain function, which means figuring out fast 
if someone is having a stroke. So how can you tell? Here are three quick things to try: 1. Ask the person to smile. A crooked mouth or facial drooping 
can indicate muscle weakness. 2. Ask them to raise their arms. If one drifts downward, that arm weakness
is also a sign of a stroke. 3. Ask them to repeat a
simple word or phrase. If their speech sounds
slurred or strange, it could mean that the language area 
of their brain is oxygen-deprived. This is sometimes called the FAST test,
and the T stands for time. If you see any of those signs, 
call emergency services right away. Lives may depend on it.

**Transcript**:
Every two seconds, someone somewhere 
in the world experiences a stroke. And one out of every six people will have 
one at some point in their lives. Strokes deprive brain cells of oxygen and are one of the most 
common causes of death and a leading cause 
of preventable disability. When someone experiences a stroke,
quick medical care is critical, and can often help avoid 
permanent brain damage. But what causes strokes 
in the first place? And what can doctors do to treat them? The brain makes up just 2% 
of your body’s mass but consumes more than 20%
of the oxygen in your blood. That oxygen is carried to the brain
through a system of arteries. Carotid arteries supply 
the front of the brain, and vertebral arteries supply the back. These are connected to each other, and divide into smaller 
and smaller vessels that get billions of neurons 
the oxygen they need. If the blood flow is interrupted, 
oxygen delivery stops and brain cells die. There are two ways this can happen. Hemorrhagic strokes are when a perforated
vessel allows blood to leak out. But the more common type 
is the ischemic stroke, when a clot blocks a vessel 
and brings blood flow to a halt. Where do these clots come from? On rare occasions,
a sudden change in heart rhythm prevents the upper chambers of the heart
from contracting normally. This slows down blood flow, allowing platelets, clotting factors, 
and fibrin to stick together. The clot can be carried up towards the arteries
and blood vessels supplying the brain until it gets to one 
it can’t squeeze through. This is called an embolism and it cuts off the oxygen supply 
to all the cells downstream. The brain doesn't have pain receptors,
so you can't feel the blockage itself. But oxygen deprivation 
slows brain function and can have sudden, noticeable effects. For example, if the affected area 
is responsible for speech, an individual’s words may be slurred. If the stroke affects a part of the brain 
that controls muscle movement, it can cause weakness, 
often just on one side of the body. When this happens, the body 
will immediately try to compensate by diverting blood flow 
to the affected area, but this isn’t a perfect solution. Eventually, the oxygen-deprived cells 
will start to die, leading to brain damage 
that may be severe or permanent. That’s why it’s important to get
medical care as fast as possible. The first line of treatment
is an intravenous medication called Tissue Plasminogen Activator, which can break up the blood clot and allow blood to flow again
in the compromised artery. If it’s delivered within a few hours, this medication greatly increases
the chance of surviving the stroke and avoiding permanent consequences. If Tissue Plasminogen Activator
cannot be given because the patient 
is on certain medications, has history of major bleeding, or the clot is particularly large, doctors can perform a procedure
called an endovascular thrombectomy. Using a fluorescent dye that illuminates 
the blood vessels under a strong x-ray, the physician inserts a long, 
thin, flexible tube called a catheter into an artery in the leg and maneuvers
it all the way to the blockage. A retriever is passed
through this catheter. It expands and anchors into the clot 
when it’s just past it. The catheter then pulls the clot out 
when it’s removed. These treatments need to be delivered
as soon as possible to preserve brain function, which means figuring out fast 
if someone is having a stroke. So how can you tell? Here are three quick things to try: 1. Ask the person to smile. A crooked mouth or facial drooping 
can indicate muscle weakness. 2. Ask them to raise their arms. If one drifts downward, that arm weakness
is also a sign of a stroke. 3. Ask them to repeat a
simple word or phrase. If their speech sounds
slurred or strange, it could mean that the language area 
of their brain is oxygen-deprived. This is sometimes called the FAST test,
and the T stands for time. If you see any of those signs, 
call emergency services right away. Lives may depend on it.

**Transcript**:
Somewhere between the orbits 
of Mars and Jupiter, about 500 million kilometers 
away from Earth, floats a metallic orb 
the size of Massachusetts. That’s no moon...it’s 16 Psyche, one of the most massive
asteroids in the solar system. And it is the asteroid 
our droids are looking for. We humans have managed 
to send robotic spacecraft to all sorts of environments in space – the gas clouds of Saturn and Jupiter, the icy wastes of Europa, and the rocky dunes of Mars. But Psyche’s surface 
isn’t just hard rock – it’s heavy metal. The asteroid mostly consists 
of nickel and iron, by far the largest known body 
with such a composition. But we don’t yet know what it looks like; our best current radar images 
show a pixelated smudge. That’ll change in 2026, when an unmanned spacecraft sent as
part of NASA’s Discovery Program is scheduled to arrive. So why is NASA so interested in Psyche? Are we going to mine all that metal, 
or build a giant space magnet? Actually, the real reason 
is right under our feet. The core of the Earth is thought 
to consist of a solid nickel-iron center with a molten outer layer. But we’re prevented from studying it up
close by 2,800 kilometers of solid rock. The deepest we’ve been able 
to drill is 12 kilometers. Even if we could go further, the pressure at the core is three million
times higher than at the surface, with a temperature 
of 5,000 degrees Celsius. Simply put, a journey to the center of
the Earth is out of the question for now. So scientists have had to resort 
to indirect ways of studying the core, like measuring earthquake waves 
that pass through it, or studying minerals thought 
to have formed there. But what if the best way to study 
Earth’s inner space is by visiting outer space? After all, we have a pretty
good idea of how our planets formed. Dust and gas orbiting our young Sun 
cooled and collided to form a few thousand miniature bodies 
we call planetesimals. As these continued to orbit,
some combined to grow larger, eventually forming our planets. Others experienced impacts 
that broke them apart into smaller chunks– the asteroids we see today 
in the belt between Mars and Jupiter. What makes Psyche so special is that it appears 
to have been a planetesimal well on its way to becoming a planet, with a rocky exterior 
surrounding a metal core. But its progress was cut short 
by a series of hit-and-run collisions with other planetesimals that knocked off the rocky crust 
until only the core remained. Experiencing that many 
destructive collisions with no additive ones in between 
is statistically very unlikely, making Psyche an amazingly 
rare opportunity to study an exposed metallic core. To do that, NASA’s robotic orbiter 
will be equipped with an array of advanced instruments. A spectrometer will analyze 
the gamma rays and neutrons produced when Psyche 
is struck by cosmic rays. Each element in the periodic table releases gamma rays 
of specific wavelengths, so these measurements will tell us 
what elements are found on the surface. A magnetometer will measure 
Psyche’s magnetic field, allowing us to learn more about how Earth’s magnetic field 
is generated at its core. And of course, an imager will give us 
a closer look at the surface than ever before. Visiting a whole new kind of world 
is exciting enough on its own. But the mission to Psyche gives us 
a unique chance to discover our own planet’s innermost 
secrets in an orbit far, far away.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Earth’s inner space is by visiting outer space? After all, we have a pretty
good idea of how our planets formed. Dust and gas orbiting our young Sun 
cooled and collided to form a few thousand miniature bodies 
we call planetesimals. As these continued to orbit,
some combined to grow larger, eventually forming our planets. Others experienced impacts 
that broke them apart into smaller chunks– the asteroids we see today 
in the belt between Mars and Jupiter. What makes Psyche so special is that it appears 
to have been a planetesimal well on its way to becoming a planet, with a rocky exterior 
surrounding a metal core. But its progress was cut short 
by a series of hit-and-run collisions with other planetesimals that knocked off the rocky crust 
until only the core remained. Experiencing that many 
destructive collisions with no additive ones in between 
is statistically very unlikely, making Psyche an amazingly 
rare opportunity to study an exposed metallic core. To do that, NASA’s robotic orbiter 
will be equipped with an array of advanced instruments. A spectrometer will analyze 
the gamma rays and neutrons produced when Psyche 
is struck by cosmic rays. Each element in the periodic table releases gamma rays 
of specific wavelengths, so these measurements will tell us 
what elements are found on the surface. A magnetometer will measure 
Psyche’s magnetic field, allowing us to learn more about how Earth’s magnetic field 
is generated at its core. And of course, an imager will give us 
a closer look at the surface than ever before. Visiting a whole new kind of world 
is exciting enough on its own. But the mission to Psyche gives us 
a unique chance to discover our own planet’s innermost 
secrets in an orbit far, far away.

Somewhere between the orbits 
of Mars and Jupiter, about 500 million kilometers 
away from Earth, floats a metallic orb 
the size of Massachusetts. That’s no moon...it’s 16 Psyche, one of the most massive
asteroids in the solar system. And it is the asteroid 
our droids are looking for. We humans have managed 
to send robotic spacecraft to all sorts of environments in space – the gas clouds of Saturn and Jupiter, the icy wastes of Europa, and the rocky dunes of Mars. But Psyche’s surface 
isn’t just hard rock – it’s heavy metal. The asteroid mostly consists 
of nickel and iron, by far the largest known body 
with such a composition. But we don’t yet know what it looks like; our best current radar images 
show a pixelated smudge. That’ll change in 2026, when an unmanned spacecraft sent as
part of NASA’s Discovery Program is scheduled to arrive. So why is NASA so interested in Psyche? Are we going to mine all that metal, 
or build a giant space magnet? Actually, the real reason 
is right under our feet. The core of the Earth is thought 
to consist of a solid nickel-iron center with a molten outer layer. But we’re prevented from studying it up
close by 2,800 kilometers of solid rock. The deepest we’ve been able 
to drill is 12 kilometers. Even if we could go further, the pressure at the core is three million
times higher than at the surface, with a temperature 
of 5,000 degrees Celsius. Simply put, a journey to the center of
the Earth is out of the question for now. So scientists have had to resort 
to indirect ways of studying the core, like measuring earthquake waves 
that pass through it, or studying minerals thought 
to have formed there. But what if the best way to study

**Transcript**:
Here's an intriguing fact. In the developed world, everywhere, women live an average
of six to eight years longer than men do. Six to eight years longer. That's, like, a huge gap. In 2015, the "Lancet" published an article showing that men in rich countries are twice as likely to die as women are at any age. But there is one place in the world where men live as long as women. It's a remote, mountainous zone, a blue zone, where super longevity is common to both sexes. This is the blue zone in Sardinia, an Italian island in the Mediterranean, between Corsica and Tunisia, where there are six times
as many centenarians as on the Italian mainland, less than 200 miles away. There are 10 times as many centenarians as there are in North America. It's the only place
where men live as long as women. But why? My curiosity was piqued. I decided to research the science
and the habits of the place, and I started with the genetic profile. I discovered soon enough that genes account for just
25 percent of their longevity. The other 75 percent is lifestyle. So what does it take
to live to 100 or beyond? What are they doing right? What you're looking at
is an aerial view of Villagrande. It's a village at the epicenter
of the blue zone where I went to investigate this, and as you can see, architectural beauty
is not its main virtue, density is: tightly spaced houses, interwoven alleys and streets. It means that the villagers' lives
constantly intersect. And as I walked through the village, I could feel hundreds
of pairs of eyes watching me from behind doorways and curtains, from behind shutters. Because like all ancient villages, Villagrande couldn't have survived without this structure,
without its walls, without its cathedral, without its village square, because defense and social cohesion
defined its design. Urban priorities changed as we moved
towards the industrial revolution because infectious disease
became the risk of the day. But what about now? Now, social isolation
is the public health risk of our time. Now, a third of the population says they have two or fewer people to lean on. But let's go to Villagrande
now as a contrast to meet some centenarians. Meet Giuseppe Murinu.
He's 102, a supercentenarian and a lifelong resident
of the village of Villagrande. He was a gregarious man. He loved to recount stories such as how he lived like a bird from what he could find
on the forest floor during not one but two world wars, how he and his wife,
who also lived past 100, raised six children
in a small, homey kitchen where I interviewed him. Here he is with his sons
Angelo and Domenico, both in their 70s
and looking after their father, and who were quite frankly
very suspicious of me and my daughter who came along with me
on this research trip, because the flip side of social cohesion is a wariness of strangers and outsiders. But Giuseppe, he wasn't suspicious at all. He was a happy-go-lucky guy, very outgoing with a positive outlook. And I wondered: so is that what it takes
to live to be 100 or beyond, thinking positively? Actually, no. (Laughter) Meet Giovanni Corrias. He's 101, the grumpiest person I have ever met. (Laughter) And he put a lie to the notion that you have to be positive
to live a long life. And there is evidence for this. When I asked him why he lived so long, he kind of looked at me
under hooded eyelids and he growled, "Nobody has to know my secrets." (Laughter) But despite being a sourpuss, the niece who lived with him
and looked after him called him "Il Tesoro," "my treasure." And she respected him and loved him, and she told me, when I questioned
this obvious loss of her freedom, "You just don't understand, do you? Looking after this man is a pleasure. It's a huge privilege for me. This is my heritage." And indeed, wherever I went
to interview these centenarians, I found a kitchen party. Here's Giovanni with his two nieces, Maria above him and beside him his great-niece Sara, who came when I was there
to bring fresh fruits and vegetables. And I quickly discovered by being there that in the blue zone, as people age, and indeed across their lifespans, they're always surrounded
by extended family, by friends, by neighbors, the priest,
the barkeeper, the grocer. People are always there or dropping by. They are never left
to live solitary lives. This is unlike the rest
of the developed world, where as George Burns quipped, "Happiness is having a large,
loving, caring family in another city." (Laughter) Now, so far we've only met men, long-living men, but I met women too, and here you see Zia Teresa. She, at over 100, taught me
how to make the local specialty, which is called culurgiones, which are these large pasta pockets like ravioli about this size, this size, and they're filled
with high-fat ricotta and mint and drenched in tomato sauce. And she showed me
how to make just the right crimp so they wouldn't open, and she makes them
with her daughters every Sunday and distributes them
by the dozens to neighbors and friends. And that's when I discovered
a low-fat, gluten-free diet is not what it takes
to live to 100 in the blue zone. (Applause) Now, these centenarians' stories
along with the science that underpins them prompted me to ask myself
some questions too, such as, when am I going to die
and how can I put that day off? And as you will see,
the answer is not what we expect. Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a researcher
at Brigham Young University and she addressed this very question in a series of studies of tens of thousands of middle aged people much like this audience here. And she looked at every
aspect of their lifestyle: their diet, their exercise, their marital status, how often they went to the doctor, whether they smoked or drank, etc. She recorded all of this and then she and her colleagues
sat tight and waited for seven years to see who would still be breathing. And of the people left standing, what reduced their chances
of dying the most? That was her question. So let's now look at her data in summary, going from the least powerful
predictor to the strongest. OK? So clean air, which is great, it doesn't predict how long you will live. Whether you have your hypertension treated is good. Still not a strong predictor. Whether you're lean or overweight,
you can stop feeling guilty about this, because it's only in third place. How much exercise you get is next, still only a moderate predictor. Whether you've had a cardiac event
and you're in rehab and exercising, getting higher now. Whether you've had a flu vaccine. Did anybody here know that having a flu vaccine
protects you more than doing exercise? Whether you were drinking and quit, or whether you're a moderate drinker, whether you don't smoke,
or if you did, whether you quit, and getting towards the top predictors are two features of your social life. First, your close relationships. These are the people
that you can call on for a loan if you need money suddenly, who will call the doctor
if you're not feeling well or who will take you to the hospital, or who will sit with you
if you're having an existential crisis, if you're in despair. Those people, that little clutch of people are a strong predictor, if you have them,
of how long you'll live. And then something that surprised me, something that's called
social integration. This means how much
you interact with people as you move through your day. How many people do you talk to? And these mean both
your weak and your strong bonds, so not just the people
you're really close to, who mean a lot to you, but, like, do you talk to the guy
who every day makes you your coffee? Do you talk to the postman? Do you talk to the woman who walks
by your house every day with her dog? Do you play bridge or poker,
have a book club? Those interactions
are one of the strongest predictors of how long you'll live. Now, this leads me to the next question: if we now spend more time online
than on any other activity, including sleeping, we're now up to 11 hours a day, one hour more than last year, by the way, does it make a difference? Why distinguish
between interacting in person and interacting via social media? Is it the same thing as being there if you're in contact constantly
with your kids through text, for example? Well, the short answer
to the question is no, it's not the same thing. Face-to-face contact releases
a whole cascade of neurotransmitters, and like a vaccine,
they protect you now in the present and well into the future. So simply making
eye contact with somebody, shaking hands, giving somebody a high-five is enough to release oxytocin, which increases your level of trust and it lowers your cortisol levels. So it lowers your stress. And dopamine is generated,
which gives us a little high and it kills pain. It's like a naturally produced morphine. Now, all of this passes
under our conscious radar, which is why we conflate
online activity with the real thing. But we do have evidence now,
fresh evidence, that there is a difference. So let's look at some of the neuroscience. Elizabeth Redcay, a neuroscientist
at the University of Maryland, tried to map the difference between what goes on in our brains
when we interact in person versus when we're watching
something that's static. And what she did was
she compared the brain function of two groups of people, those interacting live with her or with one of her research associates in a dynamic conversation, and she compared that
to the brain activity of people who were watching her talk
about the same subject but in a canned video, like on YouTube. And by the way, if you want to know how she fit two people
in an MRI scanner at the same time, talk to me later. So what's the difference? This is your brain
on real social interaction. What you're seeing
is the difference in brain activity between interacting in person
and taking in static content. In orange, you see the brain areas
that are associated with attention, social intelligence -- that means anticipating
what somebody else is thinking and feeling and planning -- and emotional reward. And these areas become much more engaged when we're interacting
with a live partner. Now, these richer brain signatures might be why recruiters
from Fortune 500 companies evaluating candidates thought that the candidates were smarter when they heard their voices compared to when they just
read their pitches in a text, for example, or an email or a letter. Now, our voices and body language
convey a rich signal. It shows that we're thinking, feeling, sentient human beings who are much more than an algorithm. Now, this research by Nicholas Epley at the University of Chicago
Business School is quite amazing because
it tells us a simple thing. If somebody hears your voice, they think you're smarter. I mean, that's quite a simple thing. Now, to return to the beginning, why do women live longer than men? And one major reason
is that women are more likely to prioritize and groom
their face-to-face relationships over their lifespans. Fresh evidence shows that these in-person friendships create a biological force field
against disease and decline. And it's not just true of humans but their primate relations,
our primate relations as well. Anthropologist Joan Silk's work
shows that female baboons who have a core of female friends show lower levels of stress
via their cortisol levels, they live longer and they have
more surviving offspring. At least three stable relationships. That was the magic number. Think about it. I hope you guys have three. The power of such face-to-face contact is really why there are
the lowest rates of dementia among people who are socially engaged. It's why women who have breast cancer are four times more likely
to survive their disease than loners are. Why men who've had a stroke
who meet regularly to play poker or to have coffee or to play old-timer's hockey -- I'm Canadian, after all -- (Laughter) are better protected
by that social contact than they are by medication. Why men who've had a stroke
who meet regularly -- this is something very
powerful they can do. This face-to-face contact
provides stunning benefits, yet now almost a quarter of the population
says they have no one to talk to. We can do something about this. Like Sardinian villagers, it's a biological imperative
to know we belong, and not just the women among us. Building in-person interaction
into our cities, into our workplaces, into our agendas bolsters the immune system, sends feel-good hormones
surging through the bloodstream and brain and helps us live longer. I call this building your village, and building it and sustaining it
is a matter of life and death. Thank you. (Applause) Helen Walters: Susan, come back.
I have a question for you. I'm wondering if there's a middle path. So you talk about the neurotransmitters
connecting when in face-to-face, but what about digital technology? We've seen enormous improvements
in digital technology like FaceTime, things like that. Does that work too? I mean, I see my nephew. He plays Minecraft
and he's yelling at his friends. It seems like he's connecting pretty well. Is that useful? Is that helpful? Susan Pinker: Some of the data
are just emerging. The data are so fresh
that the digital revolution happened and the health data trailed behind. So we're just learning, but I would say
there are some improvements that we could make in the technology. For example, the camera on your laptop
is at the top of the screen, so for example, when you're
looking into the screen, you're not actually making eye contact. So something as simple
as even just looking into the camera can increase those neurotransmitters, or maybe changing
the position of the camera. So it's not identical, but I think
we are getting closer with the technology. HW: Great. Thank you so much. SP: Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Here's an intriguing fact. In the developed world, everywhere, women live an average
of six to eight years longer than men do. Six to eight years longer. That's, like, a huge gap. In 2015, the "Lancet" published an article showing that men in rich countries are twice as likely to die as women are at any age. But there is one place in the world where men live as long as women. It's a remote, mountainous zone, a blue zone, where super longevity is common to both sexes. This is the blue zone in Sardinia, an Italian island in the Mediterranean, between Corsica and Tunisia, where there are six times
as many centenarians as on the Italian mainland, less than 200 miles away. There are 10 times as many centenarians as there are in North America. It's the only place
where men live as long as women. But why? My curiosity was piqued. I decided to research the science
and the habits of the place, and I started with the genetic profile. I discovered soon enough that genes account for just
25 percent of their longevity. The other 75 percent is lifestyle. So what does it take
to live to 100 or beyond? What are they doing right? What you're looking at
is an aerial view of Villagrande. It's a village at the epicenter
of the blue zone where I went to investigate this, and as you can see, architectural beauty
is not its main virtue, density is: tightly spaced houses, interwoven alleys and streets. It means that the villagers' lives
constantly intersect. And as I walked through the village, I could feel hundreds
of pairs of eyes watching me from behind doorways and curtains, from behind shutters. Because like all ancient villages, Villagrande couldn't have survived without this structure,
without its walls, without its cathedral, without its village square, because defense and social cohesion
defined its design. Urban priorities changed as we moved
towards the industrial revolution because infectious disease
became the risk of the day. But what about now? Now, social isolation
is the public health risk of our time. Now, a third of the population says they have two or fewer people to lean on. But let's go to Villagrande
now as a contrast to meet some centenarians. Meet Giuseppe Murinu.
He's 102, a supercentenarian and a lifelong resident
of the village of Villagrande. He was a gregarious man. He loved to recount stories such as how he lived like a bird from what he could find
on the forest floor during not one but two world wars, how he and his wife,
who also lived past 100, raised six children
in a small, homey kitchen where I interviewed him. Here he is with his sons
Angelo and Domenico, both in their 70s
and looking after their father, and who were quite frankly
very suspicious of me and my daughter who came along with me
on this research trip, because the flip side of social cohesion is a wariness of strangers and outsiders. But Giuseppe, he wasn't suspicious at all. He was a happy-go-lucky guy, very outgoing with a positive outlook. And I wondered: so is that what it takes
to live to be 100 or beyond, thinking positively? Actually, no. (Laughter) Meet Giovanni Corrias. He's 101, the grumpiest person I have ever met. (Laughter) And he put a lie to the notion that you have to be positive
to live a long life. And there is evidence for this. When I asked him why he lived so long, he kind of looked at me
under hooded eyelids and he growled, "Nobody has to know my secrets." (Laughter) But despite being a sourpuss, the niece who lived with him
and looked after him called him "Il Tesoro," "my treasure." And she respected him and loved him, and she told me, when I questioned
this obvious loss of her freedom, "You just don't understand, do you? Looking after this man is a pleasure. It's a huge privilege for me. This is my heritage." And indeed, wherever I went
to interview these centenarians, I found a kitchen party. Here's Giovanni with his two nieces, Maria above him and beside him his great-niece Sara, who came when I was there
to bring fresh fruits and vegetables. And I quickly discovered by being there that in the blue zone, as people age, and indeed across their lifespans, they're always surrounded
by extended family, by friends, by neighbors, the priest,
the barkeeper, the grocer. People are always there or dropping by. They are never left
to live solitary lives. This is unlike the rest
of the developed world, where as George Burns quipped, "Happiness is having a large,
loving, caring family in another city." (Laughter) Now, so far we've only met men, long-living men, but I met women too, and here you see Zia Teresa. She, at over 100, taught me
how to make the local specialty, which is called culurgiones, which are these large pasta pockets like ravioli about this size, this size, and they're filled
with high-fat ricotta and mint and drenched in tomato sauce. And she showed me
how to make just the right crimp so they wouldn't open, and she makes them
with her daughters every Sunday and distributes them
by the dozens to neighbors and friends. And that's when I discovered
a low-fat, gluten-free diet is not what it takes
to live to 100 in the blue zone. (Applause) Now, these centenarians' stories
along with the science that underpins them prompted me to ask myself
some questions too, such as, when am I going to die
and how can I put that day off? And as you will see,
the answer is not what we expect. Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a researcher
at Brigham Young University and she addressed this very question in a series of studies of tens of thousands of middle aged people much like this audience here. And she looked at every
aspect of their lifestyle: their diet, their exercise, their marital status, how often they went to the doctor, whether they smoked or drank, etc. She recorded all of this and then she and her colleagues
sat tight and waited for seven years to see who would still be breathing. And of the people left standing, what reduced their chances
of dying the most? That was her question. So let's now look at her data in summary, going from the least powerful
predictor to the strongest. OK? So clean air, which is great, it doesn't predict how long you will live. Whether you have your hypertension treated is good. Still not a strong predictor. Whether you're lean or overweight,
you can stop feeling guilty about this, because it's only in third place. How much exercise you get is next, still only a moderate predictor. Whether you've had a cardiac event
and you're in rehab and exercising, getting higher now. Whether you've had a flu vaccine. Did anybody here know that having a flu vaccine
protects you more than doing exercise? Whether you were drinking and quit, or whether you're a moderate drinker, whether you don't smoke,
or if you did, whether you quit, and getting towards the top predictors are two features of your social life. First, your close relationships. These are the people
that you can call on for a loan if you need money suddenly, who will call the doctor
if you're not feeling well or who will take you to the hospital, or who will sit with you
if you're having an existential crisis, if you're in despair. Those people, that little clutch of people are a strong predictor, if you have them,
of how long you'll live. And then something that surprised me, something that's called
social integration. This means how much
you interact with people as you move through your day. How many people do you talk to? And these mean both
your weak and your strong bonds, so not just the people
you're really close to, who mean a lot to you, but, like, do you talk to the guy
who every day makes you your coffee? Do you talk to the postman? Do you talk to the woman who walks
by your house every day with her dog? Do you play bridge or poker,
have a book club? Those interactions
are one of the strongest predictors of how long you'll live. Now, this leads me to the next question: if we now spend more time online
than on any other activity, including sleeping, we're now up to 11 hours a day, one hour more than last year, by the way, does it make a difference? Why distinguish
between interacting in person and interacting via social media? Is it the same thing as being there if you're in contact constantly
with your kids through text, for example? Well, the short answer
to the question is no, it's not the same thing. Face-to-face contact releases
a whole cascade of neurotransmitters, and like a vaccine,
they protect you now in the present and well into the future. So simply making
eye contact with somebody, shaking hands, giving somebody a high-five is enough to release oxytocin, which increases your level of trust and it lowers your cortisol levels. So it lowers your stress. And dopamine is generated,
which gives us a little high and it kills pain. It's like a naturally produced morphine. Now, all of this passes
under our conscious radar, which is why we conflate
online activity with the real thing. But we do have evidence now,
fresh evidence, that there is a difference. So let's look at some of the neuroscience. Elizabeth Redcay, a neuroscientist
at the University of Maryland, tried to map the difference between what goes on in our brains
when we interact in person versus when we're watching
something that's static. And what she did was
she compared the brain function of two groups of people, those interacting live with her or with one of her research associates in a dynamic conversation, and she compared that
to the brain activity of people who were watching her talk
about the same subject but in a canned video, like on YouTube. And by the way, if you want to know how she fit two people
in an MRI scanner at the same time, talk to me later. So what's the difference? This is your brain
on real social interaction. What you're seeing
is the difference in brain activity between interacting in person
and taking in static content. In orange, you see the brain areas
that are associated with attention, social intelligence -- that means anticipating
what somebody else is thinking and feeling and planning -- and emotional reward. And these areas become much more engaged when we're interacting
with a live partner. Now, these richer brain signatures might be why recruiters
from Fortune 500 companies evaluating candidates thought that the candidates were smarter when they heard their voices compared to when they just
read their pitches in a text, for example, or an email or a letter. Now, our voices and body language
convey a rich signal. It shows that we're thinking, feeling, sentient human beings who are much more than an algorithm. Now, this research by Nicholas Epley at the University of Chicago
Business School is quite amazing because
it tells us a simple thing. If somebody hears your voice, they think you're smarter. I mean, that's quite a simple thing. Now, to return to the beginning, why do women live longer than men? And one major reason
is that women are more likely to prioritize and groom
their face-to-face relationships over their lifespans. Fresh evidence shows that these in-person friendships create a biological force field
against disease and decline. And it's not just true of humans but their primate relations,
our primate relations as well. Anthropologist Joan Silk's work
shows that female baboons who have a core of female friends show lower levels of stress
via their cortisol levels, they live longer and they have
more surviving offspring. At least three stable relationships. That was the magic number. Think about it. I hope you guys have three. The power of such face-to-face contact is really why there are
the lowest rates of dementia among people who are socially engaged. It's why women who have breast cancer are four times more likely
to survive their disease than loners are. Why men who've had a stroke
who meet regularly to play poker or to have coffee or to play old-timer's hockey -- I'm Canadian, after all -- (Laughter) are better protected
by that social contact than they are by medication. Why men who've had a stroke
who meet regularly -- this is something very
powerful they can do. This face-to-face contact
provides stunning benefits, yet now almost a quarter of the population
says they have no one to talk to. We can do something about this. Like Sardinian villagers, it's a biological imperative
to know we belong, and not just the women among us. Building in-person interaction
into our cities, into our workplaces, into our agendas bolsters the immune system, sends feel-good hormones
surging through the bloodstream and brain and helps us live longer. I call this building your village, and building it and sustaining it
is a matter of life and death. Thank you. (Applause) Helen Walters: Susan, come back.
I have a question for you. I'm wondering if there's a middle path. So you talk about the neurotransmitters
connecting when in face-to-face, but what about digital technology? We've seen enormous improvements
in digital technology like FaceTime, things like that. Does that work too? I mean, I see my nephew. He plays Minecraft
and he's yelling at his friends. It seems like he's connecting pretty well. Is that useful? Is that helpful? Susan Pinker: Some of the data
are just emerging. The data are so fresh
that the digital revolution happened and the health data trailed behind. So we're just learning, but I would say
there are some improvements that we could make in the technology. For example, the camera on your laptop
is at the top of the screen, so for example, when you're
looking into the screen, you're not actually making eye contact. So something as simple
as even just looking into the camera can increase those neurotransmitters, or maybe changing
the position of the camera. So it's not identical, but I think
we are getting closer with the technology. HW: Great. Thank you so much. SP: Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
When historians talk about 
the atrocities of the 20th century, we often think of those that took place
during and between the two World Wars. Along with the Armenian genocide 
in modern-day Turkey, the Rape of Nanking in China, and Kristallnacht in Germany, another horrific ethnic cleansing campaign occurred on an island between 
the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The roots of this conflict 
go back to 1492, when Christopher Columbus stumbled 
onto the Caribbean island that would come to be named Hispaniola,
launching a wave of European colonization. The island’s Taíno natives were decimated 
by violence and disease and the Europeans imported large numbers
of enslaved Africans to toil in profitable sugar plantations. By 1777, the island had become divided between a French-controlled West 
and a Spanish-controlled East. A mass slave revolt won Haiti 
its independence from France in 1804 and it became the world’s 
first Black republic. But the new nation paid dearly, shut out of the world economy and 
saddled with debt by its former masters. Meanwhile, the Dominican Republic 
would declare independence by first overthrowing Haitian rule 
of eastern Hispaniola and later Spanish 
and American colonialism. Despite the long and collaborative history
shared by these two countries, many Dominican elites saw Haiti 
as a racial threat that imperiled political and commercial
relations with white western nations. In the years following World War I, the United States occupied 
both parts of the island. It did so to secure its power 
in the Western hemisphere by destroying local opposition 
and installing US-friendly governments. The brutal and racist nature 
of the US occupation, particularly along the remote
Dominican-Haitian border, laid the foundation for bigger atrocities 
after its withdrawal. In 1930, liberal Dominican president 
Horacio Vásquez was overthrown by the chief of his army, 
Rafael Trujillo. Despite being a quarter Haitian himself, Trujillo saw the presence of a bicultural 
Haitian and Dominican borderland as both a threat to his power and an escape route 
for political revolutionaries. In a chilling speech on October 2, 1937, he left no doubt about his intentions 
for the region. Claiming to be protecting Dominican
farmers from theft and incursion, Trujillo announced the killing 
of 300 Haitians along the border and promised that this so-called "remedy" 
would continue. Over the next few weeks, 
the Dominican military, acting on Trujillo’s orders, murdered thousands of Haitian men 
and women, and even their Dominican-born children. The military targeted Black Haitians, even though many Dominicans themselves 
were also dark-skinned. Some accounts say that to distinguish
the residents of one country from the other, the killers forced their victims 
to say the Spanish word for parsley. Dominicans pronounce it perejil, 
with a trilled Spanish "r." The primary Haitian language, however,
is Kreyol, which doesn’t use a trilled r. So if people struggled to say perejil, they were judged to be Haitian 
and immediately killed. Yet recent scholarship suggests 
that tests like this weren’t the sole factor used to determine
who would be murdered, especially because many of the border 
residents were bilingual. The Dominican government censored
any news of the massacre, while bodies were thrown in ravines, dumped in rivers, or burned to dispose of the evidence. This is why no one knows exactly 
how many people were murdered, though contemporary estimates 
range from about 4,000 to 15,000. Yet the extent of the carnage 
was clear to many observers. As the US Ambassador to 
the Dominican Republic at the time noted, “The entire northwest of the frontier
on the Dajabón side is absolutely devoid of Haitians. Those not slain either fled across the
frontier or are still hiding in the bush.” The government tried 
to disclaim responsibility and blame the killings 
on vigilante civilians, but Trujillo was condemned 
internationally. Eventually, the Dominican government was forced to pay only $525,000 
in reparations to Haiti, but due to corrupt bureaucracy, barely any of these funds reached 
survivors or their families. Neither Trujillo nor anyone 
in his government was ever punished for this crime 
against humanity. The legacy of the massacre remains 
a source of tension between the two countries. Activists on both sides of the border 
have tried to heal the wounds of the past. But the Dominican state has done little, 
if anything, to officially commemorate 
the massacre or its victims. Meanwhile, the memory of the Haitian
massacre remains a chilling reminder of how power-hungry leaders
can manipulate people into turning against 
their lifelong neighbors.

**Transcript**:
When historians talk about 
the atrocities of the 20th century, we often think of those that took place
during and between the two World Wars. Along with the Armenian genocide 
in modern-day Turkey, the Rape of Nanking in China, and Kristallnacht in Germany, another horrific ethnic cleansing campaign occurred on an island between 
the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The roots of this conflict 
go back to 1492, when Christopher Columbus stumbled 
onto the Caribbean island that would come to be named Hispaniola,
launching a wave of European colonization. The island’s Taíno natives were decimated 
by violence and disease and the Europeans imported large numbers
of enslaved Africans to toil in profitable sugar plantations. By 1777, the island had become divided between a French-controlled West 
and a Spanish-controlled East. A mass slave revolt won Haiti 
its independence from France in 1804 and it became the world’s 
first Black republic. But the new nation paid dearly, shut out of the world economy and 
saddled with debt by its former masters. Meanwhile, the Dominican Republic 
would declare independence by first overthrowing Haitian rule 
of eastern Hispaniola and later Spanish 
and American colonialism. Despite the long and collaborative history
shared by these two countries, many Dominican elites saw Haiti 
as a racial threat that imperiled political and commercial
relations with white western nations. In the years following World War I, the United States occupied 
both parts of the island. It did so to secure its power 
in the Western hemisphere by destroying local opposition 
and installing US-friendly governments. The brutal and racist nature 
of the US occupation, particularly along the remote
Dominican-Haitian border, laid the foundation for bigger atrocities 
after its withdrawal. In 1930, liberal Dominican president 
Horacio Vásquez was overthrown by the chief of his army, 
Rafael Trujillo. Despite being a quarter Haitian himself, Trujillo saw the presence of a bicultural 
Haitian and Dominican borderland as both a threat to his power and an escape route 
for political revolutionaries. In a chilling speech on October 2, 1937, he left no doubt about his intentions 
for the region. Claiming to be protecting Dominican
farmers from theft and incursion, Trujillo announced the killing 
of 300 Haitians along the border and promised that this so-called "remedy" 
would continue. Over the next few weeks, 
the Dominican military, acting on Trujillo’s orders, murdered thousands of Haitian men 
and women, and even their Dominican-born children. The military targeted Black Haitians, even though many Dominicans themselves 
were also dark-skinned. Some accounts say that to distinguish
the residents of one country from the other, the killers forced their victims 
to say the Spanish word for parsley. Dominicans pronounce it perejil, 
with a trilled Spanish "r." The primary Haitian language, however,
is Kreyol, which doesn’t use a trilled r. So if people struggled to say perejil, they were judged to be Haitian 
and immediately killed. Yet recent scholarship suggests 
that tests like this weren’t the sole factor used to determine
who would be murdered, especially because many of the border 
residents were bilingual. The Dominican government censored
any news of the massacre, while bodies were thrown in ravines, dumped in rivers, or burned to dispose of the evidence. This is why no one knows exactly 
how many people were murdered, though contemporary estimates 
range from about 4,000 to 15,000. Yet the extent of the carnage 
was clear to many observers. As the US Ambassador to 
the Dominican Republic at the time noted, “The entire northwest of the frontier
on the Dajabón side is absolutely devoid of Haitians. Those not slain either fled across the
frontier or are still hiding in the bush.” The government tried 
to disclaim responsibility and blame the killings 
on vigilante civilians, but Trujillo was condemned 
internationally. Eventually, the Dominican government was forced to pay only $525,000 
in reparations to Haiti, but due to corrupt bureaucracy, barely any of these funds reached 
survivors or their families. Neither Trujillo nor anyone 
in his government was ever punished for this crime 
against humanity. The legacy of the massacre remains 
a source of tension between the two countries. Activists on both sides of the border 
have tried to heal the wounds of the past. But the Dominican state has done little, 
if anything, to officially commemorate 
the massacre or its victims. Meanwhile, the memory of the Haitian
massacre remains a chilling reminder of how power-hungry leaders
can manipulate people into turning against 
their lifelong neighbors.

**Transcript**:
You heard the traveler's tales, you followed the crumbling maps, and now, after a long and dangerous quest, you have some good news and some bad news. The good news is you've managed to locate
the legendary dungeon containing the stash 
of ancient Stygian coins and the eccentric wizard 
who owns the castle has even generously
agreed to let you have them. The bad news is that he's not
quite as generous about letting you leave the dungeon,
unless you solve his puzzle. The task sounds simple enough. Both faces of each coin bear
the fearsome scorpion crest, one in silver, one in gold. And all you have to do is separate them
into two piles so that each has the same number
of coins facing silver side up. You're about to begin when all
of the torches suddenly blow out and you're left in total darkness. There are hundreds 
of coins in front of you and each one feels the same on both sides. You try to remember 
where the silver-facing coins were, but it's hopeless. You've lost track. But you do know one thing for certain. When there was still light, you counted exactly 
20 silver-side-up coins in the pile. What can you do? Are you doomed to remain in the dungeon
with your newfound treasure forever? You're tempted to kick the pile of coins and curse the curiosity 
that brought you here. But at the last moment, you stop yourself. You just realized there's 
a surprisingly easy solution. What is it? Pause here if you want to figure
it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You carefully move aside 20 coins
one by one. It doesn't matter which ones:
any coins will do, and then flip each one of them over. That's all there is to it. Why does such a simple solution work? Well, it doesn't matter how many
coins there are to start with. What matters is that only 20
of the total are facing silver side up. When you take 20 coins in the darkness, you have no way of knowing how many
of these silver-facing coins have ended up in your new pile. But let's suppose you got 7 of them. This means that there are 13
silver-facing coins left in the original pile. It also means that the other
13 coins in your new pile are facing gold side up. So what happens when you flip
all of the coins in the new pile over? Seven gold-facing coins and
13 silver-facing coins to match the ones in the original pile. It turns out this works no matter how
many of the silver-facing coins you grab, whether it's all of them, 
a few, or none at all. That's because of what's known
as complementary events. We know that each coin only has
two possible options. If it's not facing silver side up,
it must be gold side up, and vice versa, and in any combination of 20 coins, the number of gold-facing
and silver-facing coins must add up to 20. We can prove this mathematically
using algebra. The number of silver-facing coins
remaining in the original pile will always be 20 minus
however many you moved to the new pile. And since your new pile also
has a total of 20 coins, its number of gold-facing coins will be 20 minus the amount of

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You heard the traveler's tales, you followed the crumbling maps, and now, after a long and dangerous quest, you have some good news and some bad news. The good news is you've managed to locate
the legendary dungeon containing the stash 
of ancient Stygian coins and the eccentric wizard 
who owns the castle has even generously
agreed to let you have them. The bad news is that he's not
quite as generous about letting you leave the dungeon,
unless you solve his puzzle. The task sounds simple enough. Both faces of each coin bear
the fearsome scorpion crest, one in silver, one in gold. And all you have to do is separate them
into two piles so that each has the same number
of coins facing silver side up. You're about to begin when all
of the torches suddenly blow out and you're left in total darkness. There are hundreds 
of coins in front of you and each one feels the same on both sides. You try to remember 
where the silver-facing coins were, but it's hopeless. You've lost track. But you do know one thing for certain. When there was still light, you counted exactly 
20 silver-side-up coins in the pile. What can you do? Are you doomed to remain in the dungeon
with your newfound treasure forever? You're tempted to kick the pile of coins and curse the curiosity 
that brought you here. But at the last moment, you stop yourself. You just realized there's 
a surprisingly easy solution. What is it? Pause here if you want to figure
it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You carefully move aside 20 coins
one by one. It doesn't matter which ones:
any coins will do, and then flip each one of them over. That's all there is to it. Why does such a simple solution work? Well, it doesn't matter how many
coins there are to start with. What matters is that only 20
of the total are facing silver side up. When you take 20 coins in the darkness, you have no way of knowing how many
of these silver-facing coins have ended up in your new pile. But let's suppose you got 7 of them. This means that there are 13
silver-facing coins left in the original pile. It also means that the other
13 coins in your new pile are facing gold side up. So what happens when you flip
all of the coins in the new pile over? Seven gold-facing coins and
13 silver-facing coins to match the ones in the original pile. It turns out this works no matter how
many of the silver-facing coins you grab, whether it's all of them, 
a few, or none at all. That's because of what's known
as complementary events. We know that each coin only has
two possible options. If it's not facing silver side up,
it must be gold side up, and vice versa, and in any combination of 20 coins, the number of gold-facing
and silver-facing coins must add up to 20. We can prove this mathematically
using algebra. The number of silver-facing coins
remaining in the original pile will always be 20 minus
however many you moved to the new pile. And since your new pile also
has a total of 20 coins, its number of gold-facing coins will be 20 minus the amount of 
silver-facing coins you moved. When all the coins in the new pile
are flipped, these gold-facing coins become
silver-facing coins, so now the number of silver-facing
coins in both piles is the same. The gate swings open
and you hurry away with your treasure before the wizard changes his mind. At the next crossroads, you flip

coins there are to start with. What matters is that only 20
of the total are facing silver side up. When you take 20 coins in the darkness, you have no way of knowing how many
of these silver-facing coins have ended up in your new pile. But let's suppose you got 7 of them. This means that there are 13
silver-facing coins left in the original pile. It also means that the other
13 coins in your new pile are facing gold side up. So what happens when you flip
all of the coins in the new pile over? Seven gold-facing coins and
13 silver-facing coins to match the ones in the original pile. It turns out this works no matter how
many of the silver-facing coins you grab, whether it's all of them, 
a few, or none at all. That's because of what's known
as complementary events. We know that each coin only has
two possible options. If it's not facing silver side up,
it must be gold side up, and vice versa, and in any combination of 20 coins, the number of gold-facing
and silver-facing coins must add up to 20. We can prove this mathematically
using algebra. The number of silver-facing coins
remaining in the original pile will always be 20 minus
however many you moved to the new pile. And since your new pile also
has a total of 20 coins, its number of gold-facing coins will be 20 minus the amount of 
silver-facing coins you moved. When all the coins in the new pile
are flipped, these gold-facing coins become
silver-facing coins, so now the number of silver-facing
coins in both piles is the same. The gate swings open
and you hurry away with your treasure before the wizard changes his mind. At the next crossroads, you flip
one of your hard-earned coins to determine the way 
to your next adventure. But before you go, we have another 
quick coin riddle for you – one that comes from this video 
sponsor’s excellent website. Here we have 8 arrangements of coins. You can flip over adjacent pairs of coins 
as many times as you like. A flip always changes gold to silver, 
and silver to gold. Can you figure out how to tell, 
at a glance, which arrangements can be made all gold? You can try an interactive version of

Options: A. All the coins, B. However many coins are facing silver side up, C. However many coins are facing gold side up, D. It doesn’t matter
Correct Option: B (However, according to the transcript, the correct answer should be "However many coins are facing silver side up" which is 20 coins as mentioned in the transcript. The option is B but the description of option B is incorrect. The correct description of option B should be "20 coins" or "the same number of coins facing silver side up".)

**Transcript**:
This pencil-eraser-sized mass of cells 
is something called a brain organoid. It’s a collection of lab-grown neurons 
and other brain tissue that scientists can use to
learn about full-grown human brains. And it can be grown from 
a sample of your skin cells. Why would we need such a thing? Neuroscientists face a challenge: shielded by our thick skulls and
swaddled in layers of protective tissue, the human brain is
extremely difficult to observe in action. For centuries, scientists have tried to
understand them using autopsies, animal models, and, in recent years, imaging techniques. We’ve learned a lot through 
all these methods, but they have limitations. Conditions like Alzheimer’s 
and schizophrenia, and the effect on
the human brain of diseases like Zika, continue to hide beyond our view,
and our understanding. Enter brain organoids, 
which function like human brains but aren’t part of an organism. Each one comes from 
an undifferentiated stem cell, which is a cell that
can develop into any tissue in the body, from bone to brain. Scientists can make undifferentiated 
stem cells from skin cells. That means they can take a skin sample 
from a person with a particular condition and generate brain organoids
from that person. The hardest part of growing 
a brain organoid, which stumped scientists for years, was finding the perfect combination of
sugars, proteins, vitamins, and minerals that would induce the stem cell 
to develop a neural identity. That was only discovered recently, 
in 2013. The rest of the process 
is surprisingly easy. A neural stem cell essentially 
grows itself, similar to how a seed grows into a plant, all it needs are the brain’s equivalents 
of soil, water, and sunlight. A special gel to simulate 
embryonic tissue, a warm incubator set at body temperature, and a bit of motion to mimic blood flow. The stem cell grows into 
a very small version of an early-developing human brain, complete with neurons that can connect
to one another and make simplified neural networks. As mini brains grow, they follow 
all the steps of fetal brain development. By observing this process, 
we can learn how our neurons develop, as well as how we end up with 
so many more of them in our cortex, the part responsible for higher cognition
like logic and reasoning, than other species. Being able to grow brains in the lab,
even tiny ones, raises ethical questions, like: Can they think for themselves, 
or develop consciousness? And the answer is no, for several reasons. A brain organoid has the same tissue types
as a full-sized brain, but isn’t organized the same way. The organoid is similar to an airplane that’s been taken apart 
and reassembled at random; you could still study the wings, 
the engine, and other parts, but the plane could never fly. Similarly, a brain organoid allows us 
to study different types of brain tissue, but can’t think. And even if mini brains were organized 
like a real brain, they still wouldn’t be able 
to reason or develop consciousness. A big part of what makes our brains so
smart is their size, and mini brains have only 
about 100,000 neurons compared to the 86 billion 
in a full-sized brain. Scientists aren’t likely to grow larger 
brain organoids anytime soon. Without blood vessels to feed them, their size is limited 
to one centimeter at most. Finally, mini brains aren’t able 
to interact with the outside world. We learn by interacting 
with our environments: receiving inputs through our eyes, ears, and other 
sensory organs, and reacting in turn. The complex neural networks that underlie 
conscious thoughts and actions develop from this feedback loop. Without it, the organoids 
can never form a functional network. There’s nothing quite like 
the actual human brain, but mini brains are an unprecedented tool for studying everything 
from development to disease. With luck, these humble 
organoids can help us discover what makes the human brain unique, and maybe bring us closer 
to answering the age-old question: what makes us human?

to study different types of brain tissue, but can’t think. And even if mini brains were organized 
like a real brain, they still wouldn’t be able 
to reason or develop consciousness. A big part of what makes our brains so
smart is their size, and mini brains have only 
about 100,000 neurons compared to the 86 billion 
in a full-sized brain. Scientists aren’t likely to grow larger 
brain organoids anytime soon. Without blood vessels to feed them, their size is limited 
to one centimeter at most. Finally, mini brains aren’t able 
to interact with the outside world. We learn by interacting 
with our environments: receiving inputs through our eyes, ears, and other 
sensory organs, and reacting in turn. The complex neural networks that underlie 
conscious thoughts and actions develop from this feedback loop. Without it, the organoids 
can never form a functional network. There’s nothing quite like 
the actual human brain, but mini brains are an unprecedented tool for studying everything 
from development to disease. With luck, these humble 
organoids can help us discover what makes the human brain unique, and maybe bring us closer

**Transcript**:
This pencil-eraser-sized mass of cells 
is something called a brain organoid. It’s a collection of lab-grown neurons 
and other brain tissue that scientists can use to
learn about full-grown human brains. And it can be grown from 
a sample of your skin cells. Why would we need such a thing? Neuroscientists face a challenge: shielded by our thick skulls and
swaddled in layers of protective tissue, the human brain is
extremely difficult to observe in action. For centuries, scientists have tried to
understand them using autopsies, animal models, and, in recent years, imaging techniques. We’ve learned a lot through 
all these methods, but they have limitations. Conditions like Alzheimer’s 
and schizophrenia, and the effect on
the human brain of diseases like Zika, continue to hide beyond our view,
and our understanding. Enter brain organoids, 
which function like human brains but aren’t part of an organism. Each one comes from 
an undifferentiated stem cell, which is a cell that
can develop into any tissue in the body, from bone to brain. Scientists can make undifferentiated 
stem cells from skin cells. That means they can take a skin sample 
from a person with a particular condition and generate brain organoids
from that person. The hardest part of growing 
a brain organoid, which stumped scientists for years, was finding the perfect combination of
sugars, proteins, vitamins, and minerals that would induce the stem cell 
to develop a neural identity. That was only discovered recently, 
in 2013. The rest of the process 
is surprisingly easy. A neural stem cell essentially 
grows itself, similar to how a seed grows into a plant, all it needs are the brain’s equivalents 
of soil, water, and sunlight. A special gel to simulate 
embryonic tissue, a warm incubator set at body temperature, and a bit of motion to mimic blood flow. The stem cell grows into 
a very small version of an early-developing human brain, complete with neurons that can connect
to one another and make simplified neural networks. As mini brains grow, they follow 
all the steps of fetal brain development. By observing this process, 
we can learn how our neurons develop, as well as how we end up with 
so many more of them in our cortex, the part responsible for higher cognition
like logic and reasoning, than other species. Being able to grow brains in the lab,
even tiny ones, raises ethical questions, like: Can they think for themselves, 
or develop consciousness? And the answer is no, for several reasons. A brain organoid has the same tissue types
as a full-sized brain, but isn’t organized the same way. The organoid is similar to an airplane that’s been taken apart 
and reassembled at random; you could still study the wings, 
the engine, and other parts, but the plane could never fly. Similarly, a brain organoid allows us 
to study different types of brain tissue, but can’t think. And even if mini brains were organized 
like a real brain, they still wouldn’t be able 
to reason or develop consciousness. A big part of what makes our brains so

about 100,000 neurons compared to the 86 billion

**Transcript**:
Health is the most valuable thing we have in life, but we tend to forget that until we lose it. We're living longer than ever before, which is great, but an unforeseen consequence of this is that we also spend a larger and larger portion of our lives being sick. Getting old currently means spending more time in pain. So scientists are trying to shift the attention of the medical community from optimizing lifespans to optimizing healthspans, the part of our lives during which we're disease free. To do this, we need to attack the root cause of almost all bodily defects: aging itself. Unbeknown to most people, the science of aging has made enormous progress In the last few years, with human trials about to begin in the near future. Let's look at three examples of discoveries that might benefit people who are alive right now INTRO 1: senescent cells. Your cells have an expiration date. Each time one of your cells divides, it copies its chromosomes. Because of the way this works, they lose a tiny bit of DNA at the ends. This could be catastrophic, so to protect themselves we have long segments of DNA called telomeres that sort of act like the stiff bits at the end of shoelaces, but they shrink with every cell division. In some cells, after a number of divisions the telomeres are gone, and the cell becomes a zombie, a senescent cell. Senescent cells stay around and don't die. The older you get the more of them are inside you. They harmed tissue around them and are linked to many diseases that accompany old age like diabetes and kidney failure. But what if you could kill them off? Scientists genetically engineered mice so that they could destroy their senescent cells as they pleased. Older mice without senescent cells were more active. Their hearts and kidneys worked better, and they were less prone to cancer. Overall, they lived up to 30 percent longer and in better health than average mice. Since we can't genetically engineer all the cells in the human body, we need to find another way to get rid of our senescent cells. But how do we kill them without harming healthy cells? Most cells in the body commit a programmed cell suicide when they're damaged, but senescent cells don't. It turns out that they underproduce a protein that tells them when it's time to die. So in a late 2016 study, mice were given an injection of this protein. It killed 80 % of all their senescent cells, while causing almost no harm to healthy cells. The treated mice became generally healthier and even regrew lost hair. As a result, there are a number of new companies looking at treatments involving senescent cells and the first human trials will start soon. 2: NAD+ Cells are made of hundreds of millions of parts. They're the structures, machines, messages, and the catalysts that make reactions happen. All these parts constantly need to be destroyed, cleaned up, and rebuilt. As we age, this process becomes less effective and so parts become crumpled, bunched up, or are removed slower, or they are no longer produced in the quantities we need. One of these parts is NAD+, a coenzyme that tells ourselves to look after themselves. At age 50, we only have about half as much in our bodies as we do at age 20. Low amounts of it are linked to a whole bunch of diseases from skin cancer to Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. But NAD+ can't enter cells so we can't get it as a pill. But scientists notice that other more flexible substances could enter cells and would then turn into an NAD+ inside. In 2016, multiple trials on mice showed that they boosted the multiplication of skin, brain, and muscle stem cells. They were rejuvenated, had a higher ability to repair their DNA, and had a slightly increased lifespan, This even got NASA interested, which is looking for a way to minimize the DNA damage astronauts would be exposed to from cosmic radiation on Mars missions. There are human trials being planned right now, but it's too soon to say if this will boost our healthspan or even lifespan. But NAD+ is a serious candidate and could become the first human anti-aging pill. 3: stem cells Stem cells are like cell blueprints that sit at various places in the body and copy themselves to produce a steady flow of fresh young cells, but they decline as we age and so we decline too. Without new parts, human bodies break. In mice, scientists observed that as the stem cells in their brains disappeared, they started to develop diseases So they took stem cells from baby mice brains and injected them directly into the brains of middle-aged mice, more specifically the hypothalamus, a polyp that's involved in regulating a lot of bodily functions. The fresh stem cells reinvigorated older brain cells by secreting micro RNAs that regulated their metabolism. After 4 months, brain and muscles worked better than those of untreated mice and on average, they lived ten percent longer. Another study took stem cells from mice embryos and injected them directly into the hearts of older mice. As a consequence, they had improved heart function, could exercise 20% longer, and weirdly enough their hair regrew faster. Conclusion What all of this tells us is that there is not a single magic bullet with which to cure aging. It requires a complex array of different therapies. We can kill off senescent cells to clear away the junk, give ourselves fresh new stem cells to fill the gap, all while regulating the metabolism of the other cells using medication. This video comes with a big caveat. After all, these studies have been carried out on mice. There's no guarantee the same therapies would work in us to the same extent, but they are proof of concepts. To learn more about how we can modify our own healthspan, we need human trials. We've only covered a tiny part of the research that's being done right now, and only scratched the surface of these ideas. The field of healthspan extension needs more attention and funding. If it gets it, all of us might enjoy growing old without pain If you now want to support the research on aging directly, you can do so at lifespan.io, a community of people actively supporting the scientists working to cure aging. Check them out to learn about the latest advances and visit their blog or group on Facebook. The lifespan team also kindly supported the creation of this video with a donation and their expertise.

**Transcript**:
If you were to lay your digestive tract
out in a straight line, it would form a tube 
spanning nearly ten meters. The last 1.5 meters of that
are called the colon, or large intestine. Cells in this organ's lining 
constantly renew themselves, but the genes that moderate this process
occasionally go awry, leading to the excessive growth 
of new cells. That results in small growths
or abnormal clumps of cells called polyps. The majority of these polyps 
won't do any harm, but some can become cancerous
when their cells begin to grow and divide rapidly, projecting further into the colon. At that point, they can transform
into colon cancer, one of the most prevalent and
preventable forms of cancer in the world. That's a slow process: though growth times vary, it often takes around ten years
for a small polyp to grow and develop into a cancerous one. We don't know exactly what causes the majority of colon polyps 
and colon cancers. We do know in general that colon cancer
involves the activation of what's called oncogenes in the polyp, and/or the loss of tumor-suppressor genes
that usually keep cancer cells in check. Most cells have proto-oncogenes
that help them grow. When a proto-oncogene mutates,
or there are two many copies of it, it can become a permanently 
active oncogene with cells that grow out of control. While we don't yet know exactly what
underlying factors cause these changes, experts suspect a combination
of both environmental and inherited genetic factors. In the worst cases, when cells within
polyps divide and spread unchecked, they eventually break through
the lining of the colon. Lymph and blood vessels carry
those cells all over the body, and they can go on to form tumors. Despite these challenges,
there's a solution. We've become extremely good at
detecting and removing offending polyps before they can cause cancer. This happens through a process
called screening, and when we do it regularly,
we can prevent many cases of colon cancer. So, who's at risk? Most cases occur in people 
aged 50 years or older. This group is considered at average risk
for colon cancer or colon polyps. There's also a higher risk group
that includes people with personal or family histories 
of colon polyps or cancer, and those who suffer 
from inherited genetic syndromes, or inflammatory diseases, like Crohn’s disease 
and ulcerative colitis. So the best age to initiate screening
varies from person to person. If you have access to healthcare, it's best to consult a doctor
to find out when you should begin. Screening can be done with various tests. Colonoscopy involves 
a long, thin, flexible tube that's fitted with a video camera
and light at the end and placed internally to examine
the colon for polyps. If polyps are found, a doctor
can do a polypectomy, a procedure that removes polyps
from the colonic wall. Doctors can also then test
the polyp for cancerous cells. Colonoscopy is the only test that can
be used to both find and remove polyps. There are, however, 
other useful screening tests, including imaging and at-home tests that can allow patients to examine their stool 
for small amounts of blood. Occasionally, polyps are too large
to be removed during a colonoscopy, in which case, the next step is surgery. If blood and imaging tests then reveal that cancerous cells 
have spread outside the colon, then a special treatment,
like chemotherapy, may also be required to stop
the cancer from escalating. We can also take on certain habits to reduce our likelihood of developing
colon cancer in the first place. There's evidence that maintaining
a healthy weight, not smoking, and being physically active can help. But most importantly, 
access to healthcare and regular screenings 
at crucial times in life are the best ways to prevent colon cancer.

the polyp for cancerous cells. Colonoscopy is the only test that can
be used to both find and remove polyps. There are, however, 
other useful screening tests, including imaging and at-home tests that can allow patients to examine their stool 
for small amounts of blood. Occasionally, polyps are too large
to be removed during a colonoscopy, in which case, the next step is surgery. If blood and imaging tests then reveal that cancerous cells 
have spread outside the colon, then a special treatment,
like chemotherapy, may also be required to stop
the cancer from escalating. We can also take on certain habits to reduce our likelihood of developing
colon cancer in the first place. There's evidence that maintaining
a healthy weight, not smoking, and being physically active can help. But most importantly, 
access to healthcare and regular screenings 
at crucial times in life are the best ways to prevent colon cancer.

**Transcript**:
If you were to lay your digestive tract
out in a straight line, it would form a tube 
spanning nearly ten meters. The last 1.5 meters of that
are called the colon, or large intestine. Cells in this organ's lining 
constantly renew themselves, but the genes that moderate this process
occasionally go awry, leading to the excessive growth 
of new cells. That results in small growths
or abnormal clumps of cells called polyps. The majority of these polyps 
won't do any harm, but some can become cancerous
when their cells begin to grow and divide rapidly, projecting further into the colon. At that point, they can transform
into colon cancer, one of the most prevalent and
preventable forms of cancer in the world. That's a slow process: though growth times vary, it often takes around ten years
for a small polyp to grow and develop into a cancerous one. We don't know exactly what causes the majority of colon polyps 
and colon cancers. We do know in general that colon cancer
involves the activation of what's called oncogenes in the polyp, and/or the loss of tumor-suppressor genes
that usually keep cancer cells in check. Most cells have proto-oncogenes
that help them grow. When a proto-oncogene mutates,
or there are two many copies of it, it can become a permanently 
active oncogene with cells that grow out of control. While we don't yet know exactly what
underlying factors cause these changes, experts suspect a combination
of both environmental and inherited genetic factors. In the worst cases, when cells within
polyps divide and spread unchecked, they eventually break through
the lining of the colon. Lymph and blood vessels carry
those cells all over the body, and they can go on to form tumors. Despite these challenges,
there's a solution. We've become extremely good at
detecting and removing offending polyps before they can cause cancer. This happens through a process
called screening, and when we do it regularly,
we can prevent many cases of colon cancer. So, who's at risk? Most cases occur in people 
aged 50 years or older. This group is considered at average risk
for colon cancer or colon polyps. There's also a higher risk group
that includes people with personal or family histories 
of colon polyps or cancer, and those who suffer 
from inherited genetic syndromes, or inflammatory diseases, like Crohn’s disease 
and ulcerative colitis. So the best age to initiate screening
varies from person to person. If you have access to healthcare, it's best to consult a doctor
to find out when you should begin. Screening can be done with various tests. Colonoscopy involves 
a long, thin, flexible tube that's fitted with a video camera
and light at the end and placed internally to examine
the colon for polyps. If polyps are found, a doctor
can do a polypectomy, a procedure that removes polyps
from the colonic wall. Doctors can also then test
the polyp for cancerous cells. Colonoscopy is the only test that can
be used to both find and remove polyps. There are, however, 
other useful screening tests, including imaging and at-home tests that can allow patients to examine their stool

**Transcript**:
In the summer of 1997, NASA's Pathfinder spacecraft landed 
on the surface of Mars, and began transmitting incredible,
iconic images back to Earth. But several days in, 
something went terribly wrong. The transmissions stopped. Pathfinder was, in effect, 
procrastinating: keeping itself fully occupied 
but failing to do its most important work. What was going on? There was a bug, it turned out, 
in its scheduler. Every operating system has something 
called the scheduler that tells the CPU how long
to work on each task before switching, and what to switch to. Done right, computers move so fluidly 
between their various responsibilities, they give the illusion 
of doing everything simultaneously. But we all know what happens
when things go wrong. This should give us, if nothing else, 
some measure of consolation. Even computers get overwhelmed sometimes. Maybe learning about the computer science 
of scheduling can give us some ideas about our own
human struggles with time. One of the first insights is that all 
the time you spend prioritizing your work is time you aren't spending doing it. For instance, let's say when you check 
your inbox, you scan all the messages, choosing which is the most important. Once you've dealt with that one, 
you repeat. Seems sensible, 
but there's a problem here. This is what's known 
as a quadratic-time algorithm. With an inbox that's twice as
full, these passes will take twice as long and you'll need to do 
twice as many of them! This means four times the work. The programmers 
of the operating system Linux encountered a similar problem in 2003. Linux would rank every single 
one of its tasks in order of importance, and sometimes spent more time 
ranking tasks than doing them. The programmers’ counterintuitive solution
was to replace this full ranking with a limited number 
of priority “buckets.” The system was less precise 
about what to do next but more than made up for it 
by spending more time making progress. So with your emails, insisting on always 
doing the very most important thing first could lead to a meltdown. Waking up to an inbox three times fuller 
than normal could take nine times longer to clear. You’d be better off replying 
in chronological order, or even at random! Surprisingly, sometimes giving up 
on doing things in the perfect order may be the key to getting them done. Another insight that emerges 
from computer scheduling has to do with one of the most prevalent 
features of modern life: interruptions. When a computer goes 
from one task to another, it has to do what's called 
a context switch, bookmarking its place in one task, moving old data out of its memory 
and new data in. Each of these actions comes at a cost. The insight here is that there’s 
a fundamental tradeoff between productivity and responsiveness. Getting serious work done 
means minimizing context switches. But being responsive means reacting 
anytime something comes up. These two principles 
are fundamentally in tension. Recognizing this tension allows us to decide where 
we want to strike that balance. The obvious solution 
is to minimize interruptions. The less obvious one is to group them. If no notification 
or email requires a response more urgently than once an hour, say, then that’s exactly how often 
you should check them. No more. In computer science, this idea goes by 
the name of interrupt coalescing. Rather than dealing with 
things as they come up – Oh, the mouse was moved? A key was pressed? More of that file downloaded? – the system groups these 
interruptions together based on how long they can afford to wait. In 2013, interrupt coalescing triggered a massive improvement 
in laptop battery life. This is because deferring interruptions 
lets a system check everything at once, then quickly re-enter a low-power state. As with computers, so it is with us. Perhaps adopting a similar approach might allow us users 
to reclaim our own attention, and give us back one of the things
that feels so rare in modern life: rest.

**Transcript**:
In the summer of 1997, NASA's Pathfinder spacecraft landed 
on the surface of Mars, and began transmitting incredible,
iconic images back to Earth. But several days in, 
something went terribly wrong. The transmissions stopped. Pathfinder was, in effect, 
procrastinating: keeping itself fully occupied 
but failing to do its most important work. What was going on? There was a bug, it turned out, 
in its scheduler. Every operating system has something 
called the scheduler that tells the CPU how long
to work on each task before switching, and what to switch to. Done right, computers move so fluidly 
between their various responsibilities, they give the illusion 
of doing everything simultaneously. But we all know what happens
when things go wrong. This should give us, if nothing else, 
some measure of consolation. Even computers get overwhelmed sometimes. Maybe learning about the computer science 
of scheduling can give us some ideas about our own
human struggles with time. One of the first insights is that all 
the time you spend prioritizing your work is time you aren't spending doing it. For instance, let's say when you check 
your inbox, you scan all the messages, choosing which is the most important. Once you've dealt with that one, 
you repeat. Seems sensible, 
but there's a problem here. This is what's known 
as a quadratic-time algorithm. With an inbox that's twice as
full, these passes will take twice as long and you'll need to do 
twice as many of them! This means four times the work. The programmers 
of the operating system Linux encountered a similar problem in 2003. Linux would rank every single 
one of its tasks in order of importance, and sometimes spent more time 
ranking tasks than doing them. The programmers’ counterintuitive solution
was to replace this full ranking with a limited number 
of priority “buckets.” The system was less precise 
about what to do next but more than made up for it 
by spending more time making progress. So with your emails, insisting on always 
doing the very most important thing first could lead to a meltdown. Waking up to an inbox three times fuller 
than normal could take nine times longer to clear. You’d be better off replying 
in chronological order, or even at random! Surprisingly, sometimes giving up 
on doing things in the perfect order may be the key to getting them done. Another insight that emerges 
from computer scheduling has to do with one of the most prevalent 
features of modern life: interruptions. When a computer goes 
from one task to another, it has to do what's called 
a context switch, bookmarking its place in one task, moving old data out of its memory 
and new data in. Each of these actions comes at a cost. The insight here is that there’s 
a fundamental tradeoff between productivity and responsiveness. Getting serious work done 
means minimizing context switches. But being responsive means reacting 
anytime something comes up. These two principles 
are fundamentally in tension. Recognizing this tension allows us to decide where 
we want to strike that balance. The obvious solution 
is to minimize interruptions. The less obvious one is to group them. If no notification 
or email requires a response more urgently than once an hour, say, then that’s exactly how often 
you should check them. No more. In computer science, this idea goes by 
the name of interrupt coalescing. Rather than dealing with 
things as they come up – Oh, the mouse was moved? A key was pressed? More of that file downloaded? – the system groups these 
interruptions together based on how long they can afford to wait. In 2013, interrupt coalescing triggered a massive improvement 
in laptop battery life. This is because deferring interruptions 
lets a system check everything at once, then quickly re-enter a low-power state. As with computers, so it is with us. Perhaps adopting a similar approach might allow us users 
to reclaim our own attention, and give us back one of the things
that feels so rare in modern life: rest.

**Transcript**:
When desert locusts are well fed,
they're solitary creatures. But when food becomes scarce, hungry, desperate locusts
crowd onto small patches of land where they can still find 
something to eat. Contact between different locusts'
hind legs set off a slew of reactions that change their appearance and behavior. Now, instead of shunning their peers,
they seek each other out. The locusts eventually start marching
and then fly away in large numbers seeking a better habitat. These gigantic swarms can host
millions of insects and travel thousands of miles, devastating vegetation and crops. They stay close to each other,
but not too close, or they might get eaten
by their hungry neighbors. When many individual organisms, like locusts, bacteria, anchovies, or bats, come together and move 
as one coordinated entity, that's a swarm. From a handful of birds 
to billions of insects, swarms can be almost any size. But what they have in common
is that there's no leader. Members of the swarm interact
only with their nearest neighbors or through indirect cues. Each individual follows simple rules: Travel in the same direction 
as those around you, stay close, and avoid collisions. There are many benefits to traveling
in a group like this. Small prey may fool predators
by assembling into a swarm that looks like a much bigger organism. And congregating in a large group reduces the chance that any single 
individual will be captured. Moving in the same direction
as your neighbors saves energy by sharing the effort
of fighting wind or water resistance. It may even be easier 
to find a mate in a swarm. Swarming can also allow groups of animals to accomplish tasks 
they couldn’t do individually. When hundreds or millions or organisms
follow the same simple rules, sophisticated behavior called
swarm intelligence may arise. A single ant can't do much on its own, but an ant colony 
can solve complex problems, like building a nest and finding the shortest path
to a food source. But sometimes, things can go wrong. In a crowd, diseases spread more easily, and some swarming organisms may start
eating each other if food is scarce. Even some of the benefits of swarms,
like more efficient navigation, can have catastrophic consequences. Army ants are one example. They lay down chemicals called pheromones which signal their neighbors 
to follow the trail. This is good if the head of the group
is marching towards a food source. But occasionally the ants in the front
can veer off course. The whole swarm can get caught
in a loop following the pheromone trail until they die of exhaustion. Humans are notoriously individualistic,
though social, animals. But is there anything we can learn
from collective swarm-based organization? When it comes to technology,
the answer is definitely yes. Bats can teach drones how to navigate
confined spaces without colliding, fish can help design software
for safer driving, and insects are inspiring robot teams that
can assist search and rescue missions. For swarms of humans, 
it's perhaps more complicated and depends on the motives and leadership. Swarm behavior in human populations can
sometimes manifest as a destructive mob. But collective action can also produce
a crowd-sourced scientific breakthrough and artistic expression, or a peaceful global revolution.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
When desert locusts are well fed,
they're solitary creatures. But when food becomes scarce, hungry, desperate locusts
crowd onto small patches of land where they can still find 
something to eat. Contact between different locusts'
hind legs set off a slew of reactions that change their appearance and behavior. Now, instead of shunning their peers,
they seek each other out. The locusts eventually start marching
and then fly away in large numbers seeking a better habitat. These gigantic swarms can host
millions of insects and travel thousands of miles, devastating vegetation and crops. They stay close to each other,
but not too close, or they might get eaten
by their hungry neighbors. When many individual organisms, like locusts, bacteria, anchovies, or bats, come together and move 
as one coordinated entity, that's a swarm. From a handful of birds 
to billions of insects, swarms can be almost any size. But what they have in common
is that there's no leader. Members of the swarm interact
only with their nearest neighbors or through indirect cues. Each individual follows simple rules: Travel in the same direction 
as those around you, stay close, and avoid collisions. There are many benefits to traveling
in a group like this. Small prey may fool predators
by assembling into a swarm that looks like a much bigger organism. And congregating in a large group reduces the chance that any single 
individual will be captured. Moving in the same direction
as your neighbors saves energy by sharing the effort
of fighting wind or water resistance. It may even be easier 
to find a mate in a swarm. Swarming can also allow groups of animals to accomplish tasks 
they couldn’t do individually. When hundreds or millions or organisms
follow the same simple rules, sophisticated behavior called
swarm intelligence may arise. A single ant can't do much on its own, but an ant colony 
can solve complex problems, like building a nest and finding the shortest path
to a food source. But sometimes, things can go wrong. In a crowd, diseases spread more easily, and some swarming organisms may start
eating each other if food is scarce. Even some of the benefits of swarms,
like more efficient navigation, can have catastrophic consequences. Army ants are one example. They lay down chemicals called pheromones which signal their neighbors 
to follow the trail. This is good if the head of the group
is marching towards a food source. But occasionally the ants in the front
can veer off course. The whole swarm can get caught
in a loop following the pheromone trail until they die of exhaustion. Humans are notoriously individualistic,
though social, animals. But is there anything we can learn
from collective swarm-based organization? When it comes to technology,
the answer is definitely yes. Bats can teach drones how to navigate
confined spaces without colliding, fish can help design software
for safer driving, and insects are inspiring robot teams that
can assist search and rescue missions. For swarms of humans, 
it's perhaps more complicated and depends on the motives and leadership. Swarm behavior in human populations can
sometimes manifest as a destructive mob. But collective action can also produce
a crowd-sourced scientific breakthrough and artistic expression, or a peaceful global revolution.

**Transcript**:
Giant gold-digging ants, a furious king who orders
the sea to be whipped 300 times, and a dolphin that saves
a famous poet from drowning. These are just some of the stories
from The Histories by Herodotus, an Ancient Greek writer from
the 5th century BCE. Not all the events in the text 
may have happened exactly as Herodotus reported them, but this work revolutionized
the way the past was recorded. Before Herodotus, the past was documented
as a list of events with little or no attempt to explain
their causes beyond accepting things
as the will of the gods. Herodotus wanted a deeper,
more rational understanding, so he took a new approach: looking at events from both sides
to understand the reasons for them. Though he was Greek, Herodotus's
hometown of Halicarnassus was part of the Persian Empire. He grew up during a series of wars
between the powerful Persians and the smaller Greeks, and decided to find out all he could
about the subject. In Herodotus's telling, the Persian Wars
began in 499 BCE, when the Athenians assisted a rebellion
by Greeks living under Persian rule. In 490, the Persian King, Darius,
sent his army to take revenge on Athens. But at the Battle of Marathon,
the Athenians won an unexpected victory. Ten years later, the Persians returned,
planning to conquer the whole of Greece under the leadership 
of Darius's son, Xerxes. According to Herodotus,
when Xerxes arrived, his million man army was initially
opposed by a Greek force led by 300 Spartans at the mountain pass
of Thermopylae. At great cost to the Persians, the Spartans and their king, Leonidas,
were killed. This heroic defeat has been an inspiration
to underdogs ever since. A few weeks later, the Greek navy
tricked the Persian fleet into fighting in a narrow sea channel
near Athens. The Persians were defeated and Xerxes
fled, never to return. To explain how these wars broke out
and why the Greeks triumphed, Herodotus collected stories
from all around the Mediterranean. He recorded the achievements of both
Greeks and non-Greeks before they were lost
to the passage of time. The Histories opens 
with the famous sentence: "Herodotus, of Halicarnassus, 
here displays his inquiries." By framing the book as an “inquiry,” Herodotus allowed it to contain 
many different stories, some serious, others less so. He recorded the internal debates
of the Persian court but also tales of Egyptian flying snakes and practical advice 
on how to catch a crocodile. The Greek word for this method
of research is "autopsy," meaning "seeing for oneself." Herodotus was the first writer
to examine the past by combining the different kinds
of evidence he collected: opsis, or eyewitness accounts, akoe, or hearsay, and ta legomena, or tradition. He then used gnome, or reason, to reach conclusions 
about what actually happened. Many of the book's early readers
were actually listeners. The Histories was originally written
in 28 sections, each of which took about 
four hours to read aloud. As the Greeks increased in influence
and power, Herodotus's writing and the idea of history
spread across the Mediterranean. As the first proper historian,
Herodotus wasn't perfect. On occasions, he favored

**Transcript**:
Giant gold-digging ants, a furious king who orders
the sea to be whipped 300 times, and a dolphin that saves
a famous poet from drowning. These are just some of the stories
from The Histories by Herodotus, an Ancient Greek writer from
the 5th century BCE. Not all the events in the text 
may have happened exactly as Herodotus reported them, but this work revolutionized
the way the past was recorded. Before Herodotus, the past was documented
as a list of events with little or no attempt to explain
their causes beyond accepting things
as the will of the gods. Herodotus wanted a deeper,
more rational understanding, so he took a new approach: looking at events from both sides
to understand the reasons for them. Though he was Greek, Herodotus's
hometown of Halicarnassus was part of the Persian Empire. He grew up during a series of wars
between the powerful Persians and the smaller Greeks, and decided to find out all he could
about the subject. In Herodotus's telling, the Persian Wars
began in 499 BCE, when the Athenians assisted a rebellion
by Greeks living under Persian rule. In 490, the Persian King, Darius,
sent his army to take revenge on Athens. But at the Battle of Marathon,
the Athenians won an unexpected victory. Ten years later, the Persians returned,
planning to conquer the whole of Greece under the leadership 
of Darius's son, Xerxes. According to Herodotus,
when Xerxes arrived, his million man army was initially
opposed by a Greek force led by 300 Spartans at the mountain pass
of Thermopylae. At great cost to the Persians, the Spartans and their king, Leonidas,
were killed. This heroic defeat has been an inspiration
to underdogs ever since. A few weeks later, the Greek navy
tricked the Persian fleet into fighting in a narrow sea channel
near Athens. The Persians were defeated and Xerxes
fled, never to return. To explain how these wars broke out
and why the Greeks triumphed, Herodotus collected stories
from all around the Mediterranean. He recorded the achievements of both
Greeks and non-Greeks before they were lost
to the passage of time. The Histories opens 
with the famous sentence: "Herodotus, of Halicarnassus, 
here displays his inquiries." By framing the book as an “inquiry,” Herodotus allowed it to contain 
many different stories, some serious, others less so. He recorded the internal debates
of the Persian court but also tales of Egyptian flying snakes and practical advice 
on how to catch a crocodile. The Greek word for this method
of research is "autopsy," meaning "seeing for oneself." Herodotus was the first writer
to examine the past by combining the different kinds
of evidence he collected: opsis, or eyewitness accounts, akoe, or hearsay, and ta legomena, or tradition. He then used gnome, or reason, to reach conclusions 
about what actually happened. Many of the book's early readers
were actually listeners. The Histories was originally written
in 28 sections, each of which took about 
four hours to read aloud. As the Greeks increased in influence
and power, Herodotus's writing and the idea of history
spread across the Mediterranean. As the first proper historian,
Herodotus wasn't perfect. On occasions, he favored
the Greeks over the Persians and was too quick to believe
some of the stories that he heard, which made for inaccuracies. However, modern evidence 
has actually explained some of his apparently extreme claims. For instance, there's a species 
of marmot in the Himalayas that spreads gold dust while digging. The ancient Persian word for marmot

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 18, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 3
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Every year, the world uses 
35 billion barrels of oil. This massive scale of fossil fuel 
dependence pollutes the Earth and it won't last forever. Scientists estimate that we've consumed
about 40% of the world's oil. According to present estimates, at this rate, we'll run out of oil
and gas in 50 years or so, and in about a century for coal. On the flip side, we have abundant
sun, water, and wind. These are renewable energy sources, meaning that we won't use them up
over time. What if we could exchange 
our fossil fuel dependence for an existence based 
solely on renewables? We've pondered that question for decades, and yet, renewable energy still
only provides about 13% of our needs. That's because reaching 100% requires
renewable energy that's inexpensive and accessible. This represents a huge challenge, even if we ignore the politics involved
and focus on the science and engineering. We can better understand the problem
by understanding how we use energy. Global energy use is a diverse 
and complex system, and the different elements 
require their own solutions. But for now, we'll focus on two
of the most familiar in everyday life: electricity and liquid fuels. Electricity powers blast furnaces, 
elevators, computers, and all manner of things in homes,
businesses, and manufacturing. Meanwhile, liquid fuels 
play a crucial role in almost all forms of transportation. Let's consider the electrical 
portion first. The great news is that our technology
is already advanced enough to capture all that energy 
from renewables, and there's an ample supply. The sun continuously radiates about 173 quadrillion watts 
of solar energy at the Earth, which is almost 10,000 times
our present needs. It's been estimated that a surface that
spans several hundred thousand kilometers would be needed to power humanity
at our present usage levels. So why don't we build that? Because there are other 
hurdles in the way, like efficiency and energy transportation. To maximize efficiency, solar plants must be located in areas 
with lots of sunshine year round, like deserts. But those are far away 
from densely populated regions where energy demand is high. There are other forms of renewable energy
we could draw from, such as hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomasses, but they also have limits based on
availability and location. In principle, a connected electrical
energy network with power lines crisscrossing the globe would enable us to transport power
from where it's generated to where it's needed. But building a system on this scale
faces an astronomical price tag. We could lower the cost by developing
advanced technologies to capture energy more efficiently. The infrastructure for transporting energy
would also have to change drastically. Present-day power lines lose about 6-8%
of the energy they carry because wire material dissipates energy
through resistance. Longer power lines would mean
more energy loss. Superconductors could be one solution. Such materials can transport electricity
without dissipation. Unfortunately, they only work
if cooled to low temperatures, which requires energy 
and defeats the purpose. To benefit from that technology, we'd need to discover 
new superconducting materials that operate at room temperature. And what about the all-important,
oil-derived liquid fuels? The scientific challenge there is to store
renewable energy in an easily transportable form. Recently, we've gotten better
at producing lithium ion batteries, which are lightweight 
and have high-energy density. But even the best of these
store about 2.5 megajoules per kilogram. That's about 20 times less than the energy
in one kilogram of gasoline. To be truly competitive, car batteries
would have to store much more energy without adding cost. The challenges only increase 
for bigger vessels, like ships and planes. To power a cross-Atlantic 
flight for a jet, we'd need a battery weighing
about 1,000 tons. This, too, demands a technological leap
towards new materials, higher energy density, and better storage. One promising solution would be
to find efficient ways to convert solar into chemical energy. This is already happening in labs, but the efficiency is still too low
to allow it to reach the market. To find novel solutions, we'll need
lots of creativity, innovation, and powerful incentives. The transition towards all-renewable 
energies is a complex problem involving technology, 
economics, and politics. Priorities on how to tackle this challenge
depend on the specific assumptions we have to make when trying to solve
such a multifaceted problem. But there's ample reason to be optimistic
that we'll get there. Top scientific minds around the world
are working on these problems and making breakthroughs all the time. And many governments and businesses
are investing in technologies that harness the energy all around us.

**Transcript**:
Every year, the world uses 
35 billion barrels of oil. This massive scale of fossil fuel 
dependence pollutes the Earth and it won't last forever. Scientists estimate that we've consumed
about 40% of the world's oil. According to present estimates, at this rate, we'll run out of oil
and gas in 50 years or so, and in about a century for coal. On the flip side, we have abundant
sun, water, and wind. These are renewable energy sources, meaning that we won't use them up
over time. What if we could exchange 
our fossil fuel dependence for an existence based 
solely on renewables? We've pondered that question for decades, and yet, renewable energy still
only provides about 13% of our needs. That's because reaching 100% requires
renewable energy that's inexpensive and accessible. This represents a huge challenge, even if we ignore the politics involved
and focus on the science and engineering. We can better understand the problem
by understanding how we use energy. Global energy use is a diverse 
and complex system, and the different elements 
require their own solutions. But for now, we'll focus on two
of the most familiar in everyday life: electricity and liquid fuels. Electricity powers blast furnaces, 
elevators, computers, and all manner of things in homes,
businesses, and manufacturing. Meanwhile, liquid fuels 
play a crucial role in almost all forms of transportation. Let's consider the electrical 
portion first. The great news is that our technology
is already advanced enough to capture all that energy 
from renewables, and there's an ample supply. The sun continuously radiates about 173 quadrillion watts 
of solar energy at the Earth, which is almost 10,000 times
our present needs. It's been estimated that a surface that
spans several hundred thousand kilometers would be needed to power humanity
at our present usage levels. So why don't we build that? Because there are other 
hurdles in the way, like efficiency and energy transportation. To maximize efficiency, solar plants must be located in areas 
with lots of sunshine year round, like deserts. But those are far away 
from densely populated regions where energy demand is high. There are other forms of renewable energy
we could draw from, such as hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomasses, but they also have limits based on
availability and location. In principle, a connected electrical
energy network with power lines crisscrossing the globe would enable us to transport power
from where it's generated to where it's needed. But building a system on this scale
faces an astronomical price tag. We could lower the cost by developing
advanced technologies to capture energy more efficiently. The infrastructure for transporting energy
would also have to change drastically. Present-day power lines lose about 6-8%
of the energy they carry because wire material dissipates energy
through resistance. Longer power lines would mean
more energy loss. Superconductors could be one solution. Such materials can transport electricity
without dissipation. Unfortunately, they only work
if cooled to low temperatures, which requires energy 
and defeats the purpose. To benefit from that technology, we'd need to discover 
new superconducting materials that operate at room temperature. And what about the all-important,
oil-derived liquid fuels? The scientific challenge there is to store
renewable energy in an easily transportable form. Recently, we've gotten better
at producing lithium ion batteries, which are lightweight 
and have high-energy density. But even the best of these
store about 2.5 megajoules per kilogram. That's about 20 times less than the energy
in one kilogram of gasoline. To be truly competitive, car batteries
would have to store much more energy without adding cost. The challenges only increase 
for bigger vessels, like ships and planes. To power a cross-Atlantic 
flight for a jet, we'd need a battery weighing
about 1,000 tons. This, too, demands a technological leap
towards new materials, higher energy density, and better storage. One promising solution would be
to find efficient ways to convert solar into chemical energy. This is already happening in labs, but the efficiency is still too low
to allow it to reach the market. To find novel solutions, we'll need
lots of creativity, innovation, and powerful incentives. The transition towards all-renewable 
energies is a complex problem involving technology, 
economics, and politics. Priorities on how to tackle this challenge
depend on the specific assumptions we have to make when trying to solve
such a multifaceted problem. But there's ample reason to be optimistic
that we'll get there. Top scientific minds around the world
are working on these problems and making breakthroughs all the time. And many governments and businesses
are investing in technologies that harness the energy all around us.

**Transcript**:
Imagine aliens land on the planet
a million years from now and look into the geologic record. What will these curious searchers
find of us? They will find what geologists, 
scientists, and other experts are increasingly calling
the Anthropocene, or new age of mankind. The impacts that we humans make
have become so pervasive, profound, and permanent that some geologists argue
we merit our own epoch. That would be a new unit
in the geologic time scale that stretches back 
more than 4.5 billion years, or ever since the Earth took shape. Modern humans may be on par
with the glaciers behind various ice ages or the asteroid that doomed
most of the dinosaurs. What is an epoch? Most simply, it's a unit of geologic time. There's the Pleistocene, an icy epoch that saw the evolution
of modern humans. Or there's the Eocene, 
more than 34 million years ago, a hothouse time during which the continents drifted 
into their present configuration. Changes in climate or fossils
found in the rock record help distinguish these epochs
and help geologists tell deep time. So what will be the record 
of modern people's impact on the planet? It doesn't rely on the things
that may seem most obvious to us today, like sprawling cities. Even New York or Shanghai 
may prove hard to find buried in the rocks 
a million years from now. But humans have put new things
into the world that never existed on Earth before, like plutonium and plastics. In fact, the geologists 
known as stratigraphers who determine the geologic timescale, have proposed a start date
for the Anthropocene around 1950. That’s when people started blowing
up nuclear bombs all around the world and scattering novel elements 
to the winds. Those elements will last 
in the rock record, even in our bones and teeth
for millions of years. And in just 50 years, 
we've made enough plastic, at least 8 billion metric tons, to cover the whole world in a thin film. People's farming, fishing, and forestry
will also show up as a before and after in any such strata because it's those kinds of activities that are causing unique species 
of plants and animals to die out. This die-off started perhaps
more than 40,000 years ago as humanity spread out of Africa and reached places like Australia, kicking off the disappearance
of big, likable, and edible animals. This is true of Europe and Asia,
think woolly mammoth, as well as North and South America, too. For a species that has only roamed the planet for 
a few hundred thousand years, Homo sapiens has had a big impact
on the future fossil record. That also means that even if people
were to disappear tomorrow, evolution would be driven 
by our choices to date. We're making a new homogenous world
of certain favored plants and animals, like corn and rats. But it's a world that's not as resilient
as the one it replaces. As the fossil record shows, it's a diversity of plants and animals that allows unique pairings 
of flora and fauna to respond to environmental challenges,
and even thrive after an apocalypse. That goes for people, too. If the microscopic plants 
of the ocean suffer as a result of too much 
carbon dioxide, say, we'll lose the source of as much as half
of the oxygen we need to breathe. Then there's the smudge in future rocks. People's penchant for burning coal,
oil, and natural gas has spread tiny bits of soot
all over the planet. That smudge corresponds 
with a meteoric rise in the amount 
of carbon dioxide in the air, now beyond 400 parts per million, or higher than any other Homo sapiens
has ever breathed. Similar soot can still 
be found in ancient rocks from volcanic fires 
of 66 million years ago, a record of the cataclysm touched
off by an asteroid at the end of the late Cretaceous epoch. So odds are our soot will still be here
66 million years from now, easy enough to find for any aliens
who care to look. Of course, there's an important
difference between us and an asteroid. A space rock has no choice
but to follow gravity. We can choose to do differently. And if we do, there might still be
some kind of human civilization thousands or even millions
of years from now. Not a bad record to hope for.

a million years from now. But humans have put new things
into the world that never existed on Earth before, like plutonium and plastics. In fact, the geologists 
known as stratigraphers who determine the geologic timescale, have proposed a start date
for the Anthropocene around 1950. That’s when people started blowing
up nuclear bombs all around the world and scattering novel elements 
to the winds. Those elements will last 
in the rock record, even in our bones and teeth
for millions of years. And in just 50 years, 
we've made enough plastic, at least 8 billion metric tons, to cover the whole world in a thin film. People's farming, fishing, and forestry
will also show up as a before and after in any such strata because it's those kinds of activities that are causing unique species 
of plants and animals to die out. This die-off started perhaps
more than 40,000 years ago as humanity spread out of Africa and reached places like Australia, kicking off the disappearance
of big, likable, and edible animals. This is true of Europe and Asia,
think woolly mammoth, as well as North and South America, too. For a species that has only roamed the planet for 
a few hundred thousand years, Homo sapiens has had a big impact
on the future fossil record. That also means that even if people
were to disappear tomorrow, evolution would be driven 
by our choices to date. We're making a new homogenous world
of certain favored plants and animals, like corn and rats. But it's a world that's not as resilient
as the one it replaces. As the fossil record shows, it's a diversity of plants and animals that allows unique pairings 
of flora and fauna to respond to environmental challenges,
and even thrive after an apocalypse. That goes for people, too. If the microscopic plants 
of the ocean suffer as a result of too much 
carbon dioxide, say, we'll lose the source of as much as half
of the oxygen we need to breathe. Then there's the smudge in future rocks. People's penchant for burning coal,
oil, and natural gas has spread tiny bits of soot
all over the planet. That smudge corresponds 
with a meteoric rise in the amount 
of carbon dioxide in the air, now beyond 400 parts per million, or higher than any other Homo sapiens
has ever breathed. Similar soot can still 
be found in ancient rocks from volcanic fires 
of 66 million years ago, a record of the cataclysm touched
off by an asteroid at the end of the late Cretaceous epoch. So odds are our soot will still be here
66 million years from now, easy enough to find for any aliens
who care to look. Of course, there's an important
difference between us and an asteroid. A space rock has no choice
but to follow gravity. We can choose to do differently. And if we do, there might still be
some kind of human civilization thousands or even millions
of years from now. Not a bad record to hope for.

**Transcript**:
Imagine aliens land on the planet
a million years from now and look into the geologic record. What will these curious searchers
find of us? They will find what geologists, 
scientists, and other experts are increasingly calling
the Anthropocene, or new age of mankind. The impacts that we humans make
have become so pervasive, profound, and permanent that some geologists argue
we merit our own epoch. That would be a new unit
in the geologic time scale that stretches back 
more than 4.5 billion years, or ever since the Earth took shape. Modern humans may be on par
with the glaciers behind various ice ages or the asteroid that doomed
most of the dinosaurs. What is an epoch? Most simply, it's a unit of geologic time. There's the Pleistocene, an icy epoch that saw the evolution
of modern humans. Or there's the Eocene, 
more than 34 million years ago, a hothouse time during which the continents drifted 
into their present configuration. Changes in climate or fossils
found in the rock record help distinguish these epochs
and help geologists tell deep time. So what will be the record 
of modern people's impact on the planet? It doesn't rely on the things
that may seem most obvious to us today, like sprawling cities. Even New York or Shanghai 
may prove hard to find buried in the rocks 
a million years from now. But humans have put new things
into the world that never existed on Earth before, like plutonium and plastics. In fact, the geologists

**Transcript**:
His face is recognized all over the world. The young medical student
who became a revolutionary icon. But was Che Guevara 
a heroic champion of the poor or a ruthless warlord 
who left a legacy of repression? Order, order. Hey, where have I seen that guy before? Ahem, your Honor, this is Ernesto Che Guevara. In the early 1950s, he left behind a privileged life 
as a medical student in Argentina to travel through rural Latin America. The poverty and misery he witnessed
convinced him that saving lives required more than medicine. So he became a terrorist seeking to violently overthrow 
the region's governments. What? The region's governments 
were brutal oligarchies. Colonialism may have formally ended, but elites still controlled 
all the wealth. American corporations bought up land
originally seized from indigenous people and used it for profit and export, even keeping most of it uncultivated
while locals starved. Couldn't they vote to change that? Oh, they tried, your Honor. In 1953, Che came to Guatemala under the democratically-elected 
government of President Árbenz. Árbenz passed reforms to redistribute some of this uncultivated 
land back to the people while compensating the landowners. But he was overthrown 
in a CIA-sponsored coup. The military was protecting against
the seizure of private property and communist takeover. They were protecting corporate profits and Che saw that they would use
the fear of communism to overthrow any government
that threatened those profits. So he took the lessons of Guatemala
with him to Mexico. There, he met exiled Cuban revolutionaries and decided to help them 
liberate their country. You mean help Fidel Castro 
turn a vibrant Cuba into a dictatorship. Dictatorship was what Cuba 
had before the revolution. Fulgencio Batista was a tyrant
who came to power in a military coup. He turned Havana into a luxury playground
for foreigners while keeping Cubans mired in poverty and
killing thousands in police crackdowns. Even President Kennedy called it
the worst example of "economic colonization, humiliation,
and exploitation in the world." Whatever Batista's faults, it can't compare to the totalitarian
nightmare Castro would create. Forced labor camps, torture of prisoners,
no freedom to speak or to leave. But this isn't the trial 
of Fidel Castro, is it? Che Guevara was instrumental in helping
Castro seize power. As a commander in his guerilla army, he unleashed a reign of terror
across the countryside, killing any suspected spies or dissenters. He also helped peasants build
health clinics and schools, taught them to read, and even recited poetry to them. His harsh discipline was necessary
against a much stronger enemy who didn't hesitate to burn entire
villages suspected of aiding the rebels. Let's not forget that the new regime
held mass executions and killed hundreds 
of people without trial as soon as they took power in 1959. The executed were officials
and collaborators who had tormented 
the masses under Batista. The people supported 
this revolutionary justice. Which people? An angry mob crying for blood
does not a democracy make. And that's not even mentioning
the forced labor camps, arbitrary arrests, and repression of LGBT people
that continued long after the revolution. There's a reason people kept
risking their lives to flee, often with nothing but the clothes
on their backs. So was that all this Che brought to Cuba? Just another violent dictatorship? Not at all. He oversaw land redistribution, helped established universal education, and organized volunteer literacy brigades
that raised Cuba's literacy rate to 96%, still one of the highest in the world. Which allowed the government to control
what information everyone received. Guevara's idealistic incompetence
as Finance Minister caused massive drops in productivity when he replaced worker pay raises
with moral certificates. He suppressed all press freedom, declaring that newspapers 
were instruments of the oligarchy. And it was he who urged Castro
to host Soviet nuclear weapons, leading to the Cuban Missile Crisis that brought the world
to the brink of destruction. He was a leader, not a bureaucrat. That's why he eventually left to spread
the revolution abroad. Which didn't go well. He failed to rally rebels in the Congo and went to Bolivia 
even when the Soviets disapproved. The Bolivian Government, 
with the help of the CIA, was able to capture and neutralize
this terrorist in 1967, before he could do much damage. While doing plenty of damage themselves
in the process. So that was the end of it? Not at all. As Che said, 
the revolution is immortal. He was publicly mourned in cities
all over the world. Not by the Cubans who managed to escape. And his story would inspire 
young activists for generations to come. Ha. A trendy symbol of rebellion for those
who never had to live under his regime. Symbols of revolution 
may become commodified, but the idea of a more just world remains. Maybe, but I'm not sharing my coffee. Che Guevara was captured and
executed by government forces in Bolivia. His remains would not be found
for another 30 years. But did he die a hero 
or had he already become a villain? And should revolutions be judged
by their ideals or their outcomes? These are the questions we face
when we put history on trial.

no freedom to speak or to leave. But this isn't the trial 
of Fidel Castro, is it? Che Guevara was instrumental in helping
Castro seize power. As a commander in his guerilla army, he unleashed a reign of terror
across the countryside, killing any suspected spies or dissenters. He also helped peasants build
health clinics and schools, taught them to read, and even recited poetry to them. His harsh discipline was necessary
against a much stronger enemy who didn't hesitate to burn entire
villages suspected of aiding the rebels. Let's not forget that the new regime
held mass executions and killed hundreds 
of people without trial as soon as they took power in 1959. The executed were officials
and collaborators who had tormented 
the masses under Batista. The people supported 
this revolutionary justice. Which people? An angry mob crying for blood
does not a democracy make. And that's not even mentioning
the forced labor camps, arbitrary arrests, and repression of LGBT people
that continued long after the revolution. There's a reason people kept
risking their lives to flee, often with nothing but the clothes
on their backs. So was that all this Che brought to Cuba? Just another violent dictatorship? Not at all. He oversaw land redistribution, helped established universal education, and organized volunteer literacy brigades
that raised Cuba's literacy rate to 96%, still one of the highest in the world. Which allowed the government to control
what information everyone received. Guevara's idealistic incompetence
as Finance Minister caused massive drops in productivity when he replaced worker pay raises
with moral certificates. He suppressed all press freedom, declaring that newspapers 
were instruments of the oligarchy. And it was he who urged Castro
to host Soviet nuclear weapons, leading to the Cuban Missile Crisis that brought the world
to the brink of destruction. He was a leader, not a bureaucrat. That's why he eventually left to spread

even when the Soviets disapproved. The Bolivian Government, 
with the help of the CIA, was able to capture and neutralize
this terrorist in 1967, before he could do much damage. While doing plenty of damage themselves
in the process. So that was the end of it? Not at all. As Che said, 
the revolution is immortal. He was publicly mourned in cities

His face is recognized all over the world. The young medical student
who became a revolutionary icon. But was Che Guevara 
a heroic champion of the poor or a ruthless warlord 
who left a legacy of repression? Order, order. Hey, where have I seen that guy before? Ahem, your Honor, this is Ernesto Che Guevara. In the early 1950s, he left behind a privileged life 
as a medical student in Argentina to travel through rural Latin America. The poverty and misery he witnessed
convinced him that saving lives required more than medicine. So he became a terrorist seeking to violently overthrow 
the region's governments. What? The region's governments 
were brutal oligarchies. Colonialism may have formally ended, but elites still controlled 
all the wealth. American corporations bought up land
originally seized from indigenous people and used it for profit and export, even keeping most of it uncultivated
while locals starved. Couldn't they vote to change that? Oh, they tried, your Honor. In 1953, Che came to Guatemala under the democratically-elected 
government of President Árbenz. Árbenz passed reforms to redistribute some of this uncultivated 
land back to the people while compensating the landowners. But he was overthrown 
in a CIA-sponsored coup. The military was protecting against
the seizure of private property and communist takeover. They were protecting corporate profits and Che saw that they would use
the fear of communism to overthrow any government
that threatened those profits. So he took the lessons of Guatemala
with him to Mexico. There, he met exiled Cuban revolutionaries and decided to help them 
liberate their country. You mean help Fidel Castro 
turn a vibrant Cuba into a dictatorship. Dictatorship was what Cuba 
had before the revolution. Fulgencio Batista was a tyrant
who came to power in a military coup. He turned Havana into a luxury playground
for foreigners while keeping Cubans mired in poverty and
killing thousands in police crackdowns. Even President Kennedy called it
the worst example of "economic colonization, humiliation,
and exploitation in the world." Whatever Batista's faults, it can't compare to the totalitarian

**Transcript**:
Imagine as a thought experiment
that you live in a small village and depend on the local fish pond
for food. You share the pond 
with three other villagers. The pond starts off with a dozen fish,
and the fish reproduce. For every two fish, there will be 
one baby added each night. So, in order to maximize 
your supply of food, how many fish should you catch each day? Take a moment to think about it. Assume baby fish grow 
to full size immediately and that the pond begins at full capacity, and ignore factors 
like the sex of the fish you catch. The answer? One, and it's not just you. The best way to maximize 
every villager's food supply is for each fisherman
to take just one fish each day. Here's how the math works. If each villager takes one fish,
there will be eight fish left over night. Each pair of fish produces one baby, and the next day, the pond 
will be fully restocked with twelve fish. If anyone takes more than one,
the number of reproductive pairs drops, and the population 
won't be able to bounce back. Eventually, the fish in the lake 
will be gone, leaving all four villagers to starve. This fish pond is just one example
of a classic problem called the tragedy of the commons. The phenomenon was first described 
in a pamphlet by economist William Forster Lloyd in 1833 in a discussion of 
the overgrazing of cattle on village common areas. More than 100 years later, ecologist
Garrett Hardin revived the concept to describe what happens 
when many individuals all share a limited resource, like grazing land, fishing areas, living space, even clean air. Hardin argued that these situations
pit short-term self-interest against the common good, and they end badly for everyone, resulting in overgrazing, overfishing, overpopulation, pollution, and other social 
and environmental problems. The key feature of 
a tragedy of the commons is that it provides an opportunity for
an individual to benefit him or herself while spreading out any negative effects 
across the larger population. To see what that means,
let's revisit our fish pond. Each individual fisherman is motivated to take as many fish 
as he can for himself. Meanwhile, any decline 
in fish reproduction is shared by the entire village. Anxious to avoid 
losing out to his neighbors, a fisherman will conclude that it's in his
best interest to take an extra fish, or two, or three. Unfortunately, this is the same conclusion
reached by the other fisherman, and that's the tragedy. Optimizing for the self in the short term
isn't optimal for anyone in the long term. That's a simplified example,
but the tragedy of the commons plays out in the more complex systems
of real life, too. The overuse of antibiotics has led to
short-term gains in livestock production and in treating common illnesses, but it's also resulted in the evolution
of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which threaten the entire population. A coal-fired power plant produces
cheap electricity for its customers and profits for its owners. These local benefits are helpful
in the short term, but pollution from mining and burning coal
is spread across the entire atmosphere and sticks around for thousands of years. There are other examples, too. Littering, water shortages, deforestation, traffic jams, even the purchase of bottled water. But human civilization has proven it's
capable of doing something remarkable. We form social contracts, we make communal agreements, we elect governments, and we pass laws. All this to save our collective selves
from our own individual impulses. It isn't easy, and we certainly 
don't get it right nearly all of the time. But humans at our best have shown
that we can solve these problems and we can continue to do so
if we remember Hardin's lesson. When the tragedy of the commons applies, what's good for all of us 
is good for each of us.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is the definition of the tragedy of the commons?
Options: A. When humans overuse a natural resource, B. When the short-term, positive effects go to the individual, while the long-term, negative effects are spread out to the group, C.

best interest to take an extra fish, or two, or three. Unfortunately, this is the same conclusion
reached by the other fisherman, and that's the tragedy. Optimizing for the self in the short term
isn't optimal for anyone in the long term. That's a simplified example,
but the tragedy of the commons plays out in the more complex systems
of real life, too. The overuse of antibiotics has led to
short-term gains in livestock production and in treating common illnesses, but it's also resulted in the evolution
of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which threaten the entire population. A coal-fired power plant produces
cheap electricity for its customers and profits for its owners. These local benefits are helpful
in the short term, but pollution from mining and burning coal
is spread across the entire atmosphere and sticks around for thousands of years. There are other examples, too. Littering, water shortages, deforestation, traffic jams, even the purchase of bottled water. But human civilization has proven it's
capable of doing something remarkable. We form social contracts, we make communal agreements, we elect governments, and we pass laws. All this to save our collective selves
from our own individual impulses. It isn't easy, and we certainly 
don't get it right nearly all of the time. But humans at our best have shown
that we can solve these problems and we can continue to do so
if we remember Hardin's lesson. When the tragedy of the commons applies, what's good for all of us 
is good for each of us.

**Transcript**:
Imagine as a thought experiment
that you live in a small village and depend on the local fish pond
for food. You share the pond 
with three other villagers. The pond starts off with a dozen fish,
and the fish reproduce. For every two fish, there will be 
one baby added each night. So, in order to maximize 
your supply of food, how many fish should you catch each day? Take a moment to think about it. Assume baby fish grow 
to full size immediately and that the pond begins at full capacity, and ignore factors 
like the sex of the fish you catch. The answer? One, and it's not just you. The best way to maximize 
every villager's food supply is for each fisherman
to take just one fish each day. Here's how the math works. If each villager takes one fish,
there will be eight fish left over night. Each pair of fish produces one baby, and the next day, the pond 
will be fully restocked with twelve fish. If anyone takes more than one,
the number of reproductive pairs drops, and the population 
won't be able to bounce back. Eventually, the fish in the lake 
will be gone, leaving all four villagers to starve. This fish pond is just one example
of a classic problem called the tragedy of the commons. The phenomenon was first described 
in a pamphlet by economist William Forster Lloyd in 1833 in a discussion of 
the overgrazing of cattle on village common areas. More than 100 years later, ecologist
Garrett Hardin revived the concept to describe what happens 
when many individuals all share a limited resource, like grazing land, fishing areas, living space, even clean air. Hardin argued that these situations
pit short-term self-interest against the common good, and they end badly for everyone, resulting in overgrazing, overfishing, overpopulation, pollution, and other social 
and environmental problems. The key feature of 
a tragedy of the commons is that it provides an opportunity for
an individual to benefit him or herself while spreading out any negative effects 
across the larger population. To see what that means,
let's revisit our fish pond. Each individual fisherman is motivated to take as many fish 
as he can for himself. Meanwhile, any decline 
in fish reproduction is shared by the entire village. Anxious to avoid 
losing out to his neighbors, a fisherman will conclude that it's in his

**Transcript**:
All year long, researchers at hundreds
of hospitals around the world collect samples from flu patients and send them to top virology experts
with one goal: to design the vaccine 
for the next flu season. But why do we need a new one every year? Vaccines for diseases like mumps
and rubella offer a lifetime of protection with two shots early in life. What's so special about the flu? Two factors make the flu a tough target. First, there are more than 100 subtypes
of the influenza virus, and the ones in circulation 
change from season to season. And second, the flu's genetic code
allows it to mutate more quickly than many other viruses. The flu spreads by turning a host's own 
cells into viral production factories. When the virus is engulfed by a host cell,
it expels its genetic material, which makes its way to the nucleus. There, cellular machinery that normally
copies the host's genes starts replicating viral genes instead, creating more and more copies
of the virus. New viruses are repackaged 
and crammed into the cell until it bursts, sending freshly minted influenza viruses
out to infect additional cells. Most viruses follow this script. The trick with the flu is that its genetic
material isn't DNA but a similar compound called RNA. And RNA viruses can mutate much faster. When cells synthesize DNA, a built-in proofreader recognizes 
and corrects mistakes, but the RNA synthesis mechanism
doesn't have this fail-safe. If errors creep in, they stick around
creating new variants of the virus. Why is this a problem? Because vaccines depend on recognition. The flu vaccine includes some of the same
substances, called antigens, found on the surface of the virus itself. The body identifies those fragments
as foreign and responds by producing compounds
called antibodies, tailor-made to match the antigens. When a vaccinated person
encounters the actual virus, the preprogrammed antibodies
help the immune system identify the threat and mobilize quickly 
to prevent an infection. Those antigens are different 
for every strain of influenza. If vaccination has prepared 
the immune system for one strain, a different one may still 
be able to sneak by. Even within the same strain of flu, those rapid genetic mutations
can change the surface compounds enough that the antibodies 
may not recognize them. To make things even more complicated, sometimes two different strains combine
to create an entirely new hybrid virus. All of this makes vaccinating for the flu like trying to hit a moving 
transforming target. That's why scientists are constantly
collecting data about which strains are circulating and checking to see how much those
strains have mutated from previous years' versions. Twice annually, the World 
Health Organization pulls together experts to analyze all that data, holding one meeting for each hemisphere. The scientists determine which strains
to include in that season's vaccine, picking four for the quadrivalent vaccine
in use today. In spite of the flu's evasive maneuvers, in recent years, the group's predictions
have been almost always correct. Even when flu strains mutate further,
the vaccine is often close enough that a vaccinated person who catches
the flu anyway will have a milder and shorter illness
than they would otherwise. Vaccination also helps protect
other people in the community who may not be medically eligible 
for the shot by preventing those around them
from carrying the virus. This is called herd immunity. The flu shot can't give you the flu. It contains an inactivated virus
that isn't capable of making you sick. You might feel tired 
and achy after getting it, but that's not an infection. It's your normal immune response
to the vaccine. Some parts of the world use, 
instead of a shot, an inhaled vaccine that contains a weakened live virus. This is also safe for 
the vast majority of people. Only those with impaired immune systems
would be at risk, but they're typically 
not given live vaccines. Meanwhile, scientists are working
to develop a universal flu vaccine that would protect against any strain,
even mutated ones. But until then, the hunt 
for next year's vaccine is on.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is the genetic material of the flu virus?
Options: A. DNA, B. RNA, C. Both, D. None of the above

**Transcript**:
All year long, researchers at hundreds
of hospitals around the world collect samples from flu patients and send them to top virology experts
with one goal: to design the vaccine 
for the next flu season. But why do we need a new one every year? Vaccines for diseases like mumps
and rubella offer a lifetime of protection with two shots early in life. What's so special about the flu? Two factors make the flu a tough target. First, there are more than 100 subtypes
of the influenza virus, and the ones in circulation 
change from season to season. And second, the flu's genetic code
allows it to mutate more quickly than many other viruses. The flu spreads by turning a host's own 
cells into viral production factories. When the virus is engulfed by a host cell,
it expels its genetic material, which makes its way to the nucleus. There, cellular machinery that normally
copies the host's genes starts replicating viral genes instead, creating more and more copies
of the virus. New viruses are repackaged 
and crammed into the cell until it bursts, sending freshly minted influenza viruses
out to infect additional cells. Most viruses follow this script. The trick with the flu is that its genetic
material isn't DNA but a similar compound called RNA. And RNA viruses can mutate much faster. When cells synthesize DNA, a built-in proofreader recognizes 
and corrects mistakes, but the RNA synthesis mechanism
doesn't have this fail-safe. If errors creep in, they stick around
creating new variants of the virus. Why is this a problem? Because vaccines depend on recognition. The flu vaccine includes some of the same
substances, called antigens, found on the surface of the virus itself. The body identifies those fragments
as foreign and responds by producing compounds
called antibodies, tailor-made to match the antigens. When a vaccinated person
encounters the actual virus, the preprogrammed antibodies
help the immune system identify the threat and mobilize quickly 
to prevent an infection. Those antigens are different 
for every strain of influenza. If vaccination has prepared 
the immune system for one strain, a different one may still 
be able to sneak by. Even within the same strain of flu, those rapid genetic mutations
can change the surface compounds enough that the antibodies 
may not recognize them. To make things even more complicated, sometimes two different strains combine
to create an entirely new hybrid virus. All of this makes vaccinating for the flu like trying to hit a moving 
transforming target. That's why scientists are constantly
collecting data about which strains are circulating and checking to see how much those
strains have mutated from previous years' versions. Twice annually, the World 
Health Organization pulls together experts to analyze all that data, holding one meeting for each hemisphere. The scientists determine which strains
to include in that season's vaccine, picking four for the quadrivalent vaccine
in use today. In spite of the flu's evasive maneuvers, in recent years, the group's predictions
have been almost always correct. Even when flu strains mutate further,
the vaccine is often close enough that a vaccinated person who catches
the flu anyway will have a milder and shorter illness
than they would otherwise. Vaccination also helps protect
other people in the community who may not be medically eligible 
for the shot by preventing those around them
from carrying the virus. This is called herd immunity. The flu shot can't give you the flu. It contains an inactivated virus
that isn't capable of making you sick. You might feel tired 
and achy after getting it, but that's not an infection. It's your normal immune response
to the vaccine. Some parts of the world use, 
instead of a shot, an inhaled vaccine that contains a weakened live virus. This is also safe for 
the vast majority of people. Only those with impaired immune systems
would be at risk, but they're typically 
not given live vaccines. Meanwhile, scientists are working
to develop a universal flu vaccine that would protect against any strain,
even mutated ones. But until then, the hunt 
for next year's vaccine is on.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Like all living things, influenza makes small errors when it copies its genetic code during reproduction. Why does influenza lack the ability to repair those errors?

**Transcript**:
Are you as good at things 
as you think you are? How good are you at managing money? What about reading people's emotions? How healthy are you 
compared to other people you know? Are you better than average at grammar? Knowing how competent we are and how are skill stack up 
against other people's is more than a self-esteem boost. It helps us figure out when we can forge
ahead on our own decisions and instincts and when we need, instead, 
to seek out advice. But psychological research suggests
that we're not very good at evaluating ourselves accurately. In fact, we frequently overestimate
our own abilities. Researchers have a name 
for this phenomena, the Dunning-Kruger effect. This effect explains 
why more than 100 studies have shown that people display 
illusory superiority. We judge ourselves as better than others to a degree that violates 
the laws of math. When software engineers at two companies
were asked to rate their performance, 32% of the engineers at one company
and 42% at the other put themselves in the top 5%. In another study, 88% of American drivers described themselves 
as having above average driving skills. These aren't isolated findings. On average, people tend to rate
themselves better than most in disciplines ranging from health,
leadership skills, ethics, and beyond. What's particularly interesting
is that those with the least ability are often the most likely to overrate
their skills to the greatest extent. People measurably poor 
at logical reasoning, grammar, financial knowledge, math, emotional intelligence, running medical lab tests, and chess all tend to rate their expertise almost
as favorably as actual experts do. So who's most vulnerable to this delusion? Sadly, all of us because we all have
pockets of incompetence we don't recognize. But why? When psychologists Dunning and Kruger
first described the effect in 1999, they argued that people lacking
knowledge and skill in particular areas suffer a double curse. First, they make mistakes
and reach poor decisions. But second, those same knowledge gaps also
prevent them from catching their errors. In other words, poor performers lack
the very expertise needed to recognize how badly they're doing. For example, when the researchers studied participants in 
a college debate tournament, the bottom 25% of teams 
in preliminary rounds lost nearly four 
out of every five matches. But they thought they were winning
almost 60%. WIthout a strong grasp 
of the rules of debate, the students simply couldn't recognize
when or how often their arguments broke down. The Dunning-Kruger effect isn't a question
of ego blinding us to our weaknesses. People usually do admit their deficits
once they can spot them. In one study, students who had initially
done badly on a logic quiz and then took a mini course on logic were quite willing to label
their original performances as awful. That may be why people with a moderate
amount of experience or expertise often have less confidence
in their abilities. They know enough to know that 
there's a lot they don't know. Meanwhile, experts tend to be aware
of just how knowledgeable they are. But they often make a different mistake: they assume that everyone else 
is knowledgeable, too. The result is that people, 
whether they're inept or highly skilled, are often caught in a bubble
of inaccurate self-perception. When they're unskilled, 
they can't see their own faults. When they're exceptionally competent, they don't perceive how unusual 
their abilities are. So if the Dunning-Kruger effect 
is invisible to those experiencing it, what can you do to find out how good
you actually are at various things? First, ask for feedback from other people, and consider it, 
even if it's hard to hear. Second, and more important, keep learning. The more knowledgeable we become, the less likely we are to have
invisible holes in our competence. Perhaps it all boils down 
to that old proverb: When arguing with a fool, first make sure the other person
isn't doing the same thing.

Are you as good at things

compared to other people you know? Are you better than average at grammar? Knowing how competent we are and how are skill stack up 
against other people's is more than a self-esteem boost. It helps us figure out when we can forge
ahead on our own decisions and instincts and when we need, instead, 
to seek out advice. But psychological research suggests
that we're not very good at evaluating ourselves accurately. In fact, we frequently overestimate
our own abilities. Researchers have a name

even if it's hard to hear. Second, and more important, keep learning. The more knowledgeable we become, the less likely we are to have
invisible holes in our competence. Perhaps it all boils down 
to that old proverb: When arguing with a fool, first make sure the other person
isn't doing the same thing.

**Transcript**:
The city has just opened its
one-of-a-kind Fabergé Egg Museum with a single egg displayed on each floor
of a 100-story building. And the world's most notorious jewel thief
already has her eyes on the prize. Because security is tight
and the eggs are so large, she'll only get the chance to steal one by dropping it out the window
into her waiting truck and repelling down 
before the police can arrive. All eggs are identical in weight
and construction, but each floor's egg is more rare 
and valuable than the one below it. While the thief would naturally like
to take the priceless egg at the top, she suspects it won't survive
a 100-story drop. Being pragmatic, she decides to settle
for the most expensive egg she can get. In the museum's gift shop, 
she finds two souvenir eggs, perfect replicas 
that are perfectly worthless. The plan is to test drop them to find the highest floor 
at which an egg will survive the fall without breaking. Of course, the experiment 
can only be repeated until both replica eggs are smashed. And throwing souvenirs out the window
too many times is probably going to draw 
the guards' attention. What's the least number of tries
it would take to guarantee that 
she find the right floor? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If you're having trouble getting started
on the solution, it might help to start 
with a simpler scenario. Imagine our thief only 
had one replica egg. She'd have a single option: To start by dropping it 
from the first floor and go up one by one until it breaks. Then she'd know that the floor below that is the one she needs 
to target for the real heist. But this could require 
as many as 100 tries. Having an additional replica egg
gives the thief a better option. She can drop the first egg from different
floors at larger intervals in order to narrow down the range
where the critical floor can be found. And once the first breaks, she can use the second egg to explore
that interval floor by floor. Large floor intervals don't work great. In the worst case scenario, they require
many tests with the second egg. Smaller intervals work much better. For example, if she starts by dropping
the first egg from every 10th floor, once it breaks, she'll only have to test
the nine floors below. That means it'll take at most
19 tries to find the right floor. But can she do even better? After all, there's no reason 
every interval has to be the same size. Let's say there were only ten floors. The thief could test this whole building
with just four total throws by dropping the first egg
at floors four, seven, and nine. If it broke at floor four, it would take
up to three throws of the second egg to find the exact floor. If it broke at seven, it would take up to two throws
with the second egg. And if it broke at floor nine, it would take just one more
throw of the second egg. Intuitively, what we're trying to do here
is divide the building into sections where no matter which floor is correct, it takes up to the same number
of throws to find it. We want each interval to be one floor
smaller than the last. This equation can help us solve
for the first floor we need to start with in the 100 floor building. There are several ways 
to solve this equation, including trial and error. If we plug in two for n,
that equation would look like this. If we plug in three, we get this. So we can find the first n to pass 100 by adding more terms 
until we get to our answer, which is 14. And so our thief starts on the 14th floor, moving up to the 27th, the 39th, and so on, for a maximum of 14 drops. Like the old saying goes, you can't 
pull a heist without breaking a few eggs.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Is it true that the thief will need 14 throws to find the correct floor?
Options: A. Yes, because we found that otherwise the thief cannot know for sure that he succeeded., B. Yes, because 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13+14>100, C. No, because sometimes the thief will find the correct floor with less than 14 throws, D. No, because 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13+14>100

**Transcript**:
The city has just opened its
one-of-a-kind Fabergé Egg Museum with a single egg displayed on each floor
of a 100-story building. And the world's most notorious jewel thief
already has her eyes on the prize. Because security is tight
and the eggs are so large, she'll only get the chance to steal one by dropping it out the window
into her waiting truck and repelling down 
before the police can arrive. All eggs are identical in weight
and construction, but each floor's egg is more rare 
and valuable than the one below it. While the thief would naturally like
to take the priceless egg at the top, she suspects it won't survive
a 100-story drop. Being pragmatic, she decides to settle
for the most expensive egg she can get. In the museum's gift shop, 
she finds two souvenir eggs, perfect replicas 
that are perfectly worthless. The plan is to test drop them to find the highest floor 
at which an egg will survive the fall without breaking. Of course, the experiment 
can only be repeated until both replica eggs are smashed. And throwing souvenirs out the window
too many times is probably going to draw 
the guards' attention. What's the least number of tries
it would take to guarantee that 
she find the right floor? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If you're having trouble getting started
on the solution, it might help to start 
with a simpler scenario. Imagine our thief only 
had one replica egg. She'd have a single option: To start by dropping it 
from the first floor and go up one by one until it breaks. Then she'd know that the floor below that is the one she needs 
to target for the real heist. But this could require 
as many as 100 tries. Having an additional replica egg
gives the thief a better option. She can drop the first egg from different
floors at larger intervals in order to narrow down the range
where the critical floor can be found. And once the first breaks, she can use the second egg to explore
that interval floor by floor. Large floor intervals don't work great. In the worst case scenario, they require
many tests with the second egg. Smaller intervals work much better. For example, if she starts by dropping
the first egg from every 10th floor, once it breaks, she'll only have to test
the nine floors below. That means it'll take at most
19 tries to find the right floor. But can she do even better? After all, there's no reason 
every interval has to be the same size. Let's say there were only ten floors. The thief could test this whole building
with just four total throws by dropping the first egg
at floors four, seven, and nine. If it broke at floor four, it would take
up to three throws of the second egg to find the exact floor. If it broke at seven, it would take up to two throws
with the second egg. And if it broke at floor nine, it would take just one more
throw of the second egg. Intuitively, what we're trying to do here
is divide the building into sections where no matter which floor is correct, it takes up to the same number
of throws to find it. We want each interval to be one floor
smaller than the last. This equation can help us solve
for the first floor we need to start with in the 100 floor building. There are several ways 
to solve this equation, including trial and error. If we plug in two for n,
that equation would look like this. If we plug in three, we get this. So we can find the first n to pass 100 by adding more terms 
until we get to our answer, which is 14. And so our thief starts on the 14th floor, moving up to the 27th, the 39th, and so on, for a maximum of 14 drops. Like the old saying goes, you can't 
pull a heist without breaking a few eggs.
