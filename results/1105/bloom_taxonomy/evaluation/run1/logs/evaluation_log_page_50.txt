**Transcript**:
There are over one billion cars
in the world today, getting people where they need to go, but cars aren't just
a mode of transportation, they're also a chemistry lesson
waiting to be taught. The process of starting your car
begins in the engine cylinders, where a spritz of gasoline
from the fuel injector and a gulp of air
from the intake valve mix together before 
being ignited by a spark, forming gases that expand and push the piston. But combustion is an exothermic reaction,
meaning it releases heat. Lots of it. And while much of this heat escapes
through the tail pipe, the heat that remains in the engine block
needs to be absorbed, transported, and dissipated to protect the metal components
from deforming or even melting. This is where the cooling system comes in. A liquid gets circulated
throughout the engine, but what kind of liquid
can absorb all that heat? Water may seem like an obvious first choice. After all, its specific heat, the amount of energy required
to raise the temperature of a given amount
by one degree Celsius, is higher than that of
any other common substance. And we have a lot of heat energy to absorb. But using water can get us
into deep trouble. For one thing, its freezing point
is zero degrees Celsius. Since water expands
as it freezes, a cold winter night could mean
a cracked radiator and a damaged engine block, a chilling prospect. And considering how hot
car engines can get, the relatively low boiling point
of 100 degrees Celsius can lead to a situation
that would get anyone steamed. So, instead of water,
we use a solution, a homogeneous mixture consisting
of a solute and a solvent. Some of the solution's properties will differ
depending on the proportion of solute present. These are called colligative properties,
and as luck would have it, they include freezing point depression
and boiling point elevation. So, solutions have both a lower freezing point
and a higher boiling point than pure solvent, and the more solute is present,
the bigger the difference. So, why do these properties change? First of all, we need to understand that
temperature is a measure of the particle's average kinetic energy. The colder the liquid,
the less of this energy there is, and the slower the molecules move. When a liquid freezes,
the molecules slow down, enough for their attractive forces
to act on each other, arranging themselves into a crystal structure. But the presence of solute particles
gets in the way of these attractions, requiring a solution to be cooled down further
before the arrangement can occur. As for the boiling point,
when a liquid boils, it produces bubbles filled with its vapor, but for a bubble to form,
the vapor pressure must become as strong as the atmosphere constantly pushing down
on the surface of the liquid. As the liquid is heated, 
the vapor pressure increases, and when it becomes equal
to the atmospheric pressure, the bubbles form and boiling occurs. A solution's vapor pressure is lower
than that of pure solvent, so it must be heated
to an even higher temperature before it can match 
the strength of the atmosphere. As an added bonus,
the pressure in the radiator is kept above atmospheric pressure, raising the boiling point
by another 25 degrees Celsius. The solution commonly used 
for a car's cooling system is a 50/50 mixture of 
ethylene glycol and water, which freezes at -37 degrees Celsius
and boils at 106 degrees Celsius. At the highest recommended proportion
of 70 to 30, the freezing point is even lower
at -55 degrees Celsius, and the boiling point rises
to 113 degrees Celsius. As you can see,
the more ethylene glycol you add, the more protection you get,
so why not go even higher? Well, it turns out you can have
too much of a good thing because at higher proportions, the freezing point actually
starts to go back up. The properties of the solution head towards
the properties of ethylene glycol, which freezes at -12.9 degrees Celsius, a higher temperature than we 
attained with the solution. The solution flows through the engine,
absorbing heat along the way. When it reaches the radiator,
it's cooled by a fan, as well as air rushing through
the front of the car before returning to the hot engine compartment. So, an effective and safe engine coolant must have a high specific heat, 
a low freezing point, and a high boiling point. But instead of searching all over the world
for the perfect liquid to solve our problem, we can create our own solution.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 9: What is the effect of the presence of solute particles on the freezing point of a solution?**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks about colligative properties in general. A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the properties of solutions that differ from those of pure solvent, and how they depend on the concentration of particles in solution.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 3: What is the effect of adding a solute to a solvent on its boiling point?** is the closest match, as it deals with one aspect of colligative properties (boiling point elevation).

However, I must note that this is not a perfect match, and a more suitable question would be one that asks about colligative properties in general, including both freezing point depression and boiling point elevation.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**3**

However, please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more suitable question would be one that asks about colligative properties in general.

**Transcript**:
Did you know that every time
musicians pick up their instruments, there are fireworks going off
all over their brain? On the outside,
they may look calm and focused, reading the music and making the precise
and practiced movements required. But inside their brains,
there's a party going on. How do we know this? Well, in the last few decades, neuroscientists have made
enormous breakthroughs in understanding how our brains work
by monitoring them in real time with instruments like
fMRI and PET scanners. When people are hooked up
to these machines, tasks, such as reading
or doing math problems, each have corresponding areas of the brain
where activity can be observed. But when researchers got
the participants to listen to music, they saw fireworks. Multiple areas of their brains
were lighting up at once, as they processed the sound, took it apart to understand elements
like melody and rhythm, and then put it all back together
into unified musical experience. And our brains do all this work
in the split second between when we first hear the music
and when our foot starts to tap along. But when scientists turned
from observing the brains of music listeners to those of musicians, the little backyard fireworks
became a jubilee. It turns out that while listening
to music engages the brain in some pretty interesting activities, playing music is the brain's equivalent
of a full-body workout. The neuroscientists saw
multiple areas of the brain light up, simultaneously processing
different information in intricate, interrelated,
and astonishingly fast sequences. But what is it about making music
that sets the brain alight? The research is still fairly new, but neuroscientists
have a pretty good idea. Playing a musical instrument engages practically every area
of the brain at once, especially the visual,
auditory, and motor cortices. As with any other workout, disciplined,
structured practice in playing music strengthens those brain functions,
allowing us to apply that strength to other activities. The most obvious difference between
listening to music and playing it is that the latter requires
fine motor skills, which are controlled
in both hemispheres of the brain. It also combines the linguistic
and mathematical precision, in which the left hemisphere
is more involved, with the novel and creative
content that the right excels in. For these reasons,
playing music has been found to increase the volume and activity
in the brain's corpus callosum, the bridge between the two hemispheres, allowing messages to get across the brain
faster and through more diverse routes. This may allow musicians to solve problems more effectively and creatively,
in both academic and social settings. Because making music also involves
crafting and understanding its emotional content and message, musicians often have higher levels
of executive function, a category of interlinked tasks that includes planning, strategizing,
and attention to detail and requires simultaneous analysis
of both cognitive and emotional aspects. This ability also has an impact
on how our memory systems work. And, indeed, musicians exhibit
enhanced memory functions, creating, storing, and retrieving memories
more quickly and efficiently. Studies have found that musicians appear
to use their highly connected brains to give each memory multiple tags, such as a conceptual tag,
an emotional tag, an audio tag, and a contextual tag, like a good Internet search engine. How do we know that all these benefits
are unique to music, as opposed to, say, sports or painting? Or could it be
that people who go into music were already smarter to begin with? Neuroscientists have explored
these issues, but so far, they have found that the artistic
and aesthetic aspects of learning to play a musical instrument are different from any other activity
studied, including other arts. And several randomized studies
of participants, who showed the same levels of cognitive function
and neural processing at the start, found that those who were exposed
to a period of music learning showed enhancement in multiple
brain areas, compared to the others. This recent research about
the mental benefits of playing music has advanced our understanding
of mental function, revealing the inner rhythms
and complex interplay that make up the amazing
orchestra of our brain.

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 2, Question 2
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Did you know that every time
musicians pick up their instruments, there are fireworks going off
all over their brain? On the outside,
they may look calm and focused, reading the music and making the precise
and practiced movements required. But inside their brains,
there's a party going on. How do we know this? Well, in the last few decades, neuroscientists have made
enormous breakthroughs in understanding how our brains work
by monitoring them in real time with instruments like
fMRI and PET scanners. When people are hooked up
to these machines, tasks, such as reading
or doing math problems, each have corresponding areas of the brain
where activity can be observed. But when researchers got
the participants to listen to music, they saw fireworks. Multiple areas of their brains
were lighting up at once, as they processed the sound, took it apart to understand elements
like melody and rhythm, and then put it all back together
into unified musical experience. And our brains do all this work
in the split second between when we first hear the music
and when our foot starts to tap along. But when scientists turned
from observing the brains of music listeners to those of musicians, the little backyard fireworks
became a jubilee. It turns out that while listening
to music engages the brain in some pretty interesting activities, playing music is the brain's equivalent
of a full-body workout. The neuroscientists saw
multiple areas of the brain light up, simultaneously processing
different information in intricate, interrelated,
and astonishingly fast sequences. But what is it about making music
that sets the brain alight? The research is still fairly new, but neuroscientists
have a pretty good idea. Playing a musical instrument engages practically every area
of the brain at once, especially the visual,
auditory, and motor cortices. As with any other workout, disciplined,
structured practice in playing music strengthens those brain functions,
allowing us to apply that strength to other activities. The most obvious difference between
listening to music and playing it is that the latter requires
fine motor skills, which are controlled
in both hemispheres of the brain. It also combines the linguistic
and mathematical precision, in which the left hemisphere
is more involved, with the novel and creative
content that the right excels in. For these reasons,
playing music has been found to increase the volume and activity
in the brain's corpus callosum, the bridge between the two hemispheres, allowing messages to get across the brain
faster and through more diverse routes. This may allow musicians to solve problems more effectively and creatively,
in both academic and social settings. Because making music also involves
crafting and understanding its emotional content and message, musicians often have higher levels
of executive function, a category of interlinked tasks that includes planning, strategizing,
and attention to detail and requires simultaneous analysis
of both cognitive and emotional aspects. This ability also has an impact
on how our memory systems work. And, indeed, musicians exhibit
enhanced memory functions, creating, storing, and retrieving memories
more quickly and efficiently. Studies have found that musicians appear
to use their highly connected brains to give each memory multiple tags, such as a conceptual tag,
an emotional tag, an audio tag, and a contextual tag, like a good Internet search engine. How do we know that all these benefits
are unique to music, as opposed to, say, sports or painting? Or could it be
that people who go into music were already smarter to begin with? Neuroscientists have explored
these issues, but so far, they have found that the artistic
and aesthetic aspects of learning to play a musical instrument are different from any other activity
studied, including other arts. And several randomized studies
of participants, who showed the same levels of cognitive function
and neural processing at the start, found that those who were exposed
to a period of music learning showed enhancement in multiple
brain areas, compared to the others. This recent research about
the mental benefits of playing music has advanced our understanding
of mental function, revealing the inner rhythms
and complex interplay that make up the amazing
orchestra of our brain.

listening to music and playing it is that the latter requires
fine motor skills, which are controlled
in both hemispheres of the brain. It also combines the linguistic
and mathematical precision, in which the left hemisphere
is more involved, with the novel and creative
content that the right excels in. For these reasons,
playing music has been found to increase the volume and activity
in the brain's corpus callosum, the bridge between the two hemispheres, allowing messages to get across the brain
faster and through more diverse routes. This may allow musicians to solve problems more effectively and creatively,
in both academic and social settings. Because making music also involves
crafting and understanding its emotional content and message, musicians often have higher levels
of executive function, a category of interlinked tasks that includes planning, strategizing,
and attention to detail and requires simultaneous analysis
of both cognitive and emotional aspects. This ability also has an impact
on how our memory systems work. And, indeed, musicians exhibit
enhanced memory functions, creating, storing, and retrieving memories
more quickly and efficiently. Studies have found that musicians appear
to use their highly connected brains to give each memory multiple tags, such as a conceptual tag,
an emotional tag, an audio tag, and a contextual tag, like a good Internet search engine. How do we know that all these benefits
are unique to music, as opposed to, say, sports or painting? Or could it be
that people who go into music were already smarter to begin with? Neuroscientists have explored
these issues, but so far, they have found that the artistic
and aesthetic aspects of learning to play a musical instrument are different from any other activity
studied, including other arts. And several randomized studies
of participants, who showed the same levels of cognitive function
and neural processing at the start, found that those who were exposed
to a period of music learning showed enhancement in multiple
brain areas, compared to the others. This recent research about
the mental benefits of playing music has advanced our understanding
of mental function, revealing the inner rhythms
and complex interplay that make up the amazing
orchestra of our brain.

**Transcript**:
Did you know that every time
musicians pick up their instruments, there are fireworks going off
all over their brain? On the outside,
they may look calm and focused, reading the music and making the precise
and practiced movements required. But inside their brains,
there's a party going on. How do we know this? Well, in the last few decades, neuroscientists have made
enormous breakthroughs in understanding how our brains work
by monitoring them in real time with instruments like
fMRI and PET scanners. When people are hooked up
to these machines, tasks, such as reading
or doing math problems, each have corresponding areas of the brain
where activity can be observed. But when researchers got
the participants to listen to music, they saw fireworks. Multiple areas of their brains
were lighting up at once, as they processed the sound, took it apart to understand elements
like melody and rhythm, and then put it all back together
into unified musical experience. And our brains do all this work
in the split second between when we first hear the music
and when our foot starts to tap along. But when scientists turned
from observing the brains of music listeners to those of musicians, the little backyard fireworks
became a jubilee. It turns out that while listening
to music engages the brain in some pretty interesting activities, playing music is the brain's equivalent
of a full-body workout. The neuroscientists saw
multiple areas of the brain light up, simultaneously processing
different information in intricate, interrelated,
and astonishingly fast sequences. But what is it about making music
that sets the brain alight? The research is still fairly new, but neuroscientists
have a pretty good idea. Playing a musical instrument engages practically every area
of the brain at once, especially the visual,
auditory, and motor cortices. As with any other workout, disciplined,
structured practice in playing music strengthens those brain functions,
allowing us to apply that strength to other activities. The most obvious difference between
listening to music and playing it is that the latter requires
fine motor skills, which are controlled
in both hemispheres of the brain. It also combines the linguistic
and mathematical precision, in which the left hemisphere
is more involved, with the novel and creative
content that the right excels in. For these reasons,

**Transcript**:
In 1985, 16-year-old Douglas Casa, ran the championship 10,000 meter track race
at the Empire State Games. Suddenly, with just 200 meters to go,
he collapsed, got back up and then collapsed again
on the final straightaway, with his body temperature 
at dangerous levels. He had suffered an exertional heat stroke. Fortunately, with immediate and
proper treatment, he survived the potentially fatal episode and has since helped save 167 people
in similar circumstances. From ancient soldiers on the battlefield to modern day warriors on the gridiron, exertional heat stroke, or sunstroke, 
has long been a serious concern. And unlike classical heat stroke, 
which affects vulnerable people such as infants and the elderly 
during heat waves, exertional heat stroke is caused by 
intense exercise in the heat, and is one of the top three killers
of athletes and soldiers in training. When you exercise, 
nearly 80% of the energy you use is transformed into heat. In normal circumstances, 
this is what's known as compensable heat stress. And your body can dissipate the heat
as quickly as it's generated through cooling methods 
like the evaporation of sweat. But with uncompensable heat stress, your body is unable to lose enough heat due to overexertion or 
high temperatures in humidity, which raises your core temperature 
beyond normal levels. This causes the proteins and 
cell membranes to denature, creating cells that no longer 
function properly and begin to leak their contents. If these leaky cells 
proliferate through the body, the results can be devastating. Including liver damage, 
blood clot formation in the kidneys, damage to the gastrointestinal tract 
and even the failure of vital organs. So how do you diagnose 
an exertional heat stroke? The main criterion is a core body temperature 
greater than 40 degrees Celsius observed along with physical symptoms such as increased heart rate, 
low blood pressure and rapid breathing or signs of central nervous system disfunction such as confused behavior, 
aggression or loss of consciousness. The most feasible and accurate way 
to assess core body temperature is with a rectal thermometer as other common temperature-taking methods
are not accurate in these circumstances. As far as treatment goes, the most important thing to remember is
cool first, transport second. Because the human body can withstand 
a core temperature above 40 degrees Celsius for about 30 minutes before cell damage sets in, it's essential to initiate rapid cooling on site in order to lower it as quickly as possible. After any athletic or protective gear 
has been removed from the victim, place them in an ice water tub 
while stirring the water and monitoring vitals continuously. If this is not possible, dousing in ice water and applying 
wet towels over the entire body can help. But before you start anything, 
emergency services should be called. As you wait, it's important 
to keep the victim calm while cooling as much 
surface area as possible until emergency personnel arrive. If medical staff are available on site,
cooling should continue until a core temperature
of 38.9 degrees Celsius is reached. The sun is known for giving life, but it can also take life away
if we're not careful, even affecting the strongest among us. As Dr. JJ Levick wrote of
exertional heat stroke in 1859, "It strikes down its victim 
with his full armor on. Youth, health and strength
oppose no obstacle to its power." But although this condition is one of the 
top three leading causes of death in sports, it has been 100% survivable with proper care.

a core temperature above 40 degrees Celsius for about 30 minutes before cell damage sets in, it's essential to initiate rapid cooling on site in order to lower it as quickly as possible. After any athletic or protective gear 
has been removed from the victim, place them in an ice water tub 
while stirring the water and monitoring vitals continuously. If this is not possible, dousing in ice water and applying 
wet towels over the entire body can help. But before you start anything, 
emergency services should be called. As you wait, it's important 
to keep the victim calm while cooling as much 
surface area as possible until emergency personnel arrive. If medical staff are available on site,
cooling should continue until a core temperature
of 38.9 degrees Celsius is reached. The sun is known for giving life, but it can also take life away
if we're not careful, even affecting the strongest among us. As Dr. JJ Levick wrote of
exertional heat stroke in 1859, "It strikes down its victim 
with his full armor on. Youth, health and strength
oppose no obstacle to its power." But although this condition is one of the 
top three leading causes of death in sports, it has been 100% survivable with proper care.

**Transcript**:
In 1985, 16-year-old Douglas Casa, ran the championship 10,000 meter track race
at the Empire State Games. Suddenly, with just 200 meters to go,
he collapsed, got back up and then collapsed again
on the final straightaway, with his body temperature 
at dangerous levels. He had suffered an exertional heat stroke. Fortunately, with immediate and
proper treatment, he survived the potentially fatal episode and has since helped save 167 people
in similar circumstances. From ancient soldiers on the battlefield to modern day warriors on the gridiron, exertional heat stroke, or sunstroke, 
has long been a serious concern. And unlike classical heat stroke, 
which affects vulnerable people such as infants and the elderly 
during heat waves, exertional heat stroke is caused by 
intense exercise in the heat, and is one of the top three killers
of athletes and soldiers in training. When you exercise, 
nearly 80% of the energy you use is transformed into heat. In normal circumstances, 
this is what's known as compensable heat stress. And your body can dissipate the heat
as quickly as it's generated through cooling methods 
like the evaporation of sweat. But with uncompensable heat stress, your body is unable to lose enough heat due to overexertion or 
high temperatures in humidity, which raises your core temperature 
beyond normal levels. This causes the proteins and 
cell membranes to denature, creating cells that no longer 
function properly and begin to leak their contents. If these leaky cells 
proliferate through the body, the results can be devastating. Including liver damage, 
blood clot formation in the kidneys, damage to the gastrointestinal tract 
and even the failure of vital organs. So how do you diagnose 
an exertional heat stroke? The main criterion is a core body temperature 
greater than 40 degrees Celsius observed along with physical symptoms such as increased heart rate, 
low blood pressure and rapid breathing or signs of central nervous system disfunction such as confused behavior, 
aggression or loss of consciousness. The most feasible and accurate way 
to assess core body temperature is with a rectal thermometer as other common temperature-taking methods
are not accurate in these circumstances. As far as treatment goes, the most important thing to remember is
cool first, transport second. Because the human body can withstand 
a core temperature above 40 degrees Celsius for about 30 minutes before cell damage sets in, it's essential to initiate rapid cooling on site in order to lower it as quickly as possible. After any athletic or protective gear

**Transcript**:
we conventionally divided space into private and public realms and we know these legal distinctions very well because we become experts at protecting our private property and private space but we're less attuned to the nuances of the public what translates generic public space into qualitative space and this is something that our studio has been working on for the past decade and we're doing this through some case studies a large chunk of our work has been put into transforming this neglected industrial ruin into a viable post-industrial space that looks forward and backwards at the same time and another huge chunk of our work has gone into making relevant a site that's grown out of sync with its time we've been working on democratizing Lincoln Center for a public that doesn't usually have 300 dollars to spend on an opera ticket so we've been eating drinking thinking living public space for quite a long time and it's taught us really one thing and that is to truly make a good public space you have to erase the distinctions between architecture urbanism landscape media design and so on it really goes beyond distinction now we are moving on to Washington DC and we're working on another transformation and that is for the existing Hirshhorn Museum that's sited on the most revered public space in America the National Mall the mall is a symbol of American democracy and what's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing it's not an image it's not an artifact it's actually it's a space and it's kind of just defined by line of buildings on either side it's a space where citizens can voice their discontent and show their power it's a place where pivotal moments in American history have taken place and they're inscribed in there forever like the march on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the great speech that Martin Luther King gave there the Vietnam protests the commemoration of all that died in the pandemic of AIDS the March for women's reproductive rights right up until almost the present the mall is the greatest civic stage in this country for descent and it's synonymous with free speech even if you're not sure what it is that you have to say it may just be a place for civic and miseration there is a huge disconnect we believe between the communicative and discursive space of the mall and the museums that line it to either side and that is that those museums are usually passive they have passive relationships between the museum as the presenter and the audience as the receiver of information and so you can see dinosaurs and and and insects and collections of locomotives and and all of that but you're really not involved you're being talked to when Richard Kirsch aaalac took over as director of the Hirshhorn in 2009 he was determined to take advantage of the fact that this museum was sited the most unique place the seat of power in the US and while art and politics are inherently and implicitly together always and all the time there could be some very special relationship that could be forged here in its uniqueness the question is is it possible ultimately for art's to insert itself into the dialogue of national and world affairs and could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy there are over a hundred and eighty embassies in Washington DC there are over five hundred think tanks there should be a way of harnessing all of that intellectual and global energy into and somehow through the museum there should be some kind of brain trust so the Hirshhorn as we began to think about and as we evolved the mission with Richard and his team it's really his lifeblood but beyond exhibiting contemporary art the Hirshhorn will become a public forum a place of discourse for for issues around arts culture politics and policy it would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum it would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference it would have kind of the informality of The Times Square and for this new initiative the Hirshhorn would have to expand or appropriate aside for a temporary deployable structure this is it this is the Hirshhorn so 230 foot diameter concrete donut design in the early 70s by Gordon Bunn shaft it's hulking its silent its cloistered its arrogant it's a design challenge architects love to hate it a one redeeming feature is its lifted up off the ground and it's got this void and it's God an empty core kind of in the spirit and that facade very much corporate and federal style and around that space the ring is actually galleries very very difficult to mount shows in there when the Hirshhorn opened it'll always huxtable the New York Times critic had some choice words neo penitentiary modern a maimed monument and and maimed mall for a maimed collection almost four decades later how would this building expand for a new progressive program where would it go can't go in the mall there is no space there it can't go in the courtyard it's already taken up by landscape and by sculptures oh there's always the hole but how could it take the space of that hole and not be buried in it and invisibly how could it become iconic and what language would it take the Hirshhorn sits among the most monumental institutions most are neoclassical heavy and opaque made of stone or concrete and question is well if one inhabits that space what is the material of them all it has to be different from the buildings there it has to be something entirely different it has to be air in our imagination it has to be light it has to be ephemeral it has to be formless and it has to be free so this is the big idea it's a giant air bag the expansion takes the shape of its container and it loses out wherever can the top and sides but more poetically we like to think of the structure as inhaling the Democratic air of the mall bringing it into itself the before and the after it was dubbed the bubble by the press that was the lounge it's basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction the membrane is translucent it's made of silicone coated glass fiber and it's inflated twice a year for one month at a time this is the view from the inside so you might have been wondering how in the world did we get this approved by the federal government I mean it was it had to be approved by actually two agencies and and it was and one is there to preserve the dignity and sanctity of them all I blush whenever I show this it is yours to interpret but one thing I could say is that it's a combination of iconoclasm and adoration there was also some creative interpretation involved the Congressional Buildings Act of 1910 limits the height of buildings in DC to 130 feet except for spires towers domes and minarets there's pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state and the bubble is 153 feet that's the Pantheon next to it it's about 1.2 million cubic feet of compressed air and so we argued it on the merits of being a dome so there it is very stately among all these stately buildings in the mall and while this Hirshhorn is not landmarked it's very very historically sensitive and so we couldn't really touch its services we couldn't leave any traces behind so we strained it from the edges and we held it by cables it's a study of some bondage techniques which are actually very very important because it's hit by wind all the time there's one permanent steel ring at the top but it can't be seen from any vantage point on them all there are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit it glows from within it's translucent but it can't be more lit than the Capitol or some of the monuments so it's down the hierarchy on lighting so it comes to the side twice a year it's taken off the delivery truck its hoisted and then it's inflated with this low pressure air and then it's restrained with the cables and then it's ballasted with water at the very bottom this is a converse strange moment we were asked by the the bureaucracy at the mall how much time would it take to install and we said well the first direction would take one week the very first and they really connected with that idea and and then it was really easy all the way through but so we didn't really have that many hurdles I have to say with the with the government and all the authorities but some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones this is the warp and weft this is a point cloud there are extreme pressures this is a very very unusual building in that there's no gravity load but there's load in every direction and I'm just gonna zip through these slides and this is the space in action so flexible interior for discussions just like this but in the round luminous and reconfigurable could be used for anything for performances films for installations and the very first program will be one of cultural dialogue and diplomacy organized in partnership with the Council on Foreign Relations form and content are together here the bubble is an ante monument the ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity art and politics occupy an ambiguous site outside the museum walls but inside of the museum's core blending its with the Democratic era of the mall and the bubble will inflate hopefully for the first time at the end of 2013 thank you

**Transcript**:
we conventionally divided space into private and public realms and we know these legal distinctions very well because we become experts at protecting our private property and private space but we're less attuned to the nuances of the public what translates generic public space into qualitative space and this is something that our studio has been working on for the past decade and we're doing this through some case studies a large chunk of our work has been put into transforming this neglected industrial ruin into a viable post-industrial space that looks forward and backwards at the same time and another huge chunk of our work has gone into making relevant a site that's grown out of sync with its time we've been working on democratizing Lincoln Center for a public that doesn't usually have 300 dollars to spend on an opera ticket so we've been eating drinking thinking living public space for quite a long time and it's taught us really one thing and that is to truly make a good public space you have to erase the distinctions between architecture urbanism landscape media design and so on it really goes beyond distinction now we are moving on to Washington DC and we're working on another transformation and that is for the existing Hirshhorn Museum that's sited on the most revered public space in America the National Mall the mall is a symbol of American democracy and what's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing it's not an image it's not an artifact it's actually it's a space and it's kind of just defined by line of buildings on either side it's a space where citizens can voice their discontent and show their power it's a place where pivotal moments in American history have taken place and they're inscribed in there forever like the march on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the great speech that Martin Luther King gave there the Vietnam protests the commemoration of all that died in the pandemic of AIDS the March for women's reproductive rights right up until almost the present the mall is the greatest civic stage in this country for descent and it's synonymous with free speech even if you're not sure what it is that you have to say it may just be a place for civic and miseration there is a huge disconnect we believe between the communicative and discursive space of the mall and the museums that line it to either side and that is that those museums are usually passive they have passive relationships between the museum as the presenter and the audience as the receiver of information and so you can see dinosaurs and and and insects and collections of locomotives and and all of that but you're really not involved you're being talked to when Richard Kirsch aaalac took over as director of the Hirshhorn in 2009 he was determined to take advantage of the fact that this museum was sited the most unique place the seat of power in the US and while art and politics are inherently and implicitly together always and all the time there could be some very special relationship that could be forged here in its uniqueness the question is is it possible ultimately for art's to insert itself into the dialogue of national and world affairs and could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy there are over a hundred and eighty embassies in Washington DC there are over five hundred think tanks there should be a way of harnessing all of that intellectual and global energy into and somehow through the museum there should be some kind of brain trust so the Hirshhorn as we began to think about and as we evolved the mission with Richard and his team it's really his lifeblood but beyond exhibiting contemporary art the Hirshhorn will become a public forum a place of discourse for for issues around arts culture politics and policy it would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum it would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference it would have kind of the informality of The Times Square and for this new initiative the Hirshhorn would have to expand or appropriate aside for a temporary deployable structure this is it this is the Hirshhorn so 230 foot diameter concrete donut design in the early 70s by Gordon Bunn shaft it's hulking its silent its cloistered its arrogant it's a design challenge architects love to hate it a one redeeming feature is its lifted up off the ground and it's got this void and it's God an empty core kind of in the spirit and that facade very much corporate and federal style and around that space the ring is actually galleries very very difficult to mount shows in there when the Hirshhorn opened it'll always huxtable the New York Times critic had some choice words neo penitentiary modern a maimed monument and and maimed mall for a maimed collection almost four decades later how would this building expand for a new progressive program where would it go can't go in the mall there is no space there it can't go in the courtyard it's already taken up by landscape and by sculptures oh there's always the hole but how could it take the space of that hole and not be buried in it and invisibly how could it become iconic and what language would it take the Hirshhorn sits among the most monumental institutions most are neoclassical heavy and opaque made of stone or concrete and question is well if one inhabits that space what is the material of them all it has to be different from the buildings there it has to be something entirely different it has to be air in our imagination it has to be light it has to be ephemeral it has to be formless and it has to be free so this is the big idea it's a giant air bag the expansion takes the shape of its container and it loses out wherever can the top and sides but more poetically we like to think of the structure as inhaling the Democratic air of the mall bringing it into itself the before and the after it was dubbed the bubble by the press that was the lounge it's basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction the membrane is translucent it's made of silicone coated glass fiber and it's inflated twice a year for one month at a time this is the view from the inside so you might have been wondering how in the world did we get this approved by the federal government I mean it was it had to be approved by actually two agencies and and it was and one is there to preserve the dignity and sanctity of them all I blush whenever I show this it is yours to interpret but one thing I could say is that it's a combination of iconoclasm and adoration there was also some creative interpretation involved the Congressional Buildings Act of 1910 limits the height of buildings in DC to 130 feet except for spires towers domes and minarets there's pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state and the bubble is 153 feet that's the Pantheon next to it it's about 1.2 million cubic feet of compressed air and so we argued it on the merits of being a dome so there it is very stately among all these stately buildings in the mall and while this Hirshhorn is not landmarked it's very very historically sensitive and so we couldn't really touch its services we couldn't leave any traces behind so we strained it from the edges and we held it by cables it's a study of some bondage techniques which are actually very very important because it's hit by wind all the time there's one permanent steel ring at the top but it can't be seen from any vantage point on them all there are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit it glows from within it's translucent but it can't be more lit than the Capitol or some of the monuments so it's down the hierarchy on lighting so it comes to the side twice a year it's taken off the delivery truck its hoisted and then it's inflated with this low pressure air and then it's restrained with the cables and then it's ballasted with water at the very bottom this is a converse strange moment we were asked by the the bureaucracy at the mall how much time would it take to install and we said well the first direction would take one week the very first and they really connected with that idea and and then it was really easy all the way through but so we didn't really have that many hurdles I have to say with the with the government and all the authorities but some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones this is the warp and weft this is a point cloud there are extreme pressures this is a very very unusual building in that there's no gravity load but there's load in every direction and I'm just gonna zip through these slides and this is the space in action so flexible interior for discussions just like this but in the round luminous and reconfigurable could be used for anything for performances films for installations and the very first program will be one of cultural dialogue and diplomacy organized in partnership with the Council on Foreign Relations form and content are together here the bubble is an ante monument the ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity art and politics occupy an ambiguous site outside the museum walls but inside of the museum's core blending its with the Democratic era of the mall and the bubble will inflate hopefully for the first time at the end of 2013 thank you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the initial reception of the Hirshhorn Museum when it was first opened. The closest generated MCQ that touches on the topic of the Hirshhorn Museum's design and reception is Question 4, which asks about the design concept for the Hirshhorn's expansion.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ that indirectly relates to the ground truth MCQ is Question 2, which asks about the museum that is the subject of the transcript's discussion about transformation and expansion. This question does not directly address the initial reception of the Hirshhorn Museum but does provide some context about the museum's transformation.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 7, which asks about the Hirshhorn's relationship to the National Mall. This question does not directly address the initial reception of the Hirshhorn Museum but does provide some context about the museum's location and significance.

However, it's worth noting that the transcript does mention the initial reception of the Hirshhorn Museum, stating that when the Hirshhorn opened, it was described by the New York Times critic as "neo-penitentiary modern, a maimed monument, and a maimed mall for a maimed collection." This information is not directly addressed in any of the generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
well when I was asked to do this TED talk I really chuckled because you see my father's name was Ted and much of my life especially my musical life is really a talk that I'm still having with him were at the part of me that he continues to be now Ted was a New Yorker and all-around theatre guy and he was a self-taught illustrator and musician he didn't read a note and he was profoundly hearing-impaired yet he was my greatest teacher because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids his understanding of music was profound and for him it wasn't so much the way the music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you and he did a painting of this experience which he called in the realm of music now Ted entered this realm every day by improvising you know sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this but he was tough when it came to music he said there are only two things that matter in music what and how and the thing about classical music that what and how it's inexhaustible that was his passion for the music both my parents really loved it they didn't know all that much about it but they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them and I think inspired by that memory it's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as I can to sort of pass it on through whatever it means and how people get this music how it comes into their lives really fascinates me one day in New York I was on the street and I saw some kids playing baseball between Stoops and cars and fire hydrants and a tough slouchy kid got up to bat and he took a swing and really connected and he watched the ball fly for a second and then he went and he ran around the bases and I thought go figure how did this piece of 18th century Austrian aristocratic entertainment turn in to the victory crow of this New York kid how was that passed on how did he get to hear Mozart well when it comes to classical music there's an awful lot to pass on much more than Mozart Beethoven or Tchaikovsky because classical music is an unbroken living tradition that goes back over a thousand years and every one of those years has had something unique and powerful to say to us about what it's like to be alive and the raw material of it of course is just the music of everyday life it's all the anthems and dance crazes and ballads and marches but what classical music does is to distill all of these musics down to condense them to their absolute essence and from that essence create an new language a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly about who we really are it's a language that's still evolving now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of like concertos and symphonies but even the most ambitious masterpiece can have as its central mission to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment like this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto it's so simple so evocative so many emotions seem to be inside of it yeah of course like all music it's essentially not about anything it's just a design of pitches in silence and time and two pitches the notes as you know are just vibrations their locations in the spectrum of sound or whether we call them 440 per second a or 3729 b-flat trust me that's right all right there just phenomenon but the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena is complex and emotional and not totally understood and the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries as have our preferences for them so for example in the 11th century people liked pieces that ended like this and in the 17th century it was more like this and in the 21st century now your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord even though a while back that would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room and the reason you like it is because you've inherited whether you knew it or not centuries worth of changes in musical theory practice and fashion and in classical music we can follow these changes very very accurately because of the music's powerful silent partner the way it's been passed on notation now the impulse to notate or more exactly I should say encode music has been with us for a very long time in 200 BC a man named Siculus wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in a notational system of the Greeks at a thousand years later this impulse to notate took an entirely different form and you can see how this happened in these excerpts from the Christmas Mass who we're not assessed no bees for us is born in the 10th century little squiggles were used just to indicate the general shape of the tune and in the 12th century a line was drawn like a musical horizon line to better pinpoint the pitches location and then in the 13th century more lines and new shapes of notes locked in the concept of the tune exactly and that led to the kind of notation we have today well notation not only passed the music on notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely because it enabled the musicians to imagine music out of much vaster scale now inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded saved considered prioritized made into intricate designs and from this moment classical music became what it most essentially is a dialogue between the two powerful size of our nature instinct and intelligence and there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition now improviser senses and plays the next cool move but a composer is considering all possible moves testing them out prioritizing them out until he sees how they can form a a powerful and coherent design of ultimate and enduring coolness now some of the greatest composers like ba were combinations of these two things Bach was like a great improviser with the mind of a chess master Mozart was the same way but every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason instincts and intelligence and every musical era had different priorities of these things different things to pass on different what's and how's so in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big what was to praise God and by the 1400s music was being written that tried to mirror God's mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky the howl was a style called polyphony music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planet seemed to move in ptolemies geocentric universe this was truly the music of the spheres this is the kind of music that Leonardo da Vinci would have known and perhaps it's tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity meant that something new had to happen a radical new move which in 1600 is what did happen this of course was the birth of opera and its development put music on a radical new course the what now was not to mirror the mind of God but to follow the emotional turbulence of man and the how was harmony stacking up the pitches to form chords and the chords it turned out were capable of representing an incredible varieties of emotions and the basic chords were the ones we still have with us the Triads either the major one which we think is happy or the minor one which we perceive as sad but what's the actual difference between these two chords it's just these two notes in the middle right it's either a natural at 659 vibrations per second or E flat at 622 so the big difference between human happiness and sadness 37 freakin vibrations so you can see in a system like this there was enormous subtle potential of representing human emotions and in fact as man began to understand more his complex and ambivalent nature harmony grew more complex to reflect it turned out he was capable of expressing emotions beyond the ability of words now with all this possibility music classical music really took off it's the time in which the big forms began to arise and the effects of technology began to be felt also because printing put music the scores the code books of music into the hands of performers everywhere and new and improved instruments made the age of the virtuoso possible this is when those big forms arose the symphonies the sonatas the concertos and these big architectures of time composers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime a piece like Beethoven's fifth basically witnessing how it was possible for him to go from sorrow and anger over the course of a half an hour step by exacting step of his route to the moment when he could make it across to joy and it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues like dripping ones of culture and such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality but whatever direction the music took one thing until recently was always the same and that was when the musicians stop playing the music stopped now this moment so fascinates me I find it such a profound one what happens when the music stops where does it go what's left what sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude and how might that changed their lives to me this is the intimate personal side of music it's the passing on part it's the why part of it and to me that's the most essential of all mostly it's been a person-to-person thing a teacher-student performer audience thing and then around 1880 came this new technology that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally created a new miraculous way of passing things on albeit an impersonal one people could now hear music all the time even though it wasn't necessary for them to play an instrument read music or even go to concerts and technology democratized music by making everything available it's spearheaded a cultural revolution in which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing and technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes using computers and synthesizers to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity beyond the means of performers and audiences at the same time technology by taking over the role that notation had always played shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side the culture in which we live now is awash with music of improvisation that's been sliced diced layered and godknows distributed and sold what's the long-term effect of this on us or our music nobody knows the question remains what happens when the music stops what sticks with people now that we have unlimited access to music what does stick with us well let me show you a story of what I mean by really sticking with us I was visiting a cousin of mine in an old-age home and I spied a very shaky old man making his way across the room on a walker he came over to a piano that was there and he bounced himself and began playing something like this and he said something like me a boy symphony they Beethoven and I suddenly got it my said friend by any chance are you trying to play this and he said yes yes I was a little boy but at the simply Isaac Stern that the concerto I heard it and I thought like God how much must this music mean to this man that he would get himself out of his bed across the room to recover the memory of this music that after everything else in his life is sloughing away still means so much to him well that's why I take every performance so seriously why it matters to me so much I never know who might be there who might be absorbing it and what will happen to it in their life but now I'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possible of sharing this music that's what drives my interest in projects like the TV series keeping score with the San Francisco Symphony that looks at the backstories of music and working with the young musicians at the New World Symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education and of course the New World Symphony led to the YouTube Symphony and projects on the internet that reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world and the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype there's a role here for so many people teachers parents performers to be explorers together sure the big events attract a lot of attention but what really matters is what goes on every single day we need your perspectives your curiosity your voices that it excites me now to meet people who are hikers chefs code writers taxi drivers people I never would have guessed who loved the music and we're passing it on you don't need to worry about knowing anything if you're curious if you have a capacity for wonder if you're alive you know all that you need to know you can start anywhere ramble a bit follow traces get lost be surprised amused inspired all that what all that how is out there waiting for you to discover its why to dive in and pass it on thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] when I was uh growing up in Montana I uh I had two dreams I wanted to be a paleontologist a dinosaur paleontologist and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur and so that's what I've been striving for all of my life I was very fortunate early in my career I was fortunate in finding things I wasn't very good at reading things in fact I don't read much of anything I am extremely dyslexic and so reading is the hardest thing I do but instead I I go out and I find things and I just pick things up I basically you know practice just for finding money on the street and I wander about the hills and and I have found a few things and I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemosphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests and the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of Bones and it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize the dinosaurs weren't the big stupid green reptiles of that people had thought for so many years and people were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special and so at that time I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues we were able to actually say that dinosaurs based on the evidence we had the dinosaurs built nests and and lived in colonies and cared for their young brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds so it was it was it was pretty interesting stuff I have gone on to find more things and and discover that that dinosaurs really were very social we have found um a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults the appearance of them would have been different which it is in all social animals in social groups of animals the juveniles always look different than the adults the adults can recognize the juveniles the juveniles can recognize the adults and so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looked like and they didn't just all Chase Jeeps around but it is that social thing that that I guess attracted Michael kryon in his book he talked about the social animals and then Steven Spielberg of course depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures the theme of this story is building a dinosaur and so we come to that part of Jurassic Park this is you know Michael kryon really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life you all know the story right I mean I assume everyone here has seen Jurassic Park if you want to make a dinosaur you go out you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap otherwise known as Amber that has some blood sucking insects in it good ones and you get your insect you drill into it and you suck out some DNA because obviously all insects that suck blood in those days suck dinosaur DNA out and and you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it and I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich or something like that and then you wait and lo and behold out pops a little baby dinosaur and everybody's happy about that and they're happy over and over again they keep doing it they just keep making these things and and then they then then and then you know then the dinosaurs being social act out their socialness and they get together and they conspire and of course that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around so I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of Amber and it had an insect in it and you drilled into it and you got something out of that insect and you cloned it and you did it over and over and over again you'd have a room full of mosquitoes right or maybe and probably a whole bunch of trees as well now if you want dinosaur DNA I say go to the dinosaur so that's what we've done back in 1993 when the movie came out we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur and we chose the dinosaur on the left a Tyrannosaurus Rex which was a very nice specimen and one of my former doctoral students Dr Mary schwitzer actually had the background to do this sort of thing and so she looked into the bone of this T-Rex one of the thigh bones and she actually found some very interesting structures in there they found these red circular looking objects and they looked for all the world like red blood cells and they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone and so she thought well what the heck so she sampled some material out of it and it wasn't DNA she didn't find DNA but she did find he which is the biological Foundation of hemoglobin and that was really cool that was interesting I that was here we have 65 milliony old he well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it so a few years went by and then we started the hell Creek project and the hell Creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them and out in eastern Montana there's a a lot of space a lot of bad lands and not very many people and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff and we did find a lot of stuff we found a lot of Tyrannosaurs but we found one special Tyrannosaur and we called it B rex and B rex was found under a th000 cubic yards of rock it wasn't a very complete T-Rex and it wasn't a very big T-Rex but it was a very special BX I and my colleagues cut into it and we were able to determine by looking at lines of Arrested growth some lines in it that b rex had died at the age of 16 we don't really know how long dinosaurs Liv because we haven't found the oldest one yet but this one died at the age of 16 we gave samples to Mary schwitzer and she was actually able to determine that b rex was a female based on medular tissue found on the inside of the bone medular tissue is the calcium buildup the calcium storage basically when an animal is pregnant when a bird is pregnant so here was a character that linked birds and dinosaurs but Mary went further she took the bone and she dumped it into acid now we all know that bones are fossilized and so if you dump it into acid there shouldn't be anything left but there was something left there were blood vessels left there were flexible clear blood vessels and so here was the first soft tissues from a dinosaur was extraordinary but she also found osteocytes which are the cells that laid down the bones and try and try we could not find DNA but she did find find evidence of proteins but we thought maybe well we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18 wheeler trailer actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples and we did we got better material uh the cells looked better the vessels looked better found the protein collagen I mean it it was wonderful stuff but it's not dinosaur DNA so we have discovered that dinosaur DNA all DNA just breaks down too fast we're just not going to be able to do what they did in Jurassic Park we're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur but birds are dinosaurs birds are living dinosaurs we actually classify them as dinosaurs We Now call them non-avian dinosaurs and Aven dinosaurs so the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct Aven dinosaurs are our modern birds so we don't have to make a dinosaur so I already have [Music] them I know you're you're you're as bad as the sixth graders right the sixth graders look at it and they say no you can call it you can call it a dinosaur but look at the Velociraptor the Velociraptor is cool the chicken is not so this is our problem as you can imagine the chicken is a dinosaur I mean it really is I mean you you can't argue with it because we you know we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way but the sixth graders demand it fix the chicken so so that's what I'm here to tell you about how we're going to fix a chicken so we have a number of of ways that we actually can fix the because Evolution works we actually have some evolutionary tools we'll call them biological modification tools we have selection and we know selection works right I mean we started out with a wolf-like creature and we end up with a malti I mean that's that's that's definitely genetic modification or any of the other funny looking little dogs we also have trans Genesis trans Genesis is really cool too that's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one that's how we you know that's how people made glowfish you take a jean a glow Jean out of a out of a coral or a or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebra fish and they glow and you know that's pretty cool and they obviously make a lot of money off of them and now they're you know they're making glow rabbits and and glow all sorts of things and I guess we could make a glow chicken but I don't think that'll satisfy the six graders either but there's another thing there's what we call adamism activation and adamism activation is basically an atavism is a is an ancestral characteristic now you've you've heard that occasionally children are born with tals and it's because it's a an ancestral characteristic and so there are a number of atavisms that can happen snakes are occasionally born with legs and here's an example this is a chicken with teeth a fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene of teeth for teeth and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in in chickens which now that's a good characteristic we can we can save that one all right we we know we can use that we can make a chicken with teeth that's getting closer that's better than a glowwing chicken a friend of mine a a colleague of mine Dr Hans Larsson at McGill University is actually looking at adisms and he's looking at them by looking at the embryogenesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail he's also interested in the transformation of the arm the hand to the wing he's looking for those genes as well and I said well you know if you can find those I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth graders and so he agreed and so that's what we're looking into if you look at dinosaur hands a velociraptor has that cool looking hand with the claws on it archaeopteris which is a bird a primitive bird still has that very primitive hand but as you can see the pigeon or a chicken or anything else like a bird has kind of a weird looking hand because the hand is a wing but the cool thing is is that if you look in the embryo as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the arch opter hand it has the three fingers the three digits but a gene turns on that actually fuses those together and so what we're looking for is that Gene we want to stop that Gene from turning on fusing those hands together so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand like the archaeopteris and the same goes for the Tails birds have basically rudimentary tails and so we know that in Embry as the animal is developing it actually has a relatively long tail but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail gets rid of it so that's the other Gene we're looking for we want to stop that tail from resorbing so what we're trying to do really is take our chicken modify it and make a chickenosaurus it's a cooler looking chicken I mean but it's just the very Basics so that really is what we're doing and people always say well you know why do that why make this thing what good is it well that's a good question you know actually I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things and quite frankly I think if if uh Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it he could actually advertise an extra piece anyway when Ard Dino chicken hatches it will be obviously the poster child or what you might call the poster chick for technology entertainment and design thank you

out of a out of a coral or a or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebra fish and they glow and you know that's pretty cool and they obviously make a lot of money off of them and now they're you know they're making glow rabbits and and glow all sorts of things and I guess we could make a glow chicken but I don't think that'll satisfy the six graders either but there's another thing there's what we call adamism activation and adamism activation is basically an atavism is a is an ancestral characteristic now you've you've heard that occasionally children are born with tals and it's because it's a an ancestral characteristic and so there are a number of atavisms that can happen snakes are occasionally born with legs and here's an example this is a chicken with teeth a fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene of teeth for teeth and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in in chickens which now that's a good characteristic we can we can save that one all right we we know we can use that we can make a chicken with teeth that's getting closer that's better than a glowwing chicken a friend of mine a a colleague of mine Dr Hans Larsson at McGill University is actually looking at adisms and he's looking at them by looking at the embryogenesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail he's also interested in the transformation of the arm the hand to the wing he's looking for those genes as well and I said well you know if you can find those I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth graders and so he agreed and so that's what we're looking into if you look at dinosaur hands a velociraptor has that cool looking hand with the claws on it archaeopteris which is a bird a primitive bird still has that very primitive hand but as you can see the pigeon or a chicken or anything else like a bird has kind of a weird looking hand because the hand is a wing but the cool thing is is that if you look in the embryo as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the arch opter hand it has the three fingers the three digits but a gene turns on that actually fuses those together and so what we're looking for is that Gene we want to stop that Gene from turning on fusing those hands together so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand like the archaeopteris and the same goes for the Tails birds have basically rudimentary tails and so we know that in Embry as the animal is developing it actually has a relatively long tail but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail gets rid of it so that's the other Gene we're looking for we want to stop that tail from resorbing so what we're trying to do really is take our chicken modify it and make a chickenosaurus it's a cooler looking chicken I mean but it's just the very Basics so that really is what we're doing and people always say well you know why do that why make this thing what good is it well that's a good question you know actually I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things and quite frankly I think if if uh Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it he could actually advertise an extra piece anyway when Ard Dino chicken hatches it will be obviously the poster child or what you might call the poster chick for technology entertainment and design thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] when I was uh growing up in Montana I uh I had two dreams I wanted to be a paleontologist a dinosaur paleontologist and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur and so that's what I've been striving for all of my life I was very fortunate early in my career I was fortunate in finding things I wasn't very good at reading things in fact I don't read much of anything I am extremely dyslexic and so reading is the hardest thing I do but instead I I go out and I find things and I just pick things up I basically you know practice just for finding money on the street and I wander about the hills and and I have found a few things and I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemosphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests and the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of Bones and it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize the dinosaurs weren't the big stupid green reptiles of that people had thought for so many years and people were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special and so at that time I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues we were able to actually say that dinosaurs based on the evidence we had the dinosaurs built nests and and lived in colonies and cared for their young brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds so it was it was it was pretty interesting stuff I have gone on to find more things and and discover that that dinosaurs really were very social we have found um a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults the appearance of them would have been different which it is in all social animals in social groups of animals the juveniles always look different than the adults the adults can recognize the juveniles the juveniles can recognize the adults and so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looked like and they didn't just all Chase Jeeps around but it is that social thing that that I guess attracted Michael kryon in his book he talked about the social animals and then Steven Spielberg of course depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures the theme of this story is building a dinosaur and so we come to that part of Jurassic Park this is you know Michael kryon really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life you all know the story right I mean I assume everyone here has seen Jurassic Park if you want to make a dinosaur you go out you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap otherwise known as Amber that has some blood sucking insects in it good ones and you get your insect you drill into it and you suck out some DNA because obviously all insects that suck blood in those days suck dinosaur DNA out and and you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it and I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich or something like that and then you wait and lo and behold out pops a little baby dinosaur and everybody's happy about that and they're happy over and over again they keep doing it they just keep making these things and and then they then then and then you know then the dinosaurs being social act out their socialness and they get together and they conspire and of course that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around so I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of Amber and it had an insect in it and you drilled into it and you got something out of that insect and you cloned it and you did it over and over and over again you'd have a room full of mosquitoes right or maybe and probably a whole bunch of trees as well now if you want dinosaur DNA I say go to the dinosaur so that's what we've done back in 1993 when the movie came out we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur and we chose the dinosaur on the left a Tyrannosaurus Rex which was a very nice specimen and one of my former doctoral students Dr Mary schwitzer actually had the background to do this sort of thing and so she looked into the bone of this T-Rex one of the thigh bones and she actually found some very interesting structures in there they found these red circular looking objects and they looked for all the world like red blood cells and they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone and so she thought well what the heck so she sampled some material out of it and it wasn't DNA she didn't find DNA but she did find he which is the biological Foundation of hemoglobin and that was really cool that was interesting I that was here we have 65 milliony old he well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it so a few years went by and then we started the hell Creek project and the hell Creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them and out in eastern Montana there's a a lot of space a lot of bad lands and not very many people and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff and we did find a lot of stuff we found a lot of Tyrannosaurs but we found one special Tyrannosaur and we called it B rex and B rex was found under a th000 cubic yards of rock it wasn't a very complete T-Rex and it wasn't a very big T-Rex but it was a very special BX I and my colleagues cut into it and we were able to determine by looking at lines of Arrested growth some lines in it that b rex had died at the age of 16 we don't really know how long dinosaurs Liv because we haven't found the oldest one yet but this one died at the age of 16 we gave samples to Mary schwitzer and she was actually able to determine that b rex was a female based on medular tissue found on the inside of the bone medular tissue is the calcium buildup the calcium storage basically when an animal is pregnant when a bird is pregnant so here was a character that linked birds and dinosaurs but Mary went further she took the bone and she dumped it into acid now we all know that bones are fossilized and so if you dump it into acid there shouldn't be anything left but there was something left there were blood vessels left there were flexible clear blood vessels and so here was the first soft tissues from a dinosaur was extraordinary but she also found osteocytes which are the cells that laid down the bones and try and try we could not find DNA but she did find find evidence of proteins but we thought maybe well we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18 wheeler trailer actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples and we did we got better material uh the cells looked better the vessels looked better found the protein collagen I mean it it was wonderful stuff but it's not dinosaur DNA so we have discovered that dinosaur DNA all DNA just breaks down too fast we're just not going to be able to do what they did in Jurassic Park we're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur but birds are dinosaurs birds are living dinosaurs we actually classify them as dinosaurs We Now call them non-avian dinosaurs and Aven dinosaurs so the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct Aven dinosaurs are our modern birds so we don't have to make a dinosaur so I already have [Music] them I know you're you're you're as bad as the sixth graders right the sixth graders look at it and they say no you can call it you can call it a dinosaur but look at the Velociraptor the Velociraptor is cool the chicken is not so this is our problem as you can imagine the chicken is a dinosaur I mean it really is I mean you you can't argue with it because we you know we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way but the sixth graders demand it fix the chicken so so that's what I'm here to tell you about how we're going to fix a chicken so we have a number of of ways that we actually can fix the because Evolution works we actually have some evolutionary tools we'll call them biological modification tools we have selection and we know selection works right I mean we started out with a wolf-like creature and we end up with a malti I mean that's that's that's definitely genetic modification or any of the other funny looking little dogs we also have trans Genesis trans Genesis is really cool too that's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one that's how we you know that's how people made glowfish you take a jean a glow Jean

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the major theory confirmed by Jack and his team as a result of their findings, which is that dinosaurs are social, build nests, and care for their young.

The most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but it is related to the speaker's research and findings. I would suggest Question 1 is not the closest match, but rather some of the information in the transcript that generated question 1 also generated other questions and the closest match is:

 Question 6: What was the purpose of the Hell Creek project? Options: A. To extract dinosaur DNA, B. To find new dinosaur fossils, C. To study the behavior of modern birds, D. To analyze the fossil record Correct Option: B

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ. A better match would be a generated question like: 

What did the speaker and his team discover about the behavior of dinosaurs? Options: A. Dinosaurs are social, build nests, and care for their young, B. Dinosaurs are mainly big and green, C. Dinosaurs are exclusively reptilian, but they are both cold and warm blooded, D. Dinosaurs went extinct millions of years before we first believed Correct Option: A.

Unfortunately, this question was not generated, so I will choose the closest match from the given options.

Since there is no direct match, I will choose the closest match based on the content and intent of the question.

well you know if you can find those I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth graders and so he agreed and so that's what we're looking into if you look at dinosaur hands a velociraptor has that cool looking hand with the claws on it archaeopteris which is a bird a primitive bird still has that very primitive hand but as you can see the pigeon or a chicken or anything else like a bird has kind of a weird looking hand because the hand is a wing but the cool thing is is that if you look in the embryo as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the arch opter hand it has the three fingers the three digits but a gene turns on that actually fuses those together and so what we're looking for is that Gene we want to stop that Gene from turning on fusing those hands together so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand like the archaeopteris and the same goes for the Tails birds have basically rudimentary tails and so we know that in Embry as the animal is developing it actually has a relatively long tail but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail gets rid of it so that's the other Gene we're looking for we want to stop that tail from resorbing so what we're trying to do really is take our chicken modify it and make a chickenosaurus it's a cooler looking chicken I mean but it's just the very Basics so that really is what we're doing and people always say well you know why do that why make this thing what good is it well that's a good question you know actually I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things and quite frankly I think if if uh Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it he could actually advertise an extra piece anyway when Ard Dino chicken hatches it will be obviously the poster child or what you might call the poster chick for technology entertainment and design thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] when I was uh growing up in Montana I uh I had two dreams I wanted to be a paleontologist a dinosaur paleontologist and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur and so that's what I've been striving for all of my life I was very fortunate early in my career I was fortunate in finding things I wasn't very good at reading things in fact I don't read much of anything I am extremely dyslexic and so reading is the hardest thing I do but instead I I go out and I find things and I just pick things up I basically you know practice just for finding money on the street and I wander about the hills and and I have found a few things and I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemosphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests and the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of Bones and it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize the dinosaurs weren't the big stupid green reptiles of that people had thought for so many years and people were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special and so at that time I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues we were able to actually say that dinosaurs based on the evidence we had the dinosaurs built nests and and lived in colonies and cared for their young brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds so it was it was it was pretty interesting stuff I have gone on to find more things and and discover that that dinosaurs really were very social we have found um a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults the appearance of them would have been different which it is in all social animals in social groups of animals the juveniles always look different than the adults the adults can recognize the juveniles the juveniles can recognize the adults and so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looked like and they didn't just all Chase Jeeps around but it is that social thing that that I guess attracted Michael kryon in his book he talked about the social animals and then Steven Spielberg of course depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures the theme of this story is building a dinosaur and so we come to that part of Jurassic Park this is you know Michael kryon really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life you all know the story right I mean I assume everyone here has seen Jurassic Park if you want to make a dinosaur you go out you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap otherwise known as Amber that has some blood sucking insects in it good ones and you get your insect you drill into it and you suck out some DNA because obviously all insects that suck blood in those days suck dinosaur DNA out and and you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it and I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich or something like that and then you wait and lo and behold out pops a little baby dinosaur and everybody's happy about that and they're happy over and over again they keep doing it they just keep making these things and and then they then then and then you know then the dinosaurs being social act out their socialness and they get together and they conspire and of course that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around so I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of Amber and it had an insect in it and you drilled into it and you got something out of that insect and you cloned it and you did it over and over and over again you'd have a room full of mosquitoes right or maybe and probably a whole bunch of trees as well now if you want dinosaur DNA I say go to the dinosaur so that's what we've done back in 1993 when the movie came out we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur and we chose the dinosaur on the left a Tyrannosaurus Rex which was a very nice specimen and one of my former doctoral students Dr Mary schwitzer actually had the background to do this sort of thing and so she looked into the bone of this T-Rex one of the thigh bones and she actually found some very interesting structures in there they found these red circular looking objects and they looked for all the world like red blood cells and they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone and so she thought well what the heck so she sampled some material out of it and it wasn't DNA she didn't find DNA but she did find he which is the biological Foundation of hemoglobin and that was really cool that was interesting I that was here we have 65 milliony old he well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it so a few years went by and then we started the hell Creek project and the hell Creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them and out in eastern Montana there's a a lot of space a lot of bad lands and not very many people and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff and we did find a lot of stuff we found a lot of Tyrannosaurs but we found one special Tyrannosaur and we called it B rex and B rex was found under a th000 cubic yards of rock it wasn't a very complete T-Rex and it wasn't a very big T-Rex but it was a very special BX I and my colleagues cut into it and we were able to determine by looking at lines of Arrested growth some lines in it that b rex had died at the age of 16 we don't really know how long dinosaurs Liv because we haven't found the oldest one yet but this one died at the age of 16 we gave samples to Mary schwitzer and she was actually able to determine that b rex was a female based on medular tissue found on the inside of the bone medular tissue is the calcium buildup the calcium storage basically when an animal is pregnant when a bird is pregnant so here was a character that linked birds and dinosaurs but Mary went further she took the bone and she dumped it into acid now we all know that bones are fossilized and so if you dump it into acid there shouldn't be anything left but there was something left there were blood vessels left there were flexible clear blood vessels and so here was the first soft tissues from a dinosaur was extraordinary but she also found osteocytes which are the cells that laid down the bones and try and try we could not find DNA but she did find find evidence of proteins but we thought maybe well we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18 wheeler trailer actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples and we did we got better material uh the cells looked better the vessels looked better found the protein collagen I mean it it was wonderful stuff but it's not dinosaur DNA so we have discovered that dinosaur DNA all DNA just breaks down too fast we're just not going to be able to do what they did in Jurassic Park we're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur but birds are dinosaurs birds are living dinosaurs we actually classify them as dinosaurs We Now call them non-avian dinosaurs and Aven dinosaurs so the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct Aven dinosaurs are our modern birds so we don't have to make a dinosaur so I already have [Music] them I know you're you're you're as bad as the sixth graders right the sixth graders look at it and they say no you can call it you can call it a dinosaur but look at the Velociraptor the Velociraptor is cool the chicken is not so this is our problem as you can imagine the chicken is a dinosaur I mean it really is I mean you you can't argue with it because we you know we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way but the sixth graders demand it fix the chicken so so that's what I'm here to tell you about how we're going to fix a chicken so we have a number of of ways that we actually can fix the because Evolution works we actually have some evolutionary tools we'll call them biological modification tools we have selection and we know selection works right I mean we started out with a wolf-like creature and we end up with a malti I mean that's that's that's definitely genetic modification or any of the other funny looking little dogs we also have trans Genesis trans Genesis is really cool too that's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one that's how we you know that's how people made glowfish you take a jean a glow Jean out of a out of a coral or a or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebra fish and they glow and you know that's pretty cool and they obviously make a lot of money off of them and now they're you know they're making glow rabbits and and glow all sorts of things and I guess we could make a glow chicken but I don't think that'll satisfy the six graders either but there's another thing there's what we call adamism activation and adamism activation is basically an atavism is a is an ancestral characteristic now you've you've heard that occasionally children are born with tals and it's because it's a an ancestral characteristic and so there are a number of atavisms that can happen snakes are occasionally born with legs and here's an example this is a chicken with teeth a fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene of teeth for teeth and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in in chickens which now that's a good characteristic we can we can save that one all right we we know we can use that we can make a chicken with teeth that's getting closer that's better than a glowwing chicken a friend of mine a a colleague of mine Dr Hans Larsson at McGill University is actually looking at adisms and he's looking at them by looking at the embryogenesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail he's also interested in the transformation of the arm the hand to the wing he's looking for those genes as well and I said

**Transcript**:
They say that if walls could talk,
each building would have a story to tell, but few would tell so many fascinating
stories in so many different voices as the Hagia Sophia, or holy wisdom. Perched at the crossroads 
of continents and cultures, it has seen massive changes 
from the name of the city where it stands, to its own structure and purpose. And today, the elements
from each era stand ready to tell their tales 
to any visitor who will listen. Even before you arrive at the Hagia Sophia,
the ancient fortifications hint at the strategic importance 
of the surrounding city, founded as Byzantium 
by Greek colonists in 657 BCE. And successfully renamed as 
Augusta Antonia, New Rome and Constantinople as it was conquered, reconquered,
destroyed and rebuilt by various Greek, Persian and 
Roman rulers over the following centuries. And it was within these walls that 
the first Megale Ekklesia, or great church, was built in the fourth century. Though it was soon burned
to the ground in riots, it established the location for
the region's main religious structure for centuries to come. Near the entrance,
the marble stones with reliefs are the last reminders 
of the second church. Built in 415 CE, it was destroyed 
during the Nika Riots of 532 when angry crowds at a chariot race nearly overthrew the emperor, 
Justinian the First. Having barely managed to retain power, he resolved to rebuild the church
on a grander scale, and five years later, the edifice 
you see before you was completed. As you step inside, the stones 
of the foundation and walls murmur tales from their homelands
of Egypt and Syria, while columns taken from the Temple
of Artemis recall a more ancient past. Runic inscriptions carved by the 
Vikings of the emperor's elite guard carry the lore of distant northern lands. But your attention is caught by 
the grand dome, representing the heavens. Reaching over 50 meters high and 
over 30 meters in diameter and ringed by windows around its base, the golden dome appears
suspended from heaven, light reflecting through its interior. Beneath its grandiose symbolism,
the sturdy reinforcing Corinthian columns, brought from Lebanon after 
the original dome was partially destroyed by an earthquake in 558 CE, quietly remind you of its fragility and the engineering skills
such a marvel requires. If a picture is worth a thousand words, the mosaics from the next several 
centuries have the most to say not only about their Biblical themes, but also the Byzantine emperors who commissioned them, often depicted along with Christ. But beneath their loud and clear voices, one hears the haunting echoes of 
the damaged and missing mosaics and icons, desecrated and looted during 
the Latin Occupation in the Fourth Crusade. Within the floor, the tomb inscription
of Enrico Dandolo, the Venetian ruler who 
commanded the campaign, is a stark reminder of those 57 years that Hagia Sophia spent as a Roman Catholic church before returning to its orthodox roots
upon the Byzantine Reconquest. But it would not remain a church for long. Weakened by the Crusades, Constantinople
fell to the Ottomans in 1453 and would be known as Istanbul thereafter. After allowing his soldiers
three days of pillage, Sultan Mehmed the Second 
entered the building. Though heavily damaged, 
its grandeur was not lost on the young sultan who immediately
rededicated it to Allah, proclaiming that it would be
the new imperial mosque. The four minarets built 
over the next century are the most obvious sign of this era, serving as architectural supports 
in addition to their religious purpose. But there are many others. Ornate candle holders relate 
Suleiman's conquest of Hungary, while giant caligraphy discs 
hung from the ceiling remind visitors for the first 
four caliphs who followed Muhammad. Though the building you see today still
looks like a mosque, it is now a museum, a decision made in 1935 by Kemal Ataturk, the modernizing first president of Turkey following the Ottoman Empire's collapse. It was this secularization
that allowed for removal of the carpets hiding 
the marble floor decorations and the plaster covering 
the Christian mosaics. Ongoing restoration work 
has allowed the multiplicity of voices in Hagia Sophia's long history to be heard again after
centuries of silence. But conflict remains. Hidden mosaics cry out from 
beneath Islamic calligraphy, valuable pieces of history that cannot be
uncovered without destroying others. Meanwhile, calls sound from
both Muslim and Christian communities to return the building to 
its former religious purposes. The story of the divine wisdom 
may be far from over, but one can only hope that 
the many voices residing there will be able to tell their part
for years to come.

commanded the campaign, is a stark reminder of those 57 years that Hagia Sophia spent as a Roman Catholic church before returning to its orthodox roots
upon the Byzantine Reconquest. But it would not remain a church for long. Weakened by the Crusades, Constantinople
fell to the Ottomans in 1453 and would be known as Istanbul thereafter. After allowing his soldiers
three days of pillage, Sultan Mehmed the Second 
entered the building. Though heavily damaged, 
its grandeur was not lost on the young sultan who immediately
rededicated it to Allah, proclaiming that it would be
the new imperial mosque. The four minarets built 
over the next century are the most obvious sign of this era, serving as architectural supports 
in addition to their religious purpose. But there are many others. Ornate candle holders relate 
Suleiman's conquest of Hungary, while giant caligraphy discs 
hung from the ceiling remind visitors for the first 
four caliphs who followed Muhammad. Though the building you see today still
looks like a mosque, it is now a museum, a decision made in 1935 by Kemal Ataturk, the modernizing first president of Turkey following the Ottoman Empire's collapse. It was this secularization
that allowed for removal of the carpets hiding 
the marble floor decorations and the plaster covering 
the Christian mosaics. Ongoing restoration work 
has allowed the multiplicity of voices in Hagia Sophia's long history to be heard again after
centuries of silence. But conflict remains. Hidden mosaics cry out from 
beneath Islamic calligraphy, valuable pieces of history that cannot be
uncovered without destroying others. Meanwhile, calls sound from
both Muslim and Christian communities to return the building to 
its former religious purposes. The story of the divine wisdom 
may be far from over, but one can only hope that 
the many voices residing there will be able to tell their part
for years to come.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 1 has some similarities. However, the question intent and options are not identical.

A more suitable approach would be to look for a generated MCQ that tests the same knowledge or concept as the ground truth MCQ. In this case, the ground truth MCQ asks about a statement that is NOT true about the Hagia Sophia.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs have the same question intent or format as the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one that is vaguely related, I would say Question 1 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: 1

However, I would like to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ, and a new generated MCQ should be created to test the same knowledge or concept. 

Here is an example of a new generated MCQ that could match the ground truth MCQ:

Question: Which of the following statements about the Hagia Sophia is NOT true?
Options: A. It was founded as Byzantium by Greek colonists, B. The Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque after Mehmet’s conquest in 1453, C. It was renamed Augusta Antonia, D. The Hagia Sophia was originally built as a synagogue.

This new generated MCQ has the same question intent and format as the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
They say that if walls could talk,
each building would have a story to tell, but few would tell so many fascinating
stories in so many different voices as the Hagia Sophia, or holy wisdom. Perched at the crossroads 
of continents and cultures, it has seen massive changes 
from the name of the city where it stands, to its own structure and purpose. And today, the elements
from each era stand ready to tell their tales 
to any visitor who will listen. Even before you arrive at the Hagia Sophia,
the ancient fortifications hint at the strategic importance 
of the surrounding city, founded as Byzantium 
by Greek colonists in 657 BCE. And successfully renamed as 
Augusta Antonia, New Rome and Constantinople as it was conquered, reconquered,
destroyed and rebuilt by various Greek, Persian and 
Roman rulers over the following centuries. And it was within these walls that 
the first Megale Ekklesia, or great church, was built in the fourth century. Though it was soon burned
to the ground in riots, it established the location for
the region's main religious structure for centuries to come. Near the entrance,
the marble stones with reliefs are the last reminders 
of the second church. Built in 415 CE, it was destroyed 
during the Nika Riots of 532 when angry crowds at a chariot race nearly overthrew the emperor, 
Justinian the First. Having barely managed to retain power, he resolved to rebuild the church
on a grander scale, and five years later, the edifice 
you see before you was completed. As you step inside, the stones 
of the foundation and walls murmur tales from their homelands
of Egypt and Syria, while columns taken from the Temple
of Artemis recall a more ancient past. Runic inscriptions carved by the 
Vikings of the emperor's elite guard carry the lore of distant northern lands. But your attention is caught by 
the grand dome, representing the heavens. Reaching over 50 meters high and 
over 30 meters in diameter and ringed by windows around its base, the golden dome appears
suspended from heaven, light reflecting through its interior. Beneath its grandiose symbolism,
the sturdy reinforcing Corinthian columns, brought from Lebanon after 
the original dome was partially destroyed by an earthquake in 558 CE, quietly remind you of its fragility and the engineering skills
such a marvel requires. If a picture is worth a thousand words, the mosaics from the next several 
centuries have the most to say not only about their Biblical themes, but also the Byzantine emperors who commissioned them, often depicted along with Christ. But beneath their loud and clear voices, one hears the haunting echoes of 
the damaged and missing mosaics and icons, desecrated and looted during 
the Latin Occupation in the Fourth Crusade. Within the floor, the tomb inscription
of Enrico Dandolo, the Venetian ruler who 
commanded the campaign, is a stark reminder of those 57 years that Hagia Sophia spent as a Roman Catholic church before returning to its orthodox roots

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest a closest match.

The ground truth MCQ is about the calligraphic disks hung inside the Hagia Sophia, and the correct option is related to the rightful caliphs or rulers after the death of Muhammad.

Although there isn't a direct match, the closest generated MCQ in terms of content and intent is:

Question 7: What is the significance of the four minarets built over the next century in the Hagia Sophia?

This question is not about the calligraphic disks, but it is related to the architectural features added during the Ottoman era, which is the same period when the calligraphic disks were hung. However, the options do not match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that there is no direct match, but the closest one would be Question 7, with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

To provide a more accurate answer, I would suggest generating new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ. 

However, if you insist on choosing from the existing options, I would say that the closest match is:

 Question 7 (with the caveat that it's not a perfect match)

Please note that this is not an ideal match, and it's recommended to generate new MCQs that more closely align with the ground truth MCQ.

Think about all the things that need to happen for a human settlement to thrive: obtaining food, building shelter, raising children and more. There needs to be a way to divide resources, organize major efforts and distribute labor efficiently. Now imagine having to do this without any sort of planning or higher level communication. Welcome to the ant colony. Ants have some of the most complex social organization in the animal kingdom, living in structured colonies containing different types of members who perform specific roles. But although this may sound similar to some human societies, this organization doesn't arise from any higher level decisions, but is part of a biologically programmed cycle. In many species, all the winged males and winged virgin queens from all the nearby colonies in the population each leave from their different nests and meet at a central place to mate, using pheromones to guide each other to a breeding ground. After mating, the males die off, while females try to establish a new colony. The few that are successful settle down in a suitable spot, lose their wings, and begin laying eggs, selectively fertilizing some using stored sperm they've saved up from mating. Fertilized eggs grow into female workers who care for the queen and her eggs. They will then defend the colony and forage for food, while unfertilized eggs grow into males whose only job is to wait until they are ready to leave the nest and reproduce, beginning the cycle again. So how do worker ants decide what to do and when? Well, they don't really. Although they have no methods of intentional communication, individual ants do interact with one another through touch, sound and chemical signals. These stimuli accomplish many things from serving as an alarm to other ants if one is killed, to signaling when a queen is nearing the end of her reproductive life. But one of the most impressive collective capabilities of an ant colony is to thoroughly and efficiently explore large areas without any predetermined plan. Most species of ants have little or no sense of sight and can only smell things in their vicinity. Combined with their lack of high level coordination, this would seem to make them terrible explorers, but there is an amazingly simple way that ants maximize their searching efficiency; by changing their movement patterns based on individual interactions. When two ants meet, they sense each other by touching antennae. If there are many ants in a small area this will happen more often causing them to respond by moving in more convoluted, random paths in order to search more thoroughly. But in a larger area, with less ants, where such meetings happen less often, they can walk in straight lines to cover more ground. While exploring their environment in this way, an ant may come across any number of things, from threats or enemies, to alternate nesting sites. And some species have another capability known as recruitment. When one of these ants happens to find food, it will return with it, marking its path with a chemical scent. Other ants will then follow this pheromone trail, renewing it each time they manage to find food and return. Once the food in that spot is depleted, the ants stop marking their return. The scent dissipates and ants are no longer attracted to that path. These seemingly crude methods of search and retrieval are, in fact, so useful that they are applied in computer models to obtain optimal solutions from decentralized elements, working randomly and exchanging simple information. This has many theoretical and practical applications, from solving the famous traveling salesman problem, to scheduling computing tasks and optimizing Internet searches, to enabling groups of robots to search a minefield or a burning building collectively, without any central control. But you can observe these fascinatingly simple, yet effective, processes directly through some simple experiments, by allowing ants to enter empty spaces of various sizes and paying attention to their behavior. Ants may not be able to vote, hold meetings or even make any plans, but we humans may still be able to learn something from the way that such simple creatures are able to function so effectively in such complex ways.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is about how ant colonies start. The correct option is "The worker ants produce a new queen," but this seems to be incorrect based on the transcript. According to the transcript, ant colonies start when a female (queen) settles down in a suitable spot, loses her wings, and begins laying eggs after mating.

Considering the generated MCQs, none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 2 is related to the mating process and what happens to the males after mating. It does not directly address how colonies start but is part of the process described in the transcript that leads to the founding of new colonies.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, but Question 2 is part of the relevant process, I would identify Question 2 as the closest match based on the content provided, despite it not being a perfect match.

Think about all the things that need to happen for a human settlement to thrive: obtaining food, building shelter, raising children and more. There needs to be a way to divide resources, organize major efforts and distribute labor efficiently. Now imagine having to do this without any sort of planning or higher level communication. Welcome to the ant colony. Ants have some of the most complex social organization in the animal kingdom, living in structured colonies containing different types of members who perform specific roles. But although this may sound similar to some human societies, this organization doesn't arise from any higher level decisions, but is part of a biologically programmed cycle. In many species, all the winged males and winged virgin queens from all the nearby colonies in the population each leave from their different nests and meet at a central place to mate, using pheromones to guide each other to a breeding ground. After mating, the males die off, while females try to establish a new colony. The few that are successful settle down in a suitable spot, lose their wings, and begin laying eggs, selectively fertilizing some using stored sperm they've saved up from mating. Fertilized eggs grow into female workers who care for the queen and her eggs. They will then defend the colony and forage for food, while unfertilized eggs grow into males whose only job is to wait until they are ready to leave the nest and reproduce, beginning the cycle again. So how do worker ants decide what to do and when? Well, they don't really. Although they have no methods of intentional communication, individual ants do interact with one another through touch, sound and chemical signals. These stimuli accomplish many things from serving as an alarm to other ants if one is killed, to signaling when a queen is nearing the end of her reproductive life. But one of the most impressive collective capabilities of an ant colony is to thoroughly and efficiently explore large areas without any predetermined plan. Most species of ants have little or no sense of sight and can only smell things in their vicinity. Combined with their lack of high level coordination, this would seem to make them terrible explorers, but there is an amazingly simple way that ants maximize their searching efficiency; by changing their movement patterns based on individual interactions. When two ants meet, they sense each other by touching antennae. If there are many ants in a small area this will happen more often causing them to respond by moving in more convoluted, random paths in order to search more thoroughly. But in a larger area, with less ants, where such meetings happen less often, they can walk in straight lines to cover more ground. While exploring their environment in this way, an ant may come across any number of things, from threats or enemies, to alternate nesting sites. And some species have another capability known as recruitment. When one of these ants happens to find food, it will return with it, marking its path with a chemical scent. Other ants will then follow this pheromone trail, renewing it each time they manage to find food and return. Once the food in that spot is depleted, the ants stop marking their return. The scent dissipates and ants are no longer attracted to that path. These seemingly crude methods of search and retrieval are, in fact, so useful that they are applied in computer models to obtain optimal solutions from decentralized elements, working randomly and exchanging simple information. This has many theoretical and practical applications, from solving the famous traveling salesman problem, to scheduling computing tasks and optimizing Internet searches, to enabling groups of robots to search a minefield or a burning building collectively, without any central control. But you can observe these fascinatingly simple, yet effective, processes directly through some simple experiments, by allowing ants to enter empty spaces of various sizes and paying attention to their behavior. Ants may not be able to vote, hold meetings or even make any plans, but we humans may still be able to learn something from the way that such simple creatures are able to function so effectively in such complex ways.

Reviewer: Caroline Cristal You may not realize it, but from the moment you got out of bed today to the point where you sat down to watch this video, you've essentially been swimming. Why? Because air is a fluid just like water. It has waves and eddies. It flows. And when you push air out of the way, it rushes around you into a wake. So why don't we notice it most of the time? We commonly think of air as empty space. But while one cubic centimeter of interstellar space, the volume in the tip of your pinky finger, contains roughly one atom, the same volume of air has about 10 quintillion molecules. If that sounds hard to wrap your head around, it happens to be about the same as the number of insects alive on the planet, all crawling, climbing, and flying over each other in an enormous, tightly packed swarm. When this swarm of molecules runs into things, it exerts a force, pressing against the boundaries of the fluid, like water pressing against the glass of a bottle. This is known as air pressure. And while air is lighter than water, all those molecules still get pretty heavy, with the total air filling a typical school gym, weighing about as much as an adult elephant. So when you walk into a gym, how come you're not immediately crushed by the elephant of air in the room? Well, first of all, because most of it is pressing on the floor and the walls, and the part that is pressing on you is pushed back by the pressure inside you! You see, the air, as well as the water and everything else, that fills our bodies exerts an amount of pressure equal to that of the air outside. Of course, this is no accident. It's precisely what allows us to survive in the normal atmosphere, and what makes it more difficult at high altitudes or deep water. And we normally don't feel the air pressing on us because it's generally uniform. So even though different amounts of air molecules are hitting you at different times, the swarm is so thick that all those little differences average out. What happens when air pressure isn't uniform? This means that the molecules are pushing harder in one region of air than another, driving the air flow from the higher pressure region to the lower. We feel this flow directly as wind, and the pressure systems that meteorologists are always going on about are responsible for other weather changes, from the mundane to the catastrophic. But differences in air pressure do more than just let us complain about the weather; they're the very reason we're alive. We breathe by lowering the pressure in our lungs, allowing air to rush in. So the next time you take a deep breath, think of the unfathomable number of air molecules you're commanding to move. We look up at the night sky to ponder the infinity of space, but unless you're watching this video from that deep space, there are more air molecules in and around your body than there are grains of sand in all the world's beaches and deserts, stars in the visible universe, or both of those numbers combined. The vastness of the universe is right in front of you and inside you.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I identified the most similar generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about what happens to a balloon filled on Earth when it is brought to the moon. The correct answer is that it expands due to the lower air pressure on the moon.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 6: What happens when air pressure is not uniform? Options: A. The air molecules move slower, B. The air molecules move faster, C. The air flows from the higher pressure region to the lower, D. The air pressure remains the same Correct Option: C

Although this question does not directly ask about a balloon on the moon, it relates to the concept of air pressure differences and their effects. The correct option, C, explains that air flows from higher pressure regions to lower pressure regions, which is the underlying principle behind the expansion of a balloon in a lower-pressure environment.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 6.

But while one cubic centimeter of interstellar space, the volume in the tip of your pinky finger, contains roughly one atom, the same volume of air has about 10 quintillion molecules. If that sounds hard to wrap your head around, it happens to be about the same as the number of insects alive on the planet, all crawling, climbing, and flying over each other in an enormous, tightly packed swarm. When this swarm of molecules runs into things, it exerts a force, pressing against the boundaries of the fluid, like water pressing against the glass of a bottle. This is known as air pressure. And while air is lighter than water, all those molecules still get pretty heavy, with the total air filling a typical school gym, weighing about as much as an adult elephant. So when you walk into a gym, how come you're not immediately crushed by the elephant of air in the room? Well, first of all, because most of it is pressing on the floor and the walls, and the part that is pressing on you is pushed back by the pressure inside you! You see, the air, as well as the water and everything else, that fills our bodies exerts an amount of pressure equal to that of the air outside. Of course, this is no accident. It's precisely what allows us to survive in the normal atmosphere, and what makes it more difficult at high altitudes or deep water. And we normally don't feel the air pressing on us because it's generally uniform. So even though different amounts of air molecules are hitting you at different times, the swarm is so thick that all those little differences average out. What happens when air pressure isn't uniform? This means that the molecules are pushing harder in one region of air than another, driving the air flow from the higher pressure region to the lower. We feel this flow directly as wind, and the pressure systems that meteorologists are always going on about are responsible for other weather changes, from the mundane to the catastrophic. But differences in air pressure do more than just let us complain about the weather; they're the very reason we're alive. We breathe by lowering the pressure in our lungs, allowing air to rush in. So the next time you take a deep breath, think of the unfathomable number of air molecules you're commanding to move. We look up at the night sky to ponder the infinity of space, but unless you're watching this video from that deep space, there are more air molecules in and around your body than there are grains of sand in all the world's beaches and deserts, stars in the visible universe, or both of those numbers combined. The vastness of the universe is right in front of you and inside you.

**Transcript**:
Living with her family high
above the ground in the northern tropical forests
of Colombia, you will find Shakira, a cotton-top tamarin with a penchant
for conversation. Say, "Hola!" Though you may not realize it, this one pound monkey communicates in a highly sophisticated language of 38 distinct calls based on variations of chirps
and whistles. The response she just gave is known as a "B chirp", a call often directed at humans. To appreciate the complexities
of Shakira’s language, let's learn a few chirps and whistles, then examine how their combinations form grammatically structured sequences. The chirp Shakira used to greet us comes from a class of calls known as single frequency modulated syllables. This class is made up of short
duration calls, or chirps, and long duration calls,
like screams and squeals. Researchers have determined that there
are eight different types of chirps categorized by stem upsweep, duration,
peak frequency, and frequency change. In addition, each chirp has
its own unique meaning. For example, Shakira’s “C chirp” is used when she is approaching food, where as her “D chirp” is only used when she has
the food in hand. Single whistles also exhibit
a unique intention with each call and just as there are
eight different chirps, there are five different whistles. Based on frequency modulation, single whistles are subdivided
into four categories: squeaks, initially modulated whistles, terminally modulated whistles, and flat whistles. The language's quality of unique intention is wonderfully exemplified by the category of initially modulated whistles. These whistles change based
on the proximity of Shakira to other members of her family. If Shakira is greater than 0.6 meters
from her family, she’ll sound a large
initally modulated whistle. But if she’s less than 0.6 meters
from her family, she’ll sound a small
initially modulated whistle. Now that we’ve learned a few
chirps and whistles, Shakira wants to show off by taking you through a quick day in her life
with these calls. While heading towards a feeding tree
for her first meal of the day, she says: “(monkey noise)“, a call most often used
in relaxed investigations. However, suddenly she spots
the shadow of a hawk. "E chirp" for alarm. This call alerts her family
to the presence of this predator, and Shakira jumps to the safety
of an inner branch. The coast seems clear, so Shakira makes her way towards her dad. Wait, wait. Who is that? Ah, it's her younger brother, Carlos. Cotton-top tamarins often squeal
during play wrestling. Uh-oh. He’s playing a little too roughly,
and Shakira screams, alerting her parents to help her. Her dad makes his way
towards the ball of rolling fur and her brother stops. Shakira shakes herself and scratches herself to get the hair
on her head back in place. Then Shakira spots another group
of unfamiliar tamarins and hears their normal long call. She turns to her family. Did you catch that? First there was a chirp,
and then a whistle. This is what’s known as
a combination vocalization, a phrase that contains
both a chirp and a whistle. These are two calls strung together
to convey a message. The combination of these two elements alerts her family to the presence
of another group, the “F chirp”, and the distance
they are away, the normal long call whistle. In other words,
Shakira just said a sentence. Her simple demonstration
is just the tip of the iceberg. She’s got trills, chatters,
multiple whistle calls, more combination vocalizations,
even twitters. Yet sadly enough, we may not get to hear everything she has to say. Mixed in with chirping sonatas
from high above is the constant thud of a machete
chopping trees. Shakira’s habitat in Colombia
is being cut down, piece by piece, and if we don't work to protect the critically endangered
cotton-top tamarin, it will become extinct in our lifetime. If the chirp from one tamarin to the next has proven to be more
than just idle chit chat, imagine what else we have left
to discover. Imagine what else Shakira can tell us.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since the question and options of the ground truth MCQ are not directly matched with any of the generated MCQs, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that is closest to the topic.

Generated MCQ index: 2

Reasoning: Although Question 2 does not directly ask about the type of chirp used when encountering people, it does discuss the function of a specific chirp ("E chirp") in Shakira's language. The ground truth MCQ asks about the type of chirp used when cotton-top tamarins encounter people, and the correct answer is "Type B chirp". If a generated MCQ were to be created that matches the ground truth MCQ, it would likely be similar to Question 2 but with the specific details changed to match the ground truth MCQ.

If you would like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

initially modulated whistle. Now that we’ve learned a few
chirps and whistles, Shakira wants to show off by taking you through a quick day in her life
with these calls. While heading towards a feeding tree
for her first meal of the day, she says: “(monkey noise)“, a call most often used
in relaxed investigations. However, suddenly she spots
the shadow of a hawk. "E chirp" for alarm. This call alerts her family
to the presence of this predator, and Shakira jumps to the safety
of an inner branch. The coast seems clear, so Shakira makes her way towards her dad. Wait, wait. Who is that? Ah, it's her younger brother, Carlos. Cotton-top tamarins often squeal
during play wrestling. Uh-oh. He’s playing a little too roughly,
and Shakira screams, alerting her parents to help her. Her dad makes his way
towards the ball of rolling fur and her brother stops. Shakira shakes herself and scratches herself to get the hair
on her head back in place. Then Shakira spots another group
of unfamiliar tamarins and hears their normal long call. She turns to her family. Did you catch that? First there was a chirp,
and then a whistle. This is what’s known as
a combination vocalization, a phrase that contains
both a chirp and a whistle. These are two calls strung together
to convey a message. The combination of these two elements alerts her family to the presence
of another group, the “F chirp”, and the distance
they are away, the normal long call whistle. In other words,
Shakira just said a sentence. Her simple demonstration
is just the tip of the iceberg. She’s got trills, chatters,
multiple whistle calls, more combination vocalizations,
even twitters. Yet sadly enough, we may not get to hear everything she has to say. Mixed in with chirping sonatas
from high above is the constant thud of a machete
chopping trees. Shakira’s habitat in Colombia
is being cut down, piece by piece, and if we don't work to protect the critically endangered
cotton-top tamarin, it will become extinct in our lifetime. If the chirp from one tamarin to the next has proven to be more
than just idle chit chat, imagine what else we have left
to discover. Imagine what else Shakira can tell us.

**Transcript**:
Living with her family high
above the ground in the northern tropical forests
of Colombia, you will find Shakira, a cotton-top tamarin with a penchant
for conversation. Say, "Hola!" Though you may not realize it, this one pound monkey communicates in a highly sophisticated language of 38 distinct calls based on variations of chirps
and whistles. The response she just gave is known as a "B chirp", a call often directed at humans. To appreciate the complexities
of Shakira’s language, let's learn a few chirps and whistles, then examine how their combinations form grammatically structured sequences. The chirp Shakira used to greet us comes from a class of calls known as single frequency modulated syllables. This class is made up of short
duration calls, or chirps, and long duration calls,
like screams and squeals. Researchers have determined that there
are eight different types of chirps categorized by stem upsweep, duration,
peak frequency, and frequency change. In addition, each chirp has
its own unique meaning. For example, Shakira’s “C chirp” is used when she is approaching food, where as her “D chirp” is only used when she has
the food in hand. Single whistles also exhibit
a unique intention with each call and just as there are
eight different chirps, there are five different whistles. Based on frequency modulation, single whistles are subdivided
into four categories: squeaks, initially modulated whistles, terminally modulated whistles, and flat whistles. The language's quality of unique intention is wonderfully exemplified by the category of initially modulated whistles. These whistles change based
on the proximity of Shakira to other members of her family. If Shakira is greater than 0.6 meters
from her family, she’ll sound a large
initally modulated whistle. But if she’s less than 0.6 meters
from her family, she’ll sound a small
initially modulated whistle. Now that we’ve learned a few
chirps and whistles, Shakira wants to show off by taking you through a quick day in her life
with these calls. While heading towards a feeding tree
for her first meal of the day, she says: “(monkey noise)“, a call most often used
in relaxed investigations. However, suddenly she spots
the shadow of a hawk. "E chirp" for alarm. This call alerts her family

**Transcript**:
If you tried to pay for something
with a piece of paper, you might run into some trouble. Unless, of course, the piece of paper
was a hundred dollar bill. But what is it that makes that bill
so much more interesting and valuable than other pieces of paper? After all, there's not much
you can do with it. You can't eat it. You can't build things with it. And burning it is actually illegal. So what's the big deal? Of course, you probably know the answer. A hundred dollar bill
is printed by the government and designated as official currency, while other pieces of paper are not. But that's just what makes them legal. What makes a hundred dollar bill
valuable, on the other hand, is how many or few of them are around. Throughout history, most currency,
including the US dollar, was linked to valuable commodities and the amount of it in circulation depended on a government's gold
or silver reserves. But after the US abolished
this system in 1971, the dollar became
what is known as fiat money, meaning not linked
to any external resource but relying instead solely
on government policy to decide how much currency to print. Which branch of our government
sets this policy? The Executive, the Legislative,
or the Judicial? The surprising answer is:
none of the above! In fact, monetary policy is set
by an independent Federal Reserve System, or the Fed, made up of 12 regional banks
in major cities around the country. Its board of governors, which is appointed by the president
and confirmed by the Senate, reports to Congress, and all the Fed's profit
goes into the US Treasury. But to keep the Fed from being influenced by the day-to-day
vicissitudes of politics, it is not under the direct control
of any branch of government. Why doesn't the Fed just decide
to print infinite hundred dollar bills to make everyone happy and rich? Well, because then the bills
wouldn't be worth anything. Think about the purpose of currency, which is to be exchanged
for goods and services. If the total amount
of currency in circulation increases faster than the total value
of goods and services in the economy, then each individual piece will be able to buy a smaller portion
of those things than before. This is called inflation. On the other hand, if the money supply remains the same, while more goods
and services are produced, each dollar's value would increase in a process known as deflation. So which is worse? Too much inflation means that the money in your wallet today
will be worth less tomorrow, making you want to spend it right away. While this would stimulate business,
it would also encourage overconsumption, or hoarding commodities,
like food and fuel, raising their prices and leading to consumer shortages
and even more inflation. But deflation would make people
want to hold onto their money, and a decrease in consumer spending would reduce business profits, leading to more unemployment
and a further decrease in spending, causing the economy to keep shrinking. So most economists believe that
while too much of either is dangerous, a small, consistent amount of inflation
is necessary to encourage economic growth. The Fed uses vast amounts of economic data to determine how much currency
should be in circulation, including previous rates of inflation, international trends,
and the unemployment rate. Like in the story of Goldilocks, they need to get the numbers just right in order to stimulate growth
and keep people employed, without letting inflation
reach disruptive levels. The Fed not only determines how much that paper
in your wallet is worth but also your chances
of getting or keeping the job where you earn it.

you can do with it. You can't eat it. You can't build things with it. And burning it is actually illegal. So what's the big deal? Of course, you probably know the answer. A hundred dollar bill
is printed by the government and designated as official currency, while other pieces of paper are not. But that's just what makes them legal. What makes a hundred dollar bill
valuable, on the other hand, is how many or few of them are around. Throughout history, most currency,
including the US dollar, was linked to valuable commodities and the amount of it in circulation depended on a government's gold
or silver reserves. But after the US abolished
this system in 1971, the dollar became
what is known as fiat money, meaning not linked
to any external resource but relying instead solely
on government policy to decide how much currency to print. Which branch of our government
sets this policy? The Executive, the Legislative,
or the Judicial? The surprising answer is:
none of the above! In fact, monetary policy is set
by an independent Federal Reserve System, or the Fed, made up of 12 regional banks
in major cities around the country. Its board of governors, which is appointed by the president
and confirmed by the Senate, reports to Congress, and all the Fed's profit
goes into the US Treasury. But to keep the Fed from being influenced by the day-to-day
vicissitudes of politics, it is not under the direct control
of any branch of government. Why doesn't the Fed just decide
to print infinite hundred dollar bills to make everyone happy and rich? Well, because then the bills
wouldn't be worth anything. Think about the purpose of currency, which is to be exchanged
for goods and services. If the total amount
of currency in circulation increases faster than the total value
of goods and services in the economy, then each individual piece will be able to buy a smaller portion
of those things than before. This is called inflation. On the other hand, if the money supply remains the same, while more goods
and services are produced, each dollar's value would increase in a process known as deflation. So which is worse? Too much inflation means that the money in your wallet today
will be worth less tomorrow, making you want to spend it right away. While this would stimulate business,
it would also encourage overconsumption, or hoarding commodities,
like food and fuel, raising their prices and leading to consumer shortages
and even more inflation. But deflation would make people
want to hold onto their money, and a decrease in consumer spending would reduce business profits, leading to more unemployment
and a further decrease in spending, causing the economy to keep shrinking. So most economists believe that
while too much of either is dangerous, a small, consistent amount of inflation
is necessary to encourage economic growth. The Fed uses vast amounts of economic data to determine how much currency
should be in circulation, including previous rates of inflation, international trends,
and the unemployment rate. Like in the story of Goldilocks, they need to get the numbers just right in order to stimulate growth
and keep people employed, without letting inflation
reach disruptive levels. The Fed not only determines how much that paper
in your wallet is worth but also your chances
of getting or keeping the job where you earn it.

[Music] [Applause] here to talk about the Wonder and the Mystery of conscious Minds The Wonder is about the fact that we all woke up this morning and we had with it the amazing return of our conscious mind uh we recovered Minds with a complete sense of self and a complete sense of our own existence and we hardly ever pause to consider this Wonder we should in fact because without having this possibility of conscious Minds we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our Humanity we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world we would have no pains but also no Joys we would have no access to love or to the ability to create uh and of course Scott Fitzgerald said famously that uh he who invented Consciousness uh would have a lot to be blamed for but he also forgot that uh without Consciousness he would have no access to true happiness and even to the possibility of transcendence so much for the Wonder now for the mystery this is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to elucidate uh all the way back into early philos phos ophy and certainly throughout the history of Neuroscience uh this has been one mystery that has always resisted elucidation has caused major controversies and there are actually many people that think that we should not even touch it we should just leave it alone it's not to be solved I don't believe that and I think the situation is changing it would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make Consciousness uh in our in our brains but we certainly can begin to approach the the the question and we can begin to see the shape um of a solution and one more Wonder to celebrate uh is the fact that we have Imaging Technologies that now allow us to go inside the human brain and be able to do for example what you're seeing right now these are images that come from hanasu lab and which show you in a living brain the Reconstruction of that brain and this is a person who alive this is not a person that uh is being studied at autopsy and even more and this is something that one can be really amazed about is what I'm going to show you next which is going underneath the surface of the brain and actually looking in the living brain at real connections real Pathways so all of those colored lines correspond to Bunches of axons the fibers that join cell bodies to uh synapses and I'm sorry to disappoint you they don't come in color but at any rate uh they are there the colors are codes for the direction for whether it is back to front or vice versa um at any rate what is consciousness uh what is a conscious mind uh and we could take a very simple view and say well it is that which we lose when we fall into uh deep uh sleep without dreams uh or when we go under anesthesia and it is what we regain when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia um but what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia or when we are in deep dreamless Sleep well first of all uh it is a mind which is a flow of mental images and of course consider images that can be sensory patterns visual such as you're having right now in relation to the stage in me or auditory images as you're having now in relation to my to my words that flow of mental images is mind but there is something else that we all experiencing in this room we are not passive exhibitors of visual or auditory or tactile images we have selves we have a me that is automatically present in our minds right now we own our minds and we have a sense that it's every one of us that is experiencing in this not the person who is sitting uh next to you so in order to have a conscious mind you have a self within the conscious mind so a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it the self introduces a subjective perspective in the mind and we are only fully conscious when self comes to mind so what we need to know to even address this mystery is number one how minds are put together in the brain and number two how selves are con constructed now the first part the first problem is relatively easy it's not easy at all but it it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience and uh it's quite clear that in order to make Minds we need to construct neural Maps so imagine a grid like the one I'm showing you right now and now imagine within that grid that two-dimensional sheath imagine neurons and picture if you will a billboard a digital billboard where you have elements that can be either lit or not and depending on how you create the pattern of lighting or not lighting the digital elements or for that matter the neurons in the sheet you're going to be able to construct a map this is of course a visual map that I'm showing you but this applies to any kind of map auditory for example in relation to sound frequencies or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate now to bring home the point of how close it is the relationship between the grid of neurons and the topographical arrangement of the the activity of the neurons and our mental experience I'm going to tell you a personal story so if I cover my left eye I'm talking about me personally not all of you if I cover my left eye I look at the grid pretty much like the one I'm showing you everything is nice and fine and perpendicular but some time ago I discovered that if I cover my left eye instead what I get is this I look at the grid and I see a warping at the edge of my central left field very odd I've analyzed this for a while but some time ago uh through the help of an opthalmologist colleague of mine Carmen Pito who developed a laser scanner of the retina I found out the following if I scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner what I get is the following on the right side my retina is perfectly symmetrical you see the going down towards the fobia uh where the optic nerve begins but on my left retina there is a bump which is marked there by the red arrow and it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below and that is exactly what causes the warping of my visual image so just think of this you have a grid of neurons and now you have a plain mechanical uh change in the position of the grid and you get a warping of your mental experience so this is how close your mental experience and the activity of the neurons in the retina which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball or for that matter a sheath of visual cortex so from the retina you go on to visual cortex and the of course the brain adds on a lot of information to what is going on in the signals that come from the retina and in that image there you see a variety of islands of what I call imag making regions in the brain you have the green for example that corresponds to tactile information or the blue that corresponds to auditory information and something else that happens is that those image making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural Maps can then provide signals to this ocean of purple that you see around which is Association cortex where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image making and the great beauty is that you can then go from memory out of those Association cortices and produce back images in the very same regions that had perception so think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy the the brain is so it provides certain areas for perception and image making and those are exactly the same that are going to be used for image making when we recall information so so far the The Mystery of the conscious mind is diminishing a little bit because we have a general sense of how we make these images but what about the self the self is really the elusive problem and um for a long time people did not even want to touch it and because they say how can you have this sort of reference point this stability that is required to maintain the continuity of cells day after day um and I thought about a solution to this problem is the following we generate brain maps of the body's interior and use them as the reference for all other Maps so let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this I came to this because if you're going to have a reference that we know as self the me the I in in our own uh processing we need to have something that is stable something that does not deviate much from day to day well it so happens that we have a singular body we have one body not two not three and so that is a beginning there is just one reference point which is the body but then of course the body has many parts and things grow at different rates and they have different sizes in different people however not so with the interior the things that have to do with what is known as our internal milar for example the whole management of the chemistries within our body are in fact extremely maintained day after day for one very good reason if you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that life permitting survival range you go into disease or death so we have an inbuilt system within our own lives that ensures some kind of continuity I I like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day because if you don't have that sameness physiologically you're going to be sick or you're going to die so that's one more element for this continuity and the final thing is that there is a very tight coupling between the regulation of our body within the brain and the body itself unlike any other coupling so for example I'm making images of you but there's no physiological bond between the images I have of you as an audience and my brain however there is a close permanently permanently maintained bond between the body regulating parts of my brain and my own body so here's how it looks look at the region there there is the brain stem in between the cereal cortex and the spinal cord and it is within that region that I'm going to highlight now that we have this housing of all the life regulation devices of a body this is so specific that for example if you look at the part that is colored in red in the upper part of the brain stem if you damage that as a result of a stroke for example what you get is coma or vegetative state which is a state of course in which your mind disappears your Consciousness disappears H what what happens then actually is that you lose the surrounding of the self you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence and in fact there can be images going on being formed in the cereal cortex except you don't know they're there you have you have in effect lost Consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem but if you consider the green part of the brain stem nothing like that happens it is that specific so in that green component of the brain stem if you damage it and often it happens what you get is complete paralysis but your conscious mind is maintained you feel you know you have a fully conscious mind that you can report very indirectly this is a horrific condition you don't want to see it uh and people are in fact imprisoned within their own bodies but they do have a mind there was a very interesting film one of the rare good films done about a situation like this by Julian Schnabel some some years ago about a patient that was in that condition so now I'm going to show you a picture I promise not to say anything about this except this is to frighten you is just to tell you that in that red section of the brain stem there are to make it simple all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make brain maps of different aspects of our interior different aspects of our body they are exquisitely topographic and are exquisitly interconnected in a recursive pattern and it is out of this and out of this tight coupling between the brain stem and the body that I believe and I could be wrong but I don't think I am uh that you generate this mapping of the body that provides the grounding for the self and that comes in the form of feelings primordial Feelings by the way so what is the picture that we get here look at cerebal cortex look at brain stem look at body and you get a picture the interconnectivity in which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self in a very tight interconnection with the body and you have the cereal cortex providing the great spectacle of our minds with the profusion of images that are in fact the contents of our minds and that we normally pay most attention to as we should because that's really the film that is rolling in our minds but look at the the the arrows that're not there for looks that there because there's this very close interaction you cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between cereal cortex and brain stem you cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between the brain stem and the body another thing that is interesting is that the brain stem that we have is shared with a variety of other species so throughout vertebrates the design of the brain stem is very similar to ours which is one of the reasons why I think those other species have conscious Minds like we do except that they're not as rich as ours because they don't have a cereal cortex like we do that's where the difference is and I strongly disagree with the idea that Consciousness should be cons considered as the great product of the cereal cortex only the wealth of our minds is not the very fact that we have a self that we can refer to our own existence and that we have any sense of um person now there are three levels of self to consider the Proto the core and the autobiographical the first two are shared with many many other species and they are really coming out largely of the brain stem and whatever there is of Cortex in those species it's the autobiographical self which some species have I think satans and primates have also an autobiographical self to a certain degree and everybody's dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree but the novelty is here the autobiographical self is built on the basis of past memories and memories of the plans that we have made it's the lived past and the anticipated future and the autobiographical self has prompted extended memory reasoning imagination creativity and language and out of that came the instruments of culture religions Justice trade the Arts science technology and it is within that culture that we really can get and this is the novelty something that is not entirely set by our biology it is developed in the cultures it developed in collectives of uh human beings and this is of course the culture where we have developed something that I like to call sociocultural regulation and finally you could rightly ask why care about this why care if it is the brain stem or the Cal cortex and how this is made three reasons first curiosity primates are extremely curious and humans most of all and if we are interested for example in the fact that anti-gravity is pulling galaxies away from the earth why should we not be interested in what is going on inside of human beings second understanding society and culture we should look at how society and culture uh in this sociocultural regulation are a work in progress and finally medicine let's not forget that some of the worst dis diseases of humankind are diseases such as depression Alzheimer's disease drug addiction think of Strokes that can devastate your mind or render you unconscious you have no prayer of understanding how the of of treating those diseases effectively and in a non- serendipitous way if you do not know how this works so that's a very good reason Beyond curiosity to justify what we're doing and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains thank you for your attention

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the size difference between American homes in the 1950s and 60s compared to 2013. Question 6 asks about the benefits of having a smaller space, and one of the options mentions "Having a smaller footprint," which is related to the idea of smaller living spaces.

However, a more relevant question is Question 2 in the transcript, which states that "we Americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago." This information is not used to create a generated MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar, but it's not a direct match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4: What is one of the main approaches to living with less, according to the speaker? Options: A. Buying more stuff, B. Editing ruthlessly, C. Having a bigger house, D. Having more credit card debt Correct Option: B**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only covers one of the main approaches to living with less. A more similar question would be one that covers all the main approaches.

A closer match can be found by combining the content of multiple generated MCQs. Specifically, Question 4 (editing ruthlessly), Question 7 (small is sexy), and Question 8 (using multifunctional spaces and housewares) together cover the main approaches to living with less mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

Unfortunately, there is no single generated MCQ that perfectly matches the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose:

**Question 4**

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that covers all the main approaches to living with less.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: **4**

global oneness project A Game for Life I don't know how I can really put this, but my football is really something that is very powerful in my life, that gives me the drive to be who I am now, and have the goals I have now. I think if it wasn't for football… I can't really imagine myself without football.  Certain things, certain principles in my life are based on my football. I don't know if you understand what I mean.  [♪ native music ♪] [children playing] [♪ native music ♪] This is my place. Its a very small place. Its just a four room house. This is where we sit as a family, watch TV, eat supper, and chat. Just family chats. I'll show you the kitchen where we cook our dinner. This is my kitchen. Its not a very big place but it is where I live. This is my bedroom; I share it with my aunt, but unfortunately now she is asleep because she was working night shift. This is my bed. I sleep here with my kitten. Oh yes, this is my kitten. It is my friend. I sleep with her almost every night. This is my aunt. She stays here. She is selling veggies and fruit and her business is definitely going very well. In one week you find that you come and buy something and then its not there, its finished. So she's got a business that is doing well. This road that we are walking on, this is where I started playing soccer when I got to Port Elizabeth.  We put small stones, there would be goals on each side of the road, then we'd be playing with the guys.  That was before there was grass here. There was no grass here, so we would play from that wall to this side of the road. I grew up playing here and when I see this road or when I walk here I always remember where I started playing soccer. [♪ native music ♪] Most of the time I was with my other two cousin-brothers, and they would spend most of their time playing soccer and that's how I got on to the field and played as well. [♪ native music ♪] When I was growing up I was very, very poor. When I was still in primary school, I would wash with cold water. My school shoes, the sole was broken, so when it was raining, my socks would be so wet. And in terms of food, there was absolutely nothing to eat. [♪ native music ♪] For me to be able to eat at school I would have to wait until we are writing a test. Then each pupil would put on 10 cents or 20 cents. Then the whole amount would go to the person who was the highest on a test, and that is how I would manage to eat, because, if we were writing a test and put on some money, it was definitely my money because I was a very good student.  [♪ native music ♪] I know their are many people out there who are going through what I went through. I know they won't deal with it the way I dealt with it, because I was taking everyday as it was coming.   	
[♪ native music ♪] I never thought of going out and being a prostitute or something, and I know other people who are going through that thing. Always, not always, but sometimes opt for that if they are girls, and if they are boys, they go to armed robbery, bad things like that. So the main reason I always tell the story is just to let them know that poverty cannot conquer you for the rest of your life. You can conquer poverty as well.    	
[♪ native music ♪] [dog barking]   	
[♪ native music ♪] There is a way that you can go. There is a solution to poverty. They always do things that are unethical because they say they are going through poverty.   	
[♪ native music ♪] I've never done anything to anyone when I was very poor, but here I am today. I'm not as poor as I was before and for me, now, I don't feel like I'm poor, even though I don't have everything I want.  I don't have a big house, I don't have a car, but I still feel that I am rich because I am rich inside. [speaking in native language]
[laughter] This is a very good friend of mine. I grew up playing with him on the street. He was never a very good player, but a very good goal keeper. [laughter] Come try it:
[gaming device sounds] [winning tune] [quarters hitting the metal return]
I've won.
It's my lucky day. There you go, that's all the money. [♪ native hip-hop music ♪] Soccer helped me to stay away from the option of being a prostitute. I have always had love for my football and discipline. If you are going to be doing all the wrong things to try and get something to eat, or money, then those things won't be in-line with your football. If you look at soccer, the things you do that are in line with football, they are also in line with your own life. [♪ native hip-hop music ♪] People love soccer, and the young kids out there, they are interested in soccer. If you talk about soccer, they all know what you're talking about, because everyone knows about soccer. So its easy to reach out to the people with soccer. [♪ native hip-hop music ♪] Grassroots Soccer we have the kids who know how to prevent themselves from getting HIV and also to teach them life skills. [♪ native hip-hop music ♪] The older guys have gone through things in their lives, but would like to teach the kids so that they could not go through those things. The way we would do is with interactive games. So we don't really say, "Yeah, we're going to talk about HIV now." Some people might just lose interest in it, but simply because its interactive, we do the actual activities where they just learn from them. And its not as if we are telling them what to do, like to abstain. [♪ native hip-hop music ♪] So why was it not easy to find the ball? Because you couldn't see the ball. So remember when we play that game, what did you say? Teacher>Yes my girl, say it. 
Student>Someone who has the ball is going to be HIV positive. So what does that tell you about HIV? You can't see someone who has HIV. [clapping] Since we work with kids we use the power of soccer, and we use soccer balls because kids love to play. If you just make them play, especially with our street leagues, the way we do the teaching for HIV and AIDS gives them time to play soccer. [♪ native hip-hop music ♪] Those are tools for them to be better people, to stay away from things that could destroy their lives. [♪ native hip-hop music ♪] After we've done the program, we also assess the change in their attitudes. [♪ native hip-hop music ♪]
[clapping] If there's a big difference where their attitudes were before they went through the program, I would be very happy about that. [♪ native music ♪] When you've got something in your heart and you also want someone else to have that same feeling, I don't know how to say it... but it's always important to just share things with other people. It's just important. If you know you can do something to help the next person, just do it with all your heart. And not expect to get a reward. It really makes more sense to be able to have others help because, really, we cannot live in isolation. Honestly, we could be a unity here, but what about the others that are not a unity? We are going to say, yes we are a unity, that is fine for us. They are not a unity, that's their own problem. It shouldn't be like that. [♪ native music ♪] If people could unite. I'm telling you, I don't see anything stopping the world from being a better place. I don't see anything stopping it. [♪ native music ♪] It doesn't take much for soccer to get people together. If there's a soccer match somewhere, as long as they know that match  is somewhere, they will definitely go. It's really easy for it to unite people. [♪ native music ♪] For me its really about passion because I love soccer. I love soccer. It just really... Even if I can be stressed out about something, at my training session or at my game, I forget about it. I don't know what to say about soccer, but that's the thing about it. I just don't know what it is. [♪ native music ♪] Nolusindiso "Titie" Plaatjie is 22 years old and lives in Port Elizabeth South Africa.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the country that hosted the World Cup in 2010. Although none of the generated MCQs ask about the World Cup, Question 4 mentions South Africa, which is the country that hosted the World Cup in 2010.

Therefore, based on the content and geographical location, I would suggest that Question 4 is the most similar generated MCQ, although it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4

Please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically asks about the World Cup or a closely related topic.

**Transcript**:
Honeybees are fascinating creatures 
for a number of reasons: their incredible work ethic, the sugary sweet syrup they produce and their intricate social structure. But another reason is 
that honeybees are, in fact, excellent mathematicians. Scientists claim the tiny insects 
can calculate angles, and can even comprehend
the roundness of the Earth. But there's particular
mathematical bee genius behind the most important aspect 
of honeybee life: the hive. Just like humans, bees need food
and shelter to stay alive. The hive is not only the bees' home, but doubles as a place
to store their honey. Since it's so central to survival, honeybees have to perfect
the hive's architectural design. If you examine any piece of honeycomb, you'll see that it's constructed from tightly packed hexagonal, 
or six-sided, cells. Of all the possible designs, why do honeybees choose this one? To understand, you need
to think like a bee. Bees need a secure place 
for their entire colony to live. Similarly, there needs to be a place where their nectar can 
be stored and ripened suitably until it turns into honey. That means there's a need
for some serious space efficiency. A good solution is to build
little storage units, or cells, just big enough for a bee to fit into, which can also double as the containers
in which nectar is stored: The bees' very own honey jars. The next thing, is to decide what
the little cells should be made out of. Bees don't have beaks
or arms to pick up things, but they are capable of producing wax. The thing is, producing it 
is a lot of hard work. Bees have to consume 8 ounces of honey to produce just 1 ounce of wax. So they don't want to waste it. So, they need a design 
that allows them to store the largest possible amount of honey using the least amount of wax. What shape does that? Imagining for a minute 
that all bees had to attend architecture academy 
and go to math class. Let's say they asked 
their geometry teacher, "What shape would give us
the most space to store our honey, but require the least amount of wax?" And then geometry teacher replied, "The shape that you're seeking 
is the circle." Leaving the bees to return
to their trial construction site and begin building their honeycomb
using circular cells. After a while, some of them 
might have noticed a problem with their design: small gaps between the cells. "We can't even fit in there! 
That's wasted space!" they might have thought. So, ignoring the geometry lesson, and taking matters into their own hands, the bees went back to the drawing board to rethink their beehive design. One suggested triangles, "We can use triangles. Look! 
They fit together perfectly." Another bee suggested squares. Finally, a third bee piped up and said, "Pentagons don't seem to work, 
but hexagons do! We want the one that will use 
the least amount of wax and be able to store 
the most amount of honey. Yes, I think that's the hexagon." "Why?" "It looks more like the circle 
than the others." "But how do we know for sure?" To find out, the industrious 
insect architects calculated the areas of the triangle,
the square and the hexagon and found that the hexagon was, in fact, the shape that gave them
the most storage space. They agreed on an ideal size 
and returned to work. The space efficient comb that 
is a bee's trademark today, is probably the result 
of this trial and error, but over long periods 
of evolutionary history. However, it paid off. Peek into any hive -- with your protective goggles 
and netting on, of course -- and you'll see the end result: 
a beautiful compact honeycomb that any architect would have 
be proud to design.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is about the concept of repeating shapes to fit together without spaces, which is known as tessellation. Although none of the generated MCQs directly ask about tessellation, Question 5 discusses the problem of small gaps between circular cells, which is related to the concept of tessellation.

However, a more relevant question is Question 7, which asks about the shape that the bees eventually chose as the most efficient for storing honey. This question is related to the concept of tessellation because the bees chose the hexagon shape due to its ability to fit together without spaces, as mentioned in the transcript.

But the most similar question is not present, however, Question 3 is about the shape that would be the most efficient for storing honey using the least amount of wax, and its correct answer is the circle, but it's mentioned that the hexagon is the shape that gives the most storage space, which is related to the concept of tessellation.

So, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3, but it's not a direct match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the most efficient shape for storing honey using the least amount of wax, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about shapes that do not tessellate.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about shapes that do or do not tessellate, but such a question is not present in the provided set. Among the available options, Question 3 is the closest match in terms of discussing shapes, but it does not address the concept of tessellation.

If I had to choose an index, I would say Question 3 (Index: 3) is the closest match, but please note that it is not a perfect match.

However, if we were to modify Question 7 to ask which of the following shapes do not tessellate and provide options like triangle, square, hexagon, and octagon, then it would be a perfect match.

In the current scenario, none of the questions perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

or six-sided, cells. Of all the possible designs, why do honeybees choose this one? To understand, you need
to think like a bee. Bees need a secure place 
for their entire colony to live. Similarly, there needs to be a place where their nectar can 
be stored and ripened suitably until it turns into honey. That means there's a need
for some serious space efficiency. A good solution is to build
little storage units, or cells, just big enough for a bee to fit into, which can also double as the containers
in which nectar is stored: The bees' very own honey jars. The next thing, is to decide what
the little cells should be made out of. Bees don't have beaks
or arms to pick up things, but they are capable of producing wax. The thing is, producing it 
is a lot of hard work. Bees have to consume 8 ounces of honey to produce just 1 ounce of wax. So they don't want to waste it. So, they need a design 
that allows them to store the largest possible amount of honey using the least amount of wax. What shape does that? Imagining for a minute 
that all bees had to attend architecture academy 
and go to math class. Let's say they asked 
their geometry teacher, "What shape would give us
the most space to store our honey, but require the least amount of wax?" And then geometry teacher replied, "The shape that you're seeking 
is the circle." Leaving the bees to return
to their trial construction site and begin building their honeycomb
using circular cells. After a while, some of them 
might have noticed a problem with their design: small gaps between the cells. "We can't even fit in there! 
That's wasted space!" they might have thought. So, ignoring the geometry lesson, and taking matters into their own hands, the bees went back to the drawing board to rethink their beehive design. One suggested triangles, "We can use triangles. Look! 
They fit together perfectly." Another bee suggested squares. Finally, a third bee piped up and said, "Pentagons don't seem to work, 
but hexagons do! We want the one that will use 
the least amount of wax and be able to store 
the most amount of honey. Yes, I think that's the hexagon." "Why?" "It looks more like the circle 
than the others." "But how do we know for sure?" To find out, the industrious 
insect architects calculated the areas of the triangle,
the square and the hexagon and found that the hexagon was, in fact, the shape that gave them
the most storage space. They agreed on an ideal size 
and returned to work. The space efficient comb that 
is a bee's trademark today, is probably the result 
of this trial and error, but over long periods 
of evolutionary history. However, it paid off. Peek into any hive -- with your protective goggles 
and netting on, of course -- and you'll see the end result: 
a beautiful compact honeycomb that any architect would have 
be proud to design.

Honeybees are fascinating creatures 
for a number of reasons: their incredible work ethic, the sugary sweet syrup they produce and their intricate social structure. But another reason is 
that honeybees are, in fact, excellent mathematicians. Scientists claim the tiny insects 
can calculate angles, and can even comprehend
the roundness of the Earth. But there's particular
mathematical bee genius behind the most important aspect 
of honeybee life: the hive. Just like humans, bees need food
and shelter to stay alive. The hive is not only the bees' home, but doubles as a place
to store their honey. Since it's so central to survival, honeybees have to perfect

**Transcript**:
The year was 1816. Europe and North America had just been through a devastating series of wars, and a slow recovery seemed to be underway, but nature had other plans. After two years of poor harvests, the spring brought heavy rains and cold, flooding the rivers and causing crop failures from the British Isles to Switzerland. While odd-colored snow fell in Italy and Hungary, famine, food riots and disease epidemics ensued. Meanwhile, New England was blanketed by a strange fog that would not disperse as the ground remained frozen well into June. In what came to be known as "the Year Without a Summer," some thought the apocalypse had begun. A mood captured in Lord Byron's poem "Darkness": "I had a dream which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars did wander darkling in the eternal space, rayless, and pathless, and the icy Earth swung blind and blackening in the moonless air; morn came and went -- and came, and brought no day." They had no way of knowing that the real source of their misfortunes had occurred a year ago thousands of miles away. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa was what is known as a supervolcano, characterized by a volume of erupted material, many times greater than that of ordinary volcanoes. And while the popular image of volcanic destruction is molten rock engulfing the surrounding land, far greater devastation is caused by what remains in the air. Volcanic ash, dispersed by wind, can blanket the sky for days, while toxic gases, such as sulfur dioxide, react in the stratosphere, blocking out solar radiation and drastically cooling the atmosphere below. The resulting volcanic winter, along with other effects such as acid rain, can effect multiple continents, disrupting natural cycles and annihilating the plant life on which other organisms, including humans, depend. Releasing nearly 160 cubic kilometers of rock, ash and gas, the Mount Tambora eruption was the largest in recorded history, causing as many as 90,000 deaths. But previous eruptions have been even more deadly. The 1600 eruption of Peru's Huaynaputina is likely to have triggered the Russian famine, that killed nearly two million, while more ancient eruptions have been blamed for major world events, such as the fall of the Chinese Xia Dynasty, the disappearance of the Minoan civilization, and even a genetic bottleneck in human evolution that may have resulted from all but a few thousand human beings being wiped out 70,000 years ago. One of the most dangerous types of supervolcano is an explosive caldera, formed when a volcanic mountain collapses after an eruption so large that the now-empty magma chamber can no longer support its weight. But though the above-ground volcano is gone, the underground volcanic activity continues. With no method of release, magma and volcanic gases continue to accumulate and expand underground, building up pressure until a massive and violent explosion becomes inevitable. And one of the largest active volcanic calderas lies right under Yellowstone National Park. The last time it erupted, 650,000 years ago, it covered much of North America in nearly two meters of ash and rock. Scientists are currently monitoring the world's active volcanoes, and procedures for predicting eruptions, conducting evacuations and diverting lava flows have improved over the years. But the massive scale and global reach of a supervolcano means that for many people there would be nowhere to run. Fortunately, the current data shows no evidence of such an eruption occurring in the next few thousand years. But the idea of a sudden and unavoidable civilization-destroying apocalypse caused by events half a globe away will remain a powerful and terrifying vision. Less fictional than we would like to believe. "The winds were withered in the stagnant air, and the clouds perish'd; darkness had no need of aid from them -- she was the universe." - Lord Byron

**Transcript**:
The year was 1816. Europe and North America had just been through a devastating series of wars, and a slow recovery seemed to be underway, but nature had other plans. After two years of poor harvests, the spring brought heavy rains and cold, flooding the rivers and causing crop failures from the British Isles to Switzerland. While odd-colored snow fell in Italy and Hungary, famine, food riots and disease epidemics ensued. Meanwhile, New England was blanketed by a strange fog that would not disperse as the ground remained frozen well into June. In what came to be known as "the Year Without a Summer," some thought the apocalypse had begun. A mood captured in Lord Byron's poem "Darkness": "I had a dream which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars did wander darkling in the eternal space, rayless, and pathless, and the icy Earth swung blind and blackening in the moonless air; morn came and went -- and came, and brought no day." They had no way of knowing that the real source of their misfortunes had occurred a year ago thousands of miles away. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa was what is known as a supervolcano, characterized by a volume of erupted material, many times greater than that of ordinary volcanoes. And while the popular image of volcanic destruction is molten rock engulfing the surrounding land, far greater devastation is caused by what remains in the air. Volcanic ash, dispersed by wind, can blanket the sky for days, while toxic gases, such as sulfur dioxide, react in the stratosphere, blocking out solar radiation and drastically cooling the atmosphere below. The resulting volcanic winter, along with other effects such as acid rain, can effect multiple continents, disrupting natural cycles and annihilating the plant life on which other organisms, including humans, depend. Releasing nearly 160 cubic kilometers of rock, ash and gas, the Mount Tambora eruption was the largest in recorded history, causing as many as 90,000 deaths. But previous eruptions have been even more deadly. The 1600 eruption of Peru's Huaynaputina is likely to have triggered the Russian famine, that killed nearly two million, while more ancient eruptions have been blamed for major world events, such as the fall of the Chinese Xia Dynasty, the disappearance of the Minoan civilization, and even a genetic bottleneck in human evolution that may have resulted from all but a few thousand human beings being wiped out 70,000 years ago. One of the most dangerous types of supervolcano is an explosive caldera, formed when a volcanic mountain collapses after an eruption so large that the now-empty magma chamber can no longer support its weight. But though the above-ground volcano is gone, the underground volcanic activity continues. With no method of release, magma and volcanic gases continue to accumulate and expand underground, building up pressure until a massive and violent explosion becomes inevitable. And one of the largest active volcanic calderas lies right under Yellowstone National Park. The last time it erupted, 650,000 years ago, it covered much of North America in nearly two meters of ash and rock. Scientists are currently monitoring the world's active volcanoes, and procedures for predicting eruptions, conducting evacuations and diverting lava flows have improved over the years. But the massive scale and global reach of a supervolcano means that for many people there would be nowhere to run. Fortunately, the current data shows no evidence of such an eruption occurring in the next few thousand years. But the idea of a sudden and unavoidable civilization-destroying apocalypse caused by events half a globe away will remain a powerful and terrifying vision. Less fictional than we would like to believe. "The winds were withered in the stagnant air, and the clouds perish'd; darkness had no need of aid from them -- she was the universe." - Lord Byron

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a strategy to avoid all the devastating effects of a supervolcano, and the correct option is colonizing another planet. Among the generated MCQs, none directly address this question. However, Question 9 comes closest in terms of discussing the likelihood of a supervolcano eruption and its potential impact.

Although Question 9 does not provide a direct match, I would argue that it is the most similar generated MCQ, as it touches on the idea of mitigating the effects of a supervolcano eruption. Nevertheless, I must emphasize that the similarity is limited, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly addresses the question of avoiding the devastating effects of a supervolcano.

[Music] [Applause] so I just want to tell you my story I spend a lot of time teaching adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace and naturally I encounter a lot of resistance right because it's sort of considered to be anti intellectual and counter to serious learning but I have a problem with that belief because I know that doodling has a profound impact on the way that we can process information and the way that we can solve problems so I was curious about why there was a disconnect between the way that our society perceives doodling and the way that the reality is so I discovered some very interesting things for example there is no such thing as a flattering definition of a doodle in the 17th century a doodle was a simpleton or a fool as in Yankee Doodle in the 18th century it became a verb and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone in the 19th century it was a corrupt politician and today we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition at least to me which is the following to doodle officially means to dawdle to dilly-dally to monkey around to make meaningless marks to do something of little value substance or import and my personal favorite to do nothing no wonder people erver is to Dueling at work doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work it's totally inappropriate additionally I've heard horror stories from people whose teachers scolded them of course for doodling in classrooms and they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom there is a powerful cultural norm against doodling in settings in which we are supposed to learn something and unfortunately the press tends to reinforce this norm when they're reporting on a doodling scene you know of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like they typically use words like discovered or caught or found out as if there's some sort of criminal act being committed and additionally there is a psychological aversion to doodling Thank You Freud in the 1930s Freud told us all that you could analyze people's psyches based on their doodles this is not accurate but it did happen to Tony Blair at the Davos forum in 2005 when his doodles were of course discovered and he was labeled the following things now it turned out to be Bill Gates's doodle and Bill if you're here nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal but that does contribute right to people not wanting to share their doodles and here is the real deal here's what I believe I think that our culture is so intensely focused on verbal information that we're almost blinded to the value of doodling and I'm not comfortable with that and so because of that belief that I think needs to be burst I'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth and here's the truth doodling is an incredibly powerful tool and it is a tool that we need to remember and to relearn so here's a new definition for doodling and I hope there's someone in here from the Oxford English Dictionary because I want to talk to you later here's the real definition doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think that is why millions of people doodle here's another interesting truth about the doodle people who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information retain more of that information than their non doodling counterparts we think diddling is something you do when you lose focus but in reality it is a pre-emptive measure to stop you from losing focus additionally it has a profound effect on creative problem-solving and deep information processing there are four ways that learners intake information so that they can make decisions they are visual auditory reading and writing and kinesthetic now in order for us to really chew on information and do something with it we have to engage at least two of those modalities or we have to engage one of those modalities coupled with an emotional experience the incredible contribution of the doodle is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously with the possibility of an emotional experience that is a pretty solid contribution for a behavior equated with doing nothing this is so nerdy but this made me cry when I discovered this so they did anthropological research into the unfolding of artistic activity in children they found that across space and time all children exhibit the same evolution and visual logic as they grow in other words they have a shared and growing complexity and visual language that happens in a predictable order and I think that is incredible I think that means doodling is native to us and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct and finally a lot of people aren't privy to this but the doodle is a precursor to some of our greatest cultural assets this is but one this is Frank Gehry the architects precursor to the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi so here's my point under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated from a classroom or a boardroom or even the war room on the contrary doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations where information density is very high and the need for processing that information is very high and I will go you one further because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy my friends the doodle has never been the Nemesis of intellectual thought in reality it is one of its greatest allies thank you [Applause] you

this is so nerdy but this made me cry when I discovered this so they did anthropological research into the unfolding of artistic activity in children they found that across space and time all children

[Music] [Applause] so I just want to tell you my story I spend a lot of time teaching adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace and naturally I encounter a lot of resistance right because it's sort of considered to be anti intellectual and counter to serious learning but I have a problem with that belief because I know that doodling has a profound impact on the way that we can process information and the way that we can solve problems so I was curious about why there was a disconnect between the way that our society perceives doodling and the way that the reality is

definition at least to me which is the following to doodle officially means to dawdle to dilly-dally to monkey around to make meaningless marks to do something of little value substance or import and my personal favorite to do nothing no wonder people erver is to Dueling at work doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work it's totally inappropriate additionally I've heard horror stories from people whose teachers scolded them of course for doodling in classrooms and they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom there is a powerful cultural norm against doodling in

**Transcript**:
I didn't always love unintended consequences but I really learned to appreciate them I've learned that they're really the essence of what makes for progress even when they seem to be terrible and I'd like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do let's go to 40,000 years before the present to the time of the cultural explosion when music art technology so many of the things that we're enjoying today so many of the things that are being demonstrated at Ted were born and the anthropologist Randall White has made a very interesting observation that if our ancestors forty thousand years ago had been able to see what they had done they wouldn't have really understood it they were responding to immediate concerns they were making it possible for us to do what they do and yet they didn't really understand how they did it now let's advance to 10,000 years before the present and this is when it really gets interesting what about the domestication of grains what about the origins of Agriculture what would our ancestors 10,000 years ago have said if they really had technology assessment and I can just imagine the committee's reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity at least in the next few hundred years it was really bad news first of all worse nutrition maybe shorter lifespans it was simply awful for women the skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning noon and night and politically it was awful it was the beginning of a much higher degree of inequality among people if there had been rational technology assessment then I think they very well might have said let's call the whole thing off even now our choices are having unintended effects historically for example chopsticks according to one Japanese anthropologist who wrote a dissertation about it at the University of Michigan resulted in long-term changes in the dentition in the teeth of the Japanese public and we are also changing our teeth right now there there is evidence that the human mouth and teeth are growing smaller all the time that's not necessarily a bad unintended consequences but I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal there would have been a lot of disapproval of the wimpish choppers that we now have so these things are kind of relative to where you're you or your your ancestors happen to stand in the ancient world there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences there was a very healthy sense of caution reflected in the tree of knowledge in Pandora's Box and especially in the myth of Prometheus that's been so important in recent metaphors about technology and that's all very true the physicians of the ancient world especially the Egyptians who started medicine as we know it were very conscious of what they could and couldn't treat and the translations of the surviving text say this I will not treat this I cannot treat they were very conscious so were the followers of Hippocrates the Hippocratic manuscripts also repeatedly according to recent studies so how important it is not to do harm more recently Harvey Cushing who really developed neurosurgery as we know it who changed it from a field of medicine that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery to one in which there was a hopeful outlook he was very conscious that he was not always going to do the right thing but he did his best and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century we find a new style of technology what we find is no longer simple tools but systems we find more and more complex arrangements of machines that make it harder and harder to diagnose what's going on and the first people who saw that were the telegraphers of the mid 19th century who were the original hackers Thomas Edison would have been very very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today and these hackers have a word for those mysterious bugs and telegraph systems that they called bugs that was the origin of the word bug this consciousness though was a little slow to seep through the general population even people who were very very well-informed Samuel Clemens Mark Twain was a big investor in the most complex machine of all times at least until 1918 registered with the US Patent Office that was the page typesetter the page type setter had 18,000 parts the patent had 64 pages of text and 271 figures it was such a beautiful machine because it did everything that a human being did and setting type including returning the type to its place which was a very difficult thing and Mark Twain who knew all about typesetting really was was smitten by this machine unfortunately he was smitten in more ways than one because it made him bankrupt and he had to tour the world speaking to to recoup his money and this was an important thing about 19th century technology that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea fall apart even when judged by the most expert people now there was something else though in the early 20th century that made things even more complicated and that was that safety technology itself could be a source of danger the lesson of the Titanic for the contemporaries was that you must have enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship and this was the result of the tragic loss of lives of people who could not get into them however there was another pace the Eastland a ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in 1915 and it killed 841 people that was 14 more than the passenger toll of the Titanic the reason for it in part was the extra lifeboats that were added that made this already unstable ship even more unstable and that again proves that when you're talking about unintended consequences it's not that easy to know the right lessons to draw it's it's really a question of the system how the ship was loaded the ballast and many other things so the 20th century then saw how much more complex reality was but it also saw a positive side it saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies it could it could benefit from tragedies and my favorite example of that which is not really widely known as a technological miracle but it may be one of the greatest of all times was the scaling up of penicillin in the Second World War penicillin was discovered in 1928 but even by 1940 no commercially and medically useful quantities of it were being produced a number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it they were working on it independently and they weren't getting anywhere and the government Research Bureau brought representatives together and told them that this is something that has to be done and not only did they do it but within two years they scaled up penicillin from preparation in 1-litre flasks to ten thousand gallon vats that was how quickly penicillin was produced and became one of the greatest medical advance of all time in the Second World War to the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain so there were benefits in calamities benefits to pure science as well as to applied science and medicine now when we come to the period after the Second World War unintended consequences get even more interesting and my favorite example of that occurred beginning in 1976 when it was discovered that the bacteria causing Legionnaires disease had always been present in natural waters but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating ventilating and air-conditioning systems that raised the right temperature for the maximum reproduction of Legionella bacillus well technology to the rescue and so a chemist got to work and they developed a bactericide that became widely used in those systems but something else happened in the early 1980s and that was that there was a mysterious epidemic of failures of tape drives all over the United States and IBM which made them just didn't know what to do they commissioned a group of their best scientists to investigate and what they found was that all these tape drives were located near ventilation ducts what happened was the bactericide was formulated with many traces of 10 and these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads and were crashing the tape heads so they reformulated the bactericide but what's interesting to me is that this was the first case of a mechanical device suffering at least indirectly from a human disease so it shows that we're really all in this together in fact it also shows something interesting that although our capabilities and technology have been expanding geometrically unfortunately our ability to model their long term behavior which has also been increasing has been increasing only arithmetic aliy so one of the characteristic problems of our time is how to close this gap between capabilities and foresight one other very positive consequence of 20th century technology though was the way in which other kinds of calamities could lead to positive advances there are two historians of business at the University of Maryland Brent Goldfarb and David Kirsch who have done some extremely interesting work much of it still unpublished on the history of major innovations they have combined the list of major innovations and they've discovered that the greatest number the greatest decade for fundamental innovations as reflected in all of the lists that others have made a number of lists that they emerged was the Great Depression and nobody knows just why this was so but one story can reflect something of it it was the origin of the Xerox copier which celebrated its fiftieth anniversary last year and Chester Carlson the inventor was a patent attorney he really was not intending to to work in in patent research but he couldn't really find an alternative technical job so this was the best job he could get he was upset by the low quality and high cost of existing patent reproductions and so he started to develop a system of dry photocopying which he patented in the late 1930s and which became the first dry photocopier that was commercially practical in 1960 so we see that sometimes as a result of these dislocations as a result of people leaving their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference that depressions and all kinds of other unfortunate events can have a paradoxically stimulating effect on creativity what does this mean it means I think that we're living in a time of unexpected possibilities think of the financial world for example the mentor of Warren Buffett Benjamin Graham developed his system of value investing as a result of his own losses in the 1929 crash and he published that book in the early 1930s and the book still exists in further editions and is still a fundamental text book so many important creative things can happen when people learn from disasters now think of the large and small plagues that we have now bedbugs killer bees spam and it's very possible that the solutions to those will really extend well beyond the immediate question if we think for example of Louis Pasteur who in the 1860s was asked to study the diseases of silkworms for the silk industry and his discoveries were really the beginning of the germ theory of disease so very often some kind of disaster sometimes the consequence for example of over cultivation of silkworms which was a problem in Europe at the time can be the key to something much bigger so this means that we need to take a different view of unintended consequences we need to take a really positive view we need to see what they can do for us we need to learn from those figures that I've mentioned we need to learn for example from dr. Cushing who killed patients in the course of his early operations he had to have some errors he had to have some mistakes and he learned meticulously from his mistakes and as a result when we say this isn't brain surgery that pays tribute how difficult it was for anyone to learn from their mistakes in a field of medicine that was considered so discouraging in its prospects and we can also remember how the pharmaceutical companies were willing to pool their knowledge to share their knowledge in the face of an emergency which they hadn't really been for years and years they might have been able to do it earlier the message then for me about unintended consequences is chaos happens let's make better use of it thank you very much

**Transcript**:
I didn't always love unintended consequences but I really learned to appreciate them I've learned that they're really the essence of what makes for progress even when they seem to be terrible and I'd like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do let's go to 40,000 years before the present to the time of the cultural explosion when music art technology so many of the things that we're enjoying today so many of the things that are being demonstrated at Ted were born and the anthropologist Randall White has made a very interesting observation that if our ancestors forty thousand years ago had been able to see what they had done they wouldn't have really understood it they were responding to immediate concerns they were making it possible for us to do what they do and yet they didn't really understand how they did it now let's advance to 10,000 years before the present and this is when it really gets interesting what about the domestication of grains what about the origins of Agriculture what would our ancestors 10,000 years ago have said if they really had technology assessment and I can just imagine the committee's reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity at least in the next few hundred years it was really bad news first of all worse nutrition maybe shorter lifespans it was simply awful for women the skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning noon and night and politically it was awful it was the beginning of a much higher degree of inequality among people if there had been rational technology assessment then I think they very well might have said let's call the whole thing off even now our choices are having unintended effects historically for example chopsticks according to one Japanese anthropologist who wrote a dissertation about it at the University of Michigan resulted in long-term changes in the dentition in the teeth of the Japanese public and we are also changing our teeth right now there there is evidence that the human mouth and teeth are growing smaller all the time that's not necessarily a bad unintended consequences but I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal there would have been a lot of disapproval of the wimpish choppers that we now have so these things are kind of relative to where you're you or your your ancestors happen to stand in the ancient world there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences there was a very healthy sense of caution reflected in the tree of knowledge in Pandora's Box and especially in the myth of Prometheus that's been so important in recent metaphors about technology and that's all very true the physicians of the ancient world especially the Egyptians who started medicine as we know it were very conscious of what they could and couldn't treat and the translations of the surviving text say this I will not treat this I cannot treat they were very conscious so were the followers of Hippocrates the Hippocratic manuscripts also repeatedly according to recent studies so how important it is not to do harm more recently Harvey Cushing who really developed neurosurgery as we know it who changed it from a field of medicine that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery to one in which there was a hopeful outlook he was very conscious that he was not always going to do the right thing but he did his best and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century we find a new style of technology what we find is no longer simple tools but systems we find more and more complex arrangements of machines that make it harder and harder to diagnose what's going on and the first people who saw that were the telegraphers of the mid 19th century who were the original hackers Thomas Edison would have been very very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today and these hackers have a word for those mysterious bugs and telegraph systems that they called bugs that was the origin of the word bug this consciousness though was a little slow to seep through the general population even people who were very very well-informed Samuel Clemens Mark Twain was a big investor in the most complex machine of all times at least until 1918 registered with the US Patent Office that was the page typesetter the page type setter had 18,000 parts the patent had 64 pages of text and 271 figures it was such a beautiful machine because it did everything that a human being did and setting type including returning the type to its place which was a very difficult thing and Mark Twain who knew all about typesetting really was was smitten by this machine unfortunately he was smitten in more ways than one because it made him bankrupt and he had to tour the world speaking to to recoup his money and this was an important thing about 19th century technology that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea fall apart even when judged by the most expert people now there was something else though in the early 20th century that made things even more complicated and that was that safety technology itself could be a source of danger the lesson of the Titanic for the contemporaries was that you must have enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship and this was the result of the tragic loss of lives of people who could not get into them however there was another pace the Eastland a ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in 1915 and it killed 841 people that was 14 more than the passenger toll of the Titanic the reason for it in part was the extra lifeboats that were added that made this already unstable ship even more unstable and that again proves that when you're talking about unintended consequences it's not that easy to know the right lessons to draw it's it's really a question of the system how the ship was loaded the ballast and many other things so the 20th century then saw how much more complex reality was but it also saw a positive side it saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies it could it could benefit from tragedies and my favorite example of that which is not really widely known as a technological miracle but it may be one of the greatest of all times was the scaling up of penicillin in the Second World War penicillin was discovered in 1928 but even by 1940 no commercially and medically useful quantities of it were being produced a number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it they were working on it independently and they weren't getting anywhere and the government Research Bureau brought representatives together and told them that this is something that has to be done and not only did they do it but within two years they scaled up penicillin from preparation in 1-litre flasks to ten thousand gallon vats that was how quickly penicillin was produced and became one of the greatest medical advance of all time in the Second World War to the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain so there were benefits in calamities benefits to pure science as well as to applied science and medicine now when we come to the period after the Second World War unintended consequences get even more interesting and my favorite example of that occurred beginning in 1976 when it was discovered that the bacteria causing Legionnaires disease had always been present in natural waters but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating ventilating and air-conditioning systems that raised the right temperature for the maximum reproduction of Legionella bacillus well technology to the rescue and so a chemist got to work and they developed a bactericide that became widely used in those systems but something else happened in the early 1980s and that was that there was a mysterious epidemic of failures of tape drives all over the United States and IBM which made them just didn't know what to do they commissioned a group of their best scientists to investigate and what they found was that all these tape drives were located near ventilation ducts what happened was the bactericide was formulated with many traces of 10 and these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads and were crashing the tape heads so they reformulated the bactericide but what's interesting to me is that this was the first case of a mechanical device suffering at least indirectly from a human disease so it shows that we're really all in this together in fact it also shows something interesting that although our capabilities and technology have been expanding geometrically unfortunately our ability to model their long term behavior which has also been increasing has been increasing only arithmetic aliy so one of the characteristic problems of our time is how to close

Cushing who killed patients in the course of his early operations he had to have some errors he had to have some mistakes and he learned meticulously from his mistakes and as a result when we say this isn't brain surgery that pays tribute how difficult it was for anyone to learn from their mistakes in a field of medicine that was considered so discouraging in its prospects and we can also remember how the pharmaceutical companies were willing to pool their knowledge to share their knowledge in the face of an emergency which they hadn't really been for years and years they might have been able to do it earlier the message then for me about unintended consequences is chaos happens let's make better use of it thank you very much

Gravity. It controls the universe. Everything attracts everything else. Ouch! Including you. Ow! In this final lesson, we'll explore what gravity means for space-time, or rather what space-time means for gravity. Until now, we've been dealing with things moving at constant speeds, with straight world lines in space-time. But once you add gravity, if you measure a speed at one moment, then again a bit later, the speed may have changed. In other words, as I discovered, gravity causes acceleration, so we need the world line to look different from one moment to the next. As we saw in the last lesson, the correct way to tilt an object's world line is using a Lorentz transformation: Einstein's stretch and squash trick. So, to map out what gravity is doing to Tom's motion, we need to create a whole load of little patches of space-time, each transformed by different amounts. So that my world line is at a different angle in each one. And then, we're ready to stitch everything together. We assemble a cozy quilt of space-time where world lines look curved. Where the world lines join, the objects collide. By making these connections between the patches, a curvature gets built into space-time itself. But Einstein's true genius was to describe precisely how each patch is stretched and squashed according to nearby mass and energy. The mere presence of stuff curves the space-time, and curving space-time moves the stuff around. This is gravity, according to Einstein. Previously, Isaac Newton had explained gravity using the ideas of force and acceleration, without any wibbily wobbly space-time, and that did pretty well. But Einstein's theory does just slightly better at predicting, for example, the orbit of Mercury around the Sun, or the way that light rays are deflected by massive objects. More importantly, Einstein's theory predicts things that simply don't exist in older theories where space, time and gravity were separate. The stitching can leave wrinkles in the space-time material. These are called gravitational waves, which should be detectable as tiny, repetitive, subtle squashes and stretches in space. So we're building experiments to check if they are there. In the meantime, indirect evidence, most recently in the polarization patterns of light left over from the Big Bang, strongly suggest that they are. But despite Einstein's successes, when too much stuff gets concentrated in too small a space, like in a black hole, the curvature of space-time becomes so large, that his equations collapse. We need a new picture of space-time that incorporates quantum mechanics to unlock the secret at the heart of black holes. Which means there's plenty more to be discovered about space, time, and space-time in the future.

So, to map out what gravity is doing to Tom's motion, we need to create a whole load of little patches of space-time, each transformed by different amounts. So that my world line is at a different angle in each one. And then, we're ready to stitch everything together. We assemble a cozy quilt of space-time where world lines look curved. Where the world lines join, the objects collide. By making these connections between the patches, a curvature gets built into space-time itself. But Einstein's true genius was to describe precisely how each patch is stretched and squashed according to nearby mass and energy. The mere presence of stuff curves the space-time, and curving space-time moves the stuff around. This is gravity, according to Einstein. Previously, Isaac Newton had explained gravity using the ideas of force and acceleration, without any wibbily wobbly space-time, and that did pretty well. But Einstein's theory does just slightly better at predicting, for example, the orbit of Mercury around the Sun, or the way that light rays are deflected by massive objects. More importantly, Einstein's theory predicts things that simply don't exist in older theories where space, time and gravity were separate. The stitching can leave wrinkles in the space-time material. These are called gravitational waves, which should be detectable as tiny, repetitive, subtle squashes and stretches in space. So we're building experiments to check if they are there. In the meantime, indirect evidence, most recently in the polarization patterns of light left over from the Big Bang, strongly suggest that they are. But despite Einstein's successes, when too much stuff gets concentrated in too small a space, like in a black hole, the curvature of space-time becomes so large, that his equations collapse. We need a new picture of space-time that incorporates quantum mechanics to unlock the secret at the heart of black holes. Which means there's plenty more to be discovered about space, time, and space-time in the future.

**Transcript**:
Cancer is like a car crash. Your body typically regulates the speed at which your cells divide, but sometimes, cancer cuts the brake lines, and your cells divide too quickly, accumulating mutations that cause them to veer away from their original function, form dangerous tumors, and land you in the hospital. Cancer is basically an inability of the body to control the speed at which cells divide. When cells divide too quickly, they can often accumulate mutations that cause them to ignore their original function in the body, forming tumors. In turn, these tumors may interfere with the natural processes of the body, such as digestion and respiration, potentially leading to death. Typically, your body has a number of genetic mechanisms to control how fast your cells divide. One of these genes is BRCA1, which stands for breast cancer susceptibility gene 1. BRCA1 belongs to a class of genes called tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressor genes are involved in regulating how fast a cell divides. Normally, cell division follows an orderly process called the cell cycle, which is basically the life cycle of a cell. Within the cell cycle is a series of checkpoints, where proteins, such as the one produced by BRCA1, regulate how fast the cell may proceed. How does it do this? BRCA1 helps repair some forms of mutation in your DNA. If your DNA is damaged, BRCA1 keeps the cell from dividing until the mutation is repaired. You have two copies of the BRCA1 gene in every cell of your body. One copy you inherited from Mom, the other from Dad. This redundancy is a good a thing because you only need one functioning BRCA1 gene in a cell to regulate the cell cycle. But it's important to note that while these copies have a similar function they're not necessarily the same. In fact, there are hundreds of variations, or alleles, of BRCA1. Some regulate the cell cycle more effectively than others. In other words, some people are born with better regulating and repair mechanisms than others. And in some cases, mutations may render BRCA1 ineffective. When this happens, cells with damaged DNA are allowed to divide. As they divide, these cells may accumulate additional mutations. These mutations may cause the cell to become less specialized and stop performing its original function in the tissue. If this occurs, then there's a greater chance they'll develop into cancer cells. While we all have the gene, such as BRCA1, that can cause cancer, it's only when these genes fail at their function that problems develop. Having an ineffective or mutated version of BRCA1 can increase your susceptibility to cancer, much like driving with bad brakes increases the risk of an accident.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] I'd like to begin with a thought experiment imagine that it's 4,000 years into the future civilization as we know it has ceased to exist no books no electronic device no Facebook or Twitter all knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet has been lost now imagine archaeologists digging through the rubble of one of our cities what might they find well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic with stange symbols on them perhaps some circular pieces of metal maybe some cylindrical containers with some symbols on them and perhaps one Arch ologist becomes an instant celebrity when she discovers buried in the Hills somewhere in North America massive versions of these same symbols now let's ask ourselves what could such artifacts say about us to people 4,000 years into the future now this is no hypothetical question in fact this is exactly the kind of question we're faced with when we try to understand the Indus Valley Civilization which existed 4,000 years ago now the Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous with the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations so it occupied an area of approximately 1 million square kilometers covering what is now Pakistan Northwestern India and parts of Afghanistan and Iran now given that it was such a vast civilization you might expect to find really powerful rulers Kings and huge monuments glorifying these powerful Kings in fact what archaeologists have found is none of that they found small objects such as these so here's an example of one of these objects well obviously there's a replica but who is this person a king a god a priest or perhaps an ordinary person like you or me we don't know but the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them well no not pieces of plastic but Stone seals copper tablets pottery and surprisingly one large sign board which was found buried near the Gate of a city now we don't know if it says Hollywood or even Bollywood for that matter in fact we don't even know what any of these objects say and that's because the IND script is undeciphered we don't know what any of these symbols mean now the symbols are most commonly found on seals so you'll see up there one such object it's the square object with the Unicorn like animal on it now that's a magnificent piece of art so how big do you you think that is perhaps that big or maybe that big well let me show you so here's a replica of one such seal it's only about 1 in by 1 in in size pretty tiny so what were these used for we know that these were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other so you know those packing slips you get on your FedEx boxes so these were used to make those kinds of packing slips now you might wonder what these objects contain in terms of their text so perhaps they the name of the the sender or some information about the goods that are being send from one place to the other we don't know we would need to decipher the script to answer that question now deciphering the script is not just an intellectual puzzle it's actually become a question that's become deeply intertwined with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia in fact the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people so first there's a group of people who are very passionate in their belief that the indis script does not represent a language at all these people believe that the symbols are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs or the emblems you find on Shields now there's a second group of people who believe that the indos script represents an Indo-European language so if you look at a map of India today you'll see that most of the languages spoken in North India belong to the Indo European language family so some people believe that the indos script represents an ancient Indo-European language such as Sanskrit now there's a last group of people who believe that the Indus people were the ancestors of people living in South India today now these people believe that the indos script represents an ancient form of the dravidian language family which is the language family spoken in much of South India today and the proponents of this Theory point to that small pocket of dravidian speaking people in the north actually near Afghanistan and they say that perhaps sometime in the past past dravidian languages were spoken all over India and that this suggests that the Indus civilizations perhaps also dravidian now which of these hypotheses can be true we don't know but perhaps if you decipher the script you would be able to answer this question but deciphering the script is a very challenging Tex first there's no Rosetta Stone well I don't mean the software I mean an ancient artifact that contains the same text in both a known text and in an unknown text so we don't have such an artifact for the indos script and furthermore we don't even know what language they spoke and to make matters even worse most of the texts that we have are extremely short so as I showed you they're usually found on these seals that are very very tiny and so given these formidable obstacles one might wonder and worry whether one will ever be able to decipher the IND the script so in the rest of my talk I'd like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying and love the challenge posted by the indes script now I've always been fascinated by the indes script ever since I read about it in a middle school textbook and why was that fascinated well it's the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world now my career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist so in my day job I create computer models of the brain to try to understand how the brain makes predictions how the brain makes decisions how the brain learns and so on but in 2007 my path crossed again with the indos script that's when I was in India and I had the wonderful opportunity to meet with some Indian scientists who were using computer models to try to analyze the script and so it was then that I realized it was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists and so I jumped at that opportunity and I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found or better yet let's talk collectively decipher you ready the first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script is try to figure out the direction of writing so here are two texts that contain some symbols on them so can you tell me if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right I'll give you give a couple of seconds okay right to left how many okay left to right oh it's almost 50/50 okay so the answer is if you look at the left hand side of the two texts you'll notice that there's a cramping of signs and it seems like 4,000 years ago when the Scribe was writing from right to left they ran out of space and so they had to cram the signs and one of the signs is also below the the text on the top and so this suggests the direction of writing was probably from right to left and so that's one of the first things we know directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts and the indos script now has this particular property what are the properties of language does it show so languages contain patterns right so if I give you the letter q and I ask you to predict the next letter what do you think that would be most of you said U which is right now if I ask you to predict one more letter what do you think that would be now there are several possibilities e it could be I it could be a but certainly not B C or D right right now the indes script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns so there's a lot of text that start with this diamond shaped symbol and this in turn tends to be followed by this quotation marks like symbol and this is very similar to a q andu example this symbol can in turn be followed by these fish like symbols and some other signs but never by these other signs at the bottom and furthermore there's some signs that really prefer the end of text such as this jar-shaped sign and this sign in fact happens to be also the most frequently occurring sign in the script now given such patterns here was our idea right so the idea was to use a computer to learn these patterns and so we gave the computer the existing text and the computer learned a statistical model of which symbols tend to occur together and which symbols tend to follow each other now given the computer model we can test the model by essentially quizzing it so we could deliberately erase some symbols and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols so here are some examples so you may regard this as perhaps the most ancient game of The Wheel of Fortune so what we found was that the computer was successful in 75% of the cases in predicting the correct symbol now in the rest of the cases typically the second best guess or the third best guess was the right answer now there's also practical use for this particular procedure there's a lot of these texts that are damaged so here's an example of one such text and we can use the computer model now to to try to complete this text and make a best guess prediction so here's an example of a symbol that was predicted and this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script by generating more data that we can analyze now here's one other thing you could do with the computer model so imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard okay you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this now such a random jumble of letters is set to have a very high entropy this is a physics and information Theory term but just imagine it's a a very random dumble of letters now how many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard you might have encountered the stuck key problem so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again now this kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy because there's no variation at all Now language on the other hand has an intermediate level of entropy it's neither too rigid nor is it too random what about the IND the script so here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences so at the very top you find the uniformly r random sequence which is a random jumble of letters and interestingly also find a DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music and both of these are very very flexible which is why you find them at a very high range now at the lower end of the scale you find a rigid sequence a sequence of all A's and you also find a computer program in this case in the language Fortran which obeys really strict rules linguistic scripts occupy the middle range now what about the indos script so we found that the indos script actually falls within the range of the linguistic script scripts now when this result was first published it was highly controversial there were people who were raising a human cribe and these people were the ones who believed that the indos script does not represent language I even started to get some hate mail my students said that I should really seriously consider getting some protection now who would have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession now what does this result really show it shows that the indos script shares an important property of language anguage so as the old saying goes if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands so what other evidence is there that the script could actually encode language well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages so for example here's the same sentence written in English and the same sentence written in Dutch using the same letters of the alphabet now if you don't know Dutch and you only know English and I give you some words in Dutch you'll tell me that these words contain some very unusual patterns some things are not right and you'll say these words are probably not English words now the same thing also happens in the case of the indes script so the computer found several texts two of them are shown here that have very unusual patterns so for example the first text there's a doubling of this jar shaped sign now this sign is the most frequently occurring sign in the IND script and it's only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair so why is that the case we went back and looked at where these particular texts were found it turns out that they were found very very far away from the Indus Valley they were found in present day Iraq and Iran and why were they found there well what I haven't told you is that the Indus people were very very enterprising they used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived and so in this case they were traveling by sea all the way to Mesopotamia present day Iraq and what seems to happen here is that the indust Traders the the Merchants were using the script to write a foreign language it's just like our English and Dutch example and that would explain why we have these strange patterns that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the texts that are found within the indis value so this suggests the same script the indis script could be used to write different languages the results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion that the IND script probably does represent language so if it does represent language then how do we read the symbol that's our next big challenge so you'll notice that many of the symbols look like pictures of humans of insects of fishes of birds so most ancient scripts use the Rebus principle which is using pictures to represent words so as an example here's a word can you write it using pictures I'll give you a couple of seconds got it okay great so here's my solution so you could use the picture of a bee followed by picture of a leaf and that's belief right it could be other Solutions now in the case of the IND descript the problem is the reverse so you have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense so this is just like a crossword puzzle except that this is the mother of all crossw puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it now my colleagues mahadevan and as parpola have been making some Headway on this particular problem and I'd like to give you a quick example of uh parula's work so here's a really short text it contains seven vertical Strokes followed by this fish-like sign and I already mentioned that these seals were used for stamping clay TXS that were attached to bundles of goods so it's quite likely that these TXS at least some of them contain names of merchants and it turns out that in India there's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and the and star constellations present at the time of birth in dravidian languages the word for fish is mean which happens to sound just just like the word for star and so Seven Stars would stand for alumine which is the dravidian word for the Big Dipper Star constellation now similarly there's another sequence of six stars and that translates to aromin which is the old dravidian name for the Star constellation ples and finally there's other combinations such as this fish sign with a something that looks like a roof on top of it and that could be translated into Mayan which is the old dravidian name for the planet Saturn so this is pretty exciting it looks like we're getting somewhere but does this prove that the these seals contain dran names based on planets and star constellations well not yet so we cannot we have no way of validating these particular readings but if more and more of these readings start making sense and if more if longer and longer sequences are appear to be correct then we know that we on the right track so today we can write a word such as Ted in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in the uniform script because both of these were deciphered in the 19th century the decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly now the Mayans started speaking to us in the 20th century but the Indo civilization remains silent so why should we care well the IND civilization does not belong to just the South Indians or the North Indians or the pakistanis it belongs to all of us so these are our ancestors yours and mine they were silenced by an unfortunate accident of history now if you decipher the script you would enable them to speak to us again so what would they tell us what would we find out about them about us I can't wait to find out thank [Applause] you

suggests the direction of writing was probably from right to left and so that's one of the first things we know directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts and the indos script now has this particular property what are the properties of language does it show so languages contain patterns right so if I give you the letter q and I ask you to predict the next letter what do you think that would be most of you said U which is right now if I ask you to predict one more letter what do you think that would be now there are several possibilities e it could be I it could be a but certainly not B C or D right right now the indes script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns so there's a lot of text that start with this diamond shaped symbol and this in turn tends to be followed by this quotation marks like symbol and this is very similar to a q andu example this symbol can in turn be followed by these fish like symbols and some other signs but never by these other signs at the bottom and furthermore there's some signs that really prefer the end of text such as this jar-shaped sign and this sign in fact happens to be also the most frequently occurring sign in the script now given such patterns here was our idea right so the idea was to use a computer to learn these patterns and so we gave the computer the existing text and the computer learned a statistical model of which symbols tend to occur together and which symbols tend to follow each other now given the computer model we can test the model by essentially quizzing it so we could deliberately erase some symbols and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols so here are some examples so you may regard this as perhaps the most ancient game of The Wheel of Fortune so what we found was that the computer was successful in 75% of the cases in predicting the correct symbol now in the rest of the cases typically the second best guess or the third best guess was the right answer now there's also practical use for this particular procedure there's a lot of these texts that are damaged so here's an example of one such text and we can use the computer model now to to try to complete this text and make a best guess prediction so here's an example of a symbol that was predicted and this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script by generating more data that we can analyze now here's one other thing you could do with the computer model so imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard okay you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this now such a random jumble of letters is set to have a very high entropy this is a physics and information Theory term but just imagine it's a a very random dumble of letters now how many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard you might have encountered the stuck key problem so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again now this kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy because there's no variation at all Now language on the other hand has an intermediate level of entropy it's neither too rigid nor is it too random what about the IND the script so here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences so at the very top you find the uniformly r random sequence which is a random jumble of letters and interestingly also find a DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music and both of these are very very flexible which is why you find them at a very high range now at the lower end of the scale you find a rigid sequence a sequence of all A's and you also find a computer program in this case in the language Fortran which obeys really strict rules linguistic scripts occupy the middle range now what about the indos script so we found that the indos script actually falls within the range of the linguistic script scripts now when this result was first published it was highly controversial there were people who were raising a human cribe and these people were the ones who believed that the indos script does not represent language I even started to get some hate mail my students said that I should really seriously consider getting some protection now who would have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession now what does this result really show it shows that the indos script shares an important property of language anguage so as the old saying goes if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands so what other evidence is there that the script could actually encode language well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages so for example here's the same sentence written in English and the same sentence written in Dutch using the same letters of the alphabet now if you don't know Dutch and you only know English and I give you some words in Dutch you'll tell me that these words contain some very unusual patterns some things are not right and you'll say these words are probably not English words now the same thing also happens in the case of the indes script so the computer found several texts two of them are shown here that have very unusual patterns so for example the first text there's a doubling of this jar shaped sign now this sign is the most frequently occurring sign in the IND script and it's only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair so why is that the case we went back and looked at where these particular texts were found it turns out that they were found very very far away from the Indus Valley they were found in present day Iraq and Iran and why were they found there well what I haven't told you is that the Indus people were very very enterprising they used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived and so in this case they were traveling by sea all the way to Mesopotamia present day Iraq and what seems to happen here is that the indust Traders the the Merchants were using the script to write a foreign language it's just like our English and Dutch example and that would explain why we have these strange patterns that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the texts that are found within the indis value so this suggests the same script the indis script could be used to write different languages the results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion that the IND script probably does represent language so if it does represent language then how do we read the symbol that's our next big challenge so you'll notice that many of the symbols look like pictures of humans of insects of fishes of birds so most ancient scripts use the Rebus principle which is using pictures to represent words so as an example here's a word can you write it using pictures I'll give you a couple of seconds got it okay great so here's my solution so you could use the picture of a bee followed by picture of a leaf and that's belief right it could be other Solutions now in the case of the IND descript the problem is the reverse so you have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense so this is just like a crossword puzzle except that this is the mother of all crossw puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it now my colleagues mahadevan and as parpola have been making some Headway on this particular problem and I'd like to give you a quick example of uh parula's work so here's a really short text it contains seven vertical Strokes followed by this fish-like sign and I already mentioned that these seals were used for stamping clay TXS that were attached to bundles of goods so it's quite likely that these TXS at least some of them contain names of merchants and it turns out that in India there's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and the and star constellations present at the time of birth in dravidian languages the word for fish is mean which happens to sound just just like the word for star and so Seven Stars would stand for alumine which is the dravidian word for the Big Dipper Star constellation now similarly there's another sequence of six stars and that translates to aromin which is the old dravidian name for the Star constellation ples and finally there's other combinations such as this fish sign with a something that looks like a roof on top of it and that could be translated into Mayan which is the old dravidian name for the planet Saturn so this is pretty exciting it looks like we're getting somewhere but does this prove that the these seals contain dran names based on planets and star constellations well not yet so we cannot we have no way of validating these particular readings but if more and more of these readings start making sense and if more if longer and longer sequences are appear to be correct then we know that we on the right track so today we can write a word such as Ted in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in the uniform script because both of these were deciphered in the 19th century the decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly now the Mayans started speaking to us in the 20th century but the Indo civilization remains silent so why should we care well the IND civilization does not belong to just the South Indians or the North Indians or the pakistanis it belongs to all of us so these are our ancestors yours and mine they were silenced by an unfortunate accident of history now if you decipher the script you would enable them to speak to us again so what would they tell us what would we find out about them about us I can't wait to find out thank [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
When you hear the word symmetry, maybe you picture a simple geometric shape like a square or a triangle, or the complex pattern on a butterfly's wings. If you are artistically inclined, you might think of the subtle modulations of a Mozart concerto, or the effortless poise of a prima ballerina. When used in every day life, the word symmetry represents vague notions of beauty, harmony and balance. In math and science, symmetry has a different, and very specific, meaning. In this technical sense, a symmetry is the property of an object. Pretty much any type of object can have symmetry, from tangible things like butterflies, to abstract entities like geometric shapes. So, what does it mean for an object to be symmetric? Here's the definition: a symmetry is a transformation that leaves that object unchanged. Okay, that sounds a bit abstract, so let's unpack it. It will help to look at a particular example, like this equilateral triangle. If we rotate our triangle through 120 degrees, around an access through its center, we end up with a triangle that's identical to the original. In this case, the object is the triangle, and the transformation that leaves the object unchanged is rotation through 120 degrees. So we can say an equilateral triangle is symmetric with respect to rotations of 120 degrees around its center. If we rotated the triangle by, say, 90 degrees instead, the rotated triangle would look different to the original. In other words, an equilateral triangle is not symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees around its center. But why do mathematicians and scientists care about symmetries? Turns out, they're essential in many fields of math and science. Let's take a close look at one example: symmetry in biology. You might have noticed that there's a very familiar kind of symmetry we haven't mentioned yet: the symmetry of the right and left sides of the human body. The transformation that gives this symmetry is reflection by an imaginary mirror that slices vertically through the body. Biologists call this bilateral symmetry. As with all symmetries found in living things, it's only approximate, but still a striking feature of the human body. We humans aren't the only bilaterally symmetric organisms. Many other animals, foxes, sharks, beetles, that butterfly we mentioned earlier, have this kind of symmetry, as do some plants like orchid flowers. Other organisms have different symmetries, ones that only become apparent when you rotate the organism around its center point. It's a lot like the rotational symmetry of the triangle we watched earlier. But when it occurs in animals, this kind of symmetry is known as radial symmetry. For instance, some sea urchins and starfish have pentaradial or five-fold symmetry, that is, symmetry with respect to rotations of 72 degrees around their center. This symmetry also appears in plants, as you can see for yourself by slicing through an apple horizontally. Some jellyfish are symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees, while sea anemones are symmetric when you rotate them at any angle. Some corals, on the other hand, have no symmetry at all. They are completely asymmetric. But why do organisms exhibit these different symmetries? Does body symmetry tell us anything about an animal's lifestyle? Let's look at one particular group: bilaterally symmetric animals. In this camp, we have foxes, beetles, sharks, butterflies, and, of course, humans. The thing that unites bilaterally symmetric animals is that their bodies are designed around movement. If you want to pick one direction and move that way, it helps to have a front end where you can group your sensory organs-- your eyes, ears and nose. It helps to have your mouth there too since you're more likely to run into food or enemies from this end. You're probably familiar with a name for a group of organs, plus a mouth, mounted on the front of an animal's body. It's called a head. Having a head leads naturally to the development of bilateral symmetry. And it also helps you build streamlined fins if you're a fish, aerodynamic wings if you're a bird, or well coordinated legs for running if you're a fox. But, what does this all have to do with evolution? Turns out, biologists can use these various body symmetries to figure out which animals are related to which. For instance, we saw that starfish and sea urchins have five-fold symmetry. But really what we should have said was adult starfish and sea urchins. In their larval stage, they're bilateral, just like us humans. For biologists, this is strong evidence that we're more closely related to starfish than we are, to say, corals, or other animals that don't exhibit bilateral symmetry at any stage in their development. One of the most fascinating and important problems in biology is reconstructing the tree of life, discovering when and how the different branches diverged. Thinking about something as simple as body symmetry can help us dig far into our evolutionary past and understand where we, as a species, have come from.

**Transcript**:
When you hear the word symmetry, maybe you picture a simple geometric shape like a square or a triangle, or the complex pattern on a butterfly's wings. If you are artistically inclined, you might think of the subtle modulations of a Mozart concerto, or the effortless poise of a prima ballerina. When used in every day life, the word symmetry represents vague notions of beauty, harmony and balance. In math and science, symmetry has a different, and very specific, meaning. In this technical sense, a symmetry is the property of an object. Pretty much any type of object can have symmetry, from tangible things like butterflies, to abstract entities like geometric shapes. So, what does it mean for an object to be symmetric? Here's the definition: a symmetry is a transformation that leaves that object unchanged. Okay, that sounds a bit abstract, so let's unpack it. It will help to look at a particular example, like this equilateral triangle. If we rotate our triangle through 120 degrees, around an access through its center, we end up with a triangle that's identical to the original. In this case, the object is the triangle, and the transformation that leaves the object unchanged is rotation through 120 degrees. So we can say an equilateral triangle is symmetric with respect to rotations of 120 degrees around its center. If we rotated the triangle by, say, 90 degrees instead, the rotated triangle would look different to the original. In other words, an equilateral triangle is not symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees around its center. But why do mathematicians and scientists care about symmetries? Turns out, they're essential in many fields of math and science. Let's take a close look at one example: symmetry in biology. You might have noticed that there's a very familiar kind of symmetry we haven't mentioned yet: the symmetry of the right and left sides of the human body. The transformation that gives this symmetry is reflection by an imaginary mirror that slices vertically through the body. Biologists call this bilateral symmetry. As with all symmetries found in living things, it's only approximate, but still a striking feature of the human body. We humans aren't the only bilaterally symmetric organisms. Many other animals, foxes, sharks, beetles, that butterfly we mentioned earlier, have this kind of symmetry, as do some plants like orchid flowers. Other organisms have different symmetries, ones that only become apparent when you rotate the organism around its center point. It's a lot like the rotational symmetry of the triangle we watched earlier. But when it occurs in animals, this kind of symmetry is known as radial symmetry. For instance, some sea urchins and starfish have pentaradial or five-fold symmetry, that is, symmetry with respect to rotations of 72 degrees around their center. This symmetry also appears in plants, as you can see for yourself by slicing through an apple horizontally. Some jellyfish are symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees, while sea anemones are symmetric when you rotate them at any angle. Some corals, on the other hand, have no symmetry at all. They are completely asymmetric. But why do organisms exhibit these different symmetries? Does body symmetry tell us anything about an animal's lifestyle? Let's look at one particular group: bilaterally symmetric animals. In this camp, we have foxes, beetles, sharks, butterflies, and, of course, humans. The thing that unites bilaterally symmetric animals is that their bodies are designed around movement. If you want to pick one direction and move that way, it helps to have a front end where you can group your sensory organs-- your eyes, ears and nose. It helps to have your mouth there too since you're more likely to run into food or enemies from this end. You're probably familiar with a name for a group of organs, plus a mouth, mounted on the front of an animal's body. It's called a head. Having a head leads naturally to the development of bilateral symmetry. And it also helps you build streamlined fins if you're a fish, aerodynamic wings if you're a bird, or well coordinated legs for running if you're a fox. But, what does this all have to do with evolution? Turns out, biologists can use these various body symmetries to figure out which animals are related to which. For instance, we saw that starfish and sea urchins have five-fold symmetry. But really what we should have said was adult starfish and sea urchins. In their larval stage, they're bilateral, just like us humans. For biologists, this is strong evidence that we're more closely related to starfish than we are, to say, corals, or other animals that don't exhibit bilateral symmetry at any stage in their development. One of the most fascinating and important problems in biology is reconstructing the tree of life, discovering when and how the different branches diverged. Thinking about something as simple as body symmetry can help us dig far into our evolutionary past and understand where we, as a species, have come from.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest that the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the list. The ground truth MCQ is asking about pentaradial symmetry, which is mentioned in the transcript as a type of radial symmetry found in some sea urchins and starfish, characterized by symmetry with respect to rotations of 72 degrees around their center.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the radial symmetry concept, I would suggest Question 5: Which of the following organisms exhibit radial symmetry? Options: A. Humans, B. Foxes, C. Starfish, D. Corals Correct Option: C

However, please note that this question does not specifically ask about pentaradial symmetry or the angle of rotation, so it's not a perfect match.

If you'd like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The World Wide Web, where you're likely watching this video, is used by millions of people every day for everything from checking the weather, ordering food, and chatting with friends to raising funds, sharing news, or starting revolutions. We use it from our computers, our phones, even our cars. It's just there, all around us, all the time. But what is it exactly? Well first of all, the World Wide Web is not the Internet, even though the terms are often used interchangeably. The Internet is simply the way computers connect to each other in order to share information. When the Internet first emerged, computers actually made direct calls to each other. Today, networks are all around us, so computers can communicate seamlessly. The communication enabled through the Internet has many uses, such as email, file transfer, and conferencing. But the most common use is accessing the World Wide Web. Think of the Web as a bunch of skyscrapers, each representing a web server, a computer always connected to the Internet, specifically designed to store information and share it. When someone starts a website, they are renting a room in this skyscraper, filling it with information and linking that information together in an organized way for others to access. The people who own these skyscrapers and rent space in them are called web hosts, but anyone can set up a web server with the right equipment a bit of know-how. There's another part to having a website, without which we would be lost in the city with no way of finding what we need. This is the website address, which consists of domain names. Just like with a real life address, a website address lets you get where you want to go. The information stored in the websites is in web languages, such as HTML and JavaScript. When we find the website we're looking for, our web browser is able to take all the code on the site and turn it into words, graphics, and videos. We don't need to know any special computer languages because the web browser creates a graphic interface for us. So, in a lot of ways, the World Wide Web is a big virtual city where we communicate with each other in web languages, with browsers acting as our translators. And just like no one owns a city, no one owns the Web; it belongs to all of us. Anyone can move in and set up shop. We might have to pay an Internet service provider to gain access, a hosting company to rent web space, or a registrar to reserve our web address. Like utility companies in a city, these companies provide crucial services, but in the end, not even they own the Web. But what really makes the Web so special lies in its very name. Prior to the Web, we used to consume most information in a linear fashion. In a book or newspaper article, each sentence was read from beginning to end, page by page, in a straight line until you reached the end. But that isn't how our brains actually work. Each of our thoughts is linked to other thoughts, memories, and emotions in a loose interconnected network, like a web. Tim Berners-Lee, the father of the World Wide Web, understood that we needed a way to organize information that mirrored this natural arrangement. And the Web accomplishes this through hyperlinks. By linking several pages within a website or even redirecting you to other websites to expand on information or ideas immediately as you encounter them, hyperlinks allow the Web to operate along the same lines as our thought patterns. The Web is so much a part of our lives because in content and structure, it reflects both the wider society and our individual minds. And it connects those minds across all boundaries, not only enthnicity, gender, and age but even time and space.

**Transcript**:
The World Wide Web, where you're likely watching this video, is used by millions of people every day for everything from checking the weather, ordering food, and chatting with friends to raising funds, sharing news, or starting revolutions. We use it from our computers, our phones, even our cars. It's just there, all around us, all the time. But what is it exactly? Well first of all, the World Wide Web is not the Internet, even though the terms are often used interchangeably. The Internet is simply the way computers connect to each other in order to share information. When the Internet first emerged, computers actually made direct calls to each other. Today, networks are all around us, so computers can communicate seamlessly. The communication enabled through the Internet has many uses, such as email, file transfer, and conferencing. But the most common use is accessing the World Wide Web. Think of the Web as a bunch of skyscrapers, each representing a web server, a computer always connected to the Internet, specifically designed to store information and share it. When someone starts a website, they are renting a room in this skyscraper, filling it with information and linking that information together in an organized way for others to access. The people who own these skyscrapers and rent space in them are called web hosts, but anyone can set up a web server with the right equipment a bit of know-how. There's another part to having a website, without which we would be lost in the city with no way of finding what we need. This is the website address, which consists of domain names. Just like with a real life address, a website address lets you get where you want to go. The information stored in the websites is in web languages, such as HTML and JavaScript. When we find the website we're looking for, our web browser is able to take all the code on the site and turn it into words, graphics, and videos. We don't need to know any special computer languages because the web browser creates a graphic interface for us. So, in a lot of ways, the World Wide Web is a big virtual city where we communicate with each other in web languages, with browsers acting as our translators. And just like no one owns a city, no one owns the Web; it belongs to all of us. Anyone can move in and set up shop. We might have to pay an Internet service provider to gain access, a hosting company to rent web space, or a registrar to reserve our web address. Like utility companies in a city, these companies provide crucial services, but in the end, not even they own the Web. But what really makes the Web so special lies in its very name. Prior to the Web, we used to consume most information in a linear fashion. In a book or newspaper article, each sentence was read from beginning to end, page by page, in a straight line until you reached the end. But that isn't how our brains actually work. Each of our thoughts is linked to other thoughts, memories, and emotions in a loose interconnected network, like a web. Tim Berners-Lee, the father of the World Wide Web, understood that we needed a way to organize information that mirrored this natural arrangement. And the Web accomplishes this through hyperlinks. By linking several pages within a website or even redirecting you to other websites to expand on information or ideas immediately as you encounter them, hyperlinks allow the Web to operate along the same lines as our thought patterns. The Web is so much a part of our lives because in content and structure, it reflects both the wider society and our individual minds. And it connects those minds across all boundaries, not only enthnicity, gender, and age but even time and space.

**Transcript**:
There are over one billion cars
in the world today, getting people where they need to go, but cars aren't just
a mode of transportation, they're also a chemistry lesson
waiting to be taught. The process of starting your car
begins in the engine cylinders, where a spritz of gasoline
from the fuel injector and a gulp of air
from the intake valve mix together before 
being ignited by a spark, forming gases that expand and push the piston. But combustion is an exothermic reaction,
meaning it releases heat. Lots of it. And while much of this heat escapes
through the tail pipe, the heat that remains in the engine block
needs to be absorbed, transported, and dissipated to protect the metal components
from deforming or even melting. This is where the cooling system comes in. A liquid gets circulated
throughout the engine, but what kind of liquid
can absorb all that heat? Water may seem like an obvious first choice. After all, its specific heat, the amount of energy required
to raise the temperature of a given amount
by one degree Celsius, is higher than that of
any other common substance. And we have a lot of heat energy to absorb. But using water can get us
into deep trouble. For one thing, its freezing point
is zero degrees Celsius. Since water expands
as it freezes, a cold winter night could mean
a cracked radiator and a damaged engine block, a chilling prospect. And considering how hot
car engines can get, the relatively low boiling point
of 100 degrees Celsius can lead to a situation
that would get anyone steamed. So, instead of water,
we use a solution, a homogeneous mixture consisting
of a solute and a solvent. Some of the solution's properties will differ
depending on the proportion of solute present. These are called colligative properties,
and as luck would have it, they include freezing point depression
and boiling point elevation. So, solutions have both a lower freezing point
and a higher boiling point than pure solvent, and the more solute is present,
the bigger the difference. So, why do these properties change? First of all, we need to understand that
temperature is a measure of the particle's average kinetic energy. The colder the liquid,
the less of this energy there is, and the slower the molecules move. When a liquid freezes,
the molecules slow down, enough for their attractive forces
to act on each other, arranging themselves into a crystal structure. But the presence of solute particles
gets in the way of these attractions, requiring a solution to be cooled down further
before the arrangement can occur. As for the boiling point,
when a liquid boils, it produces bubbles filled with its vapor, but for a bubble to form,
the vapor pressure must become as strong as the atmosphere constantly pushing down
on the surface of the liquid. As the liquid is heated, 
the vapor pressure increases, and when it becomes equal
to the atmospheric pressure, the bubbles form and boiling occurs. A solution's vapor pressure is lower
than that of pure solvent, so it must be heated
to an even higher temperature before it can match 
the strength of the atmosphere. As an added bonus,
the pressure in the radiator is kept above atmospheric pressure, raising the boiling point
by another 25 degrees Celsius. The solution commonly used 
for a car's cooling system is a 50/50 mixture of 
ethylene glycol and water, which freezes at -37 degrees Celsius
and boils at 106 degrees Celsius. At the highest recommended proportion
of 70 to 30, the freezing point is even lower
at -55 degrees Celsius, and the boiling point rises
to 113 degrees Celsius. As you can see,
the more ethylene glycol you add, the more protection you get,
so why not go even higher? Well, it turns out you can have
too much of a good thing because at higher proportions, the freezing point actually
starts to go back up. The properties of the solution head towards
the properties of ethylene glycol, which freezes at -12.9 degrees Celsius, a higher temperature than we 
attained with the solution. The solution flows through the engine,
absorbing heat along the way. When it reaches the radiator,
it's cooled by a fan, as well as air rushing through
the front of the car before returning to the hot engine compartment. So, an effective and safe engine coolant must have a high specific heat, 
a low freezing point, and a high boiling point. But instead of searching all over the world
for the perfect liquid to solve our problem, we can create our own solution.

**Transcript**:
Did you know that every time
musicians pick up their instruments, there are fireworks going off
all over their brain? On the outside,
they may look calm and focused, reading the music and making the precise
and practiced movements required. But inside their brains,
there's a party going on. How do we know this? Well, in the last few decades, neuroscientists have made
enormous breakthroughs in understanding how our brains work
by monitoring them in real time with instruments like
fMRI and PET scanners. When people are hooked up
to these machines, tasks, such as reading
or doing math problems, each have corresponding areas of the brain
where activity can be observed. But when researchers got
the participants to listen to music, they saw fireworks. Multiple areas of their brains
were lighting up at once, as they processed the sound, took it apart to understand elements
like melody and rhythm, and then put it all back together
into unified musical experience. And our brains do all this work
in the split second between when we first hear the music
and when our foot starts to tap along. But when scientists turned
from observing the brains of music listeners to those of musicians, the little backyard fireworks
became a jubilee. It turns out that while listening
to music engages the brain in some pretty interesting activities, playing music is the brain's equivalent
of a full-body workout. The neuroscientists saw
multiple areas of the brain light up, simultaneously processing
different information in intricate, interrelated,
and astonishingly fast sequences. But what is it about making music
that sets the brain alight? The research is still fairly new, but neuroscientists
have a pretty good idea. Playing a musical instrument engages practically every area
of the brain at once, especially the visual,
auditory, and motor cortices. As with any other workout, disciplined,
structured practice in playing music strengthens those brain functions,
allowing us to apply that strength to other activities. The most obvious difference between
listening to music and playing it is that the latter requires
fine motor skills, which are controlled
in both hemispheres of the brain. It also combines the linguistic
and mathematical precision, in which the left hemisphere
is more involved, with the novel and creative
content that the right excels in. For these reasons,
playing music has been found to increase the volume and activity
in the brain's corpus callosum, the bridge between the two hemispheres, allowing messages to get across the brain
faster and through more diverse routes. This may allow musicians to solve problems more effectively and creatively,
in both academic and social settings. Because making music also involves
crafting and understanding its emotional content and message, musicians often have higher levels
of executive function, a category of interlinked tasks that includes planning, strategizing,
and attention to detail and requires simultaneous analysis
of both cognitive and emotional aspects. This ability also has an impact
on how our memory systems work. And, indeed, musicians exhibit
enhanced memory functions, creating, storing, and retrieving memories
more quickly and efficiently. Studies have found that musicians appear
to use their highly connected brains to give each memory multiple tags, such as a conceptual tag,
an emotional tag, an audio tag, and a contextual tag, like a good Internet search engine. How do we know that all these benefits
are unique to music, as opposed to, say, sports or painting? Or could it be
that people who go into music were already smarter to begin with? Neuroscientists have explored
these issues, but so far, they have found that the artistic
and aesthetic aspects of learning to play a musical instrument are different from any other activity
studied, including other arts. And several randomized studies
of participants, who showed the same levels of cognitive function
and neural processing at the start, found that those who were exposed
to a period of music learning showed enhancement in multiple
brain areas, compared to the others. This recent research about
the mental benefits of playing music has advanced our understanding
of mental function, revealing the inner rhythms
and complex interplay that make up the amazing
orchestra of our brain.

**Transcript**:
Did you know that every time
musicians pick up their instruments, there are fireworks going off
all over their brain? On the outside,
they may look calm and focused, reading the music and making the precise
and practiced movements required. But inside their brains,
there's a party going on. How do we know this? Well, in the last few decades, neuroscientists have made
enormous breakthroughs in understanding how our brains work
by monitoring them in real time with instruments like
fMRI and PET scanners. When people are hooked up
to these machines, tasks, such as reading
or doing math problems, each have corresponding areas of the brain
where activity can be observed. But when researchers got
the participants to listen to music, they saw fireworks. Multiple areas of their brains
were lighting up at once, as they processed the sound, took it apart to understand elements
like melody and rhythm, and then put it all back together
into unified musical experience. And our brains do all this work
in the split second between when we first hear the music
and when our foot starts to tap along. But when scientists turned
from observing the brains of music listeners to those of musicians, the little backyard fireworks
became a jubilee. It turns out that while listening
to music engages the brain in some pretty interesting activities, playing music is the brain's equivalent
of a full-body workout. The neuroscientists saw
multiple areas of the brain light up, simultaneously processing
different information in intricate, interrelated,
and astonishingly fast sequences. But what is it about making music
that sets the brain alight? The research is still fairly new, but neuroscientists
have a pretty good idea. Playing a musical instrument engages practically every area
of the brain at once, especially the visual,
auditory, and motor cortices. As with any other workout, disciplined,
structured practice in playing music strengthens those brain functions,
allowing us to apply that strength to other activities. The most obvious difference between
listening to music and playing it is that the latter requires
fine motor skills, which are controlled
in both hemispheres of the brain. It also combines the linguistic
and mathematical precision, in which the left hemisphere
is more involved, with the novel and creative
content that the right excels in. For these reasons,
playing music has been found to increase the volume and activity
in the brain's corpus callosum, the bridge between the two hemispheres, allowing messages to get across the brain
faster and through more diverse routes. This may allow musicians to solve problems more effectively and creatively,
in both academic and social settings. Because making music also involves
crafting and understanding its emotional content and message, musicians often have higher levels
of executive function, a category of interlinked tasks that includes planning, strategizing,
and attention to detail and requires simultaneous analysis
of both cognitive and emotional aspects. This ability also has an impact
on how our memory systems work. And, indeed, musicians exhibit
enhanced memory functions, creating, storing, and retrieving memories
more quickly and efficiently. Studies have found that musicians appear
to use their highly connected brains to give each memory multiple tags, such as a conceptual tag,
an emotional tag, an audio tag, and a contextual tag, like a good Internet search engine. How do we know that all these benefits
are unique to music, as opposed to, say, sports or painting? Or could it be
that people who go into music were already smarter to begin with? Neuroscientists have explored
these issues, but so far, they have found that the artistic
and aesthetic aspects of learning to play a musical instrument are different from any other activity
studied, including other arts. And several randomized studies
of participants, who showed the same levels of cognitive function
and neural processing at the start, found that those who were exposed
to a period of music learning showed enhancement in multiple
brain areas, compared to the others. This recent research about
the mental benefits of playing music has advanced our understanding
of mental function, revealing the inner rhythms
and complex interplay that make up the amazing
orchestra of our brain.

**Transcript**:
In 1985, 16-year-old Douglas Casa, ran the championship 10,000 meter track race
at the Empire State Games. Suddenly, with just 200 meters to go,
he collapsed, got back up and then collapsed again
on the final straightaway, with his body temperature 
at dangerous levels. He had suffered an exertional heat stroke. Fortunately, with immediate and
proper treatment, he survived the potentially fatal episode and has since helped save 167 people
in similar circumstances. From ancient soldiers on the battlefield to modern day warriors on the gridiron, exertional heat stroke, or sunstroke, 
has long been a serious concern. And unlike classical heat stroke, 
which affects vulnerable people such as infants and the elderly 
during heat waves, exertional heat stroke is caused by 
intense exercise in the heat, and is one of the top three killers
of athletes and soldiers in training. When you exercise, 
nearly 80% of the energy you use is transformed into heat. In normal circumstances, 
this is what's known as compensable heat stress. And your body can dissipate the heat
as quickly as it's generated through cooling methods 
like the evaporation of sweat. But with uncompensable heat stress, your body is unable to lose enough heat due to overexertion or 
high temperatures in humidity, which raises your core temperature 
beyond normal levels. This causes the proteins and 
cell membranes to denature, creating cells that no longer 
function properly and begin to leak their contents. If these leaky cells 
proliferate through the body, the results can be devastating. Including liver damage, 
blood clot formation in the kidneys, damage to the gastrointestinal tract 
and even the failure of vital organs. So how do you diagnose 
an exertional heat stroke? The main criterion is a core body temperature 
greater than 40 degrees Celsius observed along with physical symptoms such as increased heart rate, 
low blood pressure and rapid breathing or signs of central nervous system disfunction such as confused behavior, 
aggression or loss of consciousness. The most feasible and accurate way 
to assess core body temperature is with a rectal thermometer as other common temperature-taking methods
are not accurate in these circumstances. As far as treatment goes, the most important thing to remember is
cool first, transport second. Because the human body can withstand 
a core temperature above 40 degrees Celsius for about 30 minutes before cell damage sets in, it's essential to initiate rapid cooling on site in order to lower it as quickly as possible. After any athletic or protective gear 
has been removed from the victim, place them in an ice water tub 
while stirring the water and monitoring vitals continuously. If this is not possible, dousing in ice water and applying 
wet towels over the entire body can help. But before you start anything, 
emergency services should be called. As you wait, it's important 
to keep the victim calm while cooling as much 
surface area as possible until emergency personnel arrive. If medical staff are available on site,
cooling should continue until a core temperature
of 38.9 degrees Celsius is reached. The sun is known for giving life, but it can also take life away
if we're not careful, even affecting the strongest among us. As Dr. JJ Levick wrote of
exertional heat stroke in 1859, "It strikes down its victim 
with his full armor on. Youth, health and strength
oppose no obstacle to its power." But although this condition is one of the 
top three leading causes of death in sports, it has been 100% survivable with proper care.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1985, 16-year-old Douglas Casa, ran the championship 10,000 meter track race
at the Empire State Games. Suddenly, with just 200 meters to go,
he collapsed, got back up and then collapsed again
on the final straightaway, with his body temperature 
at dangerous levels. He had suffered an exertional heat stroke. Fortunately, with immediate and
proper treatment, he survived the potentially fatal episode and has since helped save 167 people
in similar circumstances. From ancient soldiers on the battlefield to modern day warriors on the gridiron, exertional heat stroke, or sunstroke, 
has long been a serious concern. And unlike classical heat stroke, 
which affects vulnerable people such as infants and the elderly 
during heat waves, exertional heat stroke is caused by 
intense exercise in the heat, and is one of the top three killers
of athletes and soldiers in training. When you exercise, 
nearly 80% of the energy you use is transformed into heat. In normal circumstances, 
this is what's known as compensable heat stress. And your body can dissipate the heat
as quickly as it's generated through cooling methods 
like the evaporation of sweat. But with uncompensable heat stress, your body is unable to lose enough heat due to overexertion or 
high temperatures in humidity, which raises your core temperature 
beyond normal levels. This causes the proteins and 
cell membranes to denature, creating cells that no longer 
function properly and begin to leak their contents. If these leaky cells 
proliferate through the body, the results can be devastating. Including liver damage, 
blood clot formation in the kidneys, damage to the gastrointestinal tract

**Transcript**:
we conventionally divided space into private and public realms and we know these legal distinctions very well because we become experts at protecting our private property and private space but we're less attuned to the nuances of the public what translates generic public space into qualitative space and this is something that our studio has been working on for the past decade and we're doing this through some case studies a large chunk of our work has been put into transforming this neglected industrial ruin into a viable post-industrial space that looks forward and backwards at the same time and another huge chunk of our work has gone into making relevant a site that's grown out of sync with its time we've been working on democratizing Lincoln Center for a public that doesn't usually have 300 dollars to spend on an opera ticket so we've been eating drinking thinking living public space for quite a long time and it's taught us really one thing and that is to truly make a good public space you have to erase the distinctions between architecture urbanism landscape media design and so on it really goes beyond distinction now we are moving on to Washington DC and we're working on another transformation and that is for the existing Hirshhorn Museum that's sited on the most revered public space in America the National Mall the mall is a symbol of American democracy and what's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing it's not an image it's not an artifact it's actually it's a space and it's kind of just defined by line of buildings on either side it's a space where citizens can voice their discontent and show their power it's a place where pivotal moments in American history have taken place and they're inscribed in there forever like the march on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the great speech that Martin Luther King gave there the Vietnam protests the commemoration of all that died in the pandemic of AIDS the March for women's reproductive rights right up until almost the present the mall is the greatest civic stage in this country for descent and it's synonymous with free speech even if you're not sure what it is that you have to say it may just be a place for civic and miseration there is a huge disconnect we believe between the communicative and discursive space of the mall and the museums that line it to either side and that is that those museums are usually passive they have passive relationships between the museum as the presenter and the audience as the receiver of information and so you can see dinosaurs and and and insects and collections of locomotives and and all of that but you're really not involved you're being talked to when Richard Kirsch aaalac took over as director of the Hirshhorn in 2009 he was determined to take advantage of the fact that this museum was sited the most unique place the seat of power in the US and while art and politics are inherently and implicitly together always and all the time there could be some very special relationship that could be forged here in its uniqueness the question is is it possible ultimately for art's to insert itself into the dialogue of national and world affairs and could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy there are over a hundred and eighty embassies in Washington DC there are over five hundred think tanks there should be a way of harnessing all of that intellectual and global energy into and somehow through the museum there should be some kind of brain trust so the Hirshhorn as we began to think about and as we evolved the mission with Richard and his team it's really his lifeblood but beyond exhibiting contemporary art the Hirshhorn will become a public forum a place of discourse for for issues around arts culture politics and policy it would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum it would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference it would have kind of the informality of The Times Square and for this new initiative the Hirshhorn would have to expand or appropriate aside for a temporary deployable structure this is it this is the Hirshhorn so 230 foot diameter concrete donut design in the early 70s by Gordon Bunn shaft it's hulking its silent its cloistered its arrogant it's a design challenge architects love to hate it a one redeeming feature is its lifted up off the ground and it's got this void and it's God an empty core kind of in the spirit and that facade very much corporate and federal style and around that space the ring is actually galleries very very difficult to mount shows in there when the Hirshhorn opened it'll always huxtable the New York Times critic had some choice words neo penitentiary modern a maimed monument and and maimed mall for a maimed collection almost four decades later how would this building expand for a new progressive program where would it go can't go in the mall there is no space there it can't go in the courtyard it's already taken up by landscape and by sculptures oh there's always the hole but how could it take the space of that hole and not be buried in it and invisibly how could it become iconic and what language would it take the Hirshhorn sits among the most monumental institutions most are neoclassical heavy and opaque made of stone or concrete and question is well if one inhabits that space what is the material of them all it has to be different from the buildings there it has to be something entirely different it has to be air in our imagination it has to be light it has to be ephemeral it has to be formless and it has to be free so this is the big idea it's a giant air bag the expansion takes the shape of its container and it loses out wherever can the top and sides but more poetically we like to think of the structure as inhaling the Democratic air of the mall bringing it into itself the before and the after it was dubbed the bubble by the press that was the lounge it's basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction the membrane is translucent it's made of silicone coated glass fiber and it's inflated twice a year for one month at a time this is the view from the inside so you might have been wondering how in the world did we get this approved by the federal government I mean it was it had to be approved by actually two agencies and and it was and one is there to preserve the dignity and sanctity of them all I blush whenever I show this it is yours to interpret but one thing I could say is that it's a combination of iconoclasm and adoration there was also some creative interpretation involved the Congressional Buildings Act of 1910 limits the height of buildings in DC to 130 feet except for spires towers domes and minarets there's pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state and the bubble is 153 feet that's the Pantheon next to it it's about 1.2 million cubic feet of compressed air and so we argued it on the merits of being a dome so there it is very stately among all these stately buildings in the mall and while this Hirshhorn is not landmarked it's very very historically sensitive and so we couldn't really touch its services we couldn't leave any traces behind so we strained it from the edges and we held it by cables it's a study of some bondage techniques which are actually very very important because it's hit by wind all the time there's one permanent steel ring at the top but it can't be seen from any vantage point on them all there are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit it glows from within it's translucent but it can't be more lit than the Capitol or some of the monuments so it's down the hierarchy on lighting so it comes to the side twice a year it's taken off the delivery truck its hoisted and then it's inflated with this low pressure air and then it's restrained with the cables and then it's ballasted with water at the very bottom this is a converse strange moment we were asked by the the bureaucracy at the mall how much time would it take to install and we said well the first direction would take one week the very first and they really connected with that idea and and then it was really easy all the way through but so we didn't really have that many hurdles I have to say with the with the government and all the authorities but some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones this is the warp and weft this is a point cloud there are extreme pressures this is a very very unusual building in that there's no gravity load but there's load in every direction and I'm just gonna zip through these slides and this is the space in action so flexible interior for discussions just like this but in the round luminous and reconfigurable could be used for anything for performances films for installations and the very first program will be one of cultural dialogue and diplomacy organized in partnership with the Council on Foreign Relations form and content are together here the bubble is an ante monument the ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity art and politics occupy an ambiguous site outside the museum walls but inside of the museum's core blending its with the Democratic era of the mall and the bubble will inflate hopefully for the first time at the end of 2013 thank you

**Transcript**:
well when I was asked to do this TED talk I really chuckled because you see my father's name was Ted and much of my life especially my musical life is really a talk that I'm still having with him were at the part of me that he continues to be now Ted was a New Yorker and all-around theatre guy and he was a self-taught illustrator and musician he didn't read a note and he was profoundly hearing-impaired yet he was my greatest teacher because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids his understanding of music was profound and for him it wasn't so much the way the music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you and he did a painting of this experience which he called in the realm of music now Ted entered this realm every day by improvising you know sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this but he was tough when it came to music he said there are only two things that matter in music what and how and the thing about classical music that what and how it's inexhaustible that was his passion for the music both my parents really loved it they didn't know all that much about it but they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them and I think inspired by that memory it's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as I can to sort of pass it on through whatever it means and how people get this music how it comes into their lives really fascinates me one day in New York I was on the street and I saw some kids playing baseball between Stoops and cars and fire hydrants and a tough slouchy kid got up to bat and he took a swing and really connected and he watched the ball fly for a second and then he went and he ran around the bases and I thought go figure how did this piece of 18th century Austrian aristocratic entertainment turn in to the victory crow of this New York kid how was that passed on how did he get to hear Mozart well when it comes to classical music there's an awful lot to pass on much more than Mozart Beethoven or Tchaikovsky because classical music is an unbroken living tradition that goes back over a thousand years and every one of those years has had something unique and powerful to say to us about what it's like to be alive and the raw material of it of course is just the music of everyday life it's all the anthems and dance crazes and ballads and marches but what classical music does is to distill all of these musics down to condense them to their absolute essence and from that essence create an new language a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly about who we really are it's a language that's still evolving now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of like concertos and symphonies but even the most ambitious masterpiece can have as its central mission to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment like this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto it's so simple so evocative so many emotions seem to be inside of it yeah of course like all music it's essentially not about anything it's just a design of pitches in silence and time and two pitches the notes as you know are just vibrations their locations in the spectrum of sound or whether we call them 440 per second a or 3729 b-flat trust me that's right all right there just phenomenon but the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena is complex and emotional and not totally understood and the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries as have our preferences for them so for example in the 11th century people liked pieces that ended like this and in the 17th century it was more like this and in the 21st century now your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord even though a while back that would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room and the reason you like it is because you've inherited whether you knew it or not centuries worth of changes in musical theory practice and fashion and in classical music we can follow these changes very very accurately because of the music's powerful silent partner the way it's been passed on notation now the impulse to notate or more exactly I should say encode music has been with us for a very long time in 200 BC a man named Siculus wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in a notational system of the Greeks at a thousand years later this impulse to notate took an entirely different form and you can see how this happened in these excerpts from the Christmas Mass who we're not assessed no bees for us is born in the 10th century little squiggles were used just to indicate the general shape of the tune and in the 12th century a line was drawn like a musical horizon line to better pinpoint the pitches location and then in the 13th century more lines and new shapes of notes locked in the concept of the tune exactly and that led to the kind of notation we have today well notation not only passed the music on notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely because it enabled the musicians to imagine music out of much vaster scale now inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded saved considered prioritized made into intricate designs and from this moment classical music became what it most essentially is a dialogue between the two powerful size of our nature instinct and intelligence and there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition now improviser senses and plays the next cool move but a composer is considering all possible moves testing them out prioritizing them out until he sees how they can form a a powerful and coherent design of ultimate and enduring coolness now some of the greatest composers like ba were combinations of these two things Bach was like a great improviser with the mind of a chess master Mozart was the same way but every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason instincts and intelligence and every musical era had different priorities of these things different things to pass on different what's and how's so in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big what was to praise God and by the 1400s music was being written that tried to mirror God's mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky the howl was a style called polyphony music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planet seemed to move in ptolemies geocentric universe this was truly the music of the spheres this is the kind of music that Leonardo da Vinci would have known and perhaps it's tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity meant that something new had to happen a radical new move which in 1600 is what did happen this of course was the birth of opera and its development put music on a radical new course the what now was not to mirror the mind of God but to follow the emotional turbulence of man and the how was harmony stacking up the pitches to form chords and the chords it turned out were capable of representing an incredible varieties of emotions and the basic chords were the ones we still have with us the Triads either the major one which we think is happy or the minor one which we perceive as sad but what's the actual difference between these two chords it's just these two notes in the middle right it's either a natural at 659 vibrations per second or E flat at 622 so the big difference between human happiness and sadness 37 freakin vibrations so you can see in a system like this there was enormous subtle potential of representing human emotions and in fact as man began to understand more his complex and ambivalent nature harmony grew more complex to reflect it turned out he was capable of expressing emotions beyond the ability of words now with all this possibility music classical music really took off it's the time in which the big forms began to arise and the effects of technology began to be felt also because printing put music the scores the code books of music into the hands of performers everywhere and new and improved instruments made the age of the virtuoso possible this is when those big forms arose the symphonies the sonatas the concertos and these big architectures of time composers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime a piece like Beethoven's fifth basically witnessing how it was possible for him to go from sorrow and anger over the course of a half an hour step by exacting step of his route to the moment when he could make it across to joy and it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues like dripping ones of culture and such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality but whatever direction the music took one thing until recently was always the same and that was when the musicians stop playing the music stopped now this moment so fascinates me I find it such a profound one what happens when the music stops where does it go what's left what sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude and how might that changed their lives to me this is the intimate personal side of music it's the passing on part it's the why part of it and to me that's the most essential of all mostly it's been a person-to-person thing a teacher-student performer audience thing and then around 1880 came this new technology that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally created a new miraculous way of passing things on albeit an impersonal one people could now hear music all the time even though it wasn't necessary for them to play an instrument read music or even go to concerts and technology democratized music by making everything available it's spearheaded a cultural revolution in which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing and technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes using computers and synthesizers to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity beyond the means of performers and audiences at the same time technology by taking over the role that notation had always played shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side the culture in which we live now is awash with music of improvisation that's been sliced diced layered and godknows distributed and sold what's the long-term effect of this on us or our music nobody knows the question remains what happens when the music stops what sticks with people now that we have unlimited access to music what does stick with us well let me show you a story of what I mean by really sticking with us I was visiting a cousin of mine in an old-age home and I spied a very shaky old man making his way across the room on a walker he came over to a piano that was there and he bounced himself and began playing something like this and he said something like me a boy symphony they Beethoven and I suddenly got it my said friend by any chance are you trying to play this and he said yes yes I was a little boy but at the simply Isaac Stern that the concerto I heard it and I thought like God how much must this music mean to this man that he would get himself out of his bed across the room to recover the memory of this music that after everything else in his life is sloughing away still means so much to him well that's why I take every performance so seriously why it matters to me so much I never know who might be there who might be absorbing it and what will happen to it in their life but now I'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possible of sharing this music that's what drives my interest in projects like the TV series keeping score with the San Francisco Symphony that looks at the backstories of music and working with the young musicians at the New World Symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education and of course the New World Symphony led to the YouTube Symphony and projects on the internet that reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world and the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype there's a role here for so many people teachers parents performers to be explorers together sure the big events attract a lot of attention but what really matters is what goes on every single day we need your perspectives your curiosity your voices that it excites me now to meet people who are hikers chefs code writers taxi drivers people I never would have guessed who loved the music and we're passing it on you don't need to worry about knowing anything if you're curious if you have a capacity for wonder if you're alive you know all that you need to know you can start anywhere ramble a bit follow traces get lost be surprised amused inspired all that what all that how is out there waiting for you to discover its why to dive in and pass it on thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] when I was uh growing up in Montana I uh I had two dreams I wanted to be a paleontologist a dinosaur paleontologist and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur and so that's what I've been striving for all of my life I was very fortunate early in my career I was fortunate in finding things I wasn't very good at reading things in fact I don't read much of anything I am extremely dyslexic and so reading is the hardest thing I do but instead I I go out and I find things and I just pick things up I basically you know practice just for finding money on the street and I wander about the hills and and I have found a few things and I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemosphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests and the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of Bones and it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize the dinosaurs weren't the big stupid green reptiles of that people had thought for so many years and people were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special and so at that time I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues we were able to actually say that dinosaurs based on the evidence we had the dinosaurs built nests and and lived in colonies and cared for their young brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds so it was it was it was pretty interesting stuff I have gone on to find more things and and discover that that dinosaurs really were very social we have found um a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults the appearance of them would have been different which it is in all social animals in social groups of animals the juveniles always look different than the adults the adults can recognize the juveniles the juveniles can recognize the adults and so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looked like and they didn't just all Chase Jeeps around but it is that social thing that that I guess attracted Michael kryon in his book he talked about the social animals and then Steven Spielberg of course depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures the theme of this story is building a dinosaur and so we come to that part of Jurassic Park this is you know Michael kryon really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life you all know the story right I mean I assume everyone here has seen Jurassic Park if you want to make a dinosaur you go out you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap otherwise known as Amber that has some blood sucking insects in it good ones and you get your insect you drill into it and you suck out some DNA because obviously all insects that suck blood in those days suck dinosaur DNA out and and you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it and I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich or something like that and then you wait and lo and behold out pops a little baby dinosaur and everybody's happy about that and they're happy over and over again they keep doing it they just keep making these things and and then they then then and then you know then the dinosaurs being social act out their socialness and they get together and they conspire and of course that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around so I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of Amber and it had an insect in it and you drilled into it and you got something out of that insect and you cloned it and you did it over and over and over again you'd have a room full of mosquitoes right or maybe and probably a whole bunch of trees as well now if you want dinosaur DNA I say go to the dinosaur so that's what we've done back in 1993 when the movie came out we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur and we chose the dinosaur on the left a Tyrannosaurus Rex which was a very nice specimen and one of my former doctoral students Dr Mary schwitzer actually had the background to do this sort of thing and so she looked into the bone of this T-Rex one of the thigh bones and she actually found some very interesting structures in there they found these red circular looking objects and they looked for all the world like red blood cells and they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone and so she thought well what the heck so she sampled some material out of it and it wasn't DNA she didn't find DNA but she did find he which is the biological Foundation of hemoglobin and that was really cool that was interesting I that was here we have 65 milliony old he well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it so a few years went by and then we started the hell Creek project and the hell Creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them and out in eastern Montana there's a a lot of space a lot of bad lands and not very many people and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff and we did find a lot of stuff we found a lot of Tyrannosaurs but we found one special Tyrannosaur and we called it B rex and B rex was found under a th000 cubic yards of rock it wasn't a very complete T-Rex and it wasn't a very big T-Rex but it was a very special BX I and my colleagues cut into it and we were able to determine by looking at lines of Arrested growth some lines in it that b rex had died at the age of 16 we don't really know how long dinosaurs Liv because we haven't found the oldest one yet but this one died at the age of 16 we gave samples to Mary schwitzer and she was actually able to determine that b rex was a female based on medular tissue found on the inside of the bone medular tissue is the calcium buildup the calcium storage basically when an animal is pregnant when a bird is pregnant so here was a character that linked birds and dinosaurs but Mary went further she took the bone and she dumped it into acid now we all know that bones are fossilized and so if you dump it into acid there shouldn't be anything left but there was something left there were blood vessels left there were flexible clear blood vessels and so here was the first soft tissues from a dinosaur was extraordinary but she also found osteocytes which are the cells that laid down the bones and try and try we could not find DNA but she did find find evidence of proteins but we thought maybe well we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18 wheeler trailer actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples and we did we got better material uh the cells looked better the vessels looked better found the protein collagen I mean it it was wonderful stuff but it's not dinosaur DNA so we have discovered that dinosaur DNA all DNA just breaks down too fast we're just not going to be able to do what they did in Jurassic Park we're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur but birds are dinosaurs birds are living dinosaurs we actually classify them as dinosaurs We Now call them non-avian dinosaurs and Aven dinosaurs so the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct Aven dinosaurs are our modern birds so we don't have to make a dinosaur so I already have [Music] them I know you're you're you're as bad as the sixth graders right the sixth graders look at it and they say no you can call it you can call it a dinosaur but look at the Velociraptor the Velociraptor is cool the chicken is not so this is our problem as you can imagine the chicken is a dinosaur I mean it really is I mean you you can't argue with it because we you know we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way but the sixth graders demand it fix the chicken so so that's what I'm here to tell you about how we're going to fix a chicken so we have a number of of ways that we actually can fix the because Evolution works we actually have some evolutionary tools we'll call them biological modification tools we have selection and we know selection works right I mean we started out with a wolf-like creature and we end up with a malti I mean that's that's that's definitely genetic modification or any of the other funny looking little dogs we also have trans Genesis trans Genesis is really cool too that's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one that's how we you know that's how people made glowfish you take a jean a glow Jean out of a out of a coral or a or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebra fish and they glow and you know that's pretty cool and they obviously make a lot of money off of them and now they're you know they're making glow rabbits and and glow all sorts of things and I guess we could make a glow chicken but I don't think that'll satisfy the six graders either but there's another thing there's what we call adamism activation and adamism activation is basically an atavism is a is an ancestral characteristic now you've you've heard that occasionally children are born with tals and it's because it's a an ancestral characteristic and so there are a number of atavisms that can happen snakes are occasionally born with legs and here's an example this is a chicken with teeth a fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene of teeth for teeth and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in in chickens which now that's a good characteristic we can we can save that one all right we we know we can use that we can make a chicken with teeth that's getting closer that's better than a glowwing chicken a friend of mine a a colleague of mine Dr Hans Larsson at McGill University is actually looking at adisms and he's looking at them by looking at the embryogenesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail he's also interested in the transformation of the arm the hand to the wing he's looking for those genes as well and I said well you know if you can find those I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth graders and so he agreed and so that's what we're looking into if you look at dinosaur hands a velociraptor has that cool looking hand with the claws on it archaeopteris which is a bird a primitive bird still has that very primitive hand but as you can see the pigeon or a chicken or anything else like a bird has kind of a weird looking hand because the hand is a wing but the cool thing is is that if you look in the embryo as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the arch opter hand it has the three fingers the three digits but a gene turns on that actually fuses those together and so what we're looking for is that Gene we want to stop that Gene from turning on fusing those hands together so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand like the archaeopteris and the same goes for the Tails birds have basically rudimentary tails and so we know that in Embry as the animal is developing it actually has a relatively long tail but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail gets rid of it so that's the other Gene we're looking for we want to stop that tail from resorbing so what we're trying to do really is take our chicken modify it and make a chickenosaurus it's a cooler looking chicken I mean but it's just the very Basics so that really is what we're doing and people always say well you know why do that why make this thing what good is it well that's a good question you know actually I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things and quite frankly I think if if uh Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it he could actually advertise an extra piece anyway when Ard Dino chicken hatches it will be obviously the poster child or what you might call the poster chick for technology entertainment and design thank you

striving for all of my life I was very fortunate early in my career I was fortunate in finding things I wasn't very good at reading things in fact I don't read much of anything I am extremely dyslexic and so reading is the hardest thing I do but instead I I go out and I find things and I just pick things up I basically you know practice just for finding money on the street and I wander about the hills and and I have found a few things and I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemosphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests and the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of Bones and it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize the dinosaurs weren't the big stupid green reptiles of that people had thought for so many years and people were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special and so at that time I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues we were able to actually say that dinosaurs based on the evidence we had the dinosaurs built nests and and lived in colonies and cared for their young brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds so it was it was it was pretty interesting stuff I have gone on to find more things and and discover that that dinosaurs really were very social we have found um a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults the appearance of them would have been different which it is in all social animals in social groups of animals the juveniles always look different than the adults the adults can recognize the juveniles the juveniles can recognize the adults and so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looked like and they didn't just all Chase Jeeps around but it is that social thing that that I guess attracted Michael kryon in his book he talked about the social animals and then Steven Spielberg of course depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures the theme of this story is building a dinosaur and so we come to that part of Jurassic Park this is you know Michael kryon really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life you all know the story right I mean I assume everyone here has seen Jurassic Park if you want to make a dinosaur you go out you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap otherwise known as Amber that has some blood sucking insects in it good ones and you get your insect you drill into it and you suck out some DNA because obviously all insects that suck blood in those days suck dinosaur DNA out and and you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it and I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich or something like that and then you wait and lo and behold out pops a little baby dinosaur and everybody's happy about that and they're happy over and over again they keep doing it they just keep making these things and and then they then then and then you know then the dinosaurs being social act out their socialness and they get together and they conspire and of course that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around so I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of Amber and it had an insect in it and you drilled into it and you got something out of that insect and you cloned it and you did it over and over and over again you'd have a room full of mosquitoes right or maybe and probably a whole bunch of trees as well now if you want dinosaur DNA I say go to the dinosaur so that's what we've done back in 1993 when the movie came out we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur and we chose the dinosaur on the left a Tyrannosaurus Rex which was a very nice specimen and one of my former doctoral students Dr Mary schwitzer actually had the background to do this sort of thing and so she looked into the bone of this T-Rex one of the thigh bones and she actually found some very interesting structures in there they found these red circular looking objects and they looked for all the world like red blood cells and they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone and so she thought well what the heck so she sampled some material out of it and it wasn't DNA she didn't find DNA but she did find he which is the biological Foundation of hemoglobin and that was really cool that was interesting I that was here we have 65 milliony old he well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it so a few years went by and then we started the hell Creek project and the hell Creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them and out in eastern Montana there's a a lot of space a lot of bad lands and not very many people and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff and we did find a lot of stuff we found a lot of Tyrannosaurs but we found one special Tyrannosaur and we called it B rex and B rex was found under a th000 cubic yards of rock it wasn't a very complete T-Rex and it wasn't a very big T-Rex but it was a very special BX I and my colleagues cut into it and we were able to determine by looking at lines of Arrested growth some lines in it that b rex had died at the age of 16 we don't really know how long dinosaurs Liv because we haven't found the oldest one yet but this one died at the age of 16 we gave samples to Mary schwitzer and she was actually able to determine that b rex was a female based on medular tissue found on the inside of the bone medular tissue is the calcium buildup the calcium storage basically when an animal is pregnant when a bird is pregnant so here was a character that linked birds and dinosaurs but Mary went further she took the bone and she dumped it into acid now we all know that bones are fossilized and so if you dump it into acid there shouldn't be anything left but there was something left there were blood vessels left there were flexible clear blood vessels and so here was the first soft tissues from a dinosaur was extraordinary but she also found osteocytes which are the cells that laid down the bones and try and try we could not find DNA but she did find find evidence of proteins but we thought maybe well we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18 wheeler trailer actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples and we did we got better material uh the cells looked better the vessels looked better found the protein collagen I mean it it was wonderful stuff but it's not dinosaur DNA so we have discovered that dinosaur DNA all DNA just breaks down too fast we're just not going to be able to do what they did in Jurassic Park we're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur but birds are dinosaurs birds are living dinosaurs we actually classify them as dinosaurs We Now call them non-avian dinosaurs and Aven dinosaurs so the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct Aven dinosaurs are our modern birds so we don't have to make a dinosaur so I already have [Music] them I know you're you're you're as bad as the sixth graders right the sixth graders look at it and they say no you can call it you can call it a dinosaur but look at the Velociraptor the Velociraptor is cool the chicken is not so this is our problem as you can imagine the chicken is a dinosaur I mean it really is I mean you you can't argue with it because we you know we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way but the sixth graders demand it fix the chicken so so that's what I'm here to tell you about how we're going to fix a chicken so we have a number of of ways that we actually can fix the because Evolution works we actually have some evolutionary tools we'll call them biological modification tools we have selection and we know selection works right I mean we started out with a wolf-like creature and we end up with a malti I mean that's that's that's definitely genetic modification or any of the other funny looking little dogs we also have trans Genesis trans Genesis is really cool too that's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one that's how we you know that's how people made glowfish you take a jean a glow Jean out of a out of a coral or a or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebra fish and they glow and you know that's pretty cool and they obviously make a lot of money off of them and now they're you know they're making glow rabbits and and glow all sorts of things and I guess we could make a glow chicken but I don't think that'll satisfy the six graders either but there's another thing there's what we call adamism activation and adamism activation is basically an atavism is a is an ancestral characteristic now you've you've heard that occasionally children are born with tals and it's because it's a an ancestral characteristic and so there are a number of atavisms that can happen snakes are occasionally born with legs and here's an example this is a chicken with teeth a fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene of teeth for teeth and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in in chickens which now that's a good characteristic we can we can save that one all right we we know we can use that we can make a chicken with teeth that's getting closer that's better than a glowwing chicken a friend of mine a a colleague of mine Dr Hans Larsson at McGill University is actually looking at adisms and he's looking at them by looking at the embryogenesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail he's also interested in the transformation of the arm the hand to the wing he's looking for those genes as well and I said well you know if you can find those I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth graders and so he agreed and so that's what we're looking into if you look at dinosaur hands a velociraptor has that cool looking hand with the claws on it archaeopteris which is a bird a primitive bird still has that very primitive hand but as you can see the pigeon or a chicken or anything else like a bird has kind of a weird looking hand because the hand is a wing but the cool thing is is that if you look in the embryo as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the arch opter hand it has the three fingers the three digits but a gene turns on that actually fuses those together and so what we're looking for is that Gene we want to stop that Gene from turning on fusing those hands together so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand like the archaeopteris and the same goes for the Tails birds have basically rudimentary tails and so we know that in Embry as the animal is developing it actually has a relatively long tail but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail gets rid of it so that's the other Gene we're looking for we want to stop that tail from resorbing so what we're trying to do really is take our chicken modify it and make a chickenosaurus it's a cooler looking chicken I mean but it's just the very Basics so that really is what we're doing and people always say well you know why do that why make this thing what good is it well that's a good question you know actually I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things and quite frankly I think if if uh Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it he could actually advertise an extra piece anyway when Ard Dino chicken hatches it will be obviously the poster child or what you might call the poster chick for technology entertainment and design thank you

Tyrannosaurus Rex which was a very nice specimen and one of my former doctoral students Dr Mary schwitzer actually had the background to do this sort of thing and so she looked into the bone of this T-Rex one of the thigh bones and she actually found some very interesting structures in there they found these red circular looking objects and they looked for all the world like red blood cells and they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone and so she thought well what the heck so she sampled some material out of it and it wasn't DNA she didn't find DNA but she did find he which is the biological Foundation of hemoglobin and that was really cool that was interesting I that was here we have 65 milliony old he well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it so a few years went by and then we started the hell Creek project and the hell Creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them and out in eastern Montana there's a a lot of space a lot of bad lands and not very many people and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff and we did find a lot of stuff we found a lot of Tyrannosaurs but we found one special Tyrannosaur and we called it B rex and B rex was found under a th000 cubic yards of rock it wasn't a very complete T-Rex and it wasn't a very big T-Rex but it was a very special BX I and my colleagues cut into it and we were able to determine by looking at lines of Arrested growth some lines in it that b rex had died at the age of 16 we don't really know how long dinosaurs Liv because we haven't found the oldest one yet but this one died at the age of 16 we gave samples to Mary schwitzer and she was actually able to determine that b rex was a female based on medular tissue found on the inside of the bone medular tissue is the calcium buildup the calcium storage basically when an animal is pregnant when a bird is pregnant so here was a character that linked birds and dinosaurs but Mary went further she took the bone and she dumped it into acid now we all know that bones are fossilized and so if you dump it into acid there shouldn't be anything left but there was something left there were blood vessels left there were flexible clear blood vessels and so here was the first soft tissues from a dinosaur was extraordinary but she also found osteocytes which are the cells that laid down the bones and try and try we could not find DNA but she did find find evidence of proteins but we thought maybe well we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18 wheeler trailer actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples and we did we got better material uh the cells looked better the vessels looked better found the protein collagen I mean it it was wonderful stuff but it's not dinosaur DNA so we have discovered that dinosaur DNA all DNA just breaks down too fast we're just not going to be able to do what they did in Jurassic Park we're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur but birds are dinosaurs birds are living dinosaurs we actually classify them as dinosaurs We Now call them non-avian dinosaurs and Aven dinosaurs so the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct Aven dinosaurs are our modern birds so we don't have to make a dinosaur so I already have [Music] them I know you're you're you're as bad as the sixth graders right the sixth graders look at it and they say no you can call it you can call it a dinosaur but look at the Velociraptor the Velociraptor is cool the chicken is not so this is our problem as you can imagine the chicken is a dinosaur I mean it really is I mean you you can't argue with it because we you know we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way but the sixth graders demand it fix the chicken so so that's what I'm here to tell you about how we're going to fix a chicken so we have a number of of ways that we actually can fix the because Evolution works we actually have some evolutionary tools we'll call them biological modification tools we have selection and we know selection works right I mean we started out with a wolf-like creature and we end up with a malti I mean that's that's that's definitely genetic modification or any of the other funny looking little dogs we also have trans Genesis trans Genesis is really cool too that's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one that's how we you know that's how people made glowfish you take a jean a glow Jean out of a out of a coral or a or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebra fish and they glow and you know that's pretty cool and they obviously make a lot of money off of them and now they're you know they're making glow rabbits and and glow all sorts of things and I guess we could make a glow chicken but I don't think that'll satisfy the six graders either but there's another thing there's what we call adamism activation and adamism activation is basically an atavism is a is an ancestral characteristic now you've you've heard that occasionally children are born with tals and it's because it's a an ancestral characteristic and so there are a number of atavisms that can happen snakes are occasionally born with legs and here's an example this is a chicken with teeth a fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene of teeth for teeth and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in in chickens which now that's a good characteristic we can we can save that one all right we we know we can use that we can make a chicken with teeth that's getting closer that's better than a glowwing chicken a friend of mine a a colleague of mine Dr Hans Larsson at McGill University is actually looking at adisms and he's looking at them by looking at the embryogenesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail he's also interested in the transformation of the arm the hand to the wing he's looking for those genes as well and I said well you know if you can find those I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth graders and so he agreed and so that's what we're looking into if you look at dinosaur hands a velociraptor has that cool looking hand with the claws on it archaeopteris which is a bird a primitive bird still has that very primitive hand but as you can see the pigeon or a chicken or anything else like a bird has kind of a weird looking hand because the hand is a wing but the cool thing is is that if you look in the embryo as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the arch opter hand it has the three fingers the three digits but a gene turns on that actually fuses those together and so what we're looking for is that Gene we want to stop that Gene from turning on fusing those hands together so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand like the archaeopteris and the same goes for the Tails birds have basically rudimentary tails and so we know that in Embry as the animal is developing it actually has a relatively long tail but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail gets rid of it so that's the other Gene we're looking for we want to stop that tail from resorbing so what we're trying to do really is take our chicken modify it and make a chickenosaurus it's a cooler looking chicken I mean but it's just the very Basics so that really is what we're doing and people always say well you know why do that why make this thing what good is it well that's a good question you know actually I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things and quite frankly I think if if uh Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it he could actually advertise an extra piece anyway when Ard Dino chicken hatches it will be obviously the poster child or what you might call the poster chick for technology entertainment and design thank you

**Transcript**:
They say that if walls could talk,
each building would have a story to tell, but few would tell so many fascinating
stories in so many different voices as the Hagia Sophia, or holy wisdom. Perched at the crossroads 
of continents and cultures, it has seen massive changes 
from the name of the city where it stands, to its own structure and purpose. And today, the elements
from each era stand ready to tell their tales 
to any visitor who will listen. Even before you arrive at the Hagia Sophia,
the ancient fortifications hint at the strategic importance 
of the surrounding city, founded as Byzantium 
by Greek colonists in 657 BCE. And successfully renamed as 
Augusta Antonia, New Rome and Constantinople as it was conquered, reconquered,
destroyed and rebuilt by various Greek, Persian and 
Roman rulers over the following centuries. And it was within these walls that 
the first Megale Ekklesia, or great church, was built in the fourth century. Though it was soon burned
to the ground in riots, it established the location for
the region's main religious structure for centuries to come. Near the entrance,
the marble stones with reliefs are the last reminders 
of the second church. Built in 415 CE, it was destroyed 
during the Nika Riots of 532 when angry crowds at a chariot race nearly overthrew the emperor, 
Justinian the First. Having barely managed to retain power, he resolved to rebuild the church
on a grander scale, and five years later, the edifice 
you see before you was completed. As you step inside, the stones 
of the foundation and walls murmur tales from their homelands
of Egypt and Syria, while columns taken from the Temple
of Artemis recall a more ancient past. Runic inscriptions carved by the 
Vikings of the emperor's elite guard carry the lore of distant northern lands. But your attention is caught by 
the grand dome, representing the heavens. Reaching over 50 meters high and 
over 30 meters in diameter and ringed by windows around its base, the golden dome appears
suspended from heaven, light reflecting through its interior. Beneath its grandiose symbolism,
the sturdy reinforcing Corinthian columns, brought from Lebanon after 
the original dome was partially destroyed by an earthquake in 558 CE, quietly remind you of its fragility and the engineering skills
such a marvel requires. If a picture is worth a thousand words, the mosaics from the next several 
centuries have the most to say not only about their Biblical themes, but also the Byzantine emperors who commissioned them, often depicted along with Christ. But beneath their loud and clear voices, one hears the haunting echoes of 
the damaged and missing mosaics and icons, desecrated and looted during 
the Latin Occupation in the Fourth Crusade. Within the floor, the tomb inscription
of Enrico Dandolo, the Venetian ruler who 
commanded the campaign, is a stark reminder of those 57 years that Hagia Sophia spent as a Roman Catholic church before returning to its orthodox roots
upon the Byzantine Reconquest. But it would not remain a church for long. Weakened by the Crusades, Constantinople
fell to the Ottomans in 1453 and would be known as Istanbul thereafter. After allowing his soldiers
three days of pillage, Sultan Mehmed the Second 
entered the building. Though heavily damaged, 
its grandeur was not lost on the young sultan who immediately
rededicated it to Allah, proclaiming that it would be
the new imperial mosque. The four minarets built 
over the next century are the most obvious sign of this era, serving as architectural supports 
in addition to their religious purpose. But there are many others. Ornate candle holders relate 
Suleiman's conquest of Hungary, while giant caligraphy discs 
hung from the ceiling remind visitors for the first 
four caliphs who followed Muhammad. Though the building you see today still
looks like a mosque, it is now a museum, a decision made in 1935 by Kemal Ataturk, the modernizing first president of Turkey following the Ottoman Empire's collapse. It was this secularization
that allowed for removal of the carpets hiding 
the marble floor decorations and the plaster covering 
the Christian mosaics. Ongoing restoration work 
has allowed the multiplicity of voices in Hagia Sophia's long history to be heard again after
centuries of silence. But conflict remains. Hidden mosaics cry out from 
beneath Islamic calligraphy, valuable pieces of history that cannot be
uncovered without destroying others. Meanwhile, calls sound from
both Muslim and Christian communities to return the building to 
its former religious purposes. The story of the divine wisdom 
may be far from over, but one can only hope that 
the many voices residing there will be able to tell their part
for years to come.

**Transcript**:
They say that if walls could talk,
each building would have a story to tell, but few would tell so many fascinating
stories in so many different voices as the Hagia Sophia, or holy wisdom. Perched at the crossroads 
of continents and cultures, it has seen massive changes 
from the name of the city where it stands, to its own structure and purpose. And today, the elements
from each era stand ready to tell their tales 
to any visitor who will listen. Even before you arrive at the Hagia Sophia,
the ancient fortifications hint at the strategic importance 
of the surrounding city, founded as Byzantium 
by Greek colonists in 657 BCE. And successfully renamed as 
Augusta Antonia, New Rome and Constantinople as it was conquered, reconquered,
destroyed and rebuilt by various Greek, Persian and 
Roman rulers over the following centuries. And it was within these walls that 
the first Megale Ekklesia, or great church, was built in the fourth century. Though it was soon burned
to the ground in riots, it established the location for
the region's main religious structure for centuries to come. Near the entrance,
the marble stones with reliefs are the last reminders 
of the second church. Built in 415 CE, it was destroyed 
during the Nika Riots of 532 when angry crowds at a chariot race nearly overthrew the emperor, 
Justinian the First. Having barely managed to retain power, he resolved to rebuild the church
on a grander scale, and five years later, the edifice 
you see before you was completed. As you step inside, the stones 
of the foundation and walls murmur tales from their homelands
of Egypt and Syria, while columns taken from the Temple
of Artemis recall a more ancient past. Runic inscriptions carved by the 
Vikings of the emperor's elite guard carry the lore of distant northern lands. But your attention is caught by 
the grand dome, representing the heavens. Reaching over 50 meters high and 
over 30 meters in diameter and ringed by windows around its base, the golden dome appears
suspended from heaven, light reflecting through its interior. Beneath its grandiose symbolism,
the sturdy reinforcing Corinthian columns, brought from Lebanon after 
the original dome was partially destroyed by an earthquake in 558 CE, quietly remind you of its fragility and the engineering skills
such a marvel requires. If a picture is worth a thousand words, the mosaics from the next several 
centuries have the most to say not only about their Biblical themes, but also the Byzantine emperors who commissioned them, often depicted along with Christ. But beneath their loud and clear voices, one hears the haunting echoes of 
the damaged and missing mosaics and icons, desecrated and looted during 
the Latin Occupation in the Fourth Crusade. Within the floor, the tomb inscription
of Enrico Dandolo, the Venetian ruler who 
commanded the campaign, is a stark reminder of those 57 years that Hagia Sophia spent as a Roman Catholic church before returning to its orthodox roots
upon the Byzantine Reconquest. But it would not remain a church for long. Weakened by the Crusades, Constantinople
fell to the Ottomans in 1453 and would be known as Istanbul thereafter. After allowing his soldiers
three days of pillage, Sultan Mehmed the Second 
entered the building. Though heavily damaged, 
its grandeur was not lost on the young sultan who immediately
rededicated it to Allah, proclaiming that it would be
the new imperial mosque. The four minarets built 
over the next century are the most obvious sign of this era, serving as architectural supports 
in addition to their religious purpose. But there are many others. Ornate candle holders relate 
Suleiman's conquest of Hungary, while giant caligraphy discs 
hung from the ceiling remind visitors for the first 
four caliphs who followed Muhammad. Though the building you see today still
looks like a mosque, it is now a museum, a decision made in 1935 by Kemal Ataturk, the modernizing first president of Turkey following the Ottoman Empire's collapse. It was this secularization
that allowed for removal of the carpets hiding 
the marble floor decorations and the plaster covering 
the Christian mosaics. Ongoing restoration work 
has allowed the multiplicity of voices in Hagia Sophia's long history to be heard again after
centuries of silence. But conflict remains. Hidden mosaics cry out from 
beneath Islamic calligraphy, valuable pieces of history that cannot be
uncovered without destroying others. Meanwhile, calls sound from
both Muslim and Christian communities to return the building to 
its former religious purposes. The story of the divine wisdom 
may be far from over, but one can only hope that 
the many voices residing there will be able to tell their part
for years to come.

**Transcript**:
Think about all the things that need to happen for a human settlement to thrive: obtaining food, building shelter, raising children and more. There needs to be a way to divide resources, organize major efforts and distribute labor efficiently. Now imagine having to do this without any sort of planning or higher level communication. Welcome to the ant colony. Ants have some of the most complex social organization in the animal kingdom, living in structured colonies containing different types of members who perform specific roles. But although this may sound similar to some human societies, this organization doesn't arise from any higher level decisions, but is part of a biologically programmed cycle. In many species, all the winged males and winged virgin queens from all the nearby colonies in the population each leave from their different nests and meet at a central place to mate, using pheromones to guide each other to a breeding ground. After mating, the males die off, while females try to establish a new colony. The few that are successful settle down in a suitable spot, lose their wings, and begin laying eggs, selectively fertilizing some using stored sperm they've saved up from mating. Fertilized eggs grow into female workers who care for the queen and her eggs. They will then defend the colony and forage for food, while unfertilized eggs grow into males whose only job is to wait until they are ready to leave the nest and reproduce, beginning the cycle again. So how do worker ants decide what to do and when? Well, they don't really. Although they have no methods of intentional communication, individual ants do interact with one another through touch, sound and chemical signals. These stimuli accomplish many things from serving as an alarm to other ants if one is killed, to signaling when a queen is nearing the end of her reproductive life. But one of the most impressive collective capabilities of an ant colony is to thoroughly and efficiently explore large areas without any predetermined plan. Most species of ants have little or no sense of sight and can only smell things in their vicinity. Combined with their lack of high level coordination, this would seem to make them terrible explorers, but there is an amazingly simple way that ants maximize their searching efficiency; by changing their movement patterns based on individual interactions. When two ants meet, they sense each other by touching antennae. If there are many ants in a small area this will happen more often causing them to respond by moving in more convoluted, random paths in order to search more thoroughly. But in a larger area, with less ants, where such meetings happen less often, they can walk in straight lines to cover more ground. While exploring their environment in this way, an ant may come across any number of things, from threats or enemies, to alternate nesting sites. And some species have another capability known as recruitment. When one of these ants happens to find food, it will return with it, marking its path with a chemical scent. Other ants will then follow this pheromone trail, renewing it each time they manage to find food and return. Once the food in that spot is depleted, the ants stop marking their return. The scent dissipates and ants are no longer attracted to that path. These seemingly crude methods of search and retrieval are, in fact, so useful that they are applied in computer models to obtain optimal solutions from decentralized elements, working randomly and exchanging simple information. This has many theoretical and practical applications, from solving the famous traveling salesman problem, to scheduling computing tasks and optimizing Internet searches, to enabling groups of robots to search a minefield or a burning building collectively, without any central control. But you can observe these fascinatingly simple, yet effective, processes directly through some simple experiments, by allowing ants to enter empty spaces of various sizes and paying attention to their behavior. Ants may not be able to vote, hold meetings or even make any plans, but we humans may still be able to learn something from the way that such simple creatures are able to function so effectively in such complex ways.

But although this may sound similar to some human societies, this organization doesn't arise from any higher level decisions, but is part of a biologically programmed cycle. In many species, all the winged males and winged virgin queens from all the nearby colonies in the population each leave from their different nests and meet at a central place to mate, using pheromones to guide each other to a breeding ground. After mating, the males die off, while females try to establish a new colony. The few that are successful settle down in a suitable spot, lose their wings, and begin laying eggs, selectively fertilizing some using stored sperm they've saved up from mating. Fertilized eggs grow into female workers who care for the queen and her eggs. They will then defend the colony and forage for food, while unfertilized eggs grow into males whose only job is to wait until they are ready to leave the nest and reproduce, beginning the cycle again. So how do worker ants decide what to do and when? Well, they don't really. Although they have no methods of intentional communication, individual ants do interact with one another through touch, sound and chemical signals. These stimuli accomplish many things from serving as an alarm to other ants if one is killed, to signaling when a queen is nearing the end of her reproductive life. But one of the most impressive collective capabilities of an ant colony is to thoroughly and efficiently explore large areas without any predetermined plan. Most species of ants have little or no sense of sight and can only smell things in their vicinity. Combined with their lack of high level coordination, this would seem to make them terrible explorers, but there is an amazingly simple way that ants maximize their searching efficiency; by changing their movement patterns based on individual interactions. When two ants meet, they sense each other by touching antennae. If there are many ants in a small area this will happen more often causing them to respond by moving in more convoluted, random paths in order to search more thoroughly. But in a larger area, with less ants, where such meetings happen less often, they can walk in straight lines to cover more ground. While exploring their environment in this way, an ant may come across any number of things, from threats or enemies, to alternate nesting sites. And some species have another capability known as recruitment. When one of these ants happens to find food, it will return with it, marking its path with a chemical scent. Other ants will then follow this pheromone trail, renewing it each time they manage to find food and return. Once the food in that spot is depleted, the ants stop marking their return. The scent dissipates and ants are no longer attracted to that path. These seemingly crude methods of search and retrieval are, in fact, so useful that they are applied in computer models to obtain optimal solutions from decentralized elements, working randomly and exchanging simple information. This has many theoretical and practical applications, from solving the famous traveling salesman problem, to scheduling computing tasks and optimizing Internet searches, to enabling groups of robots to search a minefield or a burning building collectively, without any central control. But you can observe these fascinatingly simple, yet effective, processes directly through some simple experiments, by allowing ants to enter empty spaces of various sizes and paying attention to their behavior. Ants may not be able to vote, hold meetings or even make any plans, but we humans may still be able to learn something from the way that such simple creatures are able to function so effectively in such complex ways.

Reviewer: Caroline Cristal You may not realize it, but from the moment you got out of bed today to the point where you sat down to watch this video, you've essentially been swimming. Why? Because air is a fluid just like water. It has waves and eddies. It flows. And when you push air out of the way, it rushes around you into a wake. So why don't we notice it most of the time? We commonly think of air as empty space. But while one cubic centimeter of interstellar space, the volume in the tip of your pinky finger, contains roughly one atom, the same volume of air has about 10 quintillion molecules. If that sounds hard to wrap your head around, it happens to be about the same as the number of insects alive on the planet, all crawling, climbing, and flying over each other in an enormous, tightly packed swarm. When this swarm of molecules runs into things, it exerts a force, pressing against the boundaries of the fluid, like water pressing against the glass of a bottle. This is known as air pressure. And while air is lighter than water, all those molecules still get pretty heavy, with the total air filling a typical school gym, weighing about as much as an adult elephant. So when you walk into a gym, how come you're not immediately crushed by the elephant of air in the room? Well, first of all, because most of it is pressing on the floor and the walls, and the part that is pressing on you is pushed back by the pressure inside you! You see, the air, as well as the water and everything else, that fills our bodies exerts an amount of pressure equal to that of the air outside. Of course, this is no accident. It's precisely what allows us to survive in the normal atmosphere, and what makes it more difficult at high altitudes or deep water. And we normally don't feel the air pressing on us because it's generally uniform. So even though different amounts of air molecules are hitting you at different times, the swarm is so thick that all those little differences average out. What happens when air pressure isn't uniform? This means that the molecules are pushing harder in one region of air than another, driving the air flow from the higher pressure region to the lower. We feel this flow directly as wind, and the pressure systems that meteorologists are always going on about are responsible for other weather changes, from the mundane to the catastrophic. But differences in air pressure do more than just let us complain about the weather; they're the very reason we're alive. We breathe by lowering the pressure in our lungs, allowing air to rush in. So the next time you take a deep breath, think of the unfathomable number of air molecules you're commanding to move. We look up at the night sky to ponder the infinity of space, but unless you're watching this video from that deep space, there are more air molecules in and around your body than there are grains of sand in all the world's beaches and deserts, stars in the visible universe, or both of those numbers combined. The vastness of the universe is right in front of you and inside you.

Reviewer: Caroline Cristal You may not realize it, but from the moment you got out of bed today to the point where you sat down to watch this video, you've essentially been swimming. Why? Because air is a fluid just like water. It has waves and eddies. It flows. And when you push air out of the way, it rushes around you into a wake. So why don't we notice it most of the time? We commonly think of air as empty space. But while one cubic centimeter of interstellar space, the volume in the tip of your pinky finger, contains roughly one atom, the same volume of air has about 10 quintillion molecules. If that sounds hard to wrap your head around, it happens to be about the same as the number of insects alive on the planet, all crawling, climbing, and flying over each other in an enormous, tightly packed swarm. When this swarm of molecules runs into things, it exerts a force, pressing against the boundaries of the fluid, like water pressing against the glass of a bottle. This is known as air pressure. And while air is lighter than water, all those molecules still get pretty heavy, with the total air filling a typical school gym, weighing about as much as an adult elephant. So when you walk into a gym, how come you're not immediately crushed by the elephant of air in the room? Well, first of all, because most of it is pressing on the floor and the walls, and the part that is pressing on you is pushed back by the pressure inside you! You see, the air, as well as the water and everything else, that fills our bodies exerts an amount of pressure equal to that of the air outside. Of course, this is no accident. It's precisely what allows us to survive in the normal atmosphere, and what makes it more difficult at high altitudes or deep water. And we normally don't feel the air pressing on us because it's generally uniform. So even though different amounts of air molecules are hitting you at different times, the swarm is so thick that all those little differences average out. What happens when air pressure isn't uniform? This means that the molecules are pushing harder in one region of air than another, driving the air flow from the higher pressure region to the lower. We feel this flow directly as wind, and the pressure systems that meteorologists are always going on about are responsible for other weather changes, from the mundane to the catastrophic. But differences in air pressure do more than just let us complain about the weather; they're the very reason we're alive. We breathe by lowering the pressure in our lungs, allowing air to rush in. So the next time you take a deep breath, think of the unfathomable number of air molecules you're commanding to move. We look up at the night sky to ponder the infinity of space, but unless you're watching this video from that deep space, there are more air molecules in and around your body than there are grains of sand in all the world's beaches and deserts, stars in the visible universe, or both of those numbers combined. The vastness of the universe is right in front of you and inside you.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Living with her family high
above the ground in the northern tropical forests
of Colombia, you will find Shakira, a cotton-top tamarin with a penchant
for conversation. Say, "Hola!" Though you may not realize it, this one pound monkey communicates in a highly sophisticated language of 38 distinct calls based on variations of chirps
and whistles. The response she just gave is known as a "B chirp", a call often directed at humans. To appreciate the complexities
of Shakira’s language, let's learn a few chirps and whistles, then examine how their combinations form grammatically structured sequences. The chirp Shakira used to greet us comes from a class of calls known as single frequency modulated syllables. This class is made up of short
duration calls, or chirps, and long duration calls,
like screams and squeals. Researchers have determined that there
are eight different types of chirps categorized by stem upsweep, duration,
peak frequency, and frequency change. In addition, each chirp has
its own unique meaning. For example, Shakira’s “C chirp” is used when she is approaching food, where as her “D chirp” is only used when she has
the food in hand. Single whistles also exhibit
a unique intention with each call and just as there are
eight different chirps, there are five different whistles. Based on frequency modulation, single whistles are subdivided
into four categories: squeaks, initially modulated whistles, terminally modulated whistles, and flat whistles. The language's quality of unique intention is wonderfully exemplified by the category of initially modulated whistles. These whistles change based
on the proximity of Shakira to other members of her family. If Shakira is greater than 0.6 meters
from her family, she’ll sound a large
initally modulated whistle. But if she’s less than 0.6 meters
from her family, she’ll sound a small
initially modulated whistle. Now that we’ve learned a few
chirps and whistles, Shakira wants to show off by taking you through a quick day in her life
with these calls. While heading towards a feeding tree
for her first meal of the day, she says: “(monkey noise)“, a call most often used
in relaxed investigations. However, suddenly she spots
the shadow of a hawk. "E chirp" for alarm. This call alerts her family
to the presence of this predator, and Shakira jumps to the safety
of an inner branch. The coast seems clear, so Shakira makes her way towards her dad. Wait, wait. Who is that? Ah, it's her younger brother, Carlos. Cotton-top tamarins often squeal
during play wrestling. Uh-oh. He’s playing a little too roughly,
and Shakira screams, alerting her parents to help her. Her dad makes his way
towards the ball of rolling fur and her brother stops. Shakira shakes herself and scratches herself to get the hair
on her head back in place. Then Shakira spots another group
of unfamiliar tamarins and hears their normal long call. She turns to her family. Did you catch that? First there was a chirp,
and then a whistle. This is what’s known as
a combination vocalization, a phrase that contains
both a chirp and a whistle. These are two calls strung together
to convey a message. The combination of these two elements alerts her family to the presence
of another group, the “F chirp”, and the distance
they are away, the normal long call whistle. In other words,
Shakira just said a sentence. Her simple demonstration
is just the tip of the iceberg. She’s got trills, chatters,
multiple whistle calls, more combination vocalizations,
even twitters. Yet sadly enough, we may not get to hear everything she has to say. Mixed in with chirping sonatas
from high above is the constant thud of a machete
chopping trees. Shakira’s habitat in Colombia
is being cut down, piece by piece, and if we don't work to protect the critically endangered
cotton-top tamarin, it will become extinct in our lifetime. If the chirp from one tamarin to the next has proven to be more
than just idle chit chat, imagine what else we have left
to discover. Imagine what else Shakira can tell us.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Living with her family high
above the ground in the northern tropical forests
of Colombia, you will find Shakira, a cotton-top tamarin with a penchant
for conversation. Say, "Hola!" Though you may not realize it, this one pound monkey communicates in a highly sophisticated language of 38 distinct calls based on variations of chirps
and whistles. The response she just gave is known as a "B chirp", a call often directed at humans. To appreciate the complexities
of Shakira’s language, let's learn a few chirps and whistles, then examine how their combinations form grammatically structured sequences. The chirp Shakira used to greet us comes from a class of calls known as single frequency modulated syllables. This class is made up of short
duration calls, or chirps, and long duration calls,
like screams and squeals. Researchers have determined that there
are eight different types of chirps categorized by stem upsweep, duration,
peak frequency, and frequency change. In addition, each chirp has
its own unique meaning. For example, Shakira’s “C chirp” is used when she is approaching food, where as her “D chirp” is only used when she has
the food in hand. Single whistles also exhibit
a unique intention with each call and just as there are
eight different chirps, there are five different whistles. Based on frequency modulation, single whistles are subdivided
into four categories: squeaks, initially modulated whistles, terminally modulated whistles, and flat whistles. The language's quality of unique intention is wonderfully exemplified by the category of initially modulated whistles. These whistles change based
on the proximity of Shakira to other members of her family. If Shakira is greater than 0.6 meters
from her family, she’ll sound a large
initally modulated whistle. But if she’s less than 0.6 meters
from her family, she’ll sound a small
initially modulated whistle. Now that we’ve learned a few
chirps and whistles, Shakira wants to show off by taking you through a quick day in her life
with these calls. While heading towards a feeding tree
for her first meal of the day, she says: “(monkey noise)“, a call most often used
in relaxed investigations. However, suddenly she spots
the shadow of a hawk. "E chirp" for alarm. This call alerts her family
to the presence of this predator, and Shakira jumps to the safety
of an inner branch. The coast seems clear, so Shakira makes her way towards her dad. Wait, wait. Who is that? Ah, it's her younger brother, Carlos. Cotton-top tamarins often squeal
during play wrestling. Uh-oh. He’s playing a little too roughly,
and Shakira screams, alerting her parents to help her. Her dad makes his way
towards the ball of rolling fur and her brother stops. Shakira shakes herself and scratches herself to get the hair
on her head back in place. Then Shakira spots another group
of unfamiliar tamarins and hears their normal long call. She turns to her family. Did you catch that? First there was a chirp,
and then a whistle. This is what’s known as
a combination vocalization, a phrase that contains
both a chirp and a whistle. These are two calls strung together
to convey a message. The combination of these two elements alerts her family to the presence
of another group, the “F chirp”, and the distance
they are away, the normal long call whistle. In other words,
Shakira just said a sentence. Her simple demonstration
is just the tip of the iceberg. She’s got trills, chatters,
multiple whistle calls, more combination vocalizations,
even twitters. Yet sadly enough, we may not get to hear everything she has to say. Mixed in with chirping sonatas
from high above is the constant thud of a machete
chopping trees. Shakira’s habitat in Colombia
is being cut down, piece by piece, and if we don't work to protect the critically endangered
cotton-top tamarin, it will become extinct in our lifetime. If the chirp from one tamarin to the next has proven to be more
than just idle chit chat, imagine what else we have left
to discover. Imagine what else Shakira can tell us.

**Transcript**:
If you tried to pay for something
with a piece of paper, you might run into some trouble. Unless, of course, the piece of paper
was a hundred dollar bill. But what is it that makes that bill
so much more interesting and valuable than other pieces of paper? After all, there's not much
you can do with it. You can't eat it. You can't build things with it. And burning it is actually illegal. So what's the big deal? Of course, you probably know the answer. A hundred dollar bill
is printed by the government and designated as official currency, while other pieces of paper are not. But that's just what makes them legal. What makes a hundred dollar bill
valuable, on the other hand, is how many or few of them are around. Throughout history, most currency,
including the US dollar, was linked to valuable commodities and the amount of it in circulation depended on a government's gold
or silver reserves. But after the US abolished
this system in 1971, the dollar became
what is known as fiat money, meaning not linked
to any external resource but relying instead solely
on government policy to decide how much currency to print. Which branch of our government
sets this policy? The Executive, the Legislative,
or the Judicial? The surprising answer is:
none of the above! In fact, monetary policy is set
by an independent Federal Reserve System, or the Fed, made up of 12 regional banks
in major cities around the country. Its board of governors, which is appointed by the president
and confirmed by the Senate, reports to Congress, and all the Fed's profit
goes into the US Treasury. But to keep the Fed from being influenced by the day-to-day
vicissitudes of politics, it is not under the direct control
of any branch of government. Why doesn't the Fed just decide
to print infinite hundred dollar bills to make everyone happy and rich? Well, because then the bills
wouldn't be worth anything. Think about the purpose of currency, which is to be exchanged
for goods and services. If the total amount
of currency in circulation increases faster than the total value
of goods and services in the economy, then each individual piece will be able to buy a smaller portion
of those things than before. This is called inflation. On the other hand, if the money supply remains the same, while more goods
and services are produced, each dollar's value would increase in a process known as deflation. So which is worse? Too much inflation means that the money in your wallet today
will be worth less tomorrow, making you want to spend it right away. While this would stimulate business,
it would also encourage overconsumption, or hoarding commodities,
like food and fuel, raising their prices and leading to consumer shortages
and even more inflation. But deflation would make people
want to hold onto their money, and a decrease in consumer spending would reduce business profits, leading to more unemployment
and a further decrease in spending, causing the economy to keep shrinking. So most economists believe that
while too much of either is dangerous, a small, consistent amount of inflation
is necessary to encourage economic growth. The Fed uses vast amounts of economic data to determine how much currency
should be in circulation, including previous rates of inflation, international trends,
and the unemployment rate. Like in the story of Goldilocks, they need to get the numbers just right in order to stimulate growth
and keep people employed, without letting inflation
reach disruptive levels. The Fed not only determines how much that paper
in your wallet is worth but also your chances
of getting or keeping the job where you earn it.

or the Judicial? The surprising answer is:
none of the above! In fact, monetary policy is set
by an independent Federal Reserve System, or the Fed, made up of 12 regional banks
in major cities around the country. Its board of governors, which is appointed by the president
and confirmed by the Senate, reports to Congress, and all the Fed's profit
goes into the US Treasury. But to keep the Fed from being influenced by the day-to-day
vicissitudes of politics, it is not under the direct control
of any branch of government. Why doesn't the Fed just decide
to print infinite hundred dollar bills to make everyone happy and rich? Well, because then the bills
wouldn't be worth anything. Think about the purpose of currency, which is to be exchanged
for goods and services. If the total amount
of currency in circulation increases faster than the total value
of goods and services in the economy, then each individual piece will be able to buy a smaller portion
of those things than before. This is called inflation. On the other hand, if the money supply remains the same, while more goods
and services are produced, each dollar's value would increase in a process known as deflation. So which is worse? Too much inflation means that the money in your wallet today
will be worth less tomorrow, making you want to spend it right away. While this would stimulate business,
it would also encourage overconsumption, or hoarding commodities,
like food and fuel, raising their prices and leading to consumer shortages
and even more inflation. But deflation would make people
want to hold onto their money, and a decrease in consumer spending would reduce business profits, leading to more unemployment
and a further decrease in spending, causing the economy to keep shrinking. So most economists believe that
while too much of either is dangerous, a small, consistent amount of inflation
is necessary to encourage economic growth. The Fed uses vast amounts of economic data to determine how much currency
should be in circulation, including previous rates of inflation, international trends,
and the unemployment rate. Like in the story of Goldilocks, they need to get the numbers just right in order to stimulate growth
and keep people employed, without letting inflation
reach disruptive levels. The Fed not only determines how much that paper
in your wallet is worth but also your chances
of getting or keeping the job where you earn it.

If you tried to pay for something
with a piece of paper, you might run into some trouble. Unless, of course, the piece of paper
was a hundred dollar bill. But what is it that makes that bill
so much more interesting and valuable than other pieces of paper? After all, there's not much
you can do with it. You can't eat it. You can't build things with it. And burning it is actually illegal. So what's the big deal? Of course, you probably know the answer. A hundred dollar bill
is printed by the government and designated as official currency, while other pieces of paper are not. But that's just what makes them legal. What makes a hundred dollar bill
valuable, on the other hand, is how many or few of them are around. Throughout history, most currency,
including the US dollar, was linked to valuable commodities and the amount of it in circulation depended on a government's gold
or silver reserves. But after the US abolished
this system in 1971, the dollar became
what is known as fiat money, meaning not linked
to any external resource but relying instead solely
on government policy to decide how much currency to print. Which branch of our government
sets this policy? The Executive, the Legislative,
or the Judicial? The surprising answer is:

[Music] [Applause] here to talk about the Wonder and the Mystery of conscious Minds The Wonder is about the fact that we all woke up this morning and we had with it the amazing return of our conscious mind uh we recovered Minds with a complete sense of self and a complete sense of our own existence and we hardly ever pause to consider this Wonder we should in fact because without having this possibility of conscious Minds we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our Humanity we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world we would have no pains but also no Joys we would have no access to love or to the ability to create uh and of course Scott Fitzgerald said famously that uh he who invented Consciousness uh would have a lot to be blamed for but he also forgot that uh without Consciousness he would have no access to true happiness and even to the possibility of transcendence so much for the Wonder now for the mystery this is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to elucidate uh all the way back into early philos phos ophy and certainly throughout the history of Neuroscience uh this has been one mystery that has always resisted elucidation has caused major controversies and there are actually many people that think that we should not even touch it we should just leave it alone it's not to be solved I don't believe that and I think the situation is changing it would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make Consciousness uh in our in our brains but we certainly can begin to approach the the the question and we can begin to see the shape um of a solution and one more Wonder to celebrate uh is the fact that we have Imaging Technologies that now allow us to go inside the human brain and be able to do for example what you're seeing right now these are images that come from hanasu lab and which show you in a living brain the Reconstruction of that brain and this is a person who alive this is not a person that uh is being studied at autopsy and even more and this is something that one can be really amazed about is what I'm going to show you next which is going underneath the surface of the brain and actually looking in the living brain at real connections real Pathways so all of those colored lines correspond to Bunches of axons the fibers that join cell bodies to uh synapses and I'm sorry to disappoint you they don't come in color but at any rate uh they are there the colors are codes for the direction for whether it is back to front or vice versa um at any rate what is consciousness uh what is a conscious mind uh and we could take a very simple view and say well it is that which we lose when we fall into uh deep uh sleep without dreams uh or when we go under anesthesia and it is what we regain when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia um but what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia or when we are in deep dreamless Sleep well first of all uh it is a mind which is a flow of mental images and of course consider images that can be sensory patterns visual such as you're having right now in relation to the stage in me or auditory images as you're having now in relation to my to my words that flow of mental images is mind but there is something else that we all experiencing in this room we are not passive exhibitors of visual or auditory or tactile images we have selves we have a me that is automatically present in our minds right now we own our minds and we have a sense that it's every one of us that is experiencing in this not the person who is sitting uh next to you so in order to have a conscious mind you have a self within the conscious mind so a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it the self introduces a subjective perspective in the mind and we are only fully conscious when self comes to mind so what we need to know to even address this mystery is number one how minds are put together in the brain and number two how selves are con constructed now the first part the first problem is relatively easy it's not easy at all but it it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience and uh it's quite clear that in order to make Minds we need to construct neural Maps so imagine a grid like the one I'm showing you right now and now imagine within that grid that two-dimensional sheath imagine neurons and picture if you will a billboard a digital billboard where you have elements that can be either lit or not and depending on how you create the pattern of lighting or not lighting the digital elements or for that matter the neurons in the sheet you're going to be able to construct a map this is of course a visual map that I'm showing you but this applies to any kind of map auditory for example in relation to sound frequencies or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate now to bring home the point of how close it is the relationship between the grid of neurons and the topographical arrangement of the the activity of the neurons and our mental experience I'm going to tell you a personal story so if I cover my left eye I'm talking about me personally not all of you if I cover my left eye I look at the grid pretty much like the one I'm showing you everything is nice and fine and perpendicular but some time ago I discovered that if I cover my left eye instead what I get is this I look at the grid and I see a warping at the edge of my central left field very odd I've analyzed this for a while but some time ago uh through the help of an opthalmologist colleague of mine Carmen Pito who developed a laser scanner of the retina I found out the following if I scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner what I get is the following on the right side my retina is perfectly symmetrical you see the going down towards the fobia uh where the optic nerve begins but on my left retina there is a bump which is marked there by the red arrow and it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below and that is exactly what causes the warping of my visual image so just think of this you have a grid of neurons and now you have a plain mechanical uh change in the position of the grid and you get a warping of your mental experience so this is how close your mental experience and the activity of the neurons in the retina which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball or for that matter a sheath of visual cortex so from the retina you go on to visual cortex and the of course the brain adds on a lot of information to what is going on in the signals that come from the retina and in that image there you see a variety of islands of what I call imag making regions in the brain you have the green for example that corresponds to tactile information or the blue that corresponds to auditory information and something else that happens is that those image making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural Maps can then provide signals to this ocean of purple that you see around which is Association cortex where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image making and the great beauty is that you can then go from memory out of those Association cortices and produce back images in the very same regions that had perception so think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy the the brain is so it provides certain areas for perception and image making and those are exactly the same that are going to be used for image making when we recall information so so far the The Mystery of the conscious mind is diminishing a little bit because we have a general sense of how we make these images but what about the self the self is really the elusive problem and um for a long time people did not even want to touch it and because they say how can you have this sort of reference point this stability that is required to maintain the continuity of cells day after day um and I thought about a solution to this problem is the following we generate brain maps of the body's interior and use them as the reference for all other Maps so let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this I came to this because if you're going to have a reference that we know as self the me the I in in our own uh processing we need to have something that is stable something that does not deviate much from day to day well it so happens that we have a singular body we have one body not two not three and so that is a beginning there is just one reference point which is the body but then of course the body has many parts and things grow at different rates and they have different sizes in different people however not so with the interior the things that have to do with what is known as our internal milar for example the whole management of the chemistries within our body are in fact extremely maintained day after day for one very good reason if you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that life permitting survival range you go into disease or death so we have an inbuilt system within our own lives that ensures some kind of continuity I I like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day because if you don't have that sameness physiologically you're going to be sick or you're going to die so that's one more element for this continuity and the final thing is that there is a very tight coupling between the regulation of our body within the brain and the body itself unlike any other coupling so for example I'm making images of you but there's no physiological bond between the images I have of you as an audience and my brain however there is a close permanently permanently maintained bond between the body regulating parts of my brain and my own body so here's how it looks look at the region there there is the brain stem in between the cereal cortex and the spinal cord and it is within that region that I'm going to highlight now that we have this housing of all the life regulation devices of a body this is so specific that for example if you look at the part that is colored in red in the upper part of the brain stem if you damage that as a result of a stroke for example what you get is coma or vegetative state which is a state of course in which your mind disappears your Consciousness disappears H what what happens then actually is that you lose the surrounding of the self you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence and in fact there can be images going on being formed in the cereal cortex except you don't know they're there you have you have in effect lost Consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem but if you consider the green part of the brain stem nothing like that happens it is that specific so in that green component of the brain stem if you damage it and often it happens what you get is complete paralysis but your conscious mind is maintained you feel you know you have a fully conscious mind that you can report very indirectly this is a horrific condition you don't want to see it uh and people are in fact imprisoned within their own bodies but they do have a mind there was a very interesting film one of the rare good films done about a situation like this by Julian Schnabel some some years ago about a patient that was in that condition so now I'm going to show you a picture I promise not to say anything about this except this is to frighten you is just to tell you that in that red section of the brain stem there are to make it simple all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make brain maps of different aspects of our interior different aspects of our body they are exquisitely topographic and are exquisitly interconnected in a recursive pattern and it is out of this and out of this tight coupling between the brain stem and the body that I believe and I could be wrong but I don't think I am uh that you generate this mapping of the body that provides the grounding for the self and that comes in the form of feelings primordial Feelings by the way so what is the picture that we get here look at cerebal cortex look at brain stem look at body and you get a picture the interconnectivity in which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self in a very tight interconnection with the body and you have the cereal cortex providing the great spectacle of our minds with the profusion of images that are in fact the contents of our minds and that we normally pay most attention to as we should because that's really the film that is rolling in our minds but look at the the the arrows that're not there for looks that there because there's this very close interaction you cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between cereal cortex and brain stem you cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between the brain stem and the body another thing that is interesting is that the brain stem that we have is shared with a variety of other species so throughout vertebrates the design of the brain stem is very similar to ours which is one of the reasons why I think those other species have conscious Minds like we do except that they're not as rich as ours because they don't have a cereal cortex like we do that's where the difference is and I strongly disagree with the idea that Consciousness should be cons considered as the great product of the cereal cortex only the wealth of our minds is not the very fact that we have a self that we can refer to our own existence and that we have any sense of um person now there are three levels of self to consider the Proto the core and the autobiographical the first two are shared with many many other species and they are really coming out largely of the brain stem and whatever there is of Cortex in those species it's the autobiographical self which some species have I think satans and primates have also an autobiographical self to a certain degree and everybody's dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree but the novelty is here the autobiographical self is built on the basis of past memories and memories of the plans that we have made it's the lived past and the anticipated future and the autobiographical self has prompted extended memory reasoning imagination creativity and language and out of that came the instruments of culture religions Justice trade the Arts science technology and it is within that culture that we really can get and this is the novelty something that is not entirely set by our biology it is developed in the cultures it developed in collectives of uh human beings and this is of course the culture where we have developed something that I like to call sociocultural regulation and finally you could rightly ask why care about this why care if it is the brain stem or the Cal cortex and how this is made three reasons first curiosity primates are extremely curious and humans most of all and if we are interested for example in the fact that anti-gravity is pulling galaxies away from the earth why should we not be interested in what is going on inside of human beings second understanding society and culture we should look at how society and culture uh in this sociocultural regulation are a work in progress and finally medicine let's not forget that some of the worst dis diseases of humankind are diseases such as depression Alzheimer's disease drug addiction think of Strokes that can devastate your mind or render you unconscious you have no prayer of understanding how the of of treating those diseases effectively and in a non- serendipitous way if you do not know how this works so that's a very good reason Beyond curiosity to justify what we're doing and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains thank you for your attention

I think if it wasn't for football… I can't really imagine myself without football.  Certain things, certain principles in my life are based on my football. I don't know if you understand what I mean.  [♪ native music ♪] [children playing] [♪ native music ♪] This is my place. Its a very small place. Its just a four room house. This is where we sit as a family, watch TV, eat supper, and chat. Just family chats. I'll show you the kitchen where we cook our dinner. This is my kitchen. Its not a very big place but it is where I live. This is my bedroom; I share it with my aunt, but unfortunately now she is asleep because she was working night shift. This is my bed. I sleep here with my kitten. Oh yes, this is my kitten. It is my friend. I sleep with her almost every night. This is my aunt. She stays here. She is selling veggies and fruit and her business is definitely going very well. In one week you find that you come and buy something and then its not there, its finished. So she's got a business that is doing well. This road that we are walking on, this is where I started playing soccer when I got to Port Elizabeth.  We put small stones, there would be goals on each side of the road, then we'd be playing with the guys.  That was before there was grass here. There was no grass here, so we would play from that wall to this side of the road. I grew up playing here and when I see this road or when I walk here I always remember where I started playing soccer. [♪ native music ♪] Most of the time I was with my other two cousin-brothers, and they would spend most of their time playing soccer and that's how I got on to the field and played as well.

My school shoes, the sole was broken, so when it was raining, my socks would be so wet. And in terms of food, there was absolutely nothing to eat. [♪ native music ♪] For me to be able to eat at school I would have to wait until we are writing a test. Then each pupil would put on 10 cents or 20 cents. Then the whole amount would go to the person who was the highest on a test, and that is how I would manage to eat, because, if we were writing a test and put on some money, it was definitely my money because I was a very good student.

[♪ native hip-hop music ♪] People love soccer, and the young kids out there, they are interested in soccer.

[♪ native hip-hop music ♪] The older guys have gone through things in their lives, but would like to teach the kids so that they could not go through those things. The way we would do is with interactive games. So we don't really say, "Yeah, we're going to talk about HIV now." Some people might just lose interest in it, but simply because its interactive, we do the actual activities where they just learn from them. And its not as if we are telling them what to do, like to abstain. [♪ native hip-hop music ♪] So why was it not easy to find the ball? Because you couldn't see the ball. So remember when we play that game, what did you say? Teacher>Yes my girl, say it. 
Student>Someone who has the ball is going to be HIV positive. So what does that tell you about HIV? You can't see someone who has HIV. [clapping] Since we work with kids we use the power of soccer, and we use soccer balls because kids love to play. If you just make them play, especially with our street leagues, the way we do the teaching for HIV and AIDS gives them time to play soccer. [♪ native hip-hop music ♪] Those are tools for them to be better people, to stay away from things that could destroy their lives. [♪ native hip-hop music ♪] After we've done the program, we also assess the change in their attitudes. [♪ native hip-hop music ♪]

It really makes more sense to be able to have others help because, really, we cannot live in isolation. Honestly, we could be a unity here, but what about the others that are not a unity? We are going to say, yes we are a unity, that is fine for us. They are not a unity, that's their own problem. It shouldn't be like that. [♪ native music ♪] If people could unite.

Honeybees are fascinating creatures 
for a number of reasons: their incredible work ethic, the sugary sweet syrup they produce and their intricate social structure. But another reason is 
that honeybees are, in fact, excellent mathematicians. Scientists claim the tiny insects 
can calculate angles, and can even comprehend
the roundness of the Earth. But there's particular
mathematical bee genius behind the most important aspect 
of honeybee life: the hive. Just like humans, bees need food
and shelter to stay alive. The hive is not only the bees' home, but doubles as a place
to store their honey. Since it's so central to survival, honeybees have to perfect
the hive's architectural design. If you examine any piece of honeycomb, you'll see that it's constructed from tightly packed hexagonal, 
or six-sided, cells. Of all the possible designs, why do honeybees choose this one? To understand, you need
to think like a bee. Bees need a secure place 
for their entire colony to live. Similarly, there needs to be a place where their nectar can 
be stored and ripened suitably until it turns into honey. That means there's a need
for some serious space efficiency. A good solution is to build
little storage units, or cells, just big enough for a bee to fit into, which can also double as the containers
in which nectar is stored: The bees' very own honey jars. The next thing, is to decide what
the little cells should be made out of. Bees don't have beaks
or arms to pick up things, but they are capable of producing wax. The thing is, producing it 
is a lot of hard work. Bees have to consume 8 ounces of honey to produce just 1 ounce of wax. So they don't want to waste it. So, they need a design 
that allows them to store the largest possible amount of honey using the least amount of wax. What shape does that? Imagining for a minute 
that all bees had to attend architecture academy 
and go to math class. Let's say they asked 
their geometry teacher, "What shape would give us
the most space to store our honey, but require the least amount of wax?" And then geometry teacher replied, "The shape that you're seeking 
is the circle." Leaving the bees to return
to their trial construction site and begin building their honeycomb
using circular cells. After a while, some of them 
might have noticed a problem with their design: small gaps between the cells. "We can't even fit in there! 
That's wasted space!" they might have thought. So, ignoring the geometry lesson, and taking matters into their own hands, the bees went back to the drawing board to rethink their beehive design. One suggested triangles, "We can use triangles. Look! 
They fit together perfectly." Another bee suggested squares. Finally, a third bee piped up and said, "Pentagons don't seem to work, 
but hexagons do! We want the one that will use 
the least amount of wax and be able to store 
the most amount of honey. Yes, I think that's the hexagon." "Why?" "It looks more like the circle 
than the others." "But how do we know for sure?" To find out, the industrious 
insect architects calculated the areas of the triangle,
the square and the hexagon and found that the hexagon was, in fact, the shape that gave them
the most storage space. They agreed on an ideal size 
and returned to work. The space efficient comb that 
is a bee's trademark today, is probably the result 
of this trial and error, but over long periods 
of evolutionary history. However, it paid off. Peek into any hive -- with your protective goggles 
and netting on, of course -- and you'll see the end result: 
a beautiful compact honeycomb that any architect would have 
be proud to design.

is a lot of hard work. Bees have to consume 8 ounces of honey to produce just 1 ounce of wax. So they don't want to waste it. So, they need a design 
that allows them to store the largest possible amount of honey using the least amount of wax. What shape does that? Imagining for a minute 
that all bees had to attend architecture academy 
and go to math class. Let's say they asked 
their geometry teacher, "What shape would give us
the most space to store our honey, but require the least amount of wax?" And then geometry teacher replied, "The shape that you're seeking 
is the circle." Leaving the bees to return
to their trial construction site and begin building their honeycomb
using circular cells. After a while, some of them 
might have noticed a problem with their design: small gaps between the cells. "We can't even fit in there! 
That's wasted space!" they might have thought. So, ignoring the geometry lesson, and taking matters into their own hands, the bees went back to the drawing board to rethink their beehive design. One suggested triangles, "We can use triangles. Look! 
They fit together perfectly." Another bee suggested squares. Finally, a third bee piped up and said, "Pentagons don't seem to work, 
but hexagons do! We want the one that will use 
the least amount of wax and be able to store 
the most amount of honey. Yes, I think that's the hexagon." "Why?" "It looks more like the circle 
than the others." "But how do we know for sure?" To find out, the industrious 
insect architects calculated the areas of the triangle,
the square and the hexagon and found that the hexagon was, in fact, the shape that gave them
the most storage space. They agreed on an ideal size 
and returned to work. The space efficient comb that 
is a bee's trademark today, is probably the result 
of this trial and error, but over long periods 
of evolutionary history. However, it paid off. Peek into any hive -- with your protective goggles 
and netting on, of course -- and you'll see the end result: 
a beautiful compact honeycomb that any architect would have 
be proud to design.

Honeybees are fascinating creatures 
for a number of reasons: their incredible work ethic, the sugary sweet syrup they produce and their intricate social structure. But another reason is 
that honeybees are, in fact, excellent mathematicians. Scientists claim the tiny insects 
can calculate angles, and can even comprehend
the roundness of the Earth. But there's particular
mathematical bee genius behind the most important aspect 
of honeybee life: the hive. Just like humans, bees need food
and shelter to stay alive. The hive is not only the bees' home, but doubles as a place
to store their honey. Since it's so central to survival, honeybees have to perfect
the hive's architectural design. If you examine any piece of honeycomb, you'll see that it's constructed from tightly packed hexagonal, 
or six-sided, cells. Of all the possible designs, why do honeybees choose this one? To understand, you need
to think like a bee. Bees need a secure place 
for their entire colony to live. Similarly, there needs to be a place where their nectar can 
be stored and ripened suitably until it turns into honey. That means there's a need
for some serious space efficiency. A good solution is to build
little storage units, or cells, just big enough for a bee to fit into, which can also double as the containers
in which nectar is stored: The bees' very own honey jars. The next thing, is to decide what
the little cells should be made out of. Bees don't have beaks

**Transcript**:
The year was 1816. Europe and North America had just been through a devastating series of wars, and a slow recovery seemed to be underway, but nature had other plans. After two years of poor harvests, the spring brought heavy rains and cold, flooding the rivers and causing crop failures from the British Isles to Switzerland. While odd-colored snow fell in Italy and Hungary, famine, food riots and disease epidemics ensued. Meanwhile, New England was blanketed by a strange fog that would not disperse as the ground remained frozen well into June. In what came to be known as "the Year Without a Summer," some thought the apocalypse had begun. A mood captured in Lord Byron's poem "Darkness": "I had a dream which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars did wander darkling in the eternal space, rayless, and pathless, and the icy Earth swung blind and blackening in the moonless air; morn came and went -- and came, and brought no day." They had no way of knowing that the real source of their misfortunes had occurred a year ago thousands of miles away. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa was what is known as a supervolcano, characterized by a volume of erupted material, many times greater than that of ordinary volcanoes. And while the popular image of volcanic destruction is molten rock engulfing the surrounding land, far greater devastation is caused by what remains in the air. Volcanic ash, dispersed by wind, can blanket the sky for days, while toxic gases, such as sulfur dioxide, react in the stratosphere, blocking out solar radiation and drastically cooling the atmosphere below. The resulting volcanic winter, along with other effects such as acid rain, can effect multiple continents, disrupting natural cycles and annihilating the plant life on which other organisms, including humans, depend. Releasing nearly 160 cubic kilometers of rock, ash and gas, the Mount Tambora eruption was the largest in recorded history, causing as many as 90,000 deaths. But previous eruptions have been even more deadly. The 1600 eruption of Peru's Huaynaputina is likely to have triggered the Russian famine, that killed nearly two million, while more ancient eruptions have been blamed for major world events, such as the fall of the Chinese Xia Dynasty, the disappearance of the Minoan civilization, and even a genetic bottleneck in human evolution that may have resulted from all but a few thousand human beings being wiped out 70,000 years ago. One of the most dangerous types of supervolcano is an explosive caldera, formed when a volcanic mountain collapses after an eruption so large that the now-empty magma chamber can no longer support its weight. But though the above-ground volcano is gone, the underground volcanic activity continues. With no method of release, magma and volcanic gases continue to accumulate and expand underground, building up pressure until a massive and violent explosion becomes inevitable. And one of the largest active volcanic calderas lies right under Yellowstone National Park. The last time it erupted, 650,000 years ago, it covered much of North America in nearly two meters of ash and rock. Scientists are currently monitoring the world's active volcanoes, and procedures for predicting eruptions, conducting evacuations and diverting lava flows have improved over the years. But the massive scale and global reach of a supervolcano means that for many people there would be nowhere to run. Fortunately, the current data shows no evidence of such an eruption occurring in the next few thousand years. But the idea of a sudden and unavoidable civilization-destroying apocalypse caused by events half a globe away will remain a powerful and terrifying vision. Less fictional than we would like to believe. "The winds were withered in the stagnant air, and the clouds perish'd; darkness had no need of aid from them -- she was the universe." - Lord Byron

**Transcript**:
The year was 1816. Europe and North America had just been through a devastating series of wars, and a slow recovery seemed to be underway, but nature had other plans. After two years of poor harvests, the spring brought heavy rains and cold, flooding the rivers and causing crop failures from the British Isles to Switzerland. While odd-colored snow fell in Italy and Hungary, famine, food riots and disease epidemics ensued. Meanwhile, New England was blanketed by a strange fog that would not disperse as the ground remained frozen well into June. In what came to be known as "the Year Without a Summer," some thought the apocalypse had begun. A mood captured in Lord Byron's poem "Darkness": "I had a dream which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars did wander darkling in the eternal space, rayless, and pathless, and the icy Earth swung blind and blackening in the moonless air; morn came and went -- and came, and brought no day." They had no way of knowing that the real source of their misfortunes had occurred a year ago thousands of miles away. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa was what is known as a supervolcano, characterized by a volume of erupted material, many times greater than that of ordinary volcanoes. And while the popular image of volcanic destruction is molten rock engulfing the surrounding land, far greater devastation is caused by what remains in the air. Volcanic ash, dispersed by wind, can blanket the sky for days, while toxic gases, such as sulfur dioxide, react in the stratosphere, blocking out solar radiation and drastically cooling the atmosphere below. The resulting volcanic winter, along with other effects such as acid rain, can effect multiple continents, disrupting natural cycles and annihilating the plant life on which other organisms, including humans, depend. Releasing nearly 160 cubic kilometers of rock, ash and gas, the Mount Tambora eruption was the largest in recorded history, causing as many as 90,000 deaths. But previous eruptions have been even more deadly. The 1600 eruption of Peru's Huaynaputina is likely to have triggered the Russian famine, that killed nearly two million, while more ancient eruptions have been blamed for major world events, such as the fall of the Chinese Xia Dynasty, the disappearance of the Minoan civilization, and even a genetic bottleneck in human evolution that may have resulted from all but a few thousand human beings being wiped out 70,000 years ago. One of the most dangerous types of supervolcano is an explosive caldera, formed when a volcanic mountain collapses after an eruption so large that the now-empty magma chamber can no longer support its weight. But though the above-ground volcano is gone, the underground volcanic activity continues. With no method of release, magma and volcanic gases continue to accumulate and expand underground, building up pressure until a massive and violent explosion becomes inevitable. And one of the largest active volcanic calderas lies right under Yellowstone National Park. The last time it erupted, 650,000 years ago, it covered much of North America in nearly two meters of ash and rock. Scientists are currently monitoring the world's active volcanoes, and procedures for predicting eruptions, conducting evacuations and diverting lava flows have improved over the years. But the massive scale and global reach of a supervolcano means that for many people there would be nowhere to run. Fortunately, the current data shows no evidence of such an eruption occurring in the next few thousand years. But the idea of a sudden and unavoidable civilization-destroying apocalypse caused by events half a globe away will remain a powerful and terrifying vision. Less fictional than we would like to believe. "The winds were withered in the stagnant air, and the clouds perish'd; darkness had no need of aid from them -- she was the universe." - Lord Byron

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so I just want to tell you my story I spend a lot of time teaching adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace and naturally I encounter a lot of resistance right because it's sort of considered to be anti intellectual and counter to serious learning but I have a problem with that belief because I know that doodling has a profound impact on the way that we can process information and the way that we can solve problems so I was curious about why there was a disconnect between the way that our society perceives doodling and the way that the reality is so I discovered some very interesting things for example there is no such thing as a flattering definition of a doodle in the 17th century a doodle was a simpleton or a fool as in Yankee Doodle in the 18th century it became a verb and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone in the 19th century it was a corrupt politician and today we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition at least to me which is the following to doodle officially means to dawdle to dilly-dally to monkey around to make meaningless marks to do something of little value substance or import and my personal favorite to do nothing no wonder people erver is to Dueling at work doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work it's totally inappropriate additionally I've heard horror stories from people whose teachers scolded them of course for doodling in classrooms and they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom there is a powerful cultural norm against doodling in settings in which we are supposed to learn something and unfortunately the press tends to reinforce this norm when they're reporting on a doodling scene you know of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like they typically use words like discovered or caught or found out as if there's some sort of criminal act being committed and additionally there is a psychological aversion to doodling Thank You Freud in the 1930s Freud told us all that you could analyze people's psyches based on their doodles this is not accurate but it did happen to Tony Blair at the Davos forum in 2005 when his doodles were of course discovered and he was labeled the following things now it turned out to be Bill Gates's doodle and Bill if you're here nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal but that does contribute right to people not wanting to share their doodles and here is the real deal here's what I believe I think that our culture is so intensely focused on verbal information that we're almost blinded to the value of doodling and I'm not comfortable with that and so because of that belief that I think needs to be burst I'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth and here's the truth doodling is an incredibly powerful tool and it is a tool that we need to remember and to relearn so here's a new definition for doodling and I hope there's someone in here from the Oxford English Dictionary because I want to talk to you later here's the real definition doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think that is why millions of people doodle here's another interesting truth about the doodle people who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information retain more of that information than their non doodling counterparts we think diddling is something you do when you lose focus but in reality it is a pre-emptive measure to stop you from losing focus additionally it has a profound effect on creative problem-solving and deep information processing there are four ways that learners intake information so that they can make decisions they are visual auditory reading and writing and kinesthetic now in order for us to really chew on information and do something with it we have to engage at least two of those modalities or we have to engage one of those modalities coupled with an emotional experience the incredible contribution of

[Music] [Applause] so I just want to tell you my story I spend a lot of time teaching adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace and naturally I encounter a lot of resistance right because it's sort of considered to be anti intellectual and counter to serious learning but I have a problem with that belief because I know that doodling has a profound impact on the way that we can process information and the way that we can solve problems so I was curious about why there was a disconnect between the way that our society perceives doodling and the way that the reality is so I discovered some very interesting things for example there is no such thing as a flattering definition of a doodle in the 17th century a doodle was a simpleton or a fool as in Yankee Doodle in the 18th century it became a verb and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone in the 19th century it was a corrupt politician and today we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition at least to me which is the following to doodle officially means to dawdle to dilly-dally to monkey around to make meaningless marks to do something of little value substance or import and my personal favorite to do nothing no wonder people erver is to Dueling at work doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work it's totally inappropriate additionally I've heard horror stories from people whose teachers scolded them of course for doodling in classrooms and they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom there is a powerful cultural norm against doodling in settings in which we are supposed to learn something and unfortunately the press tends to reinforce this norm when they're reporting on a doodling scene you know of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like they typically use words like discovered or caught or found out as if there's some sort of criminal act being committed and additionally there is a psychological aversion to doodling Thank You Freud in the 1930s Freud told us all that you could analyze people's psyches based on their doodles this is not accurate but it did happen to Tony Blair at the Davos forum in 2005 when his doodles were of course discovered and he was labeled the following things now it turned out to be Bill Gates's doodle and Bill if you're here nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal but that does contribute right to people not wanting to share their doodles and here is the real deal here's what I believe I think that our culture is so intensely focused on verbal information that we're almost blinded to the value of doodling and I'm not comfortable with that and so because of that belief that I think needs to be burst I'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth and here's the truth doodling is an incredibly powerful tool and it is a tool that we need to remember and to relearn so here's a new definition for doodling and I hope there's someone in here from the Oxford English Dictionary because I want to talk to you later here's the real definition doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think that is why millions of people doodle here's another interesting truth about the doodle people who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information retain more of that information than their non doodling counterparts we think diddling is something you do when you lose focus but in reality it is a pre-emptive measure to stop you from losing focus additionally it has a profound effect on creative problem-solving and deep information processing there are four ways that learners intake information so that they can make decisions they are visual auditory reading and writing and kinesthetic now in order for us to really chew on information and do something with it we have to engage at least two of those modalities or we have to engage one of those modalities coupled with an emotional experience the incredible contribution of the doodle is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously with the possibility of an emotional experience that is a pretty solid contribution for a behavior equated with doing nothing this is so nerdy but this made me cry when I discovered this so they did anthropological research into the unfolding of artistic activity in children they found that across space and time all children

**Transcript**:
I didn't always love unintended consequences but I really learned to appreciate them I've learned that they're really the essence of what makes for progress even when they seem to be terrible and I'd like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do let's go to 40,000 years before the present to the time of the cultural explosion when music art technology so many of the things that we're enjoying today so many of the things that are being demonstrated at Ted were born and the anthropologist Randall White has made a very interesting observation that if our ancestors forty thousand years ago had been able to see what they had done they wouldn't have really understood it they were responding to immediate concerns they were making it possible for us to do what they do and yet they didn't really understand how they did it now let's advance to 10,000 years before the present and this is when it really gets interesting what about the domestication of grains what about the origins of Agriculture what would our ancestors 10,000 years ago have said if they really had technology assessment and I can just imagine the committee's reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity at least in the next few hundred years it was really bad news first of all worse nutrition maybe shorter lifespans it was simply awful for women the skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning noon and night and politically it was awful it was the beginning of a much higher degree of inequality among people if there had been rational technology assessment then I think they very well might have said let's call the whole thing off even now our choices are having unintended effects historically for example chopsticks according to one Japanese anthropologist who wrote a dissertation about it at the University of Michigan resulted in long-term changes in the dentition in the teeth of the Japanese public and we are also changing our teeth right now there there is evidence that the human mouth and teeth are growing smaller all the time that's not necessarily a bad unintended consequences but I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal there would have been a lot of disapproval of the wimpish choppers that we now have so these things are kind of relative to where you're you or your your ancestors happen to stand in the ancient world there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences there was a very healthy sense of caution reflected in the tree of knowledge in Pandora's Box and especially in the myth of Prometheus that's been so important in recent metaphors about technology and that's all very true the physicians of the ancient world especially the Egyptians who started medicine as we know it were very conscious of what they could and couldn't treat and the translations of the surviving text say this I will not treat this I cannot treat they were very conscious so were the followers of Hippocrates the Hippocratic manuscripts also repeatedly according to recent studies so how important it is not to do harm more recently Harvey Cushing who really developed neurosurgery as we know it who changed it from a field of medicine that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery to one in which there was a hopeful outlook he was very conscious that he was not always going to do the right thing but he did his best and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century we find a new style of technology what we find is no longer simple tools but systems we find more and more complex arrangements of machines that make it harder and harder to diagnose what's going on and the first people who saw that were the telegraphers of the mid 19th century who were the original hackers Thomas Edison would have been very very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today and these hackers have a word for those mysterious bugs and telegraph systems that they called bugs that was the origin of the word bug this consciousness though was a little slow to seep through the general population even people who were very very well-informed Samuel Clemens Mark Twain was a big investor in the most complex machine of all times at least until 1918 registered with the US Patent Office that was the page typesetter the page type setter had 18,000 parts the patent had 64 pages of text and 271 figures it was such a beautiful machine because it did everything that a human being did and setting type including returning the type to its place which was a very difficult thing and Mark Twain who knew all about typesetting really was was smitten by this machine unfortunately he was smitten in more ways than one because it made him bankrupt and he had to tour the world speaking to to recoup his money and this was an important thing about 19th century technology that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea fall apart even when judged by the most expert people now there was something else though in the early 20th century that made things even more complicated and that was that safety technology itself could be a source of danger the lesson of the Titanic for the contemporaries was that you must have enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship and this was the result of the tragic loss of lives of people who could not get into them however there was another pace the Eastland a ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in 1915 and it killed 841 people that was 14 more than the passenger toll of the Titanic the reason for it in part was the extra lifeboats that were added that made this already unstable ship even more unstable and that again proves that when you're talking about unintended consequences it's not that easy to know the right lessons to draw it's it's really a question of the system how the ship was loaded the ballast and many other things so the 20th century then saw how much more complex reality was but it also saw a positive side it saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies it could it could benefit from tragedies and my favorite example of that which is not really widely known as a technological miracle but it may be one of the greatest of all times was the scaling up of penicillin in the Second World War penicillin was discovered in 1928 but even by 1940 no commercially and medically useful quantities of it were being produced a number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it they were working on it independently and they weren't getting anywhere and the government Research Bureau brought representatives together and told them that this is something that has to be done and not only did they do it but within two years they scaled up penicillin from preparation in 1-litre flasks to ten thousand gallon vats that was how quickly penicillin was produced and became one of the greatest medical advance of all time in the Second World War to the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain so there were benefits in calamities benefits to pure science as well as to applied science and medicine now when we come to the period after the Second World War unintended consequences get even more interesting and my favorite example of that occurred beginning in 1976 when it was discovered that the bacteria causing Legionnaires disease had always been present in natural waters but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating ventilating and air-conditioning systems that raised the right temperature for the maximum reproduction of Legionella bacillus well technology to the rescue and so a chemist got to work and they developed a bactericide that became widely used in those systems but something else happened in the early 1980s and that was that there was a mysterious epidemic of failures of tape drives all over the United States and IBM which made them just didn't know what to do they commissioned a group of their best scientists to investigate and what they found was that all these tape drives were located near ventilation ducts what happened was the bactericide was formulated with many traces of 10 and these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads and were crashing the tape heads so they reformulated the bactericide but what's interesting to me is that this was the first case of a mechanical device suffering at least indirectly from a human disease so it shows that we're really all in this together in fact it also shows something interesting that although our capabilities and technology have been expanding geometrically unfortunately our ability to model their long term behavior which has also been increasing has been increasing only arithmetic aliy so one of the characteristic problems of our time is how to close this gap between capabilities and foresight one other very positive consequence of 20th century technology though was the way in which other kinds of calamities could lead to positive advances there are two historians of business at the University of Maryland Brent Goldfarb and David Kirsch who have done some extremely interesting work much of it still unpublished on the history of major innovations they have combined the list of major innovations and they've discovered that the greatest number the greatest decade for fundamental innovations as reflected in all of the lists that others have made a number of lists that they emerged was the Great Depression and nobody knows just why this was so but one story can reflect something of it it was the origin of the Xerox copier which celebrated its fiftieth anniversary last year and Chester Carlson the inventor was a patent attorney he really was not intending to to work in in patent research but he couldn't really find an alternative technical job so this was the best job he could get he was upset by the low quality and high cost of existing patent reproductions and so he started to develop a system of dry photocopying which he patented in the late 1930s and which became the first dry photocopier that was commercially practical in 1960 so we see that sometimes as a result of these dislocations as a result of people leaving their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference that depressions and all kinds of other unfortunate events can have a paradoxically stimulating effect on creativity what does this mean it means I think that we're living in a time of unexpected possibilities think of the financial world for example the mentor of Warren Buffett Benjamin Graham developed his system of value investing as a result of his own losses in the 1929 crash and he published that book in the early 1930s and the book still exists in further editions and is still a fundamental text book so many important creative things can happen when people learn from disasters now think of the large and small plagues that we have now bedbugs killer bees spam and it's very possible that the solutions to those will really extend well beyond the immediate question if we think for example of Louis Pasteur who in the 1860s was asked to study the diseases of silkworms for the silk industry and his discoveries were really the beginning of the germ theory of disease so very often some kind of disaster sometimes the consequence for example of over cultivation of silkworms which was a problem in Europe at the time can be the key to something much bigger so this means that we need to take a different view of unintended consequences we need to take a really positive view we need to see what they can do for us we need to learn from those figures that I've mentioned we need to learn for example from dr. Cushing who killed patients in the course of his early operations he had to have some errors he had to have some mistakes and he learned meticulously from his mistakes and as a result when we say this isn't brain surgery that pays tribute how difficult it was for anyone to learn from their mistakes in a field of medicine that was considered so discouraging in its prospects and we can also remember how the pharmaceutical companies were willing to pool their knowledge to share their knowledge in the face of an emergency which they hadn't really been for years and years they might have been able to do it earlier the message then for me about unintended consequences is chaos happens let's make better use of it thank you very much

**Transcript**:
I didn't always love unintended consequences but I really learned to appreciate them I've learned that they're really the essence of what makes for progress even when they seem to be terrible and I'd like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do let's go to 40,000 years before the present to the time of the cultural explosion when music art technology so many of the things that we're enjoying today so many of the things that are being demonstrated at Ted were born and the anthropologist Randall White has made a very interesting observation that if our ancestors forty thousand years ago had been able to see what they had done they wouldn't have really understood it they were responding to immediate concerns they were making it possible for us to do what they do and yet they didn't really understand how they did it now let's advance to 10,000 years before the present and this is when it really gets interesting what about the domestication of grains what about the origins of Agriculture what would our ancestors 10,000 years ago have said if they really had technology assessment and I can just imagine the committee's reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity at least in the next few hundred years it was really bad news first of all worse nutrition maybe shorter lifespans it was simply awful for women the skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning noon and night and politically it was awful it was the beginning of a much higher degree of inequality among people if there had been rational technology assessment then I think they very well might have said let's call the whole thing off even now our choices are having unintended effects historically for example chopsticks according to one Japanese anthropologist who wrote a dissertation about it at the University of Michigan resulted in long-term changes in the dentition in the teeth of the Japanese public and we are also changing our teeth right now there there is evidence that the human mouth and teeth are growing smaller all the time that's not necessarily a bad unintended consequences but I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal there would have been a lot of disapproval of the wimpish choppers that we now have so these things are kind of relative to where you're you or your your ancestors happen to stand in the ancient world there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences there was a very healthy sense of caution reflected in the tree of knowledge in Pandora's Box and especially in the myth of Prometheus that's been so important in recent metaphors about technology and that's all very true the physicians of the ancient world especially the Egyptians who started medicine as we know it were very conscious of what they could and couldn't treat and the translations of the surviving text say this I will not treat this I cannot treat they were very conscious so were the followers of Hippocrates the Hippocratic manuscripts also repeatedly according to recent studies so how important it is not to do harm more recently Harvey Cushing who really developed neurosurgery as we know it who changed it from a field of medicine that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery to one in which there was a hopeful outlook he was very conscious that he was not always going to do the right thing but he did his best and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century we find a new style of technology what we find is no longer simple tools but systems we find more and more complex arrangements of machines that make it harder and harder to diagnose what's going on and the first people who saw that were the telegraphers of the mid 19th century who were the original hackers Thomas Edison would have been very very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today and these hackers have a word for those mysterious bugs and telegraph systems that they called bugs that was the origin of the word bug this consciousness though was a little slow to seep through the general

leaving their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference that depressions and all kinds of other unfortunate events can have a paradoxically stimulating effect on creativity what does this mean it means I think that we're living in a time of unexpected possibilities think of the financial world for example the mentor of Warren Buffett Benjamin Graham developed his system of value investing as a result of his own losses in the 1929 crash and he published that book in the early 1930s and the book still exists in further editions and is still a fundamental text book so many important creative things can happen when people learn from disasters now think of the large and small plagues that we have now bedbugs killer bees spam and it's very possible that the solutions to those will really extend well beyond the immediate question if we think for example of Louis Pasteur who in the 1860s was asked to study the diseases of silkworms for the silk industry and his discoveries were really the beginning of the germ theory of disease so very often some kind of disaster sometimes the consequence for example of over cultivation of silkworms which was a problem in Europe at the time can be the key to something much bigger so this means that we need to take a different view of unintended consequences we need to take a really positive view we need to see what they can do for us we need to learn from those figures that I've mentioned we need to learn for example from dr. Cushing who killed patients in the course of his early operations he had to have some errors he had to have some mistakes and he learned meticulously from his mistakes and as a result when we say this isn't brain surgery that pays tribute how difficult it was for anyone to learn from their mistakes in a field of medicine that was considered so discouraging in its prospects and we can also remember how the pharmaceutical companies were willing to pool their knowledge to share their knowledge in the face of an emergency which they hadn't really been for years and years they might have been able to do it earlier the message then for me about unintended consequences is chaos happens let's make better use of it thank you very much

Gravity. It controls the universe. Everything attracts everything else. Ouch! Including you. Ow! In this final lesson, we'll explore what gravity means for space-time, or rather what space-time means for gravity. Until now, we've been dealing with things moving at constant speeds, with straight world lines in space-time. But once you add gravity, if you measure a speed at one moment, then again a bit later, the speed may have changed. In other words, as I discovered, gravity causes acceleration, so we need the world line to look different from one moment to the next. As we saw in the last lesson, the correct way to tilt an object's world line is using a Lorentz transformation: Einstein's stretch and squash trick. So, to map out what gravity is doing to Tom's motion, we need to create a whole load of little patches of space-time, each transformed by different amounts. So that my world line is at a different angle in each one. And then, we're ready to stitch everything together. We assemble a cozy quilt of space-time where world lines look curved. Where the world lines join, the objects collide. By making these connections between the patches, a curvature gets built into space-time itself. But Einstein's true genius was to describe precisely how each patch is stretched and squashed according to nearby mass and energy. The mere presence of stuff curves the space-time, and curving space-time moves the stuff around. This is gravity, according to Einstein. Previously, Isaac Newton had explained gravity using the ideas of force and acceleration, without any wibbily wobbly space-time, and that did pretty well. But Einstein's theory does just slightly better at predicting, for example, the orbit of Mercury around the Sun, or the way that light rays are deflected by massive objects. More importantly, Einstein's theory predicts things that simply don't exist in older theories where space, time and gravity were separate. The stitching can leave wrinkles in the space-time material. These are called gravitational waves, which should be detectable as tiny, repetitive, subtle squashes and stretches in space. So we're building experiments to check if they are there. In the meantime, indirect evidence, most recently in the polarization patterns of light left over from the Big Bang, strongly suggest that they are. But despite Einstein's successes, when too much stuff gets concentrated in too small a space, like in a black hole, the curvature of space-time becomes so large, that his equations collapse. We need a new picture of space-time that incorporates quantum mechanics to unlock the secret at the heart of black holes. Which means there's plenty more to be discovered about space, time, and space-time in the future.

We need a new picture of space-time that incorporates quantum mechanics to unlock the secret at the heart of black holes. Which means there's plenty more to be discovered about space, time, and space-time in the future.

**Transcript**:
Cancer is like a car crash. Your body typically regulates the speed at which your cells divide, but sometimes, cancer cuts the brake lines, and your cells divide too quickly, accumulating mutations that cause them to veer away from their original function, form dangerous tumors, and land you in the hospital. Cancer is basically an inability of the body to control the speed at which cells divide. When cells divide too quickly, they can often accumulate mutations that cause them to ignore their original function in the body, forming tumors. In turn, these tumors may interfere with the natural processes of the body, such as digestion and respiration, potentially leading to death. Typically, your body has a number of genetic mechanisms to control how fast your cells divide. One of these genes is BRCA1, which stands for breast cancer susceptibility gene 1. BRCA1 belongs to a class of genes called tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressor genes are involved in regulating how fast a cell divides. Normally, cell division follows an orderly process called the cell cycle, which is basically the life cycle of a cell. Within the cell cycle is a series of checkpoints, where proteins, such as the one produced by BRCA1, regulate how fast the cell may proceed. How does it do this? BRCA1 helps repair some forms of mutation in your DNA. If your DNA is damaged, BRCA1 keeps the cell from dividing until the mutation is repaired. You have two copies of the BRCA1 gene in every cell of your body. One copy you inherited from Mom, the other from Dad. This redundancy is a good a thing because you only need one functioning BRCA1 gene in a cell to regulate the cell cycle. But it's important to note that while these copies have a similar function they're not necessarily the same. In fact, there are hundreds of variations, or alleles, of BRCA1. Some regulate the cell cycle more effectively than others. In other words, some people are born with better regulating and repair mechanisms than others. And in some cases, mutations may render BRCA1 ineffective. When this happens, cells with damaged DNA are allowed to divide. As they divide, these cells may accumulate additional mutations. These mutations may cause the cell to become less specialized and stop performing its original function in the tissue. If this occurs, then there's a greater chance they'll develop into cancer cells. While we all have the gene, such as BRCA1, that can cause cancer, it's only when these genes fail at their function that problems develop. Having an ineffective or mutated version of BRCA1 can increase your susceptibility to cancer, much like driving with bad brakes increases the risk of an accident.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] I'd like to begin with a thought experiment imagine that it's 4,000 years into the future civilization as we know it has ceased to exist no books no electronic device no Facebook or Twitter all knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet has been lost now imagine archaeologists digging through the rubble of one of our cities what might they find well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic with stange symbols on them perhaps some circular pieces of metal maybe some cylindrical containers with some symbols on them and perhaps one Arch ologist becomes an instant celebrity when she discovers buried in the Hills somewhere in North America massive versions of these same symbols now let's ask ourselves what could such artifacts say about us to people 4,000 years into the future now this is no hypothetical question in fact this is exactly the kind of question we're faced with when we try to understand the Indus Valley Civilization which existed 4,000 years ago now the Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous with the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations so it occupied an area of approximately 1 million square kilometers covering what is now Pakistan Northwestern India and parts of Afghanistan and Iran now given that it was such a vast civilization you might expect to find really powerful rulers Kings and huge monuments glorifying these powerful Kings in fact what archaeologists have found is none of that they found small objects such as these so here's an example of one of these objects well obviously there's a replica but who is this person a king a god a priest or perhaps an ordinary person like you or me we don't know but the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them well no not pieces of plastic but Stone seals copper tablets pottery and surprisingly one large sign board which was found buried near the Gate of a city now we don't know if it says Hollywood or even Bollywood for that matter in fact we don't even know what any of these objects say and that's because the IND script is undeciphered we don't know what any of these symbols mean now the symbols are most commonly found on seals so you'll see up there one such object it's the square object with the Unicorn like animal on it now that's a magnificent piece of art so how big do you you think that is perhaps that big or maybe that big well let me show you so here's a replica of one such seal it's only about 1 in by 1 in in size pretty tiny so what were these used for we know that these were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other so you know those packing slips you get on your FedEx boxes so these were used to make those kinds of packing slips now you might wonder what these objects contain in terms of their text so perhaps they the name of the the sender or some information about the goods that are being send from one place to the other we don't know we would need to decipher the script to answer that question now deciphering the script is not just an intellectual puzzle it's actually become a question that's become deeply intertwined with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia in fact the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people so first there's a group of people who are very passionate in their belief that the indis script does not represent a language at all these people believe that the symbols are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs or the emblems you find on Shields now there's a second group of people who believe that the indos script represents an Indo-European language so if you look at a map of India today you'll see that most of the languages spoken in North India belong to the Indo European language family so some people believe that the indos script represents an ancient Indo-European language such as Sanskrit now there's a last group of people who believe that the Indus people were the ancestors of people living in South India today now these people believe that the indos script represents an ancient form of the dravidian language family which is the language family spoken in much of South India today and the proponents of this Theory point to that small pocket of dravidian speaking people in the north actually near Afghanistan and they say that perhaps sometime in the past past dravidian languages were spoken all over India and that this suggests that the Indus civilizations perhaps also dravidian now which of these hypotheses can be true we don't know but perhaps if you decipher the script you would be able to answer this question but deciphering the script is a very challenging Tex first there's no Rosetta Stone well I don't mean the software I mean an ancient artifact that contains the same text in both a known text and in an unknown text so we don't have such an artifact for the indos script and furthermore we don't even know what language they spoke and to make matters even worse most of the texts that we have are extremely short so as I showed you they're usually found on these seals that are very very tiny and so given these formidable obstacles one might wonder and worry whether one will ever be able to decipher the IND the script so in the rest of my talk I'd like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying and love the challenge posted by the indes script now I've always been fascinated by the indes script ever since I read about it in a middle school textbook and why was that fascinated well it's the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world now my career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist so in my day job I create computer models of the brain to try to understand how the brain makes predictions how the brain makes decisions how the brain learns and so on but in 2007 my path crossed again with the indos script that's when I was in India and I had the wonderful opportunity to meet with some Indian scientists who were using computer models to try to analyze the script and so it was then that I realized it was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists and so I jumped at that opportunity and I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found or better yet let's talk collectively decipher you ready the first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script is try to figure out the direction of writing so here are two texts that contain some symbols on them so can you tell me if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right I'll give you give a couple of seconds okay right to left how many okay left to right oh it's almost 50/50 okay so the answer is if you look at the left hand side of the two texts you'll notice that there's a cramping of signs and it seems like 4,000 years ago when the Scribe was writing from right to left they ran out of space and so they had to cram the signs and one of the signs is also below the the text on the top and so this suggests the direction of writing was probably from right to left and so that's one of the first things we know directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts and the indos script now has this particular property what are the properties of language does it show so languages contain patterns right so if I give you the letter q and I ask you to predict the next letter what do you think that would be most of you said U which is right now if I ask you to predict one more letter what do you think that would be now there are several possibilities e it could be I it could be a but certainly not B C or D right right now the indes script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns so there's a lot of text that start with this diamond shaped symbol and this in turn tends to be followed by this quotation marks like symbol and this is very similar to a q andu example this symbol can in turn be followed by these fish like symbols and some other signs but never by these other signs at the bottom and furthermore there's some signs that really prefer the end of text such as this jar-shaped sign and this sign in fact happens to be also the most frequently occurring sign in the script now given such patterns here was our idea right so the idea was to use a computer to learn these patterns and so we gave the computer the existing text and the computer learned a statistical model of which symbols tend to occur together and which symbols tend to follow each other now given the computer model we can test the model by essentially quizzing it so we could deliberately erase some symbols and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols so here are some examples so you may regard this as perhaps the most ancient game of The Wheel of Fortune so what we found was that the computer was successful in 75% of the cases in predicting the correct symbol now in the rest of the cases typically the second best guess or the third best guess was the right answer now there's also practical use for this particular procedure there's a lot of these texts that are damaged so here's an example of one such text and we can use the computer model now to to try to complete this text and make a best guess prediction so here's an example of a symbol that was predicted and this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script by generating more data that we can analyze now here's one other thing you could do with the computer model so imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard okay you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this now such a random jumble of letters is set to have a very high entropy this is a physics and information Theory term but just imagine it's a a very random dumble of letters now how many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard you might have encountered the stuck key problem so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again now this kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy because there's no variation at all Now language on the other hand has an intermediate level of entropy it's neither too rigid nor is it too random what about the IND the script so here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences so at the very top you find the uniformly r random sequence which is a random jumble of letters and interestingly also find a DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music and both of these are very very flexible which is why you find them at a very high range now at the lower end of the scale you find a rigid sequence a sequence of all A's and you also find a computer program in this case in the language Fortran which obeys really strict rules linguistic scripts occupy the middle range now what about the indos script so we found that the indos script actually falls within the range of the linguistic script scripts now when this result was first published it was highly controversial there were people who were raising a human cribe and these people were the ones who believed that the indos script does not represent language I even started to get some hate mail my students said that I should really seriously consider getting some protection now who would have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession now what does this result really show it shows that the indos script shares an important property of language anguage so as the old saying goes if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands so what other evidence is there that the script could actually encode language well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages so for example here's the same sentence written in English and the same sentence written in Dutch using the same letters of the alphabet now if you don't know Dutch and you only know English and I give you some words in Dutch you'll tell me that these words contain some very unusual patterns some things are not right and you'll say these words are probably not English words now the same thing also happens in the case of the indes script so the computer found several texts two of them are shown here that have very unusual patterns so for example the first text there's a doubling of this jar shaped sign now this sign is the most frequently occurring sign in the IND script and it's only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair so why is that the case we went back and looked at where these particular texts were found it turns out that they were found very very far away from the Indus Valley they were found in present day Iraq and Iran and why were they found there well what I haven't told you is that the Indus people were very very enterprising they used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived and so in this case they were traveling by sea all the way to Mesopotamia present day Iraq and what seems to happen here is that the indust Traders the the Merchants were using the script to write a foreign language it's just like our English and Dutch example and that would explain why we have these strange patterns that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the texts that are found within the indis value so this suggests the same script the indis script could be used to write different languages the results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion that the IND script probably does represent language so if it does represent language then how do we read the symbol that's our next big challenge so you'll notice that many of the symbols look like pictures of humans of insects of fishes of birds so most ancient scripts use the Rebus principle which is using pictures to represent words so as an example here's a word can you write it using pictures I'll give you a couple of seconds got it okay great so here's my solution so you could use the picture of a bee followed by picture of a leaf and that's belief right it could be other Solutions now in the case of the IND descript the problem is the reverse so you have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense so this is just like a crossword puzzle except that this is the mother of all crossw puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it now my colleagues mahadevan and as parpola have been making some Headway on this particular problem and I'd like to give you a quick example of uh parula's work so here's a really short text it contains seven vertical Strokes followed by this fish-like sign and I already mentioned that these seals were used for stamping clay TXS that were attached to bundles of goods so it's quite likely that these TXS at least some of them contain names of merchants and it turns out that in India there's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and the and star constellations present at the time of birth in dravidian languages the word for fish is mean which happens to sound just just like the word for star and so Seven Stars would stand for alumine which is the dravidian word for the Big Dipper Star constellation now similarly there's another sequence of six stars and that translates to aromin which is the old dravidian name for the Star constellation ples and finally there's other combinations such as this fish sign with a something that looks like a roof on top of it and that could be translated into Mayan which is the old dravidian name for the planet Saturn so this is pretty exciting it looks like we're getting somewhere but does this prove that the these seals contain dran names based on planets and star constellations well not yet so we cannot we have no way of validating these particular readings but if more and more of these readings start making sense and if more if longer and longer sequences are appear to be correct then we know that we on the right track so today we can write a word such as Ted in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in the uniform script because both of these were deciphered in the 19th century the decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly now the Mayans started speaking to us in the 20th century but the Indo civilization remains silent so why should we care well the IND civilization does not belong to just the South Indians or the North Indians or the pakistanis it belongs to all of us so these are our ancestors yours and mine they were silenced by an unfortunate accident of history now if you decipher the script you would enable them to speak to us again so what would they tell us what would we find out about them about us I can't wait to find out thank [Applause] you

coffee on a keyboard you might have encountered the stuck key problem so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again now this kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy because there's no variation at all Now language on the other hand has an intermediate level of entropy it's neither too rigid nor is it too random what about the IND the script so here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences so at the very top you find the uniformly r random sequence which is a random jumble of letters and interestingly also find a DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music and both of these are very very flexible which is why you find them at a very high range now at the lower end of the scale you find a rigid sequence a sequence of all A's and you also find a computer program in this case in the language Fortran which obeys really strict rules linguistic scripts occupy the middle range now what about the indos script so we found that the indos script actually falls within the range of the linguistic script scripts now when this result was first published it was highly controversial there were people who were raising a human cribe and these people were the ones who believed that the indos script does not represent language I even started to get some hate mail my students said that I should really seriously consider

language anguage so as the old saying goes if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands so what other evidence is

very far away from the Indus Valley they were found in present day Iraq and Iran and why were they found there well what I haven't told you is that the Indus people were very very enterprising they used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived and so in this case they were traveling by sea all the way to Mesopotamia present day Iraq and what seems to happen here is that the indust Traders the the Merchants were using the script to write a foreign language it's just like our English and Dutch example and that would explain why we have these strange patterns that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the texts that are found within the indis value so this suggests the same script the indis script could be used to write different languages the results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion that the IND script probably does represent language so if it does represent language then how do we read the symbol that's our next big challenge so you'll notice that many of the symbols look like pictures of humans of insects of fishes of birds so most ancient scripts use the Rebus principle which is using pictures to represent words so as an example here's a word can you write it using pictures I'll give you a couple of seconds got it okay great so here's my solution so you could use the picture of a bee followed by picture of a leaf and that's belief right it could be other Solutions now in the case of the IND descript the problem is the reverse so you have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense so this is just like a crossword puzzle except that this is the mother of all crossw puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it now my colleagues mahadevan and as parpola have been making some Headway on this particular problem and I'd like to give you a quick example of uh parula's work so here's a really short text it contains seven vertical Strokes followed by this fish-like sign and I already mentioned that these seals were used for stamping clay TXS that were attached to bundles of goods so it's quite likely that these TXS at least some of them contain names of merchants and it turns out that in India there's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and the and star constellations present at the time of birth in dravidian languages the word for fish is mean which happens to sound just just like the word for star and so Seven Stars would stand for alumine which is the dravidian word for the Big Dipper Star constellation now similarly there's another sequence of six stars and that translates to aromin which is the old dravidian name for the Star constellation ples and finally there's other combinations such as this fish sign with a something that looks like a roof on top of it and that could be translated into Mayan which is the old dravidian name for the planet Saturn so this is pretty exciting it looks like we're getting somewhere but does this prove that the these seals contain dran names based on planets and star constellations well not yet so we cannot we have no way of validating these particular readings but if more and more of these readings start making sense and if more if longer and longer sequences are appear to be correct then we know that we on the right track so today we can write a word such as Ted in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in the uniform script because both of these were deciphered in the 19th century the decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly now the Mayans started speaking to us in the 20th century but the Indo civilization remains silent so why should we care well the IND civilization does not belong to just the South Indians or the North Indians or the pakistanis it belongs to all of us so these are our ancestors yours and mine they were silenced by an unfortunate accident of history now if you decipher the script you would enable them to speak to us again so what would they tell us what would we find out about them about us I can't wait to find out thank [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
When you hear the word symmetry, maybe you picture a simple geometric shape like a square or a triangle, or the complex pattern on a butterfly's wings. If you are artistically inclined, you might think of the subtle modulations of a Mozart concerto, or the effortless poise of a prima ballerina. When used in every day life, the word symmetry represents vague notions of beauty, harmony and balance. In math and science, symmetry has a different, and very specific, meaning. In this technical sense, a symmetry is the property of an object. Pretty much any type of object can have symmetry, from tangible things like butterflies, to abstract entities like geometric shapes. So, what does it mean for an object to be symmetric? Here's the definition: a symmetry is a transformation that leaves that object unchanged. Okay, that sounds a bit abstract, so let's unpack it. It will help to look at a particular example, like this equilateral triangle. If we rotate our triangle through 120 degrees, around an access through its center, we end up with a triangle that's identical to the original. In this case, the object is the triangle, and the transformation that leaves the object unchanged is rotation through 120 degrees. So we can say an equilateral triangle is symmetric with respect to rotations of 120 degrees around its center. If we rotated the triangle by, say, 90 degrees instead, the rotated triangle would look different to the original. In other words, an equilateral triangle is not symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees around its center. But why do mathematicians and scientists care about symmetries? Turns out, they're essential in many fields of math and science. Let's take a close look at one example: symmetry in biology. You might have noticed that there's a very familiar kind of symmetry we haven't mentioned yet: the symmetry of the right and left sides of the human body. The transformation that gives this symmetry is reflection by an imaginary mirror that slices vertically through the body. Biologists call this bilateral symmetry. As with all symmetries found in living things, it's only approximate, but still a striking feature of the human body. We humans aren't the only bilaterally symmetric organisms. Many other animals, foxes, sharks, beetles, that butterfly we mentioned earlier, have this kind of symmetry, as do some plants like orchid flowers. Other organisms have different symmetries, ones that only become apparent when you rotate the organism around its center point. It's a lot like the rotational symmetry of the triangle we watched earlier. But when it occurs in animals, this kind of symmetry is known as radial symmetry. For instance, some sea urchins and starfish have pentaradial or five-fold symmetry, that is, symmetry with respect to rotations of 72 degrees around their center. This symmetry also appears in plants, as you can see for yourself by slicing through an apple horizontally. Some jellyfish are symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees, while sea anemones are symmetric when you rotate them at any angle. Some corals, on the other hand, have no symmetry at all. They are completely asymmetric. But why do organisms exhibit these different symmetries? Does body symmetry tell us anything about an animal's lifestyle? Let's look at one particular group: bilaterally symmetric animals. In this camp, we have foxes, beetles, sharks, butterflies, and, of course, humans. The thing that unites bilaterally symmetric animals is that their bodies are designed around movement. If you want to pick one direction and move that way, it helps to have a front end where you can group your sensory organs-- your eyes, ears and nose. It helps to have your mouth there too since you're more likely to run into food or enemies from this end. You're probably familiar with a name for a group of organs, plus a mouth, mounted on the front of an animal's body. It's called a head. Having a head leads naturally to the development of bilateral symmetry. And it also helps you build streamlined fins if you're a fish, aerodynamic wings if you're a bird, or well coordinated legs for running if you're a fox. But, what does this all have to do with evolution? Turns out, biologists can use these various body symmetries to figure out which animals are related to which. For instance, we saw that starfish and sea urchins have five-fold symmetry. But really what we should have said was adult starfish and sea urchins. In their larval stage, they're bilateral, just like us humans. For biologists, this is strong evidence that we're more closely related to starfish than we are, to say, corals, or other animals that don't exhibit bilateral symmetry at any stage in their development. One of the most fascinating and important problems in biology is reconstructing the tree of life, discovering when and how the different branches diverged. Thinking about something as simple as body symmetry can help us dig far into our evolutionary past and understand where we, as a species, have come from.

The transformation that gives this symmetry is reflection by an imaginary mirror that slices vertically through the body. Biologists call this bilateral symmetry. As with all symmetries found in living things, it's only approximate, but still a striking feature of the human body. We humans aren't the only bilaterally symmetric organisms. Many other animals, foxes, sharks, beetles, that butterfly we mentioned earlier, have this kind of symmetry, as do some plants like orchid flowers. Other organisms have different symmetries, ones that only become apparent when you rotate the organism around its center point. It's a lot like the rotational symmetry of the triangle we watched earlier. But when it occurs in animals, this kind of symmetry is known as radial symmetry. For instance, some sea urchins and starfish have pentaradial or five-fold symmetry, that is, symmetry with respect to rotations of 72 degrees around their center. This symmetry also appears in plants, as you can see for yourself by slicing through an apple horizontally. Some jellyfish are symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees, while sea anemones are symmetric when you rotate them at any angle. Some corals, on the other hand, have no symmetry at all. They are completely asymmetric. But why do organisms exhibit these different symmetries? Does body symmetry tell us anything about an animal's lifestyle? Let's look at one particular group: bilaterally symmetric animals. In this camp, we have foxes, beetles, sharks, butterflies, and, of course, humans. The thing that unites bilaterally symmetric animals is that their bodies are designed around movement. If you want to pick one direction and move that way, it helps to have a front end where you can group your sensory organs-- your eyes, ears and nose. It helps to have your mouth there too since you're more likely to run into food or enemies from this end. You're probably familiar with a name for a group of organs, plus a mouth, mounted on the front of an animal's body. It's called a head. Having a head leads naturally to the development of bilateral symmetry. And it also helps you build streamlined fins if you're a fish, aerodynamic wings if you're a bird, or well coordinated legs for running if you're a fox. But, what does this all have to do with evolution? Turns out, biologists can use these various body symmetries to figure out which animals are related to which. For instance, we saw that starfish and sea urchins have five-fold symmetry. But really what we should have said was adult starfish and sea urchins. In their larval stage, they're bilateral, just like us humans. For biologists, this is strong evidence that we're more closely related to starfish than we are, to say, corals, or other animals that don't exhibit bilateral symmetry at any stage in their development. One of the most fascinating and important problems in biology is reconstructing the tree of life, discovering when and how the different branches diverged. Thinking about something as simple as body symmetry can help us dig far into our evolutionary past and understand where we, as a species, have come from.

**Transcript**:
The World Wide Web, where you're likely watching this video, is used by millions of people every day for everything from checking the weather, ordering food, and chatting with friends to raising funds, sharing news, or starting revolutions. We use it from our computers, our phones, even our cars. It's just there, all around us, all the time. But what is it exactly? Well first of all, the World Wide Web is not the Internet, even though the terms are often used interchangeably. The Internet is simply the way computers connect to each other in order to share information. When the Internet first emerged, computers actually made direct calls to each other. Today, networks are all around us, so computers can communicate seamlessly. The communication enabled through the Internet has many uses, such as email, file transfer, and conferencing. But the most common use is accessing the World Wide Web. Think of the Web as a bunch of skyscrapers, each representing a web server, a computer always connected to the Internet, specifically designed to store information and share it. When someone starts a website, they are renting a room in this skyscraper, filling it with information and linking that information together in an organized way for others to access. The people who own these skyscrapers and rent space in them are called web hosts, but anyone can set up a web server with the right equipment a bit of know-how. There's another part to having a website, without which we would be lost in the city with no way of finding what we need. This is the website address, which consists of domain names. Just like with a real life address, a website address lets you get where you want to go. The information stored in the websites is in web languages, such as HTML and JavaScript. When we find the website we're looking for, our web browser is able to take all the code on the site and turn it into words, graphics, and videos. We don't need to know any special computer languages because the web browser creates a graphic interface for us. So, in a lot of ways, the World Wide Web is a big virtual city where we communicate with each other in web languages, with browsers acting as our translators. And just like no one owns a city, no one owns the Web; it belongs to all of us. Anyone can move in and set up shop. We might have to pay an Internet service provider to gain access, a hosting company to rent web space, or a registrar to reserve our web address. Like utility companies in a city, these companies provide crucial services, but in the end, not even they own the Web. But what really makes the Web so special lies in its very name. Prior to the Web, we used to consume most information in a linear fashion. In a book or newspaper article, each sentence was read from beginning to end, page by page, in a straight line until you reached the end. But that isn't how our brains actually work. Each of our thoughts is linked to other thoughts, memories, and emotions in a loose interconnected network, like a web. Tim Berners-Lee, the father of the World Wide Web, understood that we needed a way to organize information that mirrored this natural arrangement. And the Web accomplishes this through hyperlinks. By linking several pages within a website or even redirecting you to other websites to expand on information or ideas immediately as you encounter them, hyperlinks allow the Web to operate along the same lines as our thought patterns. The Web is so much a part of our lives because in content and structure, it reflects both the wider society and our individual minds. And it connects those minds across all boundaries, not only enthnicity, gender, and age but even time and space.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The World Wide Web, where you're likely watching this video, is used by millions of people every day for everything from checking the weather, ordering food, and chatting with friends to raising funds, sharing news, or starting revolutions. We use it from our computers, our phones, even our cars. It's just there, all around us, all the time. But what is it exactly? Well first of all, the World Wide Web is not the Internet, even though the terms are often used interchangeably. The Internet is simply the way computers connect to each other in order to share information. When the Internet first emerged, computers actually made direct calls to each other. Today, networks are all around us, so computers can communicate seamlessly. The communication enabled through the Internet has many uses, such as email, file transfer, and conferencing. But the most common use is accessing the World Wide Web. Think of the Web as a bunch of skyscrapers, each representing a web server, a computer always connected to the Internet, specifically designed to store information and share it. When someone starts a website, they are renting a room in this skyscraper, filling it with information and linking that information together in an organized way for others to access. The people who own these skyscrapers and rent space in them are called web hosts, but anyone can set up a web server with the right equipment a bit of know-how. There's another part to having a website, without which we would be lost in the city with no way of finding what we need. This is the website address, which consists of domain names. Just like with a real life address, a website address lets you get where you want to go. The information stored in the websites is in web languages, such as HTML and JavaScript. When we find the website we're looking for, our web browser is able to take all the code on the site and turn it into words, graphics, and videos. We don't need to know any special computer languages because the web browser creates a graphic interface for us. So, in a lot of ways, the World Wide Web is a big virtual city where we communicate with each other in web languages, with browsers acting as our translators. And just like no one owns a city, no one owns the Web; it belongs to all of us. Anyone can move in and set up shop. We might have to pay an Internet service provider to gain access, a hosting company to rent web space, or a registrar to reserve our web address. Like utility companies in a city, these companies provide crucial services, but in the end, not even they own the Web. But what really makes the Web so special lies in its very name. Prior to the Web, we used to consume most information in a linear fashion. In a book or newspaper article, each sentence was read from beginning to end, page by page, in a straight line until you reached the end. But that isn't how our brains actually work. Each of our thoughts is linked to other thoughts, memories, and emotions in a loose interconnected network, like a web. Tim Berners-Lee, the father of the World Wide Web, understood that we needed a way to organize information that mirrored this natural arrangement. And the Web accomplishes this through hyperlinks. By linking several pages within a website or even redirecting you to other websites to expand on information or ideas immediately as you encounter them, hyperlinks allow the Web to operate along the same lines as our thought patterns. The Web is so much a part of our lives because in content and structure, it reflects both the wider society and our individual minds. And it connects those minds across all boundaries, not only enthnicity, gender, and age but even time and space.
