Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar A couple of years ago I started using Twitter, and one of the things that really charmed me about Twitter is that people would wake up in the morning and they would say, "Good morning!" which I thought, I'm a Canadian, so I was a little bit, I liked that politeness. And so, I'm also a giant nerd, and so I wrote a computer program that would record 24 hours of everybody on Twitter saying, "Good morning!" And then I asked myself my favorite question, "What would that look like?" Well, as it turns out, I think it would look something like this. Right, so we'd see this wave of people saying, "Good morning!" across the world as they wake up. Now the green people, these are people that wake up at around 8 o'clock in the morning, Who wakes up at 8 o'clock or says, "Good morning!" at 8? And the orange people, they say, "Good morning!" around 9. And the red people, they say, "Good morning!" around 10. Yeah, more at 10's than, more at 10's than 8's. And actually if you look at this map, we can learn a little bit about how people wake up in different parts of the world. People on the West Coast, for example, they wake up a little bit later than those people on the East Coast. But that's not all that people say on Twitter, right? We also get these really important tweets, like, "I just landed in Orlando!! [plane sign, plane sign]" Or, or, "I just landed in Texas [exclamation point]!" Or "I just landed in Honduras!" These lists, they go on and on and on, all these people, right? So, on the outside, these people are just telling us something about how they're traveling. But we know the truth, don't we? These people are show-offs! They are showing off that they're in Cape Town and I'm not. So I thought, how can we take this vanity and turn it into utility? So using a similar approach that I did with "Good morning," I mapped all those people's trips because I know where they're landing, they just told me, and I know where they live because they share that information on their Twitter profile. So what I'm able to do with 36 hours of Twitter is create a model of how people are traveling around the world during that 36 hours. And this is kind of a prototype because I think if we listen to everybody on Twitter and Facebook and the rest of our social media, we'd actually get a pretty clear picture of how people are traveling from one place to the other, which is actually turns out to be a very useful thing for scientists, particularly those who are studying how disease is spread. So, I work upstairs in the New York Times, and for the last two years, we've been working on a project called, "Cascade," which in some ways is kind of similar to this one. But instead of modeling how people move, we're modeling how people talk. We're looking at what does a discussion look like. Well, here's an example. This is a discussion around an article called, "The Island Where People Forget to Die". It's about an island in Greece where people live a really, really, really, really, really, really long time. And what we're seeing here is we're seeing a conversation that's stemming from that first tweet down in the bottom, left-hand corner. So we get to see the scope of this conversation over about 9 hours right now, we're going to creep up to 12 hours here in a second. But, we can also see what that conversation looks like in three dimensions. And that three-dimensional view is actually much more useful for us. As humans, we are really used to things that are structured as three dimensions. So, we can look at those little off-shoots of conversation, we can find out what exactly happened. And this is an interactive, exploratory tool so we can go through every step in the conversation. We can look at who the people were, what they said, how old they are, where they live, who follows them, and so on, and so on, and so on. So, the Times creates about 6,500 pieces of content every month, and we can model every single one of the conversations that happen around them. And they look somewhat different. Depending on the story and depending on how fast people are talking about it and how far the conversation spreads, these structures, which I call these conversational architectures, end up looking different. So, these projects that I've shown you, I think they all involve the same thing: we can take small pieces of data and by putting them together, we can generate more value, we can do more exciting things with them. But so far we've only talked about Twitter, right? And Twitter isn't all the data. We learned a moment ago that there is tons and tons, tons more data out there. And specifically, I want you to think about one type of data because all of you guys, everybody in this audience, we, we, me as well, are data-making machines. We are producing data all the time. Every single one of us, we're producing data. Somebody else, though, is storing that data. Usually we put our trust into companies to store that data, but what I want to suggest here is that rather than putting our trust in companies to store that data, we should put the trust in ourselves because we actually own that data. Right, that is something we should remember. Everything that someone else measures about you, you actually own. So, it's my hope, maybe because I'm a Canadian, that all of us can come together with this really valuable data that we've been storing, and we can collectively launch that data toward some of the world's most difficulty problems because big data can solve big problems, but I think it can do it the best if it's all of us who are in control. Thank you.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 2: What was the main goal of the speaker's project involving recording people saying "Good morning" on Twitter?**

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the findings of the "Good morning" project, specifically about the wake-up times of people in different regions.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one that is somewhat related, I would choose:

**Question 2**

However, I must note that this is not a perfect match, and a more suitable question would be one that asks about the specific findings of the project, such as:

"What did the speaker's map of people saying 'Good morning' reveal about the wake-up times of people on the East Coast versus the West Coast?"

Since this question is not available, I will stick with **Question 2** as the most similar, although it's not a perfect match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: **2**

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Fourth and nineteen, folks, they've gotta have a play as time's ticking away because they've got to stay in this ball game, they've got to win. They come out lined up in the empty set, three receivers to the right, two to the left. Defense looks like they're gonna to man up with no safety. This is the exact offensive match-up that they want: the best receiver lined up against the linebacker. Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun. He takes a snap, drops three steps, he plants his back foot, he's looking for an opening. There's a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush. He's looking down field. He's got the inside receiver making a cut. He's got a step on the linebacker. Quarterback has a beat on it. He lets the ball go, it's in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender. He's got it beat! He's out in front, racing for the ball! It's coming down! He cradles it at the fifteen! He's at the ten, five! Touchdown! Unbelievable play! Now, wait a minute. Of course, it's believable, it's physics, specifically the differences between scalars and vectors. So, let's just see that replay. "Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun." Stop. See, measurements are defined as two different quantities. Scalars are measurements with only numbers, and vectors are measurements with direction. For example, when that quarterback takes the snap, he's five yards away, but from where? Back from the line of scrimmage, so the five yards by itself is a scalar quantity. When you add a direction, like five yards deep, it becomes a vector quantity. Five yards - scalar, five yards deep - vector. OK, go ahead. "He takes a snap, drops three steps. He plants his back foot, he's looking for an opening. There's a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush." Whoa! Here's a difference between distance and displacement. Distance is a measurement without identifying where you moved. It's a scalar quantity. When the quarterback makes a three-step drop, he moves about three yards back. When he moves about another three yards forward, when he steps up into the pocket, so that quarterback moves a total distance of six yards. That's a distance, that's a scalar. Now, displacement is a vector quantity, describing about how far out of place the object is. So the quarterback dropped back three yards and then moved back forward three yards, he's in the exact same place where he started. So, his displacement is zero yards. Distance - six yards, displacement - zero yards. So, let's look at what happened next. "Quarterback has a beat on it, he let's the ball go! It's in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender." Stop. So, here's speed and velocity, but let's just do one thing at a time. So, speed is measurement without direction, it's a scalar quantity. Velocity is a vector quantity. It is that object's speed, but with a direction of motion. So the receiver accelerates away, gaining both speed and distance. This takes the receiver 5 seconds to run those 50 yards. So his average speed, in any given time, is 10 yards/second. The linebacker tries to keep up, but his overall speed is slower, he only goes 35 yards in those 5 seconds, so his average speed is only 7 yards/second. They're both traveling in a forward direction, so their velocity is also positive. You can't go from resting to your peak speed immediately. You've got to build up to it. This is acceleration. At first the linebacker can keep up with that receiver, but eventually the faster receiver pulls away. That's acceleration, the change in speed over time. Acceleration is a vector quantity. It describes a rate at which an object changes velocity. Like velocity, acceleration is a vector. It happens in a direction. So let's just look at that play just one more time. "Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun." Vector! "He takes a snap, drops three steps, he plants his back foot. He's looking for an opening. There's a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush." Displacement! "He's got the inside receiver making a cut. He's got a step on the linebacker. The quarterback has a beat on it. He let's the ball go! It's in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender!" Velocity! "He's got it beat! He's out in front, racing for the ball! It's coming down! He cradles it at the fifteen, he's at the ten, five!" Acceleration! "Touchdown! Unbelievable play! That was a great play as time expired, resulting in the touchdown and ultimately the win and pure effort." And pure science.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I identified the most similar generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the type of line found on a graph of accelerating speed. Although none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic, Question 5 discusses acceleration, which is related to the concept of accelerating speed.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 5: "A receiver accelerates away from the defender, gaining both speed and distance. What is his acceleration?"

However, it's essential to note that Question 5 does not directly address the type of line found on a graph of accelerating speed. It defines acceleration as "the change in speed over time," which is a fundamental concept related to accelerating speed.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would select Question 5, but with the understanding that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Fourth and nineteen, folks, they've gotta have a play as time's ticking away because they've got to stay in this ball game, they've got to win. They come out lined up in the empty set, three receivers to the right, two to the left. Defense looks like they're gonna to man up with no safety. This is the exact offensive match-up that they want: the best receiver lined up against the linebacker. Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun. He takes a snap, drops three steps, he plants his back foot, he's looking for an opening. There's a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush. He's looking down field. He's got the inside receiver making a cut. He's got a step on the linebacker. Quarterback has a beat on it. He lets the ball go, it's in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender. He's got it beat! He's out in front, racing for the ball! It's coming down! He cradles it at the fifteen! He's at the ten, five! Touchdown! Unbelievable play! Now, wait a minute. Of course, it's believable, it's physics, specifically the differences between scalars and vectors. So, let's just see that replay. "Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun." Stop. See, measurements are defined as two different quantities. Scalars are measurements with only numbers, and vectors are measurements with direction. For example, when that quarterback takes the snap, he's five yards away, but from where? Back from the line of scrimmage, so the five yards by itself is a scalar quantity. When you add a direction, like five yards deep, it becomes a vector quantity. Five yards - scalar, five yards deep - vector. OK, go ahead. "He takes a snap, drops three steps. He plants his back foot, he's looking for an opening. There's a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush." Whoa! Here's a difference between distance and displacement. Distance is a measurement without identifying where you moved. It's a scalar quantity. When the quarterback makes a three-step drop, he moves about three yards back. When he moves about another three yards forward, when he steps up into the pocket, so that quarterback moves a total distance of six yards. That's a distance, that's a scalar. Now, displacement is a vector quantity, describing about how far out of place the object is. So the quarterback dropped back three yards and then moved back forward three yards, he's in the exact same place where he started. So, his displacement is zero yards. Distance - six yards, displacement - zero yards. So, let's look at what happened next. "Quarterback has a beat on it, he let's the ball go! It's in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender." Stop. So, here's speed and velocity, but let's just do one thing at a time. So, speed is measurement without direction, it's a scalar quantity. Velocity is a vector quantity. It is that object's speed, but with a direction of motion. So the receiver accelerates away, gaining both speed and distance. This takes the receiver 5 seconds to run those 50 yards. So his average speed, in any given time, is 10 yards/second. The linebacker tries to keep up, but his overall speed is slower, he only goes 35 yards in those 5 seconds, so his average speed is only 7 yards/second. They're both traveling in a forward direction, so their velocity is also positive. You can't go from resting to your peak speed immediately. You've got to build up to it. This is acceleration.

A better match for the ground truth MCQ would be a question with the same format as the ground truth MCQ. However, the most similar question in terms of content is Question 1.

Since the options for Question 1 do not match the format of the ground truth MCQ, we can look at Question 2, but we can also create a new question or modify Question 1 to better match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if we had to choose from the existing questions, the most similar question would be Question 2, but it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

But if we look at the content of Question 1 and the fact that it is defining scalar and vector, we can argue that Question 1 is the most similar, but the options do not match.

**Question 8: A quarterback has a beat on the receiver and lets the ball go. What is the receiver's velocity?**

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options.

If I had to choose a question that is more closely related to the concept of dividing displacement by time, I would choose:

None of the generated MCQs directly ask this question. However, I can suggest a question that is related to displacement:

**Question 3: A quarterback drops back three yards and then moves forward three yards. What is his displacement?**

This question is related to displacement, but it does not ask about dividing displacement by time.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Fourth and nineteen, folks, they've gotta have a play as time's ticking away because they've got to stay in this ball game, they've got to win. They come out lined up in the empty set, three receivers to the right, two to the left. Defense looks like they're gonna to man up with no safety. This is the exact offensive match-up that they want: the best receiver lined up against the linebacker. Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun. He takes a snap, drops three steps, he plants his back foot, he's looking for an opening. There's a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush. He's looking down field. He's got the inside receiver making a cut. He's got a step on the linebacker. Quarterback has a beat on it. He lets the ball go, it's in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender. He's got it beat! He's out in front, racing for the ball! It's coming down! He cradles it at the fifteen! He's at the ten, five! Touchdown! Unbelievable play! Now, wait a minute. Of course, it's believable, it's physics, specifically the differences between scalars and vectors. So, let's just see that replay. "Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun." Stop. See, measurements are defined as two different quantities. Scalars are measurements with only numbers, and vectors are measurements with direction. For example, when that quarterback takes the snap, he's five yards away, but from where? Back from the line of scrimmage, so the five yards by itself is a scalar quantity. When you add a direction, like five yards deep, it becomes a vector quantity. Five yards - scalar, five yards deep - vector. OK, go ahead. "He takes a snap, drops three steps. He plants his back foot, he's looking for an opening. There's a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush." Whoa! Here's a difference between distance and displacement. Distance is a measurement without identifying where you moved. It's a scalar quantity. When the quarterback makes a three-step drop, he moves about three yards back. When he moves about another three yards forward, when he steps up into the pocket, so that quarterback moves a total distance of six yards. That's a distance, that's a scalar. Now, displacement is a vector quantity, describing about how far out of place the object is. So the quarterback dropped back three yards and then moved back forward three yards, he's in the exact same place where he started. So, his displacement is zero yards. Distance - six yards, displacement - zero yards. So, let's look at what happened next. "Quarterback has a beat on it, he let's the ball go! It's in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender." Stop. So, here's speed and velocity, but let's just do one thing at a time. So, speed is measurement without direction, it's a scalar quantity. Velocity is a vector quantity. It is that object's speed, but with a direction of motion. So the receiver accelerates away, gaining both speed and distance. This takes the receiver 5 seconds to run those 50 yards. So his average speed, in any given time, is 10 yards/second. The linebacker tries to keep up, but his overall speed is slower, he only goes 35 yards in those 5 seconds, so his average speed is only 7 yards/second. They're both traveling in a forward direction, so their velocity is also positive. You can't go from resting to your peak speed immediately. You've got to build up to it. This is acceleration. At first the linebacker can keep up with that receiver, but eventually the faster receiver pulls away. That's acceleration, the change in speed over time. Acceleration is a vector quantity. It describes a rate at which an object changes velocity. Like velocity, acceleration is a vector. It happens in a direction. So let's just look at that play just one more time. "Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun." Vector! "He takes a snap, drops three steps, he plants his back foot. He's looking for an opening. There's a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush." Displacement! "He's got the inside receiver making a cut. He's got a step on the linebacker. The quarterback has a beat on it. He let's the ball go! It's in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender!" Velocity! "He's got it beat! He's out in front, racing for the ball! It's coming down! He cradles it at the fifteen, he's at the ten, five!" Acceleration! "Touchdown! Unbelievable play! That was a great play as time expired, resulting in the touchdown and ultimately the win and pure effort." And pure science.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Ever see a medieval painting of baby Jesus sitting or standing on his mother's lap and wonder why she's so large? Paintings like Cimabue's enthroned Madonna with angels or Duccio's Maesta also appear out of proportion. If Mary were to stand up, it seems, the angels in the picture would be as tall as her shin bone, and her torso would be disproportionately small when compared to her legs. Maybe you thought the artist simply wasn't skilled enough to paint realistically or lacked the mathematical skill of perspective. But that's not the full story. To understand why, we need to go back to the late fifth century when the city of Rome was attacked by the Goths. Rome was built in marble and meant to last forever. It represented, for many years, the pinnacle of human civilization, so its destruction left a huge void. Theologians, who preached about a world beyond the physical, began attracting an audience as Rome crumbled, and Christianity started to fill the void left by the Empire. As a replacement for the physical beauty of Rome, Christianity offered a metaphysical beauty of virtue and an eternal heaven that could not be destroyed as Rome had. After the fall of Rome, early medieval theologians turned away from physical beauty, rejecting it in favor of inner-beauty. They maintained that while the physical world was temporary, virtue and religion were permanent. Beautiful objects could lead to a misguided worship of the object rather than the worship of goodness. It is said that the early sixth century preacher, St. Benedict, upon thinking of a beautiful woman, threw himself into a thorn patch, and through his suffering, regained his focus on spiritual beauty. He feared his desire for the beautiful woman would distract him from his desire to love God. As European civilization transitioned away from empires and towards religion, monasteries became the gatekeepers of knowledge, which meant that classical books that praised physical pleasures were not copied or protected. Without protection, they became the victims of natural decay, fire, flooding, or pests. And without the help of monks transcribing new copies, these texts and the philosophies they carried disappeared in Western Europe and were replaced by the works of people like St. Benedict, which brings us back to these depictions of Jesus and Mary. Because Christianity had so fervently rejected physical beauty, these medieval artists purposefully avoided aesthetically pleasing forms. At first, decorations for churches or palaces were limited to interesting geometric patterns, which could be pleasing without inspiring sinful thoughts of physical pleasure. As the medieval period progressed, depictions of Jesus and Mary were tolerated, but the artist clearly made an effort to veil Mary and give her disproportionately large legs, with those enormous shin bones. The fear remained that a beautiful illustration of Mary might inspire the viewer to love the painting or the physical form of Mary, rather than the virtue she's meant to represent. So even though it may be fun to think we can paint more realistically than Cimabuey or Duccio, we need to remember that they had different goals when picking up a paintbrush.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Ever see a medieval painting of baby Jesus sitting or standing on his mother's lap and wonder why she's so large? Paintings like Cimabue's enthroned Madonna with angels or Duccio's Maesta also appear out of proportion. If Mary were to stand up, it seems, the angels in the picture would be as tall as her shin bone, and her torso would be disproportionately small when compared to her legs. Maybe you thought the artist simply wasn't skilled enough to paint realistically or lacked the mathematical skill of perspective. But that's not the full story. To understand why, we need to go back to the late fifth century when the city of Rome was attacked by the Goths. Rome was built in marble and meant to last forever. It represented, for many years, the pinnacle of human civilization, so its destruction left a huge void. Theologians, who preached about a world beyond the physical, began attracting an audience as Rome crumbled, and Christianity started to fill the void left by the Empire. As a replacement for the physical beauty of Rome, Christianity offered a metaphysical beauty of virtue and an eternal heaven that could not be destroyed as Rome had. After the fall of Rome, early medieval theologians turned away from physical beauty, rejecting it in favor of inner-beauty. They maintained that while the physical world was temporary, virtue and religion were permanent. Beautiful objects could lead to a misguided worship of the object rather than the worship of goodness. It is said that the early sixth century preacher, St. Benedict, upon thinking of a beautiful woman, threw himself into a thorn patch, and through his suffering, regained his focus on spiritual beauty. He feared his desire for the beautiful woman would distract him from his desire to love God. As European civilization transitioned away from empires and towards religion, monasteries became the gatekeepers of knowledge, which meant that classical books that praised physical pleasures were not copied or protected. Without protection, they became the victims of natural decay, fire, flooding, or pests. And without the help of monks transcribing new copies, these texts and the philosophies they carried disappeared in Western Europe and were replaced by the works of people like St. Benedict, which brings us back to these depictions of Jesus and Mary. Because Christianity had so fervently rejected physical beauty, these medieval artists purposefully avoided aesthetically pleasing forms. At first, decorations for churches or palaces were limited to interesting geometric patterns, which could be pleasing without inspiring sinful thoughts of physical pleasure. As the medieval period progressed, depictions of Jesus and Mary were tolerated, but the artist clearly made an effort to veil Mary and give her disproportionately large legs, with those enormous shin bones. The fear remained that a beautiful illustration of Mary might inspire the viewer to love the painting or the physical form of Mary, rather than the virtue she's meant to represent. So even though it may be fun to think we can paint more realistically than Cimabuey or Duccio, we need to remember that they had different goals when picking up a paintbrush.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 7: Why did medieval artists purposefully avoid aesthetically pleasing forms in their depictions of Jesus and Mary?**
Options: A. To showcase their skill in painting realistically, B. To emphasize the importance of Mary's role in Christianity, C. To avoid inspiring sinful thoughts of physical pleasure, D. To create a sense of drama and tension
Correct Option: C

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not provide the exact same options. A more suitable match would be a question that combines the ideas presented in options A and B of the ground truth MCQ.

A closer match can be found in:

**Question 1: What was the primary reason for the large size of Mary in medieval paintings of the enthroned Madonna with angels?**
Options: A. To showcase the artist's skill in painting realistically, B. To emphasize the importance of Mary's role in Christianity, C. To avoid inspiring sinful thoughts of physical pleasure, D. To create avenge the destruction of Rome
Correct Option: C

However, this question still does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose **Question 1** as the closest match, but with the understanding that it is not a perfect match.

To create a perfect match, a new question could be generated that combines the ideas presented in options A and B of the ground truth MCQ, such as:

**New Question: What's the best reason (or the best reasons) Cimabue and Duccio painted a veiled, disproportionate Mary?**
Options: A. They had a different goal in mind when painting, B. They didn't want to tempt people to worship the painting instead of the virtue it represented, C. They realized that Mary was not entirely mortal, as she was chosen by God, therefore must be represented differently in paintings, D. Both A and B
Correct Option: D

This new question would be a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The Oval Office, Inauguration Day, Rose Garden signings, and secret service agents with dark sunglasses and cool wrist radios. For a moment, forget all of it. Toss out everything you know about the President. Now, start over. What would you do if you had to invent the President? That was the question facing the 55 men who got together in secret to draw up the plans for a new American government in the summer of 1787 in Philadelphia, in the same place where the Declaration of Independence had been written eleven years earlier. Declaring independence had been risky business, demanding ferocious courage that put lives and fortunes in jeopardy. But, inventing a new government was no field day either, especially when it's summer and you're in scratchy suits, and the windows are closed because you don't want anybody to hear what you are saying, and the air conditioning doesn't work because it won't be invented for nearly 200 years. And, when you don't agree on things, it gets even hotter. For the framers, the question they argued over most while writing the Constitution and creating three branches of government had to do with the executive department. One man or three to do the job? How long should he serve? What would he really do? Who would pick him? How to get rid of him if he's doing a bad job or he's a crook? And, of course, they all meant him, and he would be a white man. The idea of a woman or an African American, for instance, holding this high office was not a glimmer in their eyes. But the framers knew they needed someone who could take charge, especially in a crisis, like an invasion or a rebellion, or negotiating treaties. Congress was not very good at making such important decisions without debates and delays. But the framers thought America needed a man who was decisive and could act quickly. They called it energy and dispatch. One thing they were dead-set against: there would be no king. They had fought a war against a country with a monarch and were afraid that one man with unchecked powers, in charge of an army, could take over the country. Instead, they settled on a president and laid out his powers in Article 2 of the Constitution. But who would choose him? Not the people, they were too liable to be misled as one framer worried. Not the legislature, that would lead to cabal and factions. Got it: electors, wise, informed men who have time to make a good decision. And if they didn't produce a winner, then the decision would go to one of the other branches of government, the Congress. The House of Representatives would step in and make the choice, which they did in 1801 and 1825. In the long, hot summer of 1787, compromises were made to invent the presidency, like counting slaves as 3/5 of a person, giving the President command of the army but Congress the power to declare war, and unlimited four-year terms. Since then, some of those compromises have been amended and the men in office have sometimes been too strong or too weak. But, if you could start from scratch, how would you redesign the Oval Office?

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

Although the wording of the question is different, the intent and content of Question 1 are similar to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions ask about the location where the plans for a new American government were drawn up, and both have Philadelphia as the correct answer. The main difference is that the ground truth MCQ specifically asks about the Constitution, while Question 1 asks about the plans for a new American government. However, based on the context of the transcript, it is clear that the plans being referred to are the Constitution.

In the long, hot summer of 1787, compromises were made to invent the presidency, like counting slaves as 3/5 of a person, giving the President command of the army but Congress the power to declare war, and unlimited four-year terms. Since then, some of those compromises have been amended and the men in office have sometimes been too strong or too weak.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the closest match is not available as none of the generated MCQs discuss the powers of the President being laid out in the U.S. Constitution.

However, since Question 3 mentions the executive department, which is related to the President's powers, and Question 9 mentions compromises made during the summer of 1787, including giving the President command of the army, these could be considered tangentially related.

But since none of the generated MCQs directly address the content of the ground truth MCQ, it is not possible to provide a direct match.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The Oval Office, Inauguration Day, Rose Garden signings, and secret service agents with dark sunglasses and cool wrist radios. For a moment, forget all of it. Toss out everything you know about the President. Now, start over. What would you do if you had to invent the President? That was the question facing the 55 men who got together in secret to draw up the plans for a new American government in the summer of 1787 in Philadelphia, in the same place where the Declaration of Independence had been written eleven years earlier. Declaring independence had been risky business, demanding ferocious courage that put lives and fortunes in jeopardy. But, inventing a new government was no field day either, especially when it's summer and you're in scratchy suits, and the windows are closed because you don't want anybody to hear what you are saying, and the air conditioning doesn't work because it won't be invented for nearly 200 years. And, when you don't agree on things, it gets even hotter. For the framers, the question they argued over most while writing the Constitution and creating three branches of government had to do with the executive department. One man or three to do the job? How long should he serve? What would he really do? Who would pick him? How to get rid of him if he's doing a bad job or he's a crook? And, of course, they all meant him, and he would be a white man. The idea of a woman or an African American, for instance, holding this high office was not a glimmer in their eyes. But the framers knew they needed someone who could take charge, especially in a crisis, like an invasion or a rebellion, or negotiating treaties. Congress was not very good at making such important decisions without debates and delays. But the framers thought America needed a man who was decisive and could act quickly. They called it energy and dispatch. One thing they were dead-set against: there would be no king. They had fought a war against a country with a monarch and were afraid that one man with unchecked powers, in charge of an army, could take over the country. Instead, they settled on a president and laid out his powers in Article 2 of the Constitution. But who would choose him? Not the people, they were too liable to be misled as one framer worried. Not the legislature, that would lead to cabal and factions. Got it: electors, wise, informed men who have time to make a good decision. And if they didn't produce a winner, then the decision would go to one of the other branches of government, the Congress. The House of Representatives would step in and make the choice, which they did in 1801 and 1825. In the long, hot summer of 1787, compromises were made to invent the presidency, like counting slaves as 3/5 of a person, giving the President command of the army but Congress the power to declare war, and unlimited four-year terms.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not directly ask about the meaning of "plain English," it does ask about the definition of simplicity, which is closely related to the concept of plain English. The correct option for Question 2 (B. A means to achieving clarity, transparency, and empathy in communication) is also closely related to the correct option for the ground truth MCQ (A. Changing the content), as the speaker mentions that plain English is about changing the content to make it more intelligible.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the meaning of "plain English." If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 2, but I would also suggest creating a new generated MCQ that directly asks about the meaning of "plain English" to better match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values now it's generally understood that that questions of morality questions of good and evil and right and wrong are questions about which science officially has no opinion it's thought that science can can help us get what we value but it can never tell us what we ought to value and consequently most people I think most people probably here think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life questions like what is worth living for what is worth dying for what what constitutes a good life so I'm going to argue that this is an illusion of the separation between science and human values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history now it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values because science deals with facts and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres it's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be but I think this is quite clearly untrue but values are a certain kind of fact okay they are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks why don't we feel compassion for rocks so because we don't think rocks can suffer and if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects as indeed we are it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering now the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim this is something we could be right or wrong about if we've misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects okay there is no notion no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and it's possible changes even if you get your values from religion even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes and to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim which of course may or may not be true now to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life for human beings we know that there is a continuum of such facts we know that it's possible to live in a failed state where everything that can go wrong does go wrong where mothers cannot feed their children we're strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration where people are murdered indiscriminately and we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic that - a place where a conference like this is even conceivable and we know we know that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space and what would would adding cholera to the water be a good idea Oh probably not it would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye so that when bad things happen to them they immediately blame their neighbors probably not there are truths to be known about how human communities flourish whether or not we understand these truths and morality relates to these truths so in talking about values we are talking about facts now of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels there's the from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements but if we're going to talk about human well-being we are of necessity talking about the human brain because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain whatever happens after death even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife in this life his personality is rather unfortunate personality is the product of his brain okay and so and the contributions of culture if culture changes us as indeed it does it changes us by changing our brains and and so therefore the whatever cultural variation there is and how human beings flourish can at least in principle be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind neuroscience psychology etc so what I'm arguing is that values reduce to facts to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beans and I think this is a kind of moral landscape with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures both personal and collective and one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access that few people access and these await our discovery perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual perhaps our other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other Minds possibly could access them now let me be clear about what I'm not saying I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question I don't think for instance that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities or whether you can deduct the full cost of Ted as a business expense but if questions affect human wellbeing then they do have answers whether or not we can find them and just admitting this just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish will change the way we talk about morality and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future and for instance there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board heart under raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin and a hundreds of thousands of children instantly are subjected to this every year the locations of these enlightened districts I think will fail to surprise you we're not talking about Connecticut and the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod less we spoil the child this is in proverbs 13 and 20 and I believe 23 but we can ask the obvious question okay is is it a good idea generally speaking to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and and good behavior okay is there any doubt that this question has an answer and that it matters now many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined and seemingly perpetually open to be reconstructing their be a an objective notion of well-being well consider by analogy the concept of physical health the concept of physical health is undefined as we just heard from Michael Spector it has changed over the years when this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably thirty he is now around 80 in the developed world there may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability you know people send you donations when you're in that notice that that the fact that the concept of health is open genuinely open for revision does not make it vacuous the distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science now another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape there may be equivalent ways to thrive there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing now why wouldn't this undermine a an objective morality well think of how we talk about food I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat it's clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food but there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison okay the fact that there are many right answers to the question what is food does not make the decisions not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition now many people worry that that a universal Mara morality would would require moral precepts that that admit of no exceptions so for instance if it's really wrong to lie it must always be wrong to lie and if you can find an exception well then there's no such thing as moral truth now why would we think this consider by analogy the game chess now if you're going to play good chess a principle like don't lose your queen is very good to follow okay but it clearly admits of exceptions with their moments we're losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do there are moments where is the only good thing you can do and yet the chess is a domain of perfect objectivity the fact that there are exceptions here does not does not change that at all now this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere okay consider the great problem of women's bodies what to do about them well this is one thing you can do about them you can cover them up now it is the position generally speaking of our intellectual community that well we might not like this we might think of this as wrong in Boston or Palo Alto who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags who are we to say even that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way okay who are we not to say this who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil and women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as I'm concerned but what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped her father's first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame but just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her what what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing now to say this it's not to say that we have got the the perfect solution in our own society commit for instance this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world now granted for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images but if we are in a reflective mood we can ask is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children probably not okay so so perhaps our someplace on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of a better balance perhaps perhaps there are many such places again we're given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape but the thing to notice is that there'll be many more ways not to be on a peak now the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another and of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind okay not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being and in fact the the endurance of religion as a as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue but the demagogues are right about one thing we need a universal conception of human values now what stands in the way of this well one thing to notice is that we we do something different when talking about morality especially secular academic scientist types when talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives so for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness yeah on the other hand we have someone like Ted Bundy Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women okay so we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say well there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about really right about or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science okay that we you know he likes chocolate he likes vanilla there's there's no there's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other now notice that we don't do this in science on the left you have Edward Witten he's a string theorist if you ask the smartest physicists around who's the smartest physicist around in my experience half of them will say ed Witten the other half will tell you they don't like the question so what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said string theory is bogus you know it doesn't resonate with me it's not how I choose to view the universe the smallest scale I'm not a fan well well nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist I don't understand string theory I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member okay but this is just the point okay whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded that is what it is to have a domain of expertise that is what it is for knowledge to count how have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise or moral talent or moral genius even how have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count how have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering no okay how is how is their ignorance how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being so so this I think is what the world needs now it needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing and morality relates to that domain of facts it is possible for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things which is to say it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality okay we live in it in a in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they will one day mean nothing we live in a world filled with destructive technology and this technology cannot be uninvented it will always be easier to break things than to fix them it seems to me therefore patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in in notions of human wellbeing then then we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads or in the in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes we simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life and to do that we have to admit that these questions have answers thank you very much thank you go ahead of us sir so some combustible material there yeah whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world hearing some of this they've all be doing the screaming with rage thing all right there as well some of them language seems to be is really important here you do when you talk about the veil you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags you know I've lived in the Muslim world spoken with a lot of Muslim women and some of them would say something else they would say no you know this is a celebration of female specialness it helps build that and it's an expression it's a result of the fact that and is arguably a sophisticated psychological view that male lust is not to be trusted ROH I mean can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeing kind of cultural imperialist yeah well I think this is I tried to broach this in a sentence watching the clock ticking but the the question is what is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations and certain and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself and so if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil or a very funny hat or tattoo their faces or do I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under and and so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it especially and when it's 120 degrees out and you're you're wearing a full burqa a lot of people you know want to believe in this this concept of moral progress but can you reconcile that I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with the world that doesn't become one-dimensional well we all have to think the same paint your picture of what you know rolling the clock 50 years forward 100 years forward how you would like to think of the world balancing moral progress with richness well I think once you admit that we are on path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail then you have to admit that that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail so we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it whether they're genetic whether they're how people talk to one another whether they're economic systems and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on on that fact space so everything is not going to be up for grabs it's not going to be like you know veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as as teaching her to be confident and and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women you know so it's it's it's we oh I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that veiling compulsory veiling is a bad idea but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them you know I mean do people love their daughters just as much in these in these systems and I think I think they're right clearly right answers to that and if the results come out that actually they do are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues well yeah modulo one obvious fact that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system so that you can say like because I I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he if he found a boyfriend I chopped his head off and that was the most compassionate thing I can do if you get all those parts aligned yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love but again then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context you know it's all of us in this together it's not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus some this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours we don't have that layout if you know the time thank you that means that really an archaic what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to

**Transcript**:
I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values now it's generally understood that that questions of morality questions of good and evil and right and wrong are questions about which science officially has no opinion it's thought that science can can help us get what we value but it can never tell us what we ought to value and consequently most people I think most people probably here think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life questions like what is worth living for what is worth dying for what what constitutes a good life so I'm going to argue that this is an illusion of the separation between science and human values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history now it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values because science deals with facts and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres it's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be but I think this is quite clearly untrue but values are a certain kind of fact okay they are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks why don't we feel compassion for rocks so because we don't think rocks can suffer and if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects as indeed we are it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering now the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim this is something we could be right or wrong about if we've misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects okay there is no notion no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and it's possible changes even if you get your values from religion even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes and to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim which of course may or may not be true now to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life for human beings we know that there is a continuum of such facts we know that it's possible to live in a failed state where everything that can go wrong does go wrong where mothers cannot feed their children we're strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration where people are murdered indiscriminately and we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic that - a place where a conference like this is even conceivable and we know we know that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space and what would would adding cholera to the water be a good idea Oh probably not it would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye so that when bad things happen to them they immediately blame their neighbors probably not there are truths to be known about how human communities flourish whether or not we understand these truths and morality relates to these truths so in talking about values we are talking about facts now of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels there's the from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements but if we're going to talk about human well-being we are of necessity talking about the human brain because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain whatever happens after death even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife in this life his personality is rather unfortunate personality is the product of his brain okay and so and the contributions of culture if culture changes us as indeed it does it changes us by changing our brains and and so therefore the whatever cultural variation there is and how human beings flourish can at least in principle be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind neuroscience psychology etc so what I'm arguing is that values reduce to facts to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beans and I think this is a kind of moral landscape with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures both personal and collective and one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access that few people access and these await our discovery perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual perhaps our other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other Minds possibly could access them now let me be clear about what I'm not saying I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question I don't think for instance that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities or whether you can deduct the full cost of Ted as a business expense but if questions affect human wellbeing then they do have answers whether or not we can find them and just admitting this just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish will change the way we talk about morality and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future and for instance there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board heart under raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin and a hundreds of thousands of children instantly are subjected to this every year the locations of these enlightened districts I think will fail to surprise you we're not talking about Connecticut and the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod less we spoil the child this is in proverbs 13 and 20 and I believe 23 but we can ask the obvious question okay is is it a good idea generally speaking to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and and good behavior okay is there any doubt that this question has an answer and that it matters now many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined and seemingly perpetually open to be reconstructing their be a an objective notion of well-being well consider by analogy the concept of physical health the concept of physical health is undefined as we just heard from Michael Spector it has changed over the years when this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably thirty he is now around 80 in the developed world there may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability you know people send you donations when you're in that notice that that the fact that the concept of health is open genuinely open for revision does not make it vacuous the distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science now another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape there may be equivalent ways to thrive there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing now why wouldn't this undermine a an objective morality well think of how we talk about food I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat it's clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food but there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison okay the fact that there are many right answers to the question what is food does not make the decisions not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition now many people worry that that a universal Mara morality would would require moral precepts that that admit of no exceptions so for instance if it's really wrong to lie it must always be wrong to lie and if you can find an exception well then there's no such thing as moral truth now why would we think this consider by analogy the game chess now if you're going to play good chess a principle like don't lose your queen is very good to follow okay but it clearly admits of exceptions with their moments we're losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do there are moments where is the only good thing you can do and yet the chess is a domain of perfect objectivity the fact that there are exceptions here does not does not change that at all now this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere okay consider the great problem of women's bodies what to do about them well this is one thing you can do about them you can cover them up now it is the position generally speaking of our intellectual community that well we might not like this we might think of this as wrong in Boston or Palo Alto who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags who are we to say even that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way okay who are we not to say this who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil and women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as I'm concerned but what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped her father's first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame but just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her what what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing now to say this it's not to say that we have got the the perfect solution in our own society commit for instance this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world now granted for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images but if we are in a reflective mood we can ask is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children probably not okay so so perhaps our someplace on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of a better balance perhaps perhaps there are many such places again we're given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape but the thing to notice is that there'll be many more ways not to be on a peak now the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another and of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind okay not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being and in fact the the endurance of religion as a as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue but the demagogues are right about one thing we need a universal conception of human values now what stands in the way of this well one thing to notice is that we we do something different when talking about morality especially secular academic scientist types when talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives so for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness yeah on the other hand we have someone like Ted Bundy Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women okay so we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say well there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about really right about or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science okay that we you know he likes chocolate he likes vanilla there's there's no there's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other now notice that we don't do this in science on the left you have Edward Witten he's a string theorist if you ask the smartest physicists around who's the smartest physicist around in my experience half of them will say ed Witten the other half will tell you they don't like the question so what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said string theory is bogus you know it doesn't resonate with me it's not how I choose to view the universe the smallest scale I'm not a fan well well nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist I don't understand string theory I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member okay but this is just the point okay whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded that is what it is to have a domain of expertise that is what it is for knowledge to count how have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise or moral talent or moral genius even how have we convinced ourselves that every

considering no okay how is how is their ignorance how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being so so this I think is what the world needs now it needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing and morality relates to that domain of facts it is possible for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things which is to say it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality okay we live in it in a in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they will one day mean nothing we live in a world filled with destructive technology and this technology cannot be uninvented it will always be easier to break things than to fix them it seems to me therefore patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in in

converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life and to do that we have to admit that these questions have answers thank you very much thank you go ahead of us sir so some

**Transcript**:
I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values now it's generally understood that that questions of morality questions of good and evil and right and wrong are questions about which science officially has no opinion it's thought that science can can help us get what we value but it can never tell us what we ought to value and consequently most people I think most people probably here think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life questions like what is worth living for what is worth dying for what what constitutes a good life so I'm going to argue that this is an illusion of the separation between science and human values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history now it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values because science deals with facts and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres it's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be but I think this is quite clearly untrue but values are a certain kind of fact okay they are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks why don't we feel compassion for rocks so because we don't think rocks can suffer and if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects as indeed we are it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering now the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim this is something we could be right or wrong about if we've misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects okay there is no notion no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and it's possible changes even if you get your values from religion even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes and to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim which of course may or may not be true now to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life for human beings we know that there is a continuum of such facts we know that it's possible to live in a failed state where everything that can go wrong does go wrong where mothers cannot feed their children we're strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration where people are murdered indiscriminately and we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic that - a place where a conference like this is even conceivable and we know we know that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space and what would would adding cholera to the water be a good idea Oh probably not it would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye so that when bad things happen to them they immediately blame their neighbors probably not there are truths to be known about how human communities flourish whether or not we understand these truths and morality relates to these truths so in talking about values we are talking about facts now of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels there's the from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements but if we're going to talk about human well-being we are of necessity talking about the human brain because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain whatever happens after death even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife in this life his personality is rather unfortunate personality is the product of his brain okay and so and the contributions of culture if culture changes us as indeed it does it changes us by changing our brains and and so therefore the whatever cultural variation there is and how human beings flourish can at least in principle be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind neuroscience psychology etc so what I'm arguing is that values reduce to facts to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beans and I think this is a kind of moral landscape with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures both personal and collective and one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access that few people access and these await our discovery perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual perhaps our other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other Minds possibly could access them now let me be clear about what I'm not saying I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question I don't think for instance that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities or whether you can deduct the full cost of Ted as a business expense but if questions affect human wellbeing then they do have answers whether or not we can find them and just admitting this just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish will change the way we talk about morality and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future and for instance there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board heart under raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin and a hundreds of thousands of children instantly are subjected to this every year the locations of these enlightened districts I think will fail to surprise you we're not talking about Connecticut and the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod less we spoil the child this is in proverbs 13 and 20 and I believe 23 but we can ask the obvious question okay is is it a good idea generally speaking to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and and good behavior okay is there any doubt that this question has an answer and that it matters now many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined and seemingly perpetually open to be reconstructing their be a an objective notion of well-being well consider by analogy the concept of physical health the concept of physical health is undefined as we just heard from Michael Spector it has changed over the years when this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably thirty he is now around 80 in the developed world there may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability you know people send you donations when you're in that notice that that the fact that the concept of health is open genuinely open for revision does not make it vacuous the distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science now another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape there may be equivalent ways to thrive there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing now why wouldn't this undermine a an objective morality well think of how we talk about food I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat it's clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food but there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison okay the fact that there are many right answers to the question what is food does not make the decisions not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition now many people worry that that a universal Mara morality would would require moral precepts that that admit of no exceptions so for instance if it's really wrong to lie it must always be wrong to lie and if you can find an exception well then there's no such thing as moral truth now why would we think this consider by analogy the game chess now if you're going to play good chess a principle like don't lose your queen is very good to follow okay but it clearly admits of exceptions with their moments we're losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do there are moments where is the only good thing you can do and yet the chess is a domain of perfect objectivity the fact that there are exceptions here does not does not change that at all now this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere okay consider the great problem of women's bodies what to do about them well this is one thing you can do about them you can cover them up now it is the position generally speaking of our intellectual community that well we might not like this we might think of this as wrong in Boston or Palo Alto who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags who are we to say even that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way okay who are we not to say this who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil and women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as I'm concerned but what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped her father's first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame but just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her what what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing now to say this it's not to say that we have got the the perfect solution in our own society commit for instance this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world now granted for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images but if we are in a reflective mood we can ask is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children probably not okay so so perhaps our someplace on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of a better balance perhaps perhaps there are many such places again we're given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape but the thing to notice is that there'll be many more ways not to be on a peak now the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another and of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind okay not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being and in fact the the endurance of religion as a as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue but the demagogues are right about one thing we need a universal conception of human values now what stands in the way of this well one thing to notice is that we we do something different when talking about morality especially secular academic scientist types when talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives so for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness yeah on the other hand we have someone like Ted Bundy Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women okay so we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say well there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about really right about or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science okay that we you know he likes chocolate he likes vanilla there's there's no there's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other now notice that we don't do this in science on the left you have Edward Witten he's a string theorist if you ask the smartest physicists around who's the smartest physicist around in my experience half of them will say ed Witten the other half will tell you they don't like the question so what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said string theory is bogus you know it doesn't resonate with me it's not how I choose to view the universe the smallest scale I'm not a fan well well nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist I don't understand string theory I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member okay but this is just the point okay whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded that is what it is to have a domain of expertise that is what it is for knowledge to count how have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise or moral talent or moral genius even how have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count how have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering no okay how is how is their ignorance how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being so so this I think is what the world needs now it needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing and morality relates to that domain of facts it is possible for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things which is to say it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality okay we live in it in a in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they will one day mean nothing we live in a world filled with destructive technology and this technology cannot be uninvented it will always be easier to break things than to fix them it seems to me therefore patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in in notions of human wellbeing then then we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads or in the in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes we simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life and to do that we have to admit that these questions have answers thank you very much thank you go ahead of us sir so some combustible material there yeah whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world hearing some of this they've all be doing the screaming with rage thing all right there as well some of them language seems to be is really important here you do when you talk about the veil you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags you know I've lived in the Muslim world spoken with a lot of Muslim women and some of them would say something else they would say no you know this is a celebration of female specialness it helps build that and it's an expression it's a result of the fact that and is arguably a sophisticated psychological view that male lust is not to be trusted ROH I mean can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeing kind of cultural imperialist yeah well I think this is I tried to broach this in a sentence watching the clock ticking but the the question is what is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations and certain and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself and so if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil or a very funny hat or tattoo their faces or do I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under and and so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it especially and when it's 120 degrees out and you're you're wearing a full burqa a lot of people you know want to believe in this this concept of moral progress but can you reconcile that I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with the world that doesn't become one-dimensional well we all have to think the same paint your picture of what you know rolling the clock 50 years forward 100 years forward how you would like to think of the world balancing moral progress with richness well I think once you admit that we are on path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail then you have to admit that that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail so we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it whether they're genetic whether they're how people talk to one another whether they're economic systems and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on on that fact space so everything is not going to be up for grabs it's not going to be like you know veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as as teaching her to be confident and and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women you know so it's it's it's we oh I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that veiling compulsory veiling is a bad idea but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them you know I mean do people love their daughters just as much in these in these systems and I think I think they're right clearly right answers to that and if the results come out that actually they do are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues well yeah modulo one obvious fact that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system so that you can say like because I I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he if he found a boyfriend I chopped his head off and that was the most compassionate thing I can do if you get all those parts aligned yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love but again then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context you know it's all of us in this together it's not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus some this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours we don't have that layout if you know the time thank you that means that really an archaic what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's build a smarter planet

they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way okay who are we not to say this who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil and women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as I'm concerned but what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped her father's first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame but just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her what what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing now to say this it's not to say that we have got the the perfect solution in our own society commit for instance this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world now granted for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images but if we are in a reflective mood we can ask is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children probably not okay so so perhaps our someplace on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of a better balance perhaps perhaps there are many such places again we're given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape but the thing to notice is that there'll be many more ways not to be on a peak now the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another and of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind okay not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being and in fact the the endurance of religion as a as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue but the demagogues are right about one thing we need a universal conception of human values now what stands in the way of this well one thing to notice is that we we do something different when talking about morality especially secular academic scientist types when talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives so for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness yeah on the other hand we have someone like Ted Bundy Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women okay so we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say well there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about really right about or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science okay that we you know he likes chocolate he likes vanilla there's there's no there's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other now notice that we don't do this in science on the left you have Edward Witten he's a string theorist if you ask the smartest physicists around who's the smartest physicist around in my experience half of them will say ed Witten the other half will tell you they don't like the question so what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said string theory is bogus you know it doesn't resonate with me it's not how I choose to view the universe the smallest scale I'm not a fan well well nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist I don't understand string theory I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member okay but this is just the point okay whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded that is what it is to have a domain of expertise that is what it is for knowledge to count how have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise or moral talent or moral genius even how have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count how have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering no okay how is how is their ignorance how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being so so this I think is what the world needs now it needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing and morality relates to that domain of facts it is possible for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things which is to say it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality okay we live in it in a in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they will one day mean nothing we live in a world filled with destructive technology and this technology cannot be uninvented it will always be easier to break things than to fix them it seems to me therefore patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in in notions of human wellbeing then then we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads or in the in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes we simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life and to do that we have to admit that these questions have answers thank you very much thank you go ahead of us sir so some combustible material there yeah whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world hearing some of this they've all be doing the screaming with rage thing all right there as well some of them language seems to be is really important here you do when you talk about the veil you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags you know I've lived in the Muslim world spoken with a lot of Muslim women and some of them would say something else they would say no you know this is a celebration of female specialness it helps build that and it's an expression it's a result of the fact that and is arguably a sophisticated psychological view that male lust is not to be trusted ROH I mean can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeing kind of cultural imperialist yeah well I think this is I tried to broach this in a sentence watching the clock ticking but the the question is what is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations and certain and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself and so if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil or a very funny hat or tattoo their faces or do I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under and and so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it especially and when it's 120 degrees out and you're you're wearing a full burqa a lot of people you know want to believe in this this concept of moral progress but can you reconcile that I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with the world that doesn't become one-dimensional well we all have to think the same paint your picture of what you know rolling the clock 50 years forward 100 years forward how you would like to think of the world balancing moral progress with richness well I think once you admit that we are on path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail then you have to admit that that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail so we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it whether they're genetic whether they're how people talk to one another whether they're economic systems and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on on that fact space so everything is not going to be up for grabs it's not going to be like you know veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as as teaching her to be confident and and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women you know so it's it's it's we oh I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that veiling compulsory veiling is a bad idea but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them you know I mean do people love their daughters just as much in these in these systems and I think I think they're right clearly right answers to that and if the results come out that actually they do are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues well yeah modulo one obvious fact that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system so that you can say like because I I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he if he found a boyfriend I chopped his head off and that was the most compassionate thing I can do if you get all those parts aligned yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love but again then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context you know it's all of us in this together it's not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus some this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours we don't have that layout if you know the time thank you that means that really an archaic what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's

**Transcript**:
I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values now it's generally understood that that questions of morality questions of good and evil and right and wrong are questions about which science officially has no opinion it's thought that science can can help us get what we value but it can never tell us what we ought to value and consequently most people I think most people probably here think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life questions like what is worth living for what is worth dying for what what constitutes a good life so I'm going to argue that this is an illusion of the separation between science and human values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history now it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values because science deals with facts and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres it's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be but I think this is quite clearly untrue but values are a certain kind of fact okay they are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks why don't we feel compassion for rocks so because we don't think rocks can suffer and if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects as indeed we are it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering now the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim this is something we could be right or wrong about if we've misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects okay there is no notion no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and it's possible changes even if you get your values from religion even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes and to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim which of course may or may not be true now to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life for human beings we know that there is a continuum of such facts we know that it's possible to live in a failed state where everything that can go wrong does go wrong where mothers cannot feed their children we're strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration where people are murdered indiscriminately and we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic that - a place where a conference like this is even conceivable and we know we know that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space and what would would adding cholera to the water be a good idea Oh probably not it would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye so that when bad things happen to them they immediately blame their neighbors probably not there are truths to be known about how human communities flourish whether or not we understand these truths and morality relates to these truths so in talking about values we are talking about facts now of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels there's the from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements but if we're going to talk about human well-being we are of necessity talking about the human brain because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain whatever happens after death even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife in this life his personality is rather unfortunate personality is the product of his brain okay and so and the contributions of culture if culture changes us as indeed it does it changes us by changing our brains and and so therefore the whatever cultural variation there is and how human beings flourish can at least in principle be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind neuroscience psychology etc so what I'm arguing is that values reduce to facts to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beans and I think this is a kind of moral landscape with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures both personal and collective and one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access that few people access and these await our discovery perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual perhaps our other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other Minds possibly could access them now let me be clear about what I'm not saying I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question I don't think for instance that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities or whether you can deduct the full cost of Ted as a business expense but if questions affect human wellbeing then they do have answers whether or not we can find them and just admitting this just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish will change the way we talk about morality and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future and for instance there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board heart under raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin and a hundreds of thousands of children instantly are subjected to this every year the locations of these enlightened districts I think will fail to surprise you we're not talking about Connecticut and the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod less we spoil the child this is in proverbs 13 and 20 and I believe 23 but we can ask the obvious question okay is is it a good idea generally speaking to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and and good behavior okay is there any doubt that this question has an answer and that it matters now many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined and seemingly perpetually open to be reconstructing their be a an objective notion of well-being well consider by analogy the concept of physical health the concept of physical health is undefined as we just heard from Michael Spector it has changed over the years when this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably thirty he is now around 80 in the developed world there may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability you know people send you donations when you're in that notice that that the fact that the concept of health is open genuinely open for revision does not make it vacuous the distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science now another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape there may be equivalent ways to thrive there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing now why wouldn't this undermine a an objective morality well think of how we talk about food I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat it's clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food but there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison okay the fact that there are many right answers to the question what is food does not make the decisions not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition now many people worry that that a universal Mara morality would would require moral precepts that that admit of no exceptions so for instance if it's really wrong to lie it must always be wrong to lie and if you can find an exception well then there's no such thing as moral truth now why would we think this consider by analogy the game chess now if you're going to play good chess a principle like don't lose your queen is very good to follow okay but it clearly admits of exceptions with their moments we're losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do there are moments where is the only good thing you can do and yet the chess is a domain of perfect objectivity the fact that there are exceptions here does not does not change that at all now this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere okay consider the great problem of women's bodies what to do about them well this is one thing you can do about them you can cover them up now it is the position generally speaking of our intellectual community that well we might not like this we might think of this as wrong in Boston or Palo Alto who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags who are we to say even that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way okay who are we not to say this who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil and women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as I'm concerned but what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped her father's first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame but just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her what what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing now to say this it's not to say that we have got the the perfect solution in our own society commit for instance this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world now granted for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images but if we are in a reflective mood we can ask is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children probably not okay so so perhaps our someplace on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of a better balance perhaps perhaps there are many such places again we're given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape but the thing to notice is that there'll be many more ways not to be on a peak now the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another and of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind okay not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being and in fact the the endurance of religion as a as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue but the demagogues are right about one thing we need a universal conception of human values now what stands in the way of this well one thing to notice is that we we do something different when talking about morality especially secular academic scientist types when talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives so for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral

right about or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science okay that we you know he likes chocolate he likes vanilla there's there's no there's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other now notice that we don't do this in science on the left you have Edward Witten he's a string theorist if you ask the smartest physicists around who's the smartest physicist around in my experience half of them will say ed Witten the other half will tell you they don't like the question so what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said string theory is bogus you know it doesn't resonate with me it's not how I choose to view the universe the smallest scale I'm not a fan well well nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist I don't understand string theory I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member okay but this is just the point okay whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded that is what it is to have a domain of expertise that is what it is for knowledge to count how have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise or moral talent or moral genius even how have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count how have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering no okay how is how is their ignorance how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being so so this I think is what the world needs now it needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing and morality relates to that domain of facts it is possible for individuals and even for whole cultures to

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about ancient humans and rock art in Upper Paleolithic Europe, while the generated MCQs are about Cubist art and artists.

However, if I had to choose the least dissimilar one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. But if I really had to pick one, I would say Question 7 is the least dissimilar, only because it is the only question that mentions a specific person (Pablo Picasso), and the ground truth MCQ also mentions specific groups of people (Homo sapiens, Homo habilis, Neanderthals, Homo erectus). However, please note that this is a very weak connection, and Question 7 is still very different from the ground truth MCQ.

that it was going to take me to this hi I like the people to sort of like really come and relax because this is going to be more of a fully balanced plate of music and poetry written in the sky it's not just only about you know the message and all that I think the music as well has to P the whole feeling you know and having those hunting Melodies and everything and also because I'm singing in quite a lot of different languages I use several languages in my work uh because I think language as well plays important role in the society if you learn to speak other people's language you learn more to respect them and to understand their culture and this is also what I'm trying to sort of you know people to see that you know when I'm singing in different languages I'm trying not just you know my message or my music to be accessible to every listener uh but U it's something that everybody has has to to feel it and live it you know the footprints of a painful history your body is shaking I remember one woman uh after the show they came and was like the message about you know forgiveness and all that it's like you know you were talking to me I hated my mother and after hearing this you know um I think I'm going to have the cats now to go and ask for forgiveness if you learn to forgive you learn more to release more calmness within the innermost of yourself and to come more free you know it's like a it's like a a diamond diamond you know uh but if you don't forgive uh you become like a bitter leaf that can just be squashed or be swept away by the wind anytime so forgiveness is more important it's more about you the forgiver not those of forgiving [Music] sing in uh Amanda the film when I met the the the director Le he first came to me he was he was sort of like looking for protest music uh and um the the whole thing sort of changed you know into the Amanda thing which is uh the film and what I like about it is that you know the reality about it nothing it's sort of like real stage or script writed or whatever it's real I took him to quite a lot of different places where things were happening in Mass funerals in political rallies and all that and uh also just to show that you know music really played quite a lot of important role uh without music you know I think uh the world out there wouldn't have known uh what was really happening you know back in South Africa with us music for me and at my country music has played quite a lot of a important role uh when I grew up of course I grew up being a happy uh kid and I didn't know that there was any imbalances in in my country until 1976 you know this so to Uprising came and that's when I started you know asking questions what was happening and that's when my political uh education started the confusion and the frustration is checking the youth know my country who are a bit more ignorant about where we come from where we are now and uh done something that really uh worries me is that they forgot you know that the Privileges uh or the rights that they having today people fought for and people died for and in some way they need some kind of a cultural [Music] revolution at first the reality about it this album was supposed to be an acoustic album uh because the people have been performing quite a lot solo you know and people just love that accent of acoustic and voes voice and they asking me when are you going to sort of come up with with a solo album because this is what we like likeing on you so this album was much more focused on that but in some way you know the songs or the music really uh directed themselves where they wanted to go and I had to follow that I was very much you know fortunate and honor that to have uh the respectable Mr Dave Matthews um who really helped me quite a lot also you know to be released here in the state and of course that was just a musical decision nothing else and uh I have also the respectable Baba Joseph shabala from ladies with black mambas who also guest in the album one uh big thing that I'm going to do here is um uh is um a show that I'll be doing in um La where is to organize you know um how can I put it English English English yeah it is a charity show uh which is directed to the uh for Tri 64 Foundation of Mr Nelson Mandela of which he was asking me to be the ambassador of the 464 which is more to raise awareness and then also raising funds for people living with h h and I think that's a very important call and I feel very much honor that Mr Mandela has ask me to be the ambassador for this so that show on the 29 in La La that will be more about it what I'm trying to convey in my music is just uh the message is about Thorns that really makes us bleed unaware that we're bleeding with these Thorns like fear power grief jealousy resentment and uh talking about love as well and trying to bring morality back you know you know to us you know and just to get to to to to let people know that you know we need

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

However, Question 2 does not cover all the aspects mentioned in the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a combination of Question 2 and other questions, but since that is not an option, Question 2 is the closest match.

But upon closer inspection, it can be seen that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks why Vusi sings in multiple languages, and the correct answer is a combination of reasons. 

A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that asks the same question and has options that cover the same aspects as the ground truth MCQ.

Since there isn't a perfect match, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ:

Options: A. They were happy and unaware of any imbalances in their country, B. They were unhappy and aware of the imbalances in their country, C. They were confused and frustrated about the imbalances in their country, D. They were ignorant about the imbalances in their country

However, the correct generated MCQ should be more specific about the event that triggered Vusi's awakening into the political situation of South Africa. Since none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the event, the closest match would be a question that mentions Vusi's experience growing up in South Africa and the event that changed his perspective.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be:

**Question: What event changed Vusi's perspective on the political situation in South Africa when he was growing up?**

Unfortunately, this question is not among the generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would choose:

**Question 6**

However, I must note that it's not a perfect match.

If I were to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ more closely, I would rephrase Question 6 to focus on the specific event mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose an index from the existing generated MCQs, I would choose:

**Index: 6**

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the event that triggered Vusi's awakening into the political situation of South Africa.

also just to show that you know music really played quite a lot of important role uh without music you know I think uh the world out there wouldn't have known uh what was really happening you know back in South Africa with us music for me and at my country music has played quite a lot of a important role uh when I grew up of course I grew up being a happy uh kid and I didn't know that there was any imbalances in in my country until 1976 you know this so to Uprising came and that's when I started you know asking questions what was happening and that's when my political uh education started the confusion and the frustration is checking the youth know my country who are a bit more ignorant about where we come from where we are now and uh done something that really uh worries me is that they forgot you know that the Privileges uh or the rights that they having today people fought for and people died for and in some way they need some kind of a cultural [Music] revolution at first the reality about it this album was supposed to be an acoustic album uh because the people have been performing quite a lot solo you know and people just love that accent of acoustic and voes voice and they asking me when are you going to sort of come up with with a solo album because this is what we like likeing on you so this album was much more focused on that but in some way you know the songs or the music really uh directed themselves where they wanted to go and I had to follow that I was very much you know fortunate and honor that to have uh the respectable Mr Dave Matthews um who really helped me quite a lot also you know to be released here in the state and of course that was just a musical decision nothing else and uh I have also the respectable Baba Joseph shabala from ladies with black mambas who also guest in the album one uh big thing that I'm going to do here is um uh is um a show that I'll be doing in um La where is to organize you know um how can I put it English English English yeah it is a charity show uh which is directed to the uh for Tri 64 Foundation of Mr Nelson Mandela of which he was asking me to be the ambassador of the 464 which is more to raise awareness and then also raising funds for people living with h h and I think that's a very important call and I feel very much honor that Mr Mandela has ask me to be the ambassador for this so that show on the 29 in La La that will be more about it what I'm trying to convey in my music is just uh the message is about Thorns that really makes us bleed unaware that we're bleeding with these Thorns like fear power grief jealousy resentment and uh talking about love as well and trying to bring morality back you know you know to us you know and just to get to to to to let people know that you know we need

**Transcript**:
so I've known a lot of fish in my life I've loved only two that first one was it was more like a passionate affair it was a beautiful fish flavorful textured meaty the best seller on the menu what a fish even better it was farm raised to the suppose that highest standards of sustainability so you could feel good about selling it I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months one day the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm sustainability absolutely I said here was a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for our chefs how do we keep fish on our menus for the past 50 years we've been fishing the Seas like we clear-cut forests it's hard to overstate the destruction 90% of large fish the ones we love the tunas the halibuts the Salmons swordfish if collapse those nothing left so for better for worse aquaculture fish farming it's giving a part of our future a lot of arguments against it fish farms pollute most of them do anyway and they're inefficient take tuna a major drawback it's got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to 1 that means it takes 15 pounds of wild fish to get you one pound a farm tuna not very sustainable it doesn't taste very good either so here finally was a company trying to do it right I wanted to support him the day before the event I called the head of PR for the company let's call him Don Don I said just to get the facts straight you guys are famous for for farming so far out to see you you don't pollute that's right he said we're so far out the waste from our fish gets distributed not concentrated and then he added or basically a world unto ourselves that feed conversion ratio 2.5 to 1 he said best in the business 2.5 to one great like 2.5 what what do you feed sustainable proteins he said great I said got off the phone and that night I was lying in bed and I thought what the hell is a sustainable protein so the next day just before the event I called Don I said Don what are some examples of sustainable proteins said he didn't know he would ask around well I got on the phone with a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally I got on the phone with the head biologist let's call him Don to Don I said what are some examples of sustainable proteins well he mentioned some algie's and some fish meals and then he said chicken pellets it's a chicken pellets he said yeah a feathered skin bone meal scraps dried and processed in defeat I said what percentage of your feed is chicken thinking you know two percent that's about 30 percent he said I said Don what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish there is a long pause on the line and he said there's just too much chicken in the world okay I fell out of love with this fish now not because I'm some self-righteous goody two-shoes foodie I actually am now I fell out of love with this fish because I swear to God after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken this second fish it's different kind of love story it's the romantic kind the kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain a journalist friend have been talking about this fish for a long time she kind of set us up okay it came to the table a bright almost shimmering white color the chef's had overcooked it like twice over okay amazingly it was still delicious who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked I can't but this guy can't let's call him Miguel actually his name is Miguel and no he didn't cooked the fish and he's not a chef at least in the way that you and I understand it he's a biologist at vector La Palma it's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain it's at the tip of the Guadalcanal rêveur until the 1980s the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians they raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands they did it by draining the land they built this intricate series of canals and they pushed water off the land and out into the river well they couldn't make it work not economically and ecologically it was a disaster killed like 90% of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds and so in 1982 a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do they reversed the flow of water they literally flipped the switch instead of pushing water out they use the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canals they created a 27,000 acre fish pond vast mullet shrimp eel and in the process Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction the farms incredible I mean you've never seen anything like this you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland I was there not long ago with Miguel he's an amazing guy like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee okay there we are slogging through the wetland you know I'm panting and sweating up mud up to my knees and Miguel was calmly conducting a biology lecture here he's pointing out a rare black shoulder-height now he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton and here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian giraffe it turns out Miguel spent the better part of his career in the mikuni National Park in Africa I asked him how he became such an expert on fish I said fish I didn't know anything about fish I'm an expert in relationships and then he's off launching it to more talk about rare birds and algie's and strange aquatic plants and don't get me wrong I was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged its kind of thing you know it's great but I was in love and my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before so I interrupted my said Miguel what makes your fish taste so good he pointed at the algae I know dude the algae the phytoplankton the relationships this is amazing right but what are your fish eating and what's the feed conversion ratio we goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what the beating in the wild the plant biomass the phytoplankton zooplankton it's what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it's totally self renewing there is no feed ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals later that day I was driving around this property with Miguel and I asked him I said for a place it seems so natural unlike any fish for Alligator Farm I'd ever been at how do you measure success well at that moment it's as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see that success he said look at their bellies pink they're feasting cheese thing let's totally confuse I said Miguel aren't they feasting on your fish yes he said we lose 20% of our fish and fish eggs to birds right well last year this property had 600,000 Birds on it more than 250 different species it's become today the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe I said Miguel isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm he shook his head no he said we farm extensively not intensively this is an ecological network the flamingoes eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the phytoplankton so the pink of the belly the better the system okay so let's review a farm that doesn't feed its animals and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldn't even be there in the first place they brood in a town 150 miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nests every morning they fly 150 miles into the farm and every evening they file 150 miles back they do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway a 92 no kidding you know I was imagining a march of the Penguins thing you know so I looked at Miguel I said Miguel do they fly 150 miles to the farm and then do they fly 150 miles back at night did they do that for the children he looked at me like I just quoted a Whitney Houston song he said no they do it cuz the food's better you know I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish which was delicious and I don't like fish skin I don't like it seared I don't like it crispy it's that acrid tar-like flavor I almost never cook with it yet when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain it tasted not at all like fish skin it tasted sweet and clean like you were taking a bite of the ocean I mentioned that to Miguel he nodded he said the skin acts like a sponge it's the last defense before anything enters the body it evolved to soak up impurities and then he added but our water has no impurities okay a farm that doesn't feed its fish a farm the measures of success by the success of its predators and then I realized when he says a farm that has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River it's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days chemical contaminants pesticide runoff and when it works its way through the system and leaves the water it's cleaner than when it entered the system is so healthy it purifies the water so not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals not just a farm that measures the health its success by the health of its predators but a farm that's literally a water purification plant and not just for those fish but for you and me as well because when that water leaves it dumps out into the Atlantic dropped in the ocean I know but I'll take it and so should you because this love story however romantic is also instructive you might say it's a recipe for the future of good food whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle what we need now is a radically new conception of Agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good right look for a lot of people that's a bit too radical we're not realists us foodies we're lovers we love farmers markets we love small family farms we talk about local food we eat organic and when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food someone somewhere stands up and says hey guy I love pink flamingos but how you gonna feed the world how are you gonna feed the world can I be honest I don't love that question no not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world 1 billion people will go hungry today 1 billion that's more than ever before because of gross inequalities and distribution not tonnage now I don't love this question because it's determine the logic of our food system for last 50 years feed grain to herbivores pesticides to monocultures chemicals to soil chicken to fish and all along agribusiness has simply asked if we're feeding more people more cheaply how terrible could that be that's been the motivation it's been the justification it's been the business plan of American agriculture we should call it what it is a business in liquidation a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible that's not a business and is agriculture our breadbasket is threatened today not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources not by the latest combine and tractor invention but by fertile land not fight pumps but by fresh water not by chainsaws but by forests and not by fishing boats and nets but by fish in the sea want to feed the world let's start by asking how am I gonna feed ourselves or better how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself to do that don't look at the agribusiness model for the future it's really old and it's tired it's high on capital chemistry and machines and it's never produced anything really good to eat instead let's look to the ecological model that's the one that relies on 2 billion years of on-the-job experience look to Miguel farmers like Miguel farms that aren't worlds unto themselves farms that restore instead of deplete farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively farmers that are not just producers but experts in relationships because they're the ones that are experts in flavor - and if I'm going to be really honest there are better chef than I'll ever be you know I'm ok with that because if that's the future of good food it's going to be delicious thank you what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBMer let's build a smarter planet

the success of its predators and then I realized when he says a farm that has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River it's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days chemical contaminants pesticide runoff and when it works its way through the system and leaves the water it's cleaner than when it entered the system is so healthy it purifies the water so not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals not just a farm that measures the health its success by the health of its predators but a farm that's literally a water purification plant and not just for those fish but for you and me as well because when that water leaves it dumps out into the Atlantic dropped in the ocean I know but I'll take it and so should you because this love story however romantic is also instructive you might say it's a recipe for the future of good food whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle what we need now is a radically new conception of Agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good right look for a lot of people that's a bit too radical we're not realists us

someone somewhere stands up and says hey guy I love pink flamingos but how you gonna feed the world how are you gonna feed the world can I be honest I don't love that question no not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world 1 billion people will go hungry today 1 billion that's more than ever before because of gross inequalities and distribution not tonnage now I don't love this question because it's determine the logic of our food system for last 50 years feed grain to herbivores pesticides to monocultures chemicals to soil chicken to fish and all along agribusiness has simply asked if we're feeding more people more cheaply how terrible could that be that's been the motivation it's been the justification it's been the business plan of American agriculture we should call it what it is a business in liquidation a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible that's not a business and is agriculture our breadbasket is threatened today not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources not by the latest combine and tractor invention but by fertile land not fight pumps but by fresh water not by chainsaws but by forests and not by fishing boats and nets but by fish in the sea want to feed the world let's start by asking how am I gonna feed ourselves or better how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself to do that don't look at the agribusiness model for the future it's really old and it's tired it's high on capital chemistry and machines and it's never produced anything really good to eat instead let's look to the ecological model that's the one that relies on 2 billion years of on-the-job experience look to Miguel farmers like Miguel farms that aren't worlds unto themselves farms that restore instead of deplete farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively farmers that are not just producers but experts in relationships because they're the ones that are experts in flavor - and if I'm going to be really honest there are better chef than I'll ever be you know I'm ok with that because if that's the future of good food it's going to be delicious thank you what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm

**Transcript**:
so I've known a lot of fish in my life I've loved only two that first one was it was more like a passionate affair it was a beautiful fish flavorful textured meaty the best seller on the menu what a fish even better it was farm raised to the suppose that highest standards of sustainability so you could feel good about selling it I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months one day the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm sustainability absolutely I said here was a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for our chefs how do we keep fish on our menus for the past 50 years we've been fishing the Seas like we clear-cut forests it's hard to overstate the destruction 90% of large fish the ones we love the tunas the halibuts the Salmons swordfish if collapse those nothing left so for better for worse aquaculture fish farming it's giving a part of our future a lot of arguments against it fish farms pollute most of them do anyway and they're inefficient take tuna a major drawback it's got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to 1 that means it takes 15 pounds of wild fish to get you one pound a farm tuna not very sustainable it doesn't taste very good either so here finally was a company trying to do it right I wanted to support him the day before the event I called the head of PR for the company let's call him Don Don I said just to get the facts straight you guys are famous for for farming so far out to see you you don't pollute that's right he said we're so far out the waste from our fish gets distributed not concentrated and then he added or basically a world unto ourselves that feed conversion ratio 2.5 to 1 he said best in the business 2.5 to one great like 2.5 what what do you feed sustainable proteins he said great I said got off the phone and that night I was lying in bed and I thought what the hell is a sustainable protein so the next day just before the event I called Don I said Don what are some examples of sustainable proteins said he didn't know he would ask around well I got on the phone with a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally I got on the phone with the head biologist let's call him Don to Don I said what are some examples of sustainable proteins well he mentioned some algie's and some fish meals and then he said chicken pellets it's a chicken pellets he said yeah a feathered skin bone meal scraps dried and processed in defeat I said what percentage of your feed is chicken thinking you know two percent that's about 30 percent he said I said Don what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish there is a long pause on the line and he said there's just too much chicken in the world okay I fell out of love with this fish now not because I'm some self-righteous goody two-shoes foodie I actually am now I fell out of love with this fish because I swear to God after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken this second fish it's different kind of love story it's the romantic kind the kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain a journalist friend have been talking about this fish for a long time she kind of set us up okay it came to the table a bright almost shimmering white color the chef's had overcooked it like twice over okay amazingly it was still delicious who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked I can't but this guy can't let's call him Miguel actually his name is Miguel and no he didn't cooked the fish and he's not a chef at least in the way that you and I understand it he's a biologist at vector La Palma it's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain it's at the tip of the Guadalcanal rêveur until the 1980s the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians they raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands they did it by draining the land they built this intricate series of canals and they pushed water off the land and out into the river well they couldn't make it work not economically and ecologically it was a disaster killed like 90% of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds and so in 1982 a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do they reversed the flow of water they literally flipped the switch instead of pushing water out they use the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canals they created a 27,000 acre fish pond vast mullet shrimp eel and in the process Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction the farms incredible I mean you've never seen anything like this you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland I was there not long ago with Miguel he's an amazing guy like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee okay there we are slogging through the wetland you know I'm panting and sweating up mud up to my knees and Miguel was calmly conducting a biology lecture here he's pointing out a rare black shoulder-height now he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton and here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian giraffe it turns out Miguel spent the better part of his career in the mikuni National Park in Africa I asked him how he became such an expert on fish I said fish I didn't know anything about fish I'm an expert in relationships and then he's off launching it to more talk about rare birds and algie's and strange aquatic plants and don't get me wrong I was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged its kind of thing you know it's great but I was in love and my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before so I interrupted my said Miguel what makes your fish taste so good he pointed at the algae I know dude the algae the phytoplankton the relationships this is amazing right but what are your fish eating and what's the feed conversion ratio we goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what the beating in the wild the plant biomass the phytoplankton zooplankton it's what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it's totally self renewing there is no feed ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals later that day I was driving around this property with Miguel and I asked him I said for a place it seems so natural unlike any fish for Alligator Farm I'd ever been at how do you measure success well at that moment it's as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see that success he said look at their bellies pink they're feasting cheese thing let's totally confuse I said Miguel aren't they feasting on your fish yes he said we lose 20% of our fish and fish eggs to birds right well last year this property had 600,000 Birds on it more than 250 different species it's become today the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe I said Miguel isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm he shook his head no he said we farm extensively not intensively this is an ecological network the flamingoes eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the phytoplankton so the pink of the belly the better the system okay so let's review a farm that doesn't feed its animals and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldn't even be there in the first place they brood in a town 150 miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nests every morning they fly 150 miles into the farm and every evening they file 150 miles back they do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway a 92 no kidding you know I was imagining a march of the Penguins thing you know so I looked at Miguel I said Miguel do they fly 150 miles to the farm and then do they fly 150 miles back at night did they do that for the children he looked at me like I just quoted a Whitney Houston song he said no they do it cuz the food's better you know I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish which was delicious and I don't like fish skin I don't like it seared I don't like it crispy it's that acrid tar-like flavor I almost never cook with it yet when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain it tasted not at all like fish skin it tasted sweet and clean like you were taking a bite of the ocean I mentioned that to Miguel he nodded he said the skin acts like a sponge it's the

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the actions taken by the Spanish company to reverse the ecological destruction.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the actions taken by the Spanish company, but such a question is not present in the provided list.

If I had to choose from the existing options, I would say that **Question 3: Application** is the closest match, but it's still not a good match.

To provide a more accurate answer, I would suggest creating a new generated MCQ that asks about the actions taken by the Spanish company to reverse the ecological destruction, such as:

**New Question**: What actions did the Spanish company take to reverse the ecological destruction of the Veta la Palma land in 1982? Options: A. They reversed the flow of water, B. They flooded the canals, C. They created a 27,000-acre fish farm, D. All of the above Correct Option: D

**Transcript**:
so I've known a lot of fish in my life I've loved only two that first one was it was more like a passionate affair it was a beautiful fish flavorful textured meaty the best seller on the menu what a fish even better it was farm raised to the suppose that highest standards of sustainability so you could feel good about selling it I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months one day the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm sustainability absolutely I said here was a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for our chefs how do we keep fish on our menus for the past 50 years we've been fishing the Seas like we clear-cut forests it's hard to overstate the destruction 90% of large fish the ones we love the tunas the halibuts the Salmons swordfish if collapse those nothing left so for better for worse aquaculture fish farming it's giving a part of our future a lot of arguments against it fish farms pollute most of them do anyway and they're inefficient take tuna a major drawback it's got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to 1 that means it takes 15 pounds of wild fish to get you one pound a farm tuna not very sustainable it doesn't taste very good either so here finally was a company trying to do it right I wanted to support him the day before the event I called the head of PR for the company let's call him Don Don I said just to get the facts straight you guys are famous for for farming so far out to see you you don't pollute that's right he said we're so far out the waste from our fish gets distributed not concentrated and then he added or basically a world unto ourselves that feed conversion ratio 2.5 to 1 he said best in the business 2.5 to one great like 2.5 what what do you feed sustainable proteins he said great I said got off the phone and that night I was lying in bed and I thought what the hell is a sustainable protein so the next day just before the event I called Don I said Don what are some examples of sustainable proteins said he didn't know he would ask around well I got on the phone with a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally I got on the phone with the head biologist let's call him Don to Don I said what are some examples of sustainable proteins well he mentioned some algie's and some fish meals and then he said chicken pellets it's a chicken pellets he said yeah a feathered skin bone meal scraps dried and processed in defeat I said what percentage of your feed is chicken thinking you know two percent that's about 30 percent he said I said Don what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish there is a long pause on the line and he said there's just too much chicken in the world okay I fell out of love with this fish now not because I'm some self-righteous goody two-shoes foodie I actually am now I fell out of love with this fish because I swear to God after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken this second fish it's different kind of love story it's the romantic kind the kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain a journalist friend have been talking about this fish for a long time she kind of set us up okay it came to the table a bright almost shimmering white color the chef's had overcooked it like twice over okay amazingly it was still delicious who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked I can't but this guy can't let's call him Miguel actually his name is Miguel and no he didn't cooked the fish and he's not a chef at least in the way that you and I understand it he's a biologist at vector La Palma it's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain it's at the tip of the Guadalcanal rêveur until the 1980s the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians they raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands they did it by draining the land they built this intricate series of canals and they pushed water off the land and out into the river well they couldn't make it work not economically and ecologically it was a disaster killed like 90% of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds and so in 1982 a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do they reversed the flow of water they literally flipped the switch instead of pushing water out they use the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canals they created a 27,000 acre fish pond vast mullet shrimp eel and in the process Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction the farms incredible I mean you've never seen anything like this you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland I was there not long ago with Miguel he's an amazing guy like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee okay there we are slogging through the wetland you know I'm panting and sweating up mud up to my knees and Miguel was calmly conducting a biology lecture here he's pointing out a rare black shoulder-height now he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton and here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian giraffe it turns out Miguel spent the better part of his career in the mikuni National Park in Africa I asked him how he became such an expert on fish I said fish I didn't know anything about fish I'm an expert in relationships and then he's off launching it to more talk about rare birds and algie's and strange aquatic plants and don't get me wrong I was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged its kind of thing you know it's great but I was in love and my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before so I interrupted my said Miguel what makes your fish taste so good he pointed at the algae I know dude the algae the phytoplankton the relationships this is amazing right but what are your fish eating and what's the feed conversion ratio we goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what the beating in the wild the plant biomass the phytoplankton zooplankton it's what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it's totally self renewing there is no feed ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals later that day I was driving around this property with Miguel and I asked him I said for a place it seems so natural unlike any fish for Alligator Farm I'd ever been at how do you measure success well at that moment it's as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see that success he said look at their bellies pink they're feasting cheese thing let's totally confuse I said Miguel aren't they feasting on your fish yes he said we lose 20% of our fish and fish eggs to birds right well last year this property had 600,000 Birds on it more than 250 different species it's become today the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe I said Miguel isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm he shook his head no he said we farm extensively not intensively this is an ecological network the flamingoes eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the phytoplankton so the pink of the belly the better the system okay so let's review a farm that doesn't feed its animals and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldn't even be there in the first place they brood in a town 150 miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nests every morning they fly 150 miles into the farm and every evening they file 150 miles back they do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway a 92 no kidding you know I was imagining a march of the Penguins thing you know so I looked at Miguel I said Miguel do they fly 150 miles to the farm and then do they fly 150 miles back at night did they do that for the children he looked at me like I just quoted a Whitney Houston song he said no they do it cuz the food's better you know I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You might have heard that we're running out of fresh water. This might sound strange to you because, if you live in a place where water flows freely from the tap or shower at any time, it sure doesn't seem like a big deal. It's just there, right? Wrong! The only obvious thing about fresh water is how much we need it. Because it's essential to life, we need to think about it carefully. Right now, at this very moment, some people, women and girls in particular, walk hours and miles per day to get fresh water, and even then, it may not be clean. Every 15 seconds, a child dies due to water-born diseases. This is tragic! The most compelling reasons to think about fresh water, therefore, have to do with what we might call the global common good. This is not something we normally think about, but it means recognizing how much fresh water matters for the flourishing of human and non-human life on Earth now and in the future. How do we think about something as local as our faucets and as global as fresh water? Is there a connection between them? Many people assume that fresh water shortages are due to individual wastefulness: running the water while you brush your teeth, for example, or taking really long showers. Most of us assume, therefore, that water shortages can be fixed by improving our personal habits: taking shorter showers or turning off the water while we brush our teeth. But, global fresh water scarcity neither starts nor ends in your shower. Globally, domestic use of fresh water accounts for only 8% of consumption, 8%!! Compare that to the 70% that goes to agriculture and the 22% that goes to industrial uses. Now, hold up - you're not off the hook! Individual habits are still part of the puzzle. You should still cultivate water virtue in your daily life, turn off the tap when you brush your teeth. But still, it's true. Taking shorter showers won't solve global problems, which is too bad. It would be much more straightforward and easier if virtuous, individual actions could do the trick. You'd just stand there for 30 seconds less, and you'd be done with that irksome, planet-saving task for the day. Well, that's not so much the case. Agricultural and industrial patterns of water use need serious attention. How do our societies value water? Distribute it? Subsidize its use in agriculture? Incentivize its consumption or pollution? These are all questions that stem from how we think about fresh water's value. Is it an economic commodity? A human right? A public good? Nobel prize winners, global water justice activists, transnational institutions like the United Nations, and even the Catholic Church are at work on the issue. But, it's tricky, too, because the business of water became very profitable in the 20th century. And profit is not the same thing as the common good. We need to figure out how to value fresh water as a public good, something that's vital for human and non-human life, now and in the future. Now that's a virtuous, collective task that goes far beyond your shower.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the specific action some people (women and girls in particular) take to get water, whereas the generated MCQs cover different topics related to fresh water.

However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the topic of people's access to water, I would say Question 2 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

A new generated MCQ that directly addresses the ground truth MCQ could be:

Question: What do some people, especially women and girls, do to obtain fresh water?
Options: A. Walk hours and miles per day, B. Use a water filter, C. Buy bottled water, D. Collect rainwater
Correct Option: A

Since this is not among the options, I will not provide an index.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although the ground truth MCQ asks about the frequency of child deaths due to water-borne illnesses and provides options for "True" or "False", the closest match in terms of content is Question 2, which asks about the number of people who die every 15 seconds due to water-born diseases.

However, it's worth noting that the options provided in Question 2 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that asks the same question as the ground truth MCQ and provides the same options ("True" or "False"). Since this is not available, Question 2 is the closest match based on content.

This is not something we normally think about, but it means recognizing how much fresh water matters for the flourishing of human and non-human life on Earth now and in the future. How do we think about something as local as our faucets and as global as fresh water? Is there a connection between them? Many people assume that fresh water shortages are due to individual wastefulness: running the water while you brush your teeth, for example, or taking really long showers. Most of us assume, therefore, that water shortages can be fixed by improving our personal habits: taking shorter showers or turning off the water while we brush our teeth. But, global fresh water scarcity neither starts nor ends in your shower. Globally, domestic use of fresh water accounts for only 8% of consumption, 8%!! Compare that to the 70% that goes to agriculture and the 22% that goes to industrial uses. Now, hold up - you're not off the hook! Individual habits are still part of the puzzle. You should still cultivate water virtue in your daily life, turn off the tap when you brush your teeth. But still, it's true. Taking shorter showers won't solve global problems, which is too bad. It would be much more straightforward and easier if virtuous, individual actions could do the trick. You'd just stand there for 30 seconds less, and you'd be done with that irksome, planet-saving task for the day. Well, that's not so much the case. Agricultural and industrial patterns of water use need serious attention. How do our societies value water? Distribute it? Subsidize its use in agriculture? Incentivize its consumption or pollution? These are all questions that stem from how we think about fresh water's value. Is it an economic commodity? A human right? A public good? Nobel prize winners, global water justice activists, transnational institutions like the United Nations, and even the Catholic Church are at work on the issue. But, it's tricky, too, because the business of water became very profitable in the 20th century. And profit is not the same thing as the common good. We need to figure out how to value fresh water as a public good, something that's vital for human and non-human life, now and in the future. Now that's a virtuous, collective task that goes far beyond your shower.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9 and Question 4. However, neither question 9 nor question 4 is a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ, as they only address one aspect of the ground truth question (industrial use and domestic use, respectively).

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 and Question 9 together provide the information needed to match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one that is the most similar I would say that Question 4 is not the best match, but Question 9 is not a perfect match either.

After re-reading the generated MCQs I can see that there is not a perfect match, but I would say that the closest one is: 

 Question 9, because the ground truth MCQ asks about the two most water-using entities in the world and the options are Agriculture and pharmaceuticals, Industry and agriculture, Homes and small businesses. Question 9 mentions that 22% of global fresh water consumption is attributed to industrial uses and we know from the text that 70% is attributed to agriculture.

However, I can see that is not a perfect match.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Hello, my name is Christian Rudder, and I was one of the founders of OkCupid. It's now one of the biggest
dating sites in the United States. Like most everyone at the site,
I was a math major, As you may expect, we're known
for the analytic approach we take to love. We call it our matching algorithm. Basically, OkCupid's matching
algorithm helps us decide whether two people should go on a date. We built our entire business around it. Now, algorithm is a fancy word, and people like to drop it
like it's this big thing. But really, an algorithm
is just a systematic, step-by-step way to solve a problem. It doesn't have to be fancy at all. Here in this lesson, I'm going to explain how we arrived
at our particular algorithm, so you can see how it's done. Now, why are algorithms even important? Why does this lesson even exist? Well, notice one very significant
phrase I used above: they are a step-by-step
way to solve a problem, and as you probably know, computers
excel at step-by-step processes. A computer without an algorithm is basically an expensive paperweight. And since computers are such
a pervasive part of everyday life, algorithms are everywhere. The math behind OkCupid's matching
algorithm is surprisingly simple. It's just some addition, multiplication,
a little bit of square roots. The tricky part in designing it was figuring out how to take
something mysterious, human attraction, and break it into components
that a computer can work with. The first thing we needed
to match people up was data, something for the algorithm to work with. The best way to get data quickly
from people is to just ask for it. So we decided that OkCupid
should ask users questions, stuff like, "Do you want
to have kids one day?" "How often do you brush your teeth?" "Do you like scary movies?" And big stuff like,
"Do you believe in God?" Now, a lot of the questions
are good for matching like with like, that is, when both people
answer the same way. For example, two people
who are both into scary movies are probably a better match
than one person who is and one who isn't. But what about a question like, "Do you like to be
the center of attention?" If both people in a relationship
are saying yes to this, they're going to have massive problems. We realized this early on, and so we decided we needed
a bit more data from each question. We had to ask people to specify
not only their own answer, but the answer they wanted
from someone else. That worked really well. But we needed one more dimension. Some questions tell you more
about a person than others. For example, a question
about politics, something like, "Which is worse:
book burning or flag burning?" might reveal more about someone
than their taste in movies. And it doesn't make sense
to weigh all things equally, so we added one final data point. For everything that OkCupid asks you, you have a chance to tell us
the role it plays in your life. And this ranges
from irrelevant to mandatory. So now, for every question,
we have three things for our algorithm: first, your answer; second, how you want someone else --
your potential match -- to answer; and third, how important
the question is to you at all. With all this information, OkCupid can figure out
how well two people will get along. The algorithm crunches the numbers
and gives us a result. As a practical example, let's look at how we'd match you
with another person. Let's call him "B." Your match percentage with B is based
on questions you've both answered. Let's call that set
of common questions "s." As a very simple example,
we use a small set "s" with just two questions in common, and compute a match from that. Here are our two example questions. The first one, let's say, is,
"How messy are you?" And the answer possibilities are: very messy, average and very organized. And let's say you answered
"very organized," and you'd like someone else
to answer "very organized," and the question is very important to you. Basically, you're a neat freak. You're neat, you want someone else
to be neat, and that's it. And let's say B is a little bit different. He answered "very organized" for himself, but "average" is OK with him
as an answer from someone else, and the question is only
a little important to him. Let's look at the second question,
from our previous example: "Do you like to be
the center of attention?" The answers are "yes" and "no." You've answered "no," you want
someone else to answer "no," and the question is only
a little important to you. Now B, he's answered "yes." He wants someone else to answer "no," because he wants the spotlight on him, and the question is somewhat
important to him. So, let's try to compute all of this. Our first step is, since we use
computers to do this, we need to assign numerical values to ideas like "somewhat
important" and "very important," because computers need
everything in numbers. We at OkCupid decided
on the following scale: "Irrelevant" is worth 0. "A little important" is worth 1. "Somewhat important" is worth 10. "Very important" is 50. And "absolutely mandatory" is 250. Next, the algorithm makes
two simple calculations. The first is: How much did
B's answers satisfy you? That is, how many possible points
did B score on your scale? Well, you indicated that B's answer
to the first question, about messiness, was very important to you. It's worth 50 points and B got that right. The second question is worth only 1, because you said
it was only a little important. B got that wrong, so B's answers were 50
out of 51 possible points. That's 98% satisfactory. Pretty good. The second question the algorithm
looks at is: How much did you satisfy B? Well, B placed 1 point on your answer
to the messiness question and 10 on your answer to the second. Of those 11, that's 1 plus 10,
you earned 10 -- you guys satisfied each other
on the second question. So your answers were 10 out of 11
equals 91 percent satisfactory to B. That's not bad. The final step is to take
these two match percentages and get one number for the both of you. To do this, the algorithm
multiplies your scores, then takes the nth root, where "n" is the number of questions. Because s, which is the number
of questions in this sample, is only 2, we have: match percentage
equals the square root of 98 percent times 91 percent. That equals 94 percent. That 94 percent is your match
percentage with B. It's a mathematical expression
of how happy you'd be with each other, based on what we know. Now, why does the algorithm multiply, as opposed to, say, average
the two match scores together, and do the square-root business? In general, this formula
is called the geometric mean. It's a great way to combine
values that have wide ranges and represent very different properties. In other words, it's perfect
for romantic matching. You've got wide ranges and you've got
tons of different data points, like I said, about movies, politics,
religion -- everything. Intuitively, too, this makes sense. Two people satisfying
each other 50 percent should be a better match
than two others who satisfy 0 and 100, because affection needs to be mutual. After adding a little correction
for margin of error, in the case where we have
a small number of questions, like we do in this example, we're good to go. Any time OkCupid matches two people, it goes through the steps
we just outlined. First it collects data about your answers, then it compares your choices
and preferences to other people's in simple, mathematical ways. This, the ability to take
real-world phenomena and make them something
a microchip can understand, is, I think, the most important skill
anyone can have these days. Like you use sentences
to tell a story to a person, you use algorithms
to tell a story to a computer. If you learn the language,
you can go out and tell your stories. I hope this will help you do that.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Hello, my name is Christian Rudder, and I was one of the founders of OkCupid. It's now one of the biggest
dating sites in the United States. Like most everyone at the site,
I was a math major, As you may expect, we're known
for the analytic approach we take to love. We call it our matching algorithm. Basically, OkCupid's matching
algorithm helps us decide whether two people should go on a date. We built our entire business around it. Now, algorithm is a fancy word, and people like to drop it
like it's this big thing. But really, an algorithm
is just a systematic, step-by-step way to solve a problem. It doesn't have to be fancy at all. Here in this lesson, I'm going to explain how we arrived
at our particular algorithm, so you can see how it's done. Now, why are algorithms even important? Why does this lesson even exist? Well, notice one very significant
phrase I used above: they are a step-by-step
way to solve a problem, and as you probably know, computers
excel at step-by-step processes. A computer without an algorithm is basically an expensive paperweight. And since computers are such
a pervasive part of everyday life, algorithms are everywhere. The math behind OkCupid's matching
algorithm is surprisingly simple. It's just some addition, multiplication,
a little bit of square roots. The tricky part in designing it was figuring out how to take
something mysterious, human attraction, and break it into components
that a computer can work with. The first thing we needed
to match people up was data, something for the algorithm to work with. The best way to get data quickly
from people is to just ask for it. So we decided that OkCupid
should ask users questions, stuff like, "Do you want
to have kids one day?" "How often do you brush your teeth?" "Do you like scary movies?" And big stuff like,
"Do you believe in God?" Now, a lot of the questions
are good for matching like with like, that is, when both people
answer the same way. For example, two people
who are both into scary movies are probably a better match
than one person who is and one who isn't. But what about a question like, "Do you like to be
the center of attention?" If both people in a relationship
are saying yes to this, they're going to have massive problems. We realized this early on, and so we decided we needed
a bit more data from each question. We had to ask people to specify
not only their own answer, but the answer they wanted
from someone else. That worked really well. But we needed one more dimension. Some questions tell you more
about a person than others. For example, a question
about politics, something like, "Which is worse:
book burning or flag burning?" might reveal more about someone
than their taste in movies. And it doesn't make sense
to weigh all things equally, so we added one final data point. For everything that OkCupid asks you, you have a chance to tell us
the role it plays in your life. And this ranges
from irrelevant to mandatory. So now, for every question,
we have three things for our algorithm: first, your answer; second, how you want someone else --
your potential match -- to answer; and third, how important
the question is to you at all. With all this information, OkCupid can figure out
how well two people will get along. The algorithm crunches the numbers
and gives us a result. As a practical example, let's look at how we'd match you
with another person. Let's call him "B." Your match percentage with B is based
on questions you've both answered. Let's call that set
of common questions "s." As a very simple example,
we use a small set "s" with just two questions in common, and compute a match from that. Here are our two example questions. The first one, let's say, is,
"How messy are you?" And the answer possibilities are: very messy, average and very organized. And let's say you answered
"very organized," and you'd like someone else
to answer "very organized," and the question is very important to you. Basically, you're a neat freak. You're neat, you want someone else
to be neat, and that's it. And let's say B is a little bit different. He answered "very organized" for himself, but "average" is OK with him
as an answer from someone else, and the question is only
a little important to him. Let's look at the second question,
from our previous example: "Do you like to be
the center of attention?" The answers are "yes" and "no." You've answered "no," you want
someone else to answer "no," and the question is only
a little important to you. Now B, he's answered "yes." He wants someone else to answer "no," because he wants the spotlight on him, and the question is somewhat
important to him. So, let's try to compute all of this. Our first step is, since we use
computers to do this, we need to assign numerical values to ideas like "somewhat
important" and "very important," because computers need
everything in numbers. We at OkCupid decided
on the following scale: "Irrelevant" is worth 0. "A little important" is worth 1. "Somewhat important" is worth 10. "Very important" is 50. And "absolutely mandatory" is 250. Next, the algorithm makes
two simple calculations. The first is: How much did
B's answers satisfy you? That is, how many possible points
did B score on your scale? Well, you indicated that B's answer
to the first question, about messiness, was very important to you. It's worth 50 points and B got that right. The second question is worth only 1, because you said
it was only a little important. B got that wrong, so B's answers were 50
out of 51 possible points. That's 98% satisfactory. Pretty good. The second question the algorithm
looks at is: How much did you satisfy B? Well, B placed 1 point on your answer
to the messiness question and 10 on your answer to the second. Of those 11, that's 1 plus 10,
you earned 10 -- you guys satisfied each other
on the second question. So your answers were 10 out of 11
equals 91 percent satisfactory to B. That's not bad. The final step is to take
these two match percentages and get one number for the both of you. To do this, the algorithm
multiplies your scores, then takes the nth root, where "n" is the number of questions. Because s, which is the number
of questions in this sample, is only 2, we have: match percentage
equals the square root of 98 percent times 91 percent. That equals 94 percent. That 94 percent is your match
percentage with B. It's a mathematical expression
of how happy you'd be with each other, based on what we know. Now, why does the algorithm multiply, as opposed to, say, average
the two match scores together, and do the square-root business? In general, this formula
is called the geometric mean. It's a great way to combine
values that have wide ranges and represent very different properties. In other words, it's perfect
for romantic matching. You've got wide ranges and you've got
tons of different data points, like I said, about movies, politics,
religion -- everything. Intuitively, too, this makes sense. Two people satisfying
each other 50 percent should be a better match
than two others who satisfy 0 and 100, because affection needs to be mutual. After adding a little correction
for margin of error, in the case where we have
a small number of questions, like we do in this example, we're good to go. Any time OkCupid matches two people, it goes through the steps
we just outlined. First it collects data about your answers, then it compares your choices
and preferences to other people's in simple, mathematical ways. This, the ability to take
real-world phenomena and make them something
a microchip can understand, is, I think, the most important skill
anyone can have these days. Like you use sentences
to tell a story to a person, you use algorithms
to tell a story to a computer. If you learn the language,
you can go out and tell your stories. I hope this will help you do that.

a little important to you. Now B, he's answered "yes." He wants someone else to answer "no," because he wants the spotlight on him, and the question is somewhat
important to him. So, let's try to compute all of this. Our first step is, since we use
computers to do this, we need to assign numerical values to ideas like "somewhat
important" and "very important," because computers need
everything in numbers. We at OkCupid decided
on the following scale: "Irrelevant" is worth 0. "A little important" is worth 1. "Somewhat important" is worth 10. "Very important" is 50. And "absolutely mandatory" is 250. Next, the algorithm makes
two simple calculations. The first is: How much did
B's answers satisfy you? That is, how many possible points
did B score on your scale? Well, you indicated that B's answer
to the first question, about messiness, was very important to you. It's worth 50 points and B got that right. The second question is worth only 1, because you said
it was only a little important. B got that wrong, so B's answers were 50
out of 51 possible points. That's 98% satisfactory. Pretty good. The second question the algorithm
looks at is: How much did you satisfy B? Well, B placed 1 point on your answer
to the messiness question and 10 on your answer to the second. Of those 11, that's 1 plus 10,
you earned 10 -- you guys satisfied each other
on the second question. So your answers were 10 out of 11
equals 91 percent satisfactory to B. That's not bad. The final step is to take
these two match percentages and get one number for the both of you. To do this, the algorithm
multiplies your scores, then takes the nth root, where "n" is the number of questions. Because s, which is the number
of questions in this sample, is only 2, we have: match percentage
equals the square root of 98 percent times 91 percent. That equals 94 percent. That 94 percent is your match
percentage with B. It's a mathematical expression
of how happy you'd be with each other, based on what we know. Now, why does the algorithm multiply, as opposed to, say, average
the two match scores together, and do the square-root business? In general, this formula
is called the geometric mean. It's a great way to combine
values that have wide ranges and represent very different properties. In other words, it's perfect
for romantic matching. You've got wide ranges and you've got
tons of different data points, like I said, about movies, politics,
religion -- everything. Intuitively, too, this makes sense. Two people satisfying
each other 50 percent should be a better match
than two others who satisfy 0 and 100, because affection needs to be mutual. After adding a little correction
for margin of error, in the case where we have
a small number of questions, like we do in this example, we're good to go. Any time OkCupid matches two people, it goes through the steps
we just outlined. First it collects data about your answers, then it compares your choices
and preferences to other people's in simple, mathematical ways. This, the ability to take
real-world phenomena and make them something
a microchip can understand, is, I think, the most important skill
anyone can have these days. Like you use sentences
to tell a story to a person, you use algorithms
to tell a story to a computer. If you learn the language,
you can go out and tell your stories. I hope this will help you do that.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Hello, my name is Christian Rudder, and I was one of the founders of OkCupid. It's now one of the biggest
dating sites in the United States. Like most everyone at the site,
I was a math major, As you may expect, we're known
for the analytic approach we take to love. We call it our matching algorithm. Basically, OkCupid's matching
algorithm helps us decide whether two people should go on a date. We built our entire business around it. Now, algorithm is a fancy word, and people like to drop it
like it's this big thing. But really, an algorithm
is just a systematic, step-by-step way to solve a problem. It doesn't have to be fancy at all. Here in this lesson, I'm going to explain how we arrived
at our particular algorithm, so you can see how it's done. Now, why are algorithms even important? Why does this lesson even exist? Well, notice one very significant
phrase I used above: they are a step-by-step
way to solve a problem, and as you probably know, computers
excel at step-by-step processes. A computer without an algorithm is basically an expensive paperweight. And since computers are such
a pervasive part of everyday life, algorithms are everywhere. The math behind OkCupid's matching
algorithm is surprisingly simple. It's just some addition, multiplication,
a little bit of square roots. The tricky part in designing it was figuring out how to take
something mysterious, human attraction, and break it into components
that a computer can work with. The first thing we needed
to match people up was data, something for the algorithm to work with. The best way to get data quickly
from people is to just ask for it. So we decided that OkCupid
should ask users questions, stuff like, "Do you want
to have kids one day?" "How often do you brush your teeth?" "Do you like scary movies?" And big stuff like,
"Do you believe in God?" Now, a lot of the questions
are good for matching like with like, that is, when both people
answer the same way. For example, two people
who are both into scary movies are probably a better match
than one person who is and one who isn't. But what about a question like, "Do you like to be
the center of attention?" If both people in a relationship
are saying yes to this, they're going to have massive problems. We realized this early on, and so we decided we needed
a bit more data from each question. We had to ask people to specify
not only their own answer, but the answer they wanted
from someone else. That worked really well. But we needed one more dimension. Some questions tell you more
about a person than others. For example, a question
about politics, something like, "Which is worse:
book burning or flag burning?" might reveal more about someone
than their taste in movies. And it doesn't make sense
to weigh all things equally, so we added one final data point. For everything that OkCupid asks you, you have a chance to tell us
the role it plays in your life. And this ranges
from irrelevant to mandatory. So now, for every question,
we have three things for our algorithm: first, your answer; second, how you want someone else --
your potential match -- to answer; and third, how important
the question is to you at all. With all this information, OkCupid can figure out
how well two people will get along. The algorithm crunches the numbers
and gives us a result. As a practical example, let's look at how we'd match you
with another person. Let's call him "B." Your match percentage with B is based
on questions you've both answered. Let's call that set
of common questions "s." As a very simple example,
we use a small set "s" with just two questions in common, and compute a match from that. Here are our two example questions. The first one, let's say, is,
"How messy are you?" And the answer possibilities are: very messy, average and very organized. And let's say you answered
"very organized," and you'd like someone else
to answer "very organized," and the question is very important to you. Basically, you're a neat freak. You're neat, you want someone else
to be neat, and that's it. And let's say B is a little bit different. He answered "very organized" for himself, but "average" is OK with him
as an answer from someone else, and the question is only
a little important to him. Let's look at the second question,
from our previous example: "Do you like to be
the center of attention?" The answers are "yes" and "no." You've answered "no," you want
someone else to answer "no," and the question is only
a little important to you. Now B, he's answered "yes." He wants someone else to answer "no," because he wants the spotlight on him, and the question is somewhat
important to him. So, let's try to compute all of this. Our first step is, since we use
computers to do this, we need to assign numerical values to ideas like "somewhat
important" and "very important," because computers need
everything in numbers. We at OkCupid decided
on the following scale: "Irrelevant" is worth 0. "A little important" is worth 1. "Somewhat important" is worth 10. "Very important" is 50. And "absolutely mandatory" is 250. Next, the algorithm makes
two simple calculations. The first is: How much did
B's answers satisfy you? That is, how many possible points
did B score on your scale? Well, you indicated that B's answer
to the first question, about messiness, was very important to you. It's worth 50 points and B got that right. The second question is worth only 1, because you said
it was only a little important. B got that wrong, so B's answers were 50
out of 51 possible points. That's 98% satisfactory. Pretty good. The second question the algorithm
looks at is: How much did you satisfy B? Well, B placed 1 point on your answer
to the messiness question and 10 on your answer to the second. Of those 11, that's 1 plus 10,
you earned 10 -- you guys satisfied each other
on the second question. So your answers were 10 out of 11
equals 91 percent satisfactory to B. That's not bad. The final step is to take
these two match percentages and get one number for the both of you. To do this, the algorithm
multiplies your scores, then takes the nth root, where "n" is the number of questions. Because s, which is the number
of questions in this sample, is only 2, we have: match percentage
equals the square root of 98 percent times 91 percent. That equals 94 percent. That 94 percent is your match

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar At birth, our bodies are roughly 75% water. We remain mostly water for the rest of our lives. We cannot survive even a week without fresh water. There's no life without it for ecosystems, societies, and individuals. So, how much usable water is there on Earth? Most of the water on Earth is ocean, a salty 97.5%, to be precise, and the remaining 2.5% is fresh water. That little sliver of liquid sustains human life on Earth, it literally holds up civilizations. 2.5% is a small proportion to be sure, and even that is broken down into smaller parts: surface water, water in ice caps and polar regions, and ground water. First, surface water. All the liquid water above ground is surface water and it is a tiny blip of an amount. 0.3% of all fresh water is surface water. It may seem counterintuitive, but it accounts for little streams all over the planet. All rivers, including the Nile, the Jordan, and the Mississippi, and lakes, large to small, like Victoria, the Great Lakes, and Baikal. Second, ice caps and polar regions freeze up to 70% of the planet's fresh water. This water is significant, but it isn't available for human use in a regular way. Finally, nearly 30% of all water on Earth is ground water. As the name suggests, that's water in the ground. It can rest still and deep in huge caverns, or it can snuggle in the little crevices of rock and pebble. The upshot - thank goodness for ground water! It's invisible to us, but it is much more plentiful than surface water. It is much more reliable and easier to obtain than frozen water. Without ground water, our societies would be parched. So, how are we using that water? As a result of industrialization and population growth, demand for fresh water skyrocketed in the last century. Where is all that water going? First, we have to remember that fresh water is a global concern, but it is always local. Context matters. The Sahara is not Seattle. Still, some general information can help us get a handle on major trends. Who consumes the most fresh water? And, what sectors consume the most fresh water? First, who. Well, the United States consumes the most water per capita of any country in the entire world, followed by parts of Europe and large industrializing nations like China. But, this doesn't tell us what water is being used for. So let's look at it another way. If we ask what kinds of uses water is going towards, we see a different picture. Agriculture accounts for roughly 70% of global fresh water consumption. Again, remember the numbers vary by region, but still, it's a staggering amount. And, this makes a certain kind of sense: we need to eat, we need water to grow food; the bigger the population, the more food we need; and, the wealthier we get, the more meat we eat, and the more water is required to produce our food. Furthermore, 22% of all fresh water worldwide goes to industrial uses. This includes the production of electricity, the extraction of fossil fuels, and the manufacturing of all manner of goods, from microchips, to paper, to blimps. 70% to agriculture, 22% to industrial uses, what's left? 8% All those domestic uses - cooking, cleaning, bathing, drinking - it's a drop in the bucket of overall water use.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar At birth, our bodies are roughly 75% water. We remain mostly water for the rest of our lives. We cannot survive even a week without fresh water. There's no life without it for ecosystems, societies, and individuals. So, how much usable water is there on Earth? Most of the water on Earth is ocean, a salty 97.5%, to be precise, and the remaining 2.5% is fresh water. That little sliver of liquid sustains human life on Earth, it literally holds up civilizations. 2.5% is a small proportion to be sure, and even that is broken down into smaller parts: surface water, water in ice caps and polar regions, and ground water. First, surface water. All the liquid water above ground is surface water and it is a tiny blip of an amount. 0.3% of all fresh water is surface water. It may seem counterintuitive, but it accounts for little streams all over the planet. All rivers, including the Nile, the Jordan, and the Mississippi, and lakes, large to small, like Victoria, the Great Lakes, and Baikal. Second, ice caps and polar regions freeze up to 70% of the planet's fresh water. This water is significant, but it isn't available for human use in a regular way. Finally, nearly 30% of all water on Earth is ground water. As the name suggests, that's water in the ground. It can rest still and deep in huge caverns, or it can snuggle in the little crevices of rock and pebble. The upshot - thank goodness for ground water! It's invisible to us, but it is much more plentiful than surface water. It is much more reliable and easier to obtain than frozen water. Without ground water, our societies would be parched. So, how are we using that water? As a result of industrialization and population growth, demand for fresh water skyrocketed in the last century. Where is all that water going? First, we have to remember that fresh water is a global concern, but it is always local. Context matters. The Sahara is not Seattle. Still, some general information can help us get a handle on major trends. Who consumes the most fresh water? And, what sectors consume the most fresh water? First, who. Well, the United States consumes the most water per capita of any country in the entire world, followed by parts of Europe and large industrializing nations like China. But, this doesn't tell us what water is being used for. So let's look at it another way. If we ask what kinds of uses water is going towards, we see a different picture. Agriculture accounts for roughly 70% of global fresh water consumption. Again, remember the numbers vary by region, but still, it's a staggering amount. And, this makes a certain kind of sense: we need to eat, we need water to grow food; the bigger the population, the more food we need; and, the wealthier we get, the more meat we eat, and the more water is required to produce our food. Furthermore, 22% of all fresh water worldwide goes to industrial uses. This includes the production of electricity, the extraction of fossil fuels, and the manufacturing of all manner of goods, from microchips, to paper, to blimps. 70% to agriculture, 22% to industrial uses, what's left? 8% All those domestic uses - cooking, cleaning, bathing, drinking - it's a drop in the bucket of overall water use.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar About 100 days ago, we landed a two-ton SUV
on the surface of another planet, on the surface of Mars. This is one of the first pictures
we took there with our rover, looking out at Mount Sharp. I kind of cry a little bit, choke up, when I see this picture. Why Mars and why do we look
at these other planets? Part of it is to understand
our own planet -- what's the context for us? We live on this amazing planet,
but Mars is a lot like Earth. It's similar in size. During the daytime, it can
get up to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. So, it's so like Earth,
but at the same time, this is a barren landscape. You don't see any trees,
you don't see any cactuses growing, anything like that. Today I'm going to tell you
about how we got from Earth to Mars and why it's so cool. So one of the things we start with
is a blank sheet of paper. We knew from the previous missions
in 2004, Spirit and Opportunity, there was water on Mars in the past. But what's the next step? We're looking for an even more
fundamental level of, what does it take to have life survive? And so, to have that kind
of knowledge and understanding, we have to carry
a mass amount of instruments. We have to carry the kind of labs that people have whole rooms
devoted to on Earth inside of, essentially, a small car. And we shrunk it all down to something that weighs
about as much as I do, and then put it inside of this rover
that weighs as much as your car does. And that rover is now
on the surface of Mars, but it's so heavy, and so it kind of takes
a special challenge for us to make it all work and come together. So we look at our tool of,
what do we have to land stuff on Mars? And one of the options is airbags. We've done it before. Airbags are pretty cool,
they bounce around a lot. You could never put a human
inside of an airbag, because they would get squashed. But the problem with airbags is,
the airbags you see here, which landed the smaller rover --
it's like 400 pounds, the entire rover -- were about the size of this room. So you can imagine the size
of airbags it would take to land a two-ton rover on Mars. And they'd have to be made
out of materials that don't even exist today, so it'd be some kind of exotic material
that we'd have to develop and it may or may not work. So, what about rockets? You know, you see all the rocket ships
landing in old movies, all rockets on the bottom --
it's a cool idea. It works when they're pretty light still, but the problem is, these rockets
have to be pretty strong to actually softly land you on Mars. And so they would be so powerful
they could dig holes into the ground and then you would just
end up inside of a hole and not be able to drive out of it. So, not the best design. But what if I could take the rockets
and move them up? And that's what we came up with. It's a rocket-powered jet pack;
we call it the Sky Crane. Basically, this big rocket
sits on top of our rover and when we're ready to land,
the rocket hovers in place and we slowly lower
the rover to the ground. And then we touch down,
we're actually on the wheels, we're ready to drive, day one. But in addition to that,
the scientists were like, "We actually want to go
somewhere interesting." The last two missions were cool, but they basically landed in what was like
landing in the plains or desert. Not very exciting. We all know from the exciting places
on Earth like the Grand Canyon, those are, for the scientists,
the most interesting, because you see that whole layer, you see years and years
of history all in one place. The same thing is true
for where we landed. We wanted to land somewhere
that was unique, that had this crater wall
where things had been dug up for us, where mountains were pushing things up. But the problem is, if you landed
with the older systems, you could've landed on the side
of that mountain and just tumbled off, could've been the side of a cliff,
the crater wall or a large boulder. So we needed a kind of technology to help us land in a very small area, and that was this little
guided entry from Apollo. We took it from the 1960s. We flew over like the manned vehicle,
because they have to pick up men, you can't just land all over the place. And then we landed, like,
spot-on in the middle. And in fact, it was so spot-on
that when we did it, it was basically like a quarterback
launching towards Mars -- like a quarterback, though,
that was in Seattle, throwing at a receiver that was moving
here in Giants Stadium. That's how accurate we were.
Kind of awesome. But you only get one shot, and so we actually have to design a system that we can build and test and operate, and so it's not just about
can we get it to Mars, but, if it's only one chance, how do you make sure
that one chance goes well? So there's all these processes
to make sure things are built properly. Then we go out to the desert
and drive around and test it. We fly things in F-18s to make sure
the radar systems work in high speeds. Then, most importantly, we test the team
to make sure they know how to operate it. We don't want to miss it
because we sent the wrong command and now it's going
to be rebooting forever. So, that guy Fred there,
he did a lot of that. And then we launched it
on this rocket to Mars. We landed 2,000 pounds on Mars, but the entire thing
was about 10,000 pounds when we lifted off from Earth, all the fuel and the solar arrays
and everything else that we needed. And, again, we were so accurate that we landed in this, like,
little pin-point on Mars. In the meantime, though, we had to design
a landing system that worked. And I told you about the actual physics
of it, but here's the catch: Mars is about 14 minutes
away from Earth in light speed, which means if I try
to control it with a joystick, I would be always controlling
to 14 minutes in advance, so it wouldn't work. So we had to give it all the smarts
and knowledge it needed to make it happen. So we built in all these
smarts and algorithms and told it here's what
you're going to have to do, and it goes from basically
five times the speed of a speeding bullet to about a baby's crawl, all within about seven minutes, which are called
the seven minutes of terror, because I was about to throw up. (Laughter) But today we're on the surface of Mars,
and this was one of the panoramas we took a couple days after we landed, and it's amazing to me,
because you look at this, and can see the Grand Canyon, you can see your own planet,
you can imagine walking on the surface. And so what we're going to do
and continue to do is to understand
what makes Mars so special and what makes Earth even more special that we're all here together today. So we'll see where Curiosity takes us -- not just our rover, but our sense of exploration. Thank you. (Applause)

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the weight of Curiosity, while the generated MCQs do not directly ask about the weight of the rover. However, Question 3 mentions the weight of the rover in the context of using airbags for landing, stating that the airbags would need to be made of exotic materials to handle the weight of a 2-ton rover.

Although not a perfect match, I would suggest that Question 3 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it indirectly mentions the weight of the rover.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar About 100 days ago, we landed a two-ton SUV
on the surface of another planet, on the surface of Mars. This is one of the first pictures
we took there with our rover, looking out at Mount Sharp. I kind of cry a little bit, choke up, when I see this picture. Why Mars and why do we look
at these other planets? Part of it is to understand
our own planet -- what's the context for us? We live on this amazing planet,
but Mars is a lot like Earth. It's similar in size. During the daytime, it can
get up to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. So, it's so like Earth,
but at the same time, this is a barren landscape. You don't see any trees,
you don't see any cactuses growing, anything like that. Today I'm going to tell you
about how we got from Earth to Mars and why it's so cool. So one of the things we start with
is a blank sheet of paper. We knew from the previous missions
in 2004, Spirit and Opportunity, there was water on Mars in the past. But what's the next step? We're looking for an even more
fundamental level of, what does it take to have life survive? And so, to have that kind
of knowledge and understanding, we have to carry
a mass amount of instruments. We have to carry the kind of labs that people have whole rooms
devoted to on Earth inside of, essentially, a small car. And we shrunk it all down to something that weighs
about as much as I do, and then put it inside of this rover
that weighs as much as your car does. And that rover is now
on the surface of Mars, but it's so heavy, and so it kind of takes
a special challenge for us to make it all work and come together. So we look at our tool of,
what do we have to land stuff on Mars? And one of the options is airbags. We've done it before. Airbags are pretty cool,
they bounce around a lot. You could never put a human
inside of an airbag, because they would get squashed. But the problem with airbags is,
the airbags you see here, which landed the smaller rover --
it's like 400 pounds, the entire rover -- were about the size of this room. So you can imagine the size
of airbags it would take to land a two-ton rover on Mars. And they'd have to be made
out of materials that don't even exist today, so it'd be some kind of exotic material
that we'd have to develop and it may or may not work. So, what about rockets? You know, you see all the rocket ships
landing in old movies, all rockets on the bottom --
it's a cool idea. It works when they're pretty light still, but the problem is, these rockets
have to be pretty strong to actually softly land you on Mars. And so they would be so powerful
they could dig holes into the ground and then you would just
end up inside of a hole and not be able to drive out of it. So, not the best design. But what if I could take the rockets
and move them up? And that's what we came up with. It's a rocket-powered jet pack;
we call it the Sky Crane. Basically, this big rocket
sits on top of our rover and when we're ready to land,
the rocket hovers in place and we slowly lower
the rover to the ground. And then we touch down,
we're actually on the wheels, we're ready to drive, day one. But in addition to that,
the scientists were like, "We actually want to go
somewhere interesting." The last two missions were cool, but they basically landed in what was like
landing in the plains or desert. Not very exciting. We all know from the exciting places
on Earth like the Grand Canyon, those are, for the scientists,
the most interesting, because you see that whole layer, you see years and years
of history all in one place. The same thing is true
for where we landed. We wanted to land somewhere
that was unique, that had this crater wall
where things had been dug up for us, where mountains were pushing things up. But the problem is, if you landed
with the older systems, you could've landed on the side
of that mountain and just tumbled off, could've been the side of a cliff,
the crater wall or a large boulder. So we needed a kind of technology to help us land in a very small area, and that was this little
guided entry from Apollo. We took it from the 1960s. We flew over like the manned vehicle,
because they have to pick up men, you can't just land all over the place. And then we landed, like,
spot-on in the middle. And in fact, it was so spot-on
that when we did it, it was basically like a quarterback
launching towards Mars -- like a quarterback, though,
that was in Seattle, throwing at a receiver that was moving
here in Giants Stadium. That's how accurate we were.
Kind of awesome. But you only get one shot, and so we actually have to design a system that we can build and test and operate, and so it's not just about
can we get it to Mars, but, if it's only one chance, how do you make sure
that one chance goes well? So there's all these processes
to make sure things are built properly. Then we go out to the desert
and drive around and test it. We fly things in F-18s to make sure
the radar systems work in high speeds. Then, most importantly, we test the team
to make sure they know how to operate it. We don't want to miss it
because we sent the wrong command and now it's going
to be rebooting forever. So, that guy Fred there,
he did a lot of that. And then we launched it
on this rocket to Mars. We landed 2,000 pounds on Mars, but the entire thing
was about 10,000 pounds when we lifted off from Earth, all the fuel and the solar arrays
and everything else that we needed. And, again, we were so accurate that we landed in this, like,
little pin-point on Mars. In the meantime, though, we had to design
a landing system that worked. And I told you about the actual physics
of it, but here's the catch: Mars is about 14 minutes
away from Earth in light speed, which means if I try
to control it with a joystick, I would be always controlling
to 14 minutes in advance, so it wouldn't work. So we had to give it all the smarts
and knowledge it needed to make it happen. So we built in all these
smarts and algorithms and told it here's what
you're going to have to do, and it goes from basically
five times the speed of a speeding bullet to about a baby's crawl, all within about seven minutes, which are called
the seven minutes of terror, because I was about to throw up. (Laughter) But today we're on the surface of Mars,
and this was one of the panoramas we took a couple days after we landed, and it's amazing to me,
because you look at this, and can see the Grand Canyon, you can see your own planet,
you can imagine walking on the surface. And so what we're going to do

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

However, the options in Question 3 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the options for landing a large vehicle on Mars and includes the correct answer choice that is not an option.

Upon reviewing the generated MCQs again, I noticed that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible match based on the content and intent of the questions.

A possible match could be Question 3, but as mentioned earlier, the options do not exactly match. Another possible match could be Question 4, which discusses the advantages of using the Sky Crane for landing a rover on Mars. However, this question does not ask about the options for landing a large vehicle on Mars.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 3, but with the caveat that the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about Ferdowsi likening the landing of Curiosity to a specific scenario. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 4, which talks about the advantage of using a rocket-powered jet pack (Sky Crane) for landing a rover on Mars. However, this is not a direct match.

A closer match would be a generated MCQ that specifically asks about the analogy used by Ferdowsi to describe the landing of Curiosity. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 4. However, please note that this is not a direct match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4

Please note that the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new MCQ should be generated to exactly match the ground truth MCQ. The new MCQ could be:

that weighs as much as your car does. And that rover is now

the radar systems work in high speeds. Then, most importantly, we test the team
to make sure they know how to operate it. We don't want to miss it
because we sent the wrong command and now it's going
to be rebooting forever. So, that guy Fred there,
he did a lot of that. And then we launched it
on this rocket to Mars. We landed 2,000 pounds on Mars, but the entire thing
was about 10,000 pounds when we lifted off from Earth, all the fuel and the solar arrays
and everything else that we needed. And, again, we were so accurate that we landed in this, like,
little pin-point on Mars. In the meantime, though, we had to design
a landing system that worked. And I told you about the actual physics
of it, but here's the catch: Mars is about 14 minutes
away from Earth in light speed, which means if I try
to control it with a joystick, I would be always controlling
to 14 minutes in advance, so it wouldn't work. So we had to give it all the smarts
and knowledge it needed to make it happen. So we built in all these
smarts and algorithms and told it here's what
you're going to have to do, and it goes from basically
five times the speed of a speeding bullet to about a baby's crawl, all within about seven minutes, which are called
the seven minutes of terror, because I was about to throw up. (Laughter) But today we're on the surface of Mars,
and this was one of the panoramas we took a couple days after we landed, and it's amazing to me,

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the weight of the entire rocket (including the rover) at the time of takeoff. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this question.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is vaguely related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3, which discusses the challenges of landing a rover on Mars using airbags. While this question is not directly related to the weight of the rocket, it does mention the weight of the rover in the context of airbag landing.

But, since there is no direct match, I will provide an index of a question that at least talks about weight in some capacity.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar About 100 days ago, we landed a two-ton SUV
on the surface of another planet, on the surface of Mars. This is one of the first pictures
we took there with our rover, looking out at Mount Sharp. I kind of cry a little bit, choke up, when I see this picture. Why Mars and why do we look
at these other planets? Part of it is to understand
our own planet -- what's the context for us? We live on this amazing planet,
but Mars is a lot like Earth. It's similar in size. During the daytime, it can
get up to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. So, it's so like Earth,
but at the same time, this is a barren landscape. You don't see any trees,
you don't see any cactuses growing, anything like that. Today I'm going to tell you
about how we got from Earth to Mars and why it's so cool. So one of the things we start with
is a blank sheet of paper. We knew from the previous missions
in 2004, Spirit and Opportunity, there was water on Mars in the past. But what's the next step? We're looking for an even more
fundamental level of, what does it take to have life survive? And so, to have that kind
of knowledge and understanding, we have to carry
a mass amount of instruments. We have to carry the kind of labs that people have whole rooms
devoted to on Earth inside of, essentially, a small car. And we shrunk it all down to something that weighs
about as much as I do, and then put it inside of this rover
that weighs as much as your car does. And that rover is now
on the surface of Mars, but it's so heavy, and so it kind of takes
a special challenge for us to make it all work and come together. So we look at our tool of,
what do we have to land stuff on Mars? And one of the options is airbags. We've done it before. Airbags are pretty cool,
they bounce around a lot. You could never put a human
inside of an airbag, because they would get squashed. But the problem with airbags is,
the airbags you see here, which landed the smaller rover --
it's like 400 pounds, the entire rover -- were about the size of this room. So you can imagine the size
of airbags it would take to land a two-ton rover on Mars. And they'd have to be made
out of materials that don't even exist today, so it'd be some kind of exotic material
that we'd have to develop and it may or may not work. So, what about rockets? You know, you see all the rocket ships
landing in old movies, all rockets on the bottom --
it's a cool idea. It works when they're pretty light still, but the problem is, these rockets
have to be pretty strong to actually softly land you on Mars. And so they would be so powerful
they could dig holes into the ground and then you would just
end up inside of a hole and not be able to drive out of it. So, not the best design. But what if I could take the rockets
and move them up? And that's what we came up with. It's a rocket-powered jet pack;
we call it the Sky Crane. Basically, this big rocket
sits on top of our rover and when we're ready to land,
the rocket hovers in place and we slowly lower
the rover to the ground. And then we touch down,
we're actually on the wheels, we're ready to drive, day one. But in addition to that,
the scientists were like, "We actually want to go
somewhere interesting." The last two missions were cool, but they basically landed in what was like
landing in the plains or desert. Not very exciting. We all know from the exciting places
on Earth like the Grand Canyon, those are, for the scientists,
the most interesting, because you see that whole layer, you see years and years
of history all in one place. The same thing is true
for where we landed. We wanted to land somewhere
that was unique, that had this crater wall
where things had been dug up for us, where mountains were pushing things up. But the problem is, if you landed
with the older systems, you could've landed on the side
of that mountain and just tumbled off, could've been the side of a cliff,
the crater wall or a large boulder. So we needed a kind of technology to help us land in a very small area, and that was this little
guided entry from Apollo. We took it from the 1960s. We flew over like the manned vehicle,
because they have to pick up men, you can't just land all over the place. And then we landed, like,
spot-on in the middle. And in fact, it was so spot-on
that when we did it, it was basically like a quarterback
launching towards Mars -- like a quarterback, though,
that was in Seattle, throwing at a receiver that was moving
here in Giants Stadium. That's how accurate we were.
Kind of awesome. But you only get one shot, and so we actually have to design a system that we can build and test and operate, and so it's not just about
can we get it to Mars, but, if it's only one chance, how do you make sure
that one chance goes well? So there's all these processes
to make sure things are built properly. Then we go out to the desert
and drive around and test it. We fly things in F-18s to make sure
the radar systems work in high speeds. Then, most importantly, we test the team
to make sure they know how to operate it. We don't want to miss it
because we sent the wrong command and now it's going
to be rebooting forever. So, that guy Fred there,
he did a lot of that. And then we launched it
on this rocket to Mars. We landed 2,000 pounds on Mars, but the entire thing
was about 10,000 pounds when we lifted off from Earth, all the fuel and the solar arrays
and everything else that we needed. And, again, we were so accurate that we landed in this, like,
little pin-point on Mars. In the meantime, though, we had to design
a landing system that worked. And I told you about the actual physics
of it, but here's the catch: Mars is about 14 minutes
away from Earth in light speed, which means if I try
to control it with a joystick, I would be always controlling
to 14 minutes in advance, so it wouldn't work. So we had to give it all the smarts
and knowledge it needed to make it happen. So we built in all these
smarts and algorithms and told it here's what
you're going to have to do, and it goes from basically
five times the speed of a speeding bullet to about a baby's crawl, all within about seven minutes, which are called
the seven minutes of terror, because I was about to throw up. (Laughter) But today we're on the surface of Mars,
and this was one of the panoramas we took a couple days after we landed, and it's amazing to me,
because you look at this, and can see the Grand Canyon, you can see your own planet,
you can imagine walking on the surface. And so what we're going to do
and continue to do is to understand
what makes Mars so special and what makes Earth even more special that we're all here together today. So we'll see where Curiosity takes us -- not just our rover, but our sense of exploration. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth they've been here for billions of years and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms so they're one cell and they have the special property that they only have one piece of DNA so they have very few genes and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out and the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment they grow to twice their size they cut themselves down in the middle and one cell becomes two and so on and so on so they just grow and divide and grow and divide so kind of boring life except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters I know you guys think of yourself as humans and this is sort of how I think of you and so this man is supposed to represent a generic human being and all of the circles in that man are all the cells that make up your body so there's about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do but you have ten trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life so 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being and so of course it's the DNA that counts so here's all the 80 G's and C's that make up your genetic code and give you all your charming characteristics so you have about 30,000 genes well it turns out you have a hundred times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life and so at the best your 10% human we're more likely about 1% human depending on which of these metrics you like so I know you think of yourself as human beings but I think of you as ninety or ninety two point nine percent bacterial and these bacteria are not passive writers these are incredibly important they keep us alive they cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy they digest our food they make our vitamins they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out so they do all these amazing things that help us and keep in our vital for keeping us alive and they never get any press for that but they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well so there's all insert bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time and if they are they make you incredibly sick and so the question from my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do or all the bad things that bacteria do the question we had is how could they do anything at all I mean they're incredibly small you have to have a microscope to see one they live this soaring sort of boring life where they grow and divide and they've always been to consider to be these a social reclusive organisms and so it seemed to us that they're just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals and so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way the bacteria live and the clue to this came from another marine bacterium and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri and so what you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean named Vibrio fischeri and this bacterium has the special property that it makes light so it makes bioluminescence like fireflies make light so we're not doing anything to the cells here we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room and this is what we see and was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light but when the bacteria made light what we noticed is when the bacteria were alone so when they were in dilute suspension they made no light but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously and so the question that we had is how can bacteria these primitive organisms tell the difference from times when they're alone and times when they're in a community and then all do something together and what we figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other and they talk with a chemical language so this is now supposed to be my bacterial cell when it's alone it doesn't make any light but what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones and these are the red triangles and when the bacteria ours alone the molecules just float away and so no light but when the bacteria grow and double and they're all participating in making these molecules the molecule the extracellular amount that molecule increases in proportion to cell number and when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors they are they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony and so that's how bioluminescence works they're talking with these chemical words and the reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology so again another plug for the animals in the ocean the real fish fry lives in this squid what you're looking at is the Hawaiian bobtail squid and it's been turned on its back and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these how's the Vibrio fischeri cells they live in there at high cell number that molecule is there and they're making light and the reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light and so the way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii so just in a sort of shallow knee-deep water and the squid is nocturnal so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps but then at night it has to come out to hunt and so on bright nights when there's lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in since it's just in those couple feet of water and what the squid has developed is a shutter they can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria and then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back and it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom which is made by the bacterium exactly matches how much light hits the squids back so the squid doesn't make a shadow so it actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter illuminate itself in an anti predation device and so it so predators can't see its shadow calculate its trajectory and eat it and so this is like the stealth bomber of the ocean but then if you think about it this squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying stick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that and so what happens is every morning when the Sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep it buries itself in the sand and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm and when the Sun comes up it pumps out like 95% of the bacteria and so now the bacteria are dilute that little hormone molecule is gone so they're not making light but of course squid doesn't care it's asleep in the sand and as the day goes by the bacteria doubled they release the molecule and then light comes on at night exactly when the squid wants it and so first we figured out how and this bacterium does this but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this to figure out really what's the mechanism and what we found so this is now supposed to be again my bacterial cell is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein that's the red box it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule the red triangle and then as the cells grow they're all releasing that molecule into the environment so there's lots of molecule there and the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule these are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells and so when the molecule increases to a certain amount which says something about the number of cells it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light and why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean all bacteria have systems like this so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other they make chemical words they recognize those words and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison and so now we have a fancy name for this we call it quorum sensing they vote with these chemical votes the vote gets counted and then everybody responds to the vote and what's important for today's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions but the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence so it's not like a couple bacteria get in you and then they start secreting some toxins you're enormous that would have no effect on you you're huge but what they do we now understand is they get in you they wait they start growing they count themselves with these little molecules and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launched their virulence attack together they're going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host so bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing and so that's how it works we also then went to look at what are these molecules so these were the red triangles on my slides before and so this is the Vibrio fischeri molecule this is the word that it talks with and then we started to look at other bacteria and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered and what I hope you can see is that the molecules are related so the left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria but the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species and what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages so each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other so these are private secret conversations these conversations are for interest species communication each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's it like its language that allows it to count its own siblings and so once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors but we started what we're really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves they live in incredible mixtures with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria and that's depicted on this slide this is your skin so this is just a picture a micrograph of your skin anywhere on your body it looks pretty much like this and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there and so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria and it's about counting your neighbors it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species there has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population so we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria and what we found now is that in fact bacteria are multilingual so they all have a species specific system they have a molecule that says me but then running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered that's generic so they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria it's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication and so what happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you and they take that in for Meishan inside and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population and so then again we turn to chemistry and we figured out what this generic molecule is so that was the pink ovals on my last slide this is it it's a very small five carbon molecule and what the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule so they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication so this is the bacterial Esperanto and so once we got that far we've started to learn the bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language but what we started to think is that maybe there's something practical that we can do here as well so I've told you the bacteria do you have all these social behaviors that they communicate with these molecules and of course I've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing so we thought what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics and of course you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics bacteria are incredibly multi drug-resistant right now and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria so they either pop the bacterial membrane they make that bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA we kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants and so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases so we thought well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications just make these bacteria so they can't talk they can't count and they don't know to launch virulence and so that's exactly what we've done and we've sort of taken two strategies the first one is we've targeted the intra species communication system so we've made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules which you saw but they're a little bit different and so they lock into those receptors and they Jam recognition of the real thing and so by targeting the red system what we are able to do is to make species specific or disease specific anti quorum sensing molecules we've also done the same thing with the pink system we've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we've made in goodness of the interspecies communication system and these the hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria and so to finish I'll just show you the strategy and this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule but the logic is exactly the same so what you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal in this case a mouse it doesn't initiate virulence right away it gets in it starts growing it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they're going to launch their attack and the animal dies and so what we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections but we give them in conjunction with our anti quorum sensing molecules so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide and what we now know is that if we treat the animal with the pathogenic bacterium a multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacterium in at the same time we give our anti quorum sensing molecule in fact the animal lives and so we think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around at least initially this big problem of resistance so what I hope you think is the bacteria can talk to each other they use chemicals as their words they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about and of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular right and so in the spirit of Ted they are doing things together because it makes a difference right so what happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals and what I would hope that I could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity bacteria had been on the year on the earth for billions of years humans a couple hundred thousands so we think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular an organization works and and we think by studying bacteria we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body so we know that the principles and the rules if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from others so by using these two molecules they can say me and they can say you and again of course that's what we do both as Malec in in a molecular way and then also in an outward way but I think about the molecular stuff this is exactly what happens in your body it's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is and what their tasks should be and so again we think that bacteria invented that and then you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study and then the final thing is again just to reiterate that there's this practical part and so we've made these anti quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics but then to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the earth we've also made Pro quorum sensing molecules so we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better and so remember you have these ten times or more bacterial cells in your on you keeping you healthy what we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualist with you in the hopes of making you more healthy making those conversations better so bacteria can do things that we want them to do by in here better than they would be on their own and then finally I wanted to show you this is my gang at Princeton New Jersey everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture and I hope when you learn things like about how the natural world works I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child so science is done by that demographic there all of those people

**Transcript**:
bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth they've been here for billions of years and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms so they're one cell and they have the special property that they only have one piece of DNA so they have very few genes and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out and the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment they grow to twice their size they cut themselves down in the middle and one cell becomes two and so on and so on so they just grow and divide and grow and divide so kind of boring life except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters I know you guys think of yourself as humans and this is sort of how I think of you and so this man is supposed to represent a generic human being and all of the circles in that man are all the cells that make up your body so there's about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do but you have ten trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life so 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being and so of course it's the DNA that counts so here's all the 80 G's and C's that make up your genetic code and give you all your charming characteristics so you have about 30,000 genes well it turns out you have a hundred times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life and so at the best your 10% human we're more likely about 1% human depending on which of these metrics you like so I know you think of yourself as human beings but I think of you as ninety or ninety two point nine percent bacterial and these bacteria are not passive writers these are incredibly important they keep us alive they cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy they digest our food they make our vitamins they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out so they do all these amazing things that help us and keep in our vital for keeping us alive and they never get any press for that but they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well so there's all insert bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time and if they are they make you incredibly sick and so the question from my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do or all the bad things that bacteria do the question we had is how could they do anything at all I mean they're incredibly small you have to have a microscope to see one they live this soaring sort of boring life where they grow and divide and they've always been to consider to be these a social reclusive organisms and so it seemed to us that they're just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals and so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way the bacteria live and the clue to this came from another marine bacterium and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri and so what you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean named Vibrio fischeri and this bacterium has the special property that it makes light so it makes bioluminescence like fireflies make light so we're not doing anything to the cells here we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room and this is what we see and was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light but when the bacteria made light what we noticed is when the bacteria were alone so when they were in dilute suspension they made no light but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously and so the question that we had is how can bacteria these primitive organisms tell the difference from times when they're alone and times when they're in a community and then all do something together and what we figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other and they talk with a chemical language so this is now supposed to be my bacterial cell when it's alone it doesn't make any light but what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones and these are the red triangles and when the bacteria ours alone the molecules just float away and so no light but when the bacteria grow and double and they're all participating in making these molecules the molecule the extracellular amount that molecule increases in proportion to cell number and when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors they are they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony and so that's how bioluminescence works they're talking with these chemical words and the reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology so again another plug for the animals in the ocean the real fish fry lives in this squid what you're looking at is the Hawaiian bobtail squid and it's been turned on its back and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these how's the Vibrio fischeri cells they live in there at high cell number that molecule is there and they're making light and the reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light and so the way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii so just in a sort of shallow knee-deep water and the squid is nocturnal so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps but then at night it has to come out to hunt and so on bright nights when there's lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in since it's just in those couple feet of water and what the squid has developed is a shutter they can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria and then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back and it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom which is made by the bacterium exactly matches how much light hits the squids back so the squid doesn't make a shadow so it actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter illuminate itself in an anti predation device and so it so predators can't see its shadow calculate its trajectory and eat it and so this is like the stealth bomber of the ocean but then if you think about it this squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying stick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that and so what happens is every morning when the Sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep it buries itself in the sand and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm and when the Sun comes up it pumps out like 95% of the bacteria and so now the bacteria are dilute that little hormone molecule is gone so they're not making light but of course squid doesn't care it's asleep in the sand and as the day goes by the bacteria doubled they release the molecule and then light comes on at night exactly when the squid wants it and so first we figured out how and this bacterium does this but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this to figure out really what's the mechanism and what we found so this is now supposed to be again my bacterial cell is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein that's the red box it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule the red triangle and then as the cells grow they're all releasing that molecule into the environment so there's lots of molecule there and the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule these are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells and so when the molecule increases to a certain amount which says something about the number of cells it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light and why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean all bacteria have systems like this so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other they make chemical words they recognize those words and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison and so now we have a fancy name for this we call it quorum sensing they vote with these chemical votes the vote gets counted and then everybody responds to the vote and what's important for today's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions but the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence so it's not like a couple bacteria get in you and then they start secreting some toxins you're enormous that would have no effect on you you're huge but what they do we now understand is they get in you they wait they start growing they count themselves with these little molecules and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launched their virulence attack together they're going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host so bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing and so that's how it works we also then went to look at what are these molecules so these were the red triangles on my slides before and so this is the Vibrio fischeri molecule this is the word that it talks with and then we started to look at other bacteria and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered and what I hope you can see is that the molecules are related so the left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria but the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species and what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages so each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other so these are private secret conversations these conversations are for interest species communication each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's it like its language that allows it to count its own siblings and so once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors but we started what we're really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves they live in incredible mixtures with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria and that's depicted on this slide this is your skin so this is just a picture a micrograph of your skin anywhere on your body it looks pretty much like this and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there and so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria and it's about counting your neighbors it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species there has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population so we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria and what we found now is that in fact bacteria are multilingual so they all have a species specific system they have a molecule that says me but then running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered that's generic so they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria it's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication and so what happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you and they take that in for Meishan inside and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population and so then again we turn to chemistry and we figured out what this generic molecule is so that was the pink ovals on my last slide this is it it's a very small five carbon molecule and what the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule so they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication so this is the bacterial Esperanto and so once we got that far we've started to learn the bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language but what we started to think is that maybe there's something practical that we can do here as well so I've told you the bacteria do you have all these social behaviors that they communicate with these molecules and of course I've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing so we thought what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics and of course you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics bacteria are incredibly multi drug-resistant right now and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria so they either pop the bacterial membrane they make that bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA we kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants and so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases so we thought well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications just make these bacteria so they can't talk they can't count and they don't know to launch virulence and so that's exactly what we've done and we've sort of taken two strategies the first one is we've targeted the intra species communication system so we've made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules which you saw but they're a little bit different and so they lock into those receptors and they Jam recognition of the real thing and so by targeting the red system what we are able to do is to make species specific or disease specific anti quorum sensing molecules we've also done the same thing with the pink system we've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we've made in goodness of the interspecies communication system and these the hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria and so to finish I'll just show you the strategy and this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule but the logic is exactly the same so what you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal in this case a mouse it doesn't initiate virulence right away it gets in it starts growing it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they're going to launch their attack and the animal dies and so what we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections but we give them in conjunction with our anti quorum sensing molecules so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide and what we now know is that if we treat the animal with the pathogenic bacterium a multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacterium in at the same time we give our anti quorum sensing molecule in fact the animal lives and so we think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around at least initially this big problem of resistance so what I hope you think is the bacteria can talk to each other they use chemicals as their words they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about and of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular right and so in the spirit of Ted they are doing things together because it makes a difference right so what happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals and what I would hope that I could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity bacteria had been on the year on the earth for billions of years humans a couple hundred thousands so we think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular an organization works and and we think by studying bacteria we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body so we know that the principles and the rules if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from others so by using these two molecules they can say me and they can say you and again of course that's what we do both as Malec in in a molecular way and then also in an outward way but I think about the molecular stuff this is exactly what happens in your body it's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is and what their tasks should be and so again we think that bacteria invented that and then you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study and then the final thing is again just to reiterate that there's this practical part and so we've made these anti quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics but then to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the earth we've also made Pro quorum sensing molecules so we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better and so remember you have these ten times or more bacterial cells in your on you keeping you healthy what we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualist with you in the hopes of making you more healthy making those conversations better so bacteria can do things that we want them to do by in here better than they would be on their own and then finally I wanted to show you this is my gang at Princeton New Jersey everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture and I hope when you learn things like about how the natural world works I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child so science is done by that demographic there all of those people are between 20 and 30 years old and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country and it's a really lucky demographic to work with I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age and it's just Anna crazy delightful job and I want to thank you for inviting me here it's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference you

then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this to figure out really what's the mechanism and what we found so this is now supposed to be again my bacterial cell is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein that's the red box it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule the red triangle and then as the cells grow they're all releasing that molecule into the environment so there's lots of molecule there and the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule these are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells and so when the molecule increases to a certain amount which says something about the number of cells it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light and why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean all bacteria have systems like this so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other they make chemical words they recognize those words and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison and so now we have a fancy name for this we call it quorum sensing they vote with these chemical votes the vote gets counted and then everybody responds to the vote and what's important for today's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions but the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence so it's not like a couple bacteria get in you and then they start secreting some toxins you're enormous that would have no effect on you you're huge but what they do we now understand is they get in you they wait they start growing they count themselves with these little molecules and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launched their virulence attack together they're going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host so bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing and so that's how it works we also then went to look at what are these molecules so these were the red triangles on my slides before and so this is the Vibrio fischeri molecule this is the word that it talks with and then we started to look at other bacteria and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered and what I hope you can see is that the molecules are related so the left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria but the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species and what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages so each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other so these are private secret conversations these conversations are for interest species communication each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's it like its language that allows it to count its own siblings and so once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors but we started what we're really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves they live in incredible mixtures with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria and that's depicted on this slide this is your skin so this is just a picture a micrograph of your skin anywhere on your body it looks pretty much like this and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there and so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria and it's about counting your neighbors it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species there has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population so we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria and what we found now is that in fact bacteria are multilingual so they all have a species specific system they have a molecule that says me but then running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered that's generic so they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria it's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication and so what happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you and they take that in for Meishan inside and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population and so then again we turn to chemistry and we figured out what this generic molecule is so that was the pink ovals on my last slide this is it it's a very small five carbon molecule and what the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule so they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication so this is the bacterial Esperanto and so once we got that far we've started to learn the bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language but what we started to think is that maybe there's something practical that we can do here as well so I've told you the bacteria do you have all these social behaviors that they communicate with these molecules and of course I've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing so we thought what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics and of course you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics bacteria are incredibly multi drug-resistant right now and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria so they either pop the bacterial membrane they make that bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA we kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants and so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases so we thought well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications just make these bacteria so they can't talk they can't count and they don't know to launch virulence and so that's exactly what we've done and we've sort of taken two strategies the first one is we've targeted the intra species communication system so we've made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules which you saw but they're a little bit different and so they lock into those receptors and they Jam recognition of the real thing and so by targeting the red system what we are able to do is to make species specific or disease specific anti quorum sensing molecules we've also done the same thing with the pink system we've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we've made in goodness of the interspecies communication system and these the hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria and so to finish I'll just show you the strategy and this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule but the logic is exactly the same so what you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal in this case a mouse it doesn't initiate virulence right away it gets in it starts growing it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they're going to launch their attack and the animal dies and so what we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections but we give them in conjunction with our anti quorum sensing molecules so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide and what we now know is that if we treat the animal with the pathogenic bacterium a multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacterium in at the same time we give our anti quorum sensing molecule in fact the animal lives and so we think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around at least initially this big problem of resistance so what I hope you think is the bacteria can talk to each other they use chemicals as their words they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about and of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular right and so in the spirit of Ted they are doing things together because it makes a difference right so what happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals and what I would hope that I could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity bacteria had been on the year on the earth for billions of years humans a couple hundred thousands so we think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular an organization works and and we think by studying bacteria we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body so we know that the principles and the rules if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from others so by using these two molecules they can say me and they can say you and again of course that's what we do both as Malec in in a molecular way and then also in an outward way but I think about the molecular stuff this is exactly what happens in your body it's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is and what their tasks should be and so again we think that bacteria invented that and then you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study and then the final thing is again just to reiterate that there's this practical part and so we've made these anti quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics but then to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the earth we've also made Pro quorum sensing molecules so we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better and so remember you have these ten times or more bacterial cells in your on you keeping you healthy what we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualist with you in the hopes of making you more healthy making those conversations better so bacteria can do things that we want them to do by in here better than they would be on their own and then finally I wanted to show you this is my gang at Princeton New Jersey everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture and I hope when you learn things like about how the natural world works I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child so science is done by that demographic there all of those people are between 20 and 30 years old and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country and it's a really lucky demographic to work with I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age and it's just Anna crazy delightful job and I want to thank you for inviting me here it's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference you

**Transcript**:
bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth they've been here for billions of years and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms so they're one cell and they have the special property that they only have one piece of DNA so they have very few genes and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out and the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment they grow to twice their size they cut themselves down in the middle and one cell becomes two and so on and so on so they just grow and divide and grow and divide so kind of boring life except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters I know you guys think of yourself as humans and this is sort of how I think of you and so this man is supposed to represent a generic human being and all of the circles in that man are all the cells that make up your body so there's about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do but you have ten trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life so 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being and so of course it's the DNA that counts so here's all the 80 G's and C's that make up your genetic code and give you all your charming characteristics so you have about 30,000 genes well it turns out you have a hundred times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life and so at the best your 10% human we're more likely about 1% human depending on which of these metrics you like so I know you think of yourself as human beings but I think of you as ninety or ninety two point nine percent bacterial and these bacteria are not passive writers these are incredibly important they keep us alive they cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy they digest our food they make our vitamins they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out so they do all these amazing things that help us and keep in our vital for keeping us alive and they never get any press for that but they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well so there's all insert bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time and if they are they make you incredibly sick and so the question from my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do or all the bad things that bacteria do the question we had is how could they do anything at all I mean they're incredibly small you have to have a microscope to see one they live this soaring sort of boring life where they grow and divide and they've always been to consider to be these a social reclusive organisms and so it seemed to us that they're just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals and so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way the bacteria live and the clue to this came from another marine bacterium and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri and so what you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean named Vibrio fischeri and this bacterium has the special property that it makes light so it makes bioluminescence like fireflies make light so we're not doing anything to the cells here we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room and this is what we see and was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light but when the bacteria made light what we noticed is when the bacteria were alone so when they were in dilute suspension they made no light but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously and so the question that we had is how can bacteria these primitive organisms tell the difference from times when they're alone and times when they're in a community and then all do something together and what we figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other and they talk with a chemical language so this is now supposed to be my bacterial cell when it's alone it doesn't make any light but what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones and these are the red triangles and when the bacteria ours alone the molecules just float away and so no light but when the bacteria grow and double and they're all participating in making these molecules the molecule the extracellular amount that molecule increases in proportion to cell number and when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors they are they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony and so that's how bioluminescence works they're talking with these chemical words and the reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology so again another plug for the animals in the ocean the real fish fry lives in this squid what you're looking at is the Hawaiian bobtail squid and it's been turned on its back and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these how's the Vibrio fischeri cells they live in there at high cell number that molecule is there and they're making light and the reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light and so the way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii so just in a sort of shallow knee-deep water and the squid is nocturnal so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps but then at night it has to come out to hunt and so on bright nights when there's lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in since it's just in those couple feet of water and what the squid has developed is a shutter they can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria and then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back and it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom which is made by the bacterium exactly matches how much light hits the squids back so the squid doesn't make a shadow so it actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter illuminate itself in an anti predation device and so it so predators can't see its shadow calculate its trajectory and eat it and so this is like the stealth bomber of the ocean but then if you think about it this squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying stick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that and so what happens is every morning when the Sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep it buries itself in the sand and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm and when the Sun comes up it pumps out like 95% of the bacteria and so now the bacteria are dilute that little hormone molecule is gone so they're not making light but of course squid doesn't care it's asleep in the sand and as the day goes by the bacteria doubled they release the molecule and then light comes on at night exactly when the squid wants it and so first we figured out how and this bacterium does this but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this to figure out really what's the mechanism and what we found so this is now supposed to be again my bacterial cell is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein that's the red box it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule the red triangle and then as the cells grow they're all releasing that molecule into the environment so there's lots of molecule there and the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule these are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells and so when the molecule increases to a certain amount which says something about the number of cells it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light and why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean all bacteria have systems like this so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other they make chemical words they recognize those words and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison and so now we have a fancy name for this we call it quorum sensing they vote with these chemical votes the vote gets counted and then everybody responds to the vote and what's important for today's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions but the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence so it's not like a couple bacteria get in you and then they start secreting some toxins you're enormous that would have no effect on you you're huge but what they do we now understand is they get in you they wait they start growing they count themselves with these little molecules and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launched their virulence attack together they're going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host so bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing and so that's how it works we also then went to look at what are these molecules so these were the red triangles on my slides before and so this is the Vibrio fischeri molecule this is the word that it talks with and then we started to look at other bacteria and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered and what I hope you can see is that the molecules are related so the left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria but the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species and what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages so each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other so these are private secret conversations these conversations are for interest species communication each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's it like its language that allows it to count its own siblings and so once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors but we started what we're really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves they live in incredible mixtures with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria and that's depicted on this slide this is your skin so this is just a picture a micrograph of your skin anywhere on your body it looks pretty much like this and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there and so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria and it's about counting your neighbors it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species there has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population so we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria and what we found now is that in fact bacteria are multilingual so they all have a species specific system they have a molecule that says me but then running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered that's generic so they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria it's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication and so what happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you and they take that in for Meishan inside and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population and so then again we turn to chemistry and we figured out what this generic molecule is so that was the pink ovals on my last slide this is it it's a very small five carbon molecule and what the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule so they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication so this is the bacterial Esperanto and so once we got that far we've started to learn the bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language but what we started to think is that maybe there's something practical that we can do here as well so I've told you the bacteria do you have all these social behaviors that they communicate with these molecules and of course I've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing so we thought what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics and of course you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics bacteria are incredibly multi drug-resistant right now and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria so they either pop the bacterial membrane they make that bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA we kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants and so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases so we thought well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications just make these bacteria so they can't talk they can't count and they don't know to launch virulence and so that's exactly what we've done and we've sort of taken two strategies the first one is we've targeted the intra species communication system so we've made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules which you saw but they're a little bit different and so they lock into those receptors and they Jam recognition of the real thing and so by targeting the red system what we are able to do is to make species specific or disease specific anti quorum sensing molecules we've also done the same thing with the pink system we've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we've made in goodness of the interspecies communication system and these the hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria and so to finish I'll just show you the strategy and this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule but the logic is exactly the same so what you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal in this case a mouse it

attack and the animal dies and so what we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections but we give them in conjunction with our anti quorum sensing molecules so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide and what we now know is that if we treat the animal with the pathogenic bacterium a multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacterium in at the same time we give our anti quorum sensing molecule in fact the animal lives and so we think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around at least initially this big problem of resistance so what I hope you think is the bacteria can talk to each other they use chemicals as their words they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about and of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular right and so in the spirit of Ted they are doing things

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 4: How do bacteria use quorum sensing to initiate virulence in a host?**

This question matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. Both questions are asking about the process by which bacteria communicate with each other to launch a virulent attack on a host, and both questions mention quorum sensing as the key mechanism.

However, since the ground truth MCQ is asking about the name of the process, a more accurate match would be:

**Question 3: What is the name of the molecule that allows bacteria to communicate with each other and initiate collective behaviors?**

But an even better match would be a question that directly asks about the name of the process, which is not present in the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match, but I would like to propose an alternative:

**Question 5: What is the potential application of anti-quorum sensing molecules in treating bacterial infections?** is not a good match, but **Question 3** has an option that mentions "Quorum sensing molecule", the correct answer is actually the name of the process, which is option C in the ground truth MCQ.

A new question that directly asks about the name of the process would be the best match:

**Generated Question: What is the name of the process by which bacteria communicate with each other to launch a virulent attack on a host?**

Since this question is not present in the generated MCQs, I will choose the closest match:

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: **3**

[Music] [Music] openness it's a word that uh denotes opportunity and possibilities open-ended open harsh open source open door policy open bar and everywhere the world is opening up and it's a good thing why is this happening a technology Revolution is opening the world yesterday's internet was a platform for the presentation of content the internet of today is a platform for computation the internet is becoming a giant Global computer and every time you go on it you upload a video you do a Google search You remix something you're programming this big Global computer that we all share humanity is building a machine and this enables us to collaborate in new ways collaboration can occur on an astronomical basis now a new generation is opening up the world as well I started studying kids about 15 years ago so actually 20 years ago now and I noticed how my own children were effortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology and at first I thought my children are prodigies and uh but then I noticed all the friends were like them so that was a bad Theory so I started working with a few hundred uh kids and I came to the conclusion that this is the first generation to come of age in the digital age to be bathed in bits I called them the net generation I said these kids are different they have no fear of Technology because it's not there it's like the air sort of like I have no fear of a refrigerator and uh there there's no more powerful force to change every Institution than the first generation of digital natives I'm a digital immigrant I had to learn the language the global economic crisis is opening up the world as well our opaque institutions from the Industrial Age everything from old models of the corporation government media Wall Street are in various stages of being stalled or frozen or an atrophy or even failing and this is now creating a burning platform in the world I mean think about Wall Street the core modus operandi of Wall Street almost brought down global capitalism now you know the idea of a burning platform that you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are become greater than the cost of moving to something different perhaps something radically different and we need to change and open up all of our institutions so this technology push a demographic kick from a new generation and a demand pull from a new economic global environment is causing the world to open up now I think in fact we're at a turning point in human history where we can finally now rebuild many of the institutions of the Industrial Age around a new set of principles now what is openness well as it turns out openness has a number of different meanings and for each there's a corresponding principle for the transformation of civilization the first is collab ation now this is openness in the sense of the boundaries of organizations becoming more porous and fluid and open the guy in the picture here I'll tell you a story is his name is Rob mchan I'd like to say I have this stink tank we scour the world for amazing case studies the reason I know this story is because he's my neighbor um he actually moved across the street from us and he held a cocktail party to meet the neighbors and he says you're you're Don tavs Scot read some of your books I said great what do you do and he says well I used to be a banker and now I'm a gold miner and he tells me this amazing story he takes over this gold Min and his geologist can't tell him where the gold is he gives him more money for geological data they come back they can't tell him where to go into production after a few years he's so frustrated he's ready to give up but he has an epiphany one day he wonders if my geologists don't know where the gold is maybe somebody else does so he does a radical thing he takes his geological data he publishes it and he holds a contest on the internet called the gold Corp challenge it's basically uh half a million dollar in prize money for anyone who can tell me do I have any gold and if so where is it he gets submissions from all around the world they use techniques that he's never heard heard of and for his half a million dollars in prize money rob McKuen finds 3.4 billion doll worth of gold the market value of his company goes from 90 million to 10 billion dollars and I can tell you because he's my neighbor he's a happy camper you know conventional wisdom says Talent is inside right your most precious asso goes out the elevator every night he viewed Talent differently he wondered who are their peers he should have fired his geology Department uh but he didn't you know some of the best submissions didn't come from uh geologists they came from computer scientists engineers the winner was computer Graphics company that built a three-dimensional model of the Mind where you can helicopter underground and see where the gold is he helped us understand that social media is becoming social production this is not about hooking up online this is a new means of production in the making and this idea aora that he created an open market aora for uniquely qualified Minds was part of a change a profound change in the Deep structure and architecture of of our organizations and how we sort of uh orchestrate capability to innovate to create goods and services to engage with the rest of the world in terms of government how we create public value openness is about collaboration now secondly openness is about transparency this is different here we're talking about the communication of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations employees customers business partners shareholders and so on and everywhere our institutions are becoming naked people are all bent out of shape about Wikileaks but that's just the tip of the iceberg you see people at their fingertips now everybody not just jul Assange have have these powerful tools for finding out what's going on scrutinizing informing others and even organizing Collective responses institutions are becoming naked and if you're going to be naked well uh there are some crawler that flow from that I mean one is Fitness is no longer optional you know or if you're going to be naked you better get buff Now by Buff I mean you need to have good value because value is evidence like never before you say have good products they better be good but you also need to have values you need to have integrity as part of your bones and your DNA as an organization because if you don't You' be unable to build trust and trust is a sign of clome this new network world so this is good it's not bad sunlight is the best disinfectant and we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world now the third meaning and corresponding principle of openness is about sharing now this is different than transparency transparency is about the communication of information sharing is about giving up assets intellectual property there are all kinds of famous stories about this IBM gave away $400 million of software to the Linux movement and that gave them a multi-billion dollar payoff now convention wisdom says well hey our intellectual property belongs to us and if someone tries to infringe it we're going to get out our lawyers and we're going to sue them well it didn't work so well for the record labels did it I mean they they took they had a technology disruption and rather than taking a business model Innovation to correspond to that they took and sought a legal solution and the industry that brought you Elvis and The Beatles is now suing children is and is in danger of collapse so we need to think differently about intellectual property I'll give you an example the pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble first of all there aren't a lot of big inventions in the pipeline and this is a big problem for human health and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem that they're about to fall off something called the patent Cliff do you know about this they're going to lose 20 to 35% of their revenue in the next 12 months now what are you going to do like cut back on paper clips or something no we need to reinvent the whole model of of scientific research the pharmaceutical industry needs to place Assets in a Commons they need to start sharing pre-competitive research they need to start sharing clinical trial data and in doing so create a rising tide that could lift all boats not just for the industry but for Humanity now the fourth meaning of openness and corresponding principle is about empowerment I'm not talking about the motherhood sense here knowledge and intelligence is power and as it becomes more distributed there's a a concominant distribution and decentralization and disaggregation of power that's underway in the world today the open world is bringing Freedom now take the Arab Spring the debate about the role of social media and social change has been settled you know one word Tunisia and then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too but in the Tunisian Revolution the New Media didn't cause the revolution it was caused by Injustice social media didn't create the revolution it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who who didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore but just as the internet drops transaction and collaboration costs in business and government it also drops the cost of dissent of rebellion and even Insurrection in ways that people didn't understand you know during the Tunisian Revolution snipers associated with the regime were killing unarmed students in the street so the students would take their mobile devices take a picture triangulate the location send that picture to Friendly military units who'd come in and take out the snipers you think that social media is about hooking up online for these kids it was a military tool to defend unarmed people from murderers as a tool of self-defense you know as we speak today young people are being killed in Syria and up until 3 months ago if you were injured on the street an ambulance would pick you up take you to the hospital you'd go in say with a broken leg and you come out with a bullet in your head so these 20s somethings create an alternative Health Care System where what they did is they used Twitter and basic publicly available tools that when someone's in injured a car would show up it would pick them up take them to a makeshift Medical Clinic where you get medical treatment as opposed to being executed so this is a time of great change now it's not without its problems up until two years ago all Revolutions in human history had a leadership and when the old regime fell the the leadership the organization would take power well thesei Wiki revolutions happen so fast they create a vacuum and politics abhor vacuum and unsavory forces can fill that typically the old regime or extremists or fundamentalist forces you can see this playing out today in Egypt but that doesn't matter because this is moving forward the train has left the station the cat is out of the bag the the horse is out of the bar help me out here okay the toothpaste is out of the tube I mean we're not putting this one back the open world is bringing empowerment and freedom I think at the end of these four days that you'll come to conclude that the Ark of history is a positive one and it's towards openness if you go back few hundred years all around the world it was a very close Society it was agrarian and the means of production and political system was called feudalism and knowledge was concentrated in the church and the and and the nobility people didn't know about things there was no concept of progress you were born you lived your life and you died but then Johannes Gutenberg came along with with his great invention and over time the society opened up people started to learn about things and when they did the institutions of feudal society appeared to be stalled or frozen or failing it didn't make sense for the church to be responsible for medicine when people had knowledge so we saw the Protestant Reformation Martin Luther called the printing press God's highest ACT of Grace creation of a corporation science the university eventually the Industrial Revolution and it was all good but it came with a cost and now once again the technology Genie is out of the bottle but this time it's different the printing press gave us access to the written word the internet enables each of us to be a producer the the printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge the internet gives us access not just to information and knowledge but to the intelligence contained in the crany of other people on a on a global basis to me this is not an Information Age it's an age of networked intelligence it's an age of vast promise an age of collaboration where the boundaries of our organizations are changing of transparency where sunlight is disinfecting civilization an age of sharing and understanding the new power of the commons and it's an age of empowerment and of freedom now what I'd like to do is uh to close to share with you uh some research that I've been doing I've tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like but I've been studying nature recently you know bees come in swarms and fish come in schools starlings in the area around Edinburgh in the Moors of England come in something called called a murmuration and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings of the birds and throughout the day the starlings are out over a 20 M radius sort of doing their Starling thing and at night they come together and they create one of the most spectacular things in all of Nature and it's called a murmuration um and scientists that have studied this has said they'd never seen an accident now this thing has a function it protects the birds you can see on the right here there's a predator being chased away by the collective power of the birds apparently this is a frightening thing if you're a predator of Starlings and there's leadership but there's no one leader now is this some kind of fanciful analogy or could we actually learn something from this well the murmuration function still cord a number of principles and they're basically the principles that I describe to you today this is a huge collaboration it's an openness there a sharing of all kinds of information not just about location and trajectory and and danger and so on but about food sources and there's a real sense of interdependence of that the individual birds somehow understand that their interests are in the interests of the collective perhaps like we should understand that the the business can't succeed in a world that's failing well I look at this thing and I get lot of Hope think about the kids today in in the Arab Spring and you see something like this that's underway and imagine just consider this idea if you would what if we could connect ourselves in this world through a vast network of air and glass could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge could we start to share our intelligence could we create some kind of collective int intelligence that goes beyond an individual or a group or a team to create perhaps some kind of Consciousness on a global basis well if we could do this we could attack some big problems in the world and I look at this thing and I I don't know I get a lot of hope that maybe this smaller networked open world that our kids inherit might be a better one and that this new age of networked intelligence could be an age of of promise fulfilled and of peril unrequited let's do this thank [Applause] [Music] you

Information Age it's an age of networked intelligence it's an age of vast promise an age of collaboration where the boundaries of our organizations are changing of transparency where sunlight is disinfecting civilization an age of sharing and understanding the new power of the commons and it's an age of empowerment and of freedom now what I'd like to do is uh to close to share with you uh some research that I've been doing I've tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like but I've been studying nature recently you know bees come in swarms and fish come in schools starlings in the area around Edinburgh in the Moors of England come in something called called a murmuration and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings of the birds and throughout the day the starlings are out over a 20 M radius sort of doing their Starling thing and at night they come together and they create one of the most spectacular things in all of Nature and it's called a murmuration um and scientists that have studied this has said they'd never seen an accident now this thing has a function it protects the birds you can see on the right here there's a predator being chased away by the collective power of the birds apparently this is a frightening thing if you're a predator of Starlings and there's leadership but there's no one leader now is this some kind of fanciful analogy or could we actually learn something from this well the murmuration function still cord a number of principles and they're basically the principles that I describe to you today this is a huge collaboration it's an openness there a sharing of all kinds of information not just about location and trajectory and and danger and so on but about food sources and there's a real sense of interdependence of that the individual birds somehow understand that their interests are in the interests of the collective perhaps like we should understand that the the business can't succeed in a world that's failing well I look at this thing and I get lot of Hope think about the kids today in in the Arab Spring and you see something like this that's underway and imagine just consider this idea if you would what if we could connect ourselves in this world through a vast network of air and glass could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge could we start to share our intelligence could we create some kind of collective int intelligence that goes beyond an individual or a group or a team to create perhaps some kind of Consciousness on a global basis well if we could do this we could attack some big problems in the world and I look at this thing and I I don't know I get a lot of hope that maybe this smaller networked open world that our kids inherit might be a better one and that this new age of networked intelligence could be an age of of promise fulfilled and of peril unrequited let's do this thank [Applause] [Music] you

[Music] [Music] openness it's a word that uh denotes opportunity and possibilities open-ended open harsh open source open door policy open bar and everywhere the world is opening up and it's a good thing why is this happening a technology Revolution is opening the world yesterday's internet was a platform for the presentation of content the internet of today is a platform for computation the internet is becoming a giant Global computer and every time you go on it you upload a video you do a Google search You remix something you're programming this big Global computer that we all share humanity is building a machine and this enables us to collaborate in new ways collaboration can occur on an astronomical basis now a new generation is opening up the world as well I started studying kids about 15 years ago so actually 20 years ago now and I noticed how my own children were effortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology and at first I thought my children are prodigies and uh but then I noticed all the friends were like them so that was a bad Theory so I started working with a few hundred uh kids and I came to the conclusion that this is the first generation to come of age in the digital age to be bathed in bits I called them the net generation I said these kids are different they have no fear of Technology because it's not there it's like the air sort of like I have no fear of a refrigerator and uh there there's no more powerful force to change every Institution than the first generation of digital natives I'm a digital immigrant I had to learn the language the global economic crisis is opening up the world as well our opaque institutions from the Industrial Age everything from old models of the corporation government media Wall Street are in various stages of being stalled or frozen or an atrophy or even failing and this is now creating a burning platform in the world I mean think about Wall Street the core modus operandi of Wall Street almost brought down global capitalism now you know the idea of a burning platform that you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are become greater than the cost of moving to something different perhaps something radically different and we need to change and open up all of our institutions so this technology push a demographic kick from a new generation and a demand pull from a new economic global environment is causing the world to open up now I think in fact we're at a turning point in human history where we can finally now rebuild many of the institutions of the Industrial Age around a new set of principles now what is openness well as it turns out openness has a number of different meanings and for each there's a corresponding principle for the transformation of civilization the first is collab ation now this is openness in the sense of the boundaries of organizations becoming more porous and fluid and open the guy in the picture here I'll tell you a story is his name is Rob mchan I'd like to say I have this stink tank we scour the world for amazing case studies the reason I know this story is because he's my neighbor um he actually moved across the street from us and he held a cocktail party to meet the neighbors and he says you're you're Don tavs Scot read some of your books I said great what do you do and he says well I used to be a banker and now I'm a gold miner and he tells me this amazing story he takes over this gold Min and his geologist can't tell him where the gold is he gives him more money for geological data they come back they can't tell him where to go into production after a few years he's so frustrated he's ready to give up but he has an epiphany one day he wonders if my geologists don't know where the gold is maybe somebody else does so he does a radical thing he takes his geological data he publishes it and he holds a contest on the internet called the gold Corp challenge it's basically uh half a million dollar in prize money for anyone who can tell me do I have any gold and if so where is it he gets submissions from all around the world they use techniques that he's never heard heard of and for his half a million dollars in prize money rob McKuen finds 3.4 billion doll worth of gold the market value of his company goes from 90 million to 10 billion dollars and I can tell you because he's my neighbor he's a happy camper you know conventional wisdom says Talent is inside right your most precious asso goes out the elevator every night he viewed Talent differently he wondered who are their peers he should have fired his geology Department uh but he didn't you know some of the best submissions didn't come from uh geologists they came from computer scientists engineers the winner was computer Graphics company that built a three-dimensional model of the Mind where you can helicopter underground and see where the gold is he helped us understand that social media is becoming social production this is not about hooking up online this is a new means of production in the making and this idea aora that he created an open market aora for uniquely qualified Minds was part of a change a profound change in the Deep structure and architecture of of our organizations and how we sort of uh orchestrate capability to innovate to create goods and services to engage with the rest of the world in terms of government how we create public value openness is about collaboration now secondly openness is about transparency this is different here we're talking about the communication of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations employees customers business partners shareholders and so on and everywhere our institutions are becoming naked people are all bent out of shape about Wikileaks but that's just the tip of the iceberg you see people at their fingertips now everybody not just jul Assange have have these powerful tools for finding out what's going on scrutinizing informing others and even organizing Collective responses institutions are becoming naked and if you're going to be naked well uh there are some crawler that flow from that I mean one is Fitness is no longer optional you know or if you're going to be naked you better get buff Now by Buff I mean you need to have good value because value is evidence like never before you say have good products they better be good but you also need to have values you need to have integrity as part of your bones and your DNA as an organization because if you don't You' be unable to build trust and trust is a sign of clome this new network world so this is good it's not bad sunlight is the best disinfectant and we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world now the third meaning and corresponding principle of openness is about sharing now this is different than transparency transparency is about the communication of information sharing is about giving up assets intellectual property there are all kinds of famous stories about this IBM gave away $400 million of software to the Linux movement and that gave them a multi-billion dollar payoff now convention wisdom says well hey our intellectual property belongs to us and if someone tries to infringe it we're going to get out our lawyers and we're going to sue them well it didn't work so well for the record labels did it I mean they they took they had a technology disruption and rather than taking a business model Innovation to correspond to that they took and sought a legal solution and the industry that brought you Elvis and The Beatles is now suing children is and is in danger of collapse so we need to think differently about intellectual property I'll give you an example the pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble first of all there aren't a lot of big inventions in the pipeline and this is a big problem for human health and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem that they're about to fall off something called the patent Cliff do you know about this they're going to lose 20 to 35% of their revenue in the next 12 months now what are you going to do like cut back on paper clips or something no we need to reinvent the whole model of of scientific research the pharmaceutical industry needs to place Assets in a Commons they need to start sharing pre-competitive research they need to start sharing clinical trial data and in doing so create a rising tide that could lift all boats not just for the industry but for Humanity now the fourth meaning of openness and corresponding principle is about empowerment I'm not talking about the motherhood sense here knowledge and intelligence is power and as it becomes more distributed there's a a concominant distribution and decentralization and disaggregation of power that's underway in the world today the open world is bringing Freedom now take the Arab Spring the debate about the role of social media and social change has been settled you know one word Tunisia and then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too but in the Tunisian Revolution the New Media didn't cause the revolution it was caused by Injustice social media didn't create the revolution it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who who didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore but just as the internet drops transaction and collaboration costs in business and government it also drops the cost of dissent of rebellion and even Insurrection in ways that people didn't understand you know during the Tunisian Revolution snipers associated with the regime were killing unarmed students in the street so the students would take their mobile devices take a picture triangulate the location send that picture to Friendly military units who'd come in and take out the snipers you think that social media is about hooking up online for these kids it was a military tool to defend unarmed people from murderers as a tool of self-defense you know as we speak today young people are being killed in Syria and up until 3 months ago if you were injured on the street an ambulance would pick you up take you to the hospital you'd go in say with a broken leg and you come out with a bullet in your head so these 20s somethings create an alternative Health Care System where what they did is they used Twitter and basic publicly available tools that when someone's in injured a car would show up it would pick them up take them to a makeshift Medical Clinic where you get medical treatment as opposed to being executed so this is a time of great change now it's not without its problems up until two years ago all Revolutions in human history had a leadership and when the old regime fell the the leadership the organization would take power well thesei Wiki revolutions happen so fast they create a vacuum and politics abhor vacuum and unsavory forces can fill that typically the old regime or extremists or fundamentalist forces you can see this playing out today in Egypt but that doesn't matter because this is moving forward the train has left the station the cat is out of the bag the the horse is out of the bar help me out here okay the toothpaste is out of the tube I mean we're not putting this one back the open world is bringing empowerment and freedom I think at the end of these four days that you'll come to conclude that the Ark of history is a positive one and it's towards openness if you go back few hundred years all around the world it was a very close Society it was agrarian and the means of production and political system was called feudalism and knowledge was concentrated in the church and the and and the nobility people didn't know about things there was no concept of progress you were born you lived your life and you died but then Johannes Gutenberg came along with with his great invention and over time the society opened up people started to learn about things and when they did the institutions of feudal society appeared to be stalled or frozen or failing it didn't make sense for the church to be responsible for medicine when people had knowledge so we saw the Protestant Reformation Martin Luther called the printing press God's highest ACT of Grace creation of a corporation science the university eventually the Industrial Revolution and it was all good but it came with a cost and now once again the technology Genie is out of the bottle but this time it's different the printing press gave us access to the written word the internet enables each of us to be a producer the the printing press gave us access to

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but it is related to the concept of decentralization and distribution of power.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the effect of distributed knowledge on power structures, and the correct answer is that power becomes decentralized.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 is the closest match, but it is not directly related to the decentralization of power. However, it does mention the idea of a new generation of young people driving a revolution, which could be indirectly related to the decentralization of power.

A more relevant match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses the relationship between distributed knowledge and power structures. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match, but with a low confidence level.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 5 (with low confidence)

Note: A more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly addresses the relationship between distributed knowledge and power structures, which is not present in the provided generated MCQs.

up having a whole bunch of other words too but in the Tunisian Revolution the New Media didn't cause the revolution it was caused by Injustice social media didn't create the revolution it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who who didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore but just as the internet drops transaction and collaboration costs in business and government it also drops the cost of dissent of rebellion and even Insurrection in ways that people didn't understand you know during the Tunisian Revolution snipers associated with the regime were killing unarmed students in the street so the students would take their mobile devices take a picture triangulate the location send that picture to Friendly military units who'd come in and take out the snipers you think that social media is about hooking up online for these kids it was a military tool to defend unarmed people from murderers as a tool of self-defense you know as we speak today young people are being killed in Syria and up until 3 months ago if you were injured on the street an ambulance would pick you up take you to the hospital you'd go in say with a broken leg and you come out with a bullet in your head so these 20s somethings create an alternative Health Care System where what they did is they used Twitter and basic publicly available tools that when someone's in injured a car would show up it would pick them up take them to a makeshift Medical Clinic where you get medical treatment as opposed to being executed so this is a time of great change now it's not without its problems up until two years ago all Revolutions in human history had a leadership and when the old regime fell the the leadership the organization would take power well thesei Wiki revolutions happen so fast they create a vacuum and politics abhor vacuum and unsavory forces can fill that typically the old regime or extremists or fundamentalist forces you can see this playing out today in Egypt but that doesn't matter because this is moving forward the train has left the station the cat is out of the bag the the horse is out of the bar help me out here okay the toothpaste is out of the tube I mean we're not putting this one back the open world is bringing empowerment and freedom I think at the end of these four days that you'll come to conclude that the Ark of history is a positive one and it's towards openness if you go back few hundred years all around the world it was a very close Society it was agrarian and the means of production and political system was called feudalism and knowledge was concentrated in the church and the and and the nobility people didn't know about things there was no concept of progress you were born you lived your life and you died but then Johannes Gutenberg came along with with his great invention and over time the society opened up people started to learn about things and when they did the institutions of feudal society appeared to be stalled or frozen or failing it didn't make sense for the church to be responsible for medicine when people had knowledge so we saw the Protestant Reformation Martin Luther called the printing press God's highest ACT of Grace creation of a corporation science the university eventually the Industrial Revolution and it was all good but it came with a cost and now once again the technology Genie is out of the bottle but this time it's different the printing press gave us access to the written word the internet enables each of us to be a producer the the printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge the internet gives us access not just to information and knowledge but to the intelligence contained in the crany of other people on a on a global basis to me this is not an Information Age it's an age of networked intelligence it's an age of vast promise an age of collaboration where the boundaries of our organizations are changing of transparency where sunlight is disinfecting civilization an age of sharing and understanding the new power of the commons and it's an age of empowerment and of freedom now what I'd like to do is uh to close to share with you uh some research that I've been doing I've tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like but I've been studying nature recently you know bees come in swarms and fish come in schools starlings in the area around Edinburgh in the Moors of England come in something called called a murmuration and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings of the birds and throughout the day the starlings are out over a 20 M radius sort of doing their Starling thing and at night they come together and they create one of the most spectacular things in all of Nature and it's called a murmuration um and scientists that have studied this has said they'd never seen an accident now this thing has a function it protects the birds you can see on the right here there's a predator being chased away by the collective power of the birds apparently this is a frightening thing if you're a predator of Starlings and there's leadership but there's no one leader now is this some kind of fanciful analogy or could we actually learn something from this well the murmuration function still cord a number of principles and they're basically the principles that I describe to you today this is a huge collaboration it's an openness there a sharing of all kinds of information not just about location and trajectory and and danger and so on but about food sources and there's a real sense of interdependence of that the individual birds somehow understand that their interests are in the interests of the collective perhaps like we should understand that the the business can't succeed in a world that's failing well I look at this thing and I get lot of Hope think about the kids today in in the Arab Spring and you see something like this that's underway and imagine just consider this idea if you would what if we could connect ourselves in this world through a vast network of air and glass could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge could we start to share our intelligence could we create some kind of collective int intelligence that goes beyond an individual or a group or a team to create perhaps some kind of Consciousness on a global basis well if we could do this we could attack some big problems in the world and I look at this thing and I I don't know I get a lot of hope that maybe this smaller networked open world that our kids inherit might be a better one and that this new age of networked intelligence could be an age of of promise fulfilled and of peril unrequited let's do this thank [Applause] [Music] you

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you heard the one about Thomas Jefferson and the Louisiana Territory? Thomas Jefferson, author of The Declaration of Independence, was not a fan of the new constitution presented in 1787. He was very worried that The Constitution gave too much power to the new, national government, and not enough power to the states, an issue known as "big government". Jefferson only reluctantly agreed to support it when his friend, James Madison, promised to propose a bill of rights after it was ratified. But Jefferson's fears about big government did not go away. For example, Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, proposed a national bank in 1790, and Jefferson knew there was no provision in The Constitution to permit such a thing. Hamilton claimed some sort of implied powers mumbo-jumbo. Sure, it wasn't written in The Constitution, but The Constitution implied that it could be done. But, Jefferson wasn't buying it. Nonetheless, the bank was established by Hamilton and President Washington. When Jefferson was sworn in as President in 1801, he pledged to reduce the size and scope of the national government. But, of course, things didn't go exactly as he had planned. Spain secretly transferred the Louisiana Territory to France right beneath Jefferson's nose. When Congress found out, they quickly began discussions with France to buy a piece of the territory along the Mississippi River for about $2 million. But, there was one little problem: Jefferson knew there was no provision in The Constitution to buy foreign territory. So what was a strict constructionist to do? First, he tried to get an amendment to The Constitution passed that would expressly permit the purchase, but Congress wasn't willing to do it. Then, without permission, the U.S. negotiators in France cut a deal for all of the territory for a cool $15 million dollars. That new land doubled the size of the nation! Now Jefferson was really stuck. He knew that the territory would be a great acquisition for the country, providing lots of new land for farmers and other settlers, but how could he constitutionally justify it? In the end, Jefferson turned to the argument used by his old foe Alexander Hamilton. He claimed that the power to purchase the territory is implied in The Constitution's treaty-making power. This was the exact argument that he had mocked openly a decade before, so it must have crushed his pride to have to use it. But more importantly, he may have committed the biggest big government play ever! How ironic is it that one of the biggest opponents of big government doubled the size of the young country and did so while openly questioning its constitutionality? At $15 million, which is about three cents an acre, it has been called by many the greatest real estate deal in the history of the United States.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although the ground truth MCQ specifically asks about Thomas Jefferson's opposition to the National Bank, the closest match in terms of content and intent is Question 4, which discusses Alexander Hamilton's argument for establishing the National Bank. This argument is directly related to Jefferson's opposition, as mentioned in the transcript.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the closest match based on the provided options, I would choose Question 4, but I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that more accurately reflects the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ.

Here's an example of a new generated MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ:

Question: Why did Thomas Jefferson oppose the creation of the National Bank in 1790?
Options: A. It was not expressly authorized by the Constitution, B. It failed to benefit his home state of Virginia, C. It was too expensive to establish, D. It was not necessary for the country's economic growth

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not ask about Thomas Jefferson's pledge when he was elected president. 

A more relevant question would be one that asks about Thomas Jefferson's goals or pledges when he became president. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

But if we had to choose one, it would be:

By claiming that the power to purchase the territory was implied in the Constitution's treaty-making power, C. By negotiating with Spain directly, D. By ignoring the issue altogether Correct Option: A**

This question is not a perfect match, but it does relate to Thomas Jefferson's actions as president. However, it does not address his pledge to reduce the size and scope of the federal government.

If we were to choose a question that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, it would be:

None of the questions perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if we had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the closest in terms of the topic and the correct answer.

Jefferson only reluctantly agreed to support it when his friend, James Madison, promised to propose a bill of rights after it was ratified. But Jefferson's fears about big government did not go away. For example, Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, proposed a national bank in 1790, and Jefferson knew there was no provision in The Constitution to permit such a thing. Hamilton claimed some sort of implied powers mumbo-jumbo. Sure, it wasn't written in The Constitution, but The Constitution implied that it could be done. But, Jefferson wasn't buying it. Nonetheless, the bank was established by Hamilton and President Washington. When Jefferson was sworn in as President in 1801, he pledged to reduce the size and scope of the national government. But, of course, things didn't go exactly as he had planned. Spain secretly transferred the Louisiana Territory to France right beneath Jefferson's nose. When Congress found out, they quickly began discussions with France to buy a piece of the territory along the Mississippi River for about $2 million. But, there was one little problem: Jefferson knew there was no provision in The Constitution to buy foreign territory. So what was a strict constructionist to do? First, he tried to get an amendment to The Constitution passed that would expressly permit the purchase, but Congress wasn't willing to do it. Then, without permission, the U.S. negotiators in France cut a deal for all of the territory for a cool $15 million dollars. That new land doubled the size of the nation! Now Jefferson was really stuck. He knew that the territory would be a great acquisition for the country, providing lots of new land for farmers and other settlers, but how could he constitutionally justify it? In the end, Jefferson turned to the argument used by his old foe Alexander Hamilton. He claimed that the power to purchase the territory is implied in The Constitution's treaty-making power. This was the exact argument that he had mocked openly a decade before, so it must have crushed his pride to have to use it. But more importantly, he may have committed the biggest big government play ever! How ironic is it that one of the biggest opponents of big government doubled the size of the young country and did so while openly questioning its constitutionality? At $15 million, which is about three cents an acre, it has been called by many the greatest real estate deal in the history of the United States.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
To find the most similar generated MCQ, we need to analyze the question content, options, and overall intent of the ground truth MCQ and compare it with the generated MCQs.

The ground truth MCQ is about the approximate price per acre for the Louisiana Territory. The correct answer is 3 cents.

Upon reviewing the generated MCQs, we can see that Question 5 is about the approximate price paid by the U.S. to France for the Louisiana Territory, but it does not provide the price per acre. However, we can use this information to calculate the price per acre.

Since we know that the correct answer for the ground truth MCQ is 3 cents and the total price paid for the Louisiana Territory is $15 million (as mentioned in Question 5), we can infer that the generated MCQs do not directly provide the price per acre.

However, Question 10 mentions that the Louisiana Purchase was called the greatest real estate deal in the history of the United States, with a price of $15 million, which is about three cents an acre (as mentioned in the transcript). Although this information is not in the form of a direct question, it is mentioned in the options or the question itself, Question 5 is the closest one that provides relevant information to calculate the price per acre.

But there isn't a question that perfectly matches the ground truth MCQ. However, if we were to choose the closest one based on the information provided, it would be Question 5, as it provides the total price paid for the Louisiana Territory.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar So how many of you have a robot at home? OK, I see about 20, 30 hands. That's actually pretty good. How many of you would want
your own personal robot at home? I know I would! OK, so why doesn't this exist? Why can't I go to the convenience store
or the department store and, you know, go up to the cashier and say,
"Yeah, I want my personal robot"? Well, I'm going to talk to you
about how to make that happen. The thing that we need to do
is to make robots smarter. Now, no one will argue
that we don't have robots. We have rovers that are going to Mars
and are getting science data and expanding our
understanding of the world. We have manufacturing robots that are helping to build our cars
that we drive today. We even have robots
that are helping our military, that are out disposing of bombs so our soldiers can come home safely. So we have all this,
so why don't we have the personal robot? Why don't I have my robot chef?
Because I can't cook. (Laughter) So, here's one of my robots,
this is a simple walking robot, but it is by no means smart. And so, what we need to do is we need to change the definition
of what a robot is. How do we do that? Well, the first step, before we even start designing
and getting our hands dirty, we have to come up with rules,
kind of the laws, rules of conduct. And why is this?
Because if these robots are smart, they might be capable
of more than we want. And so we have to come up with rules. Thou, robot, shall not harm a human. Thou shall obey me, and only me. Thou shall always protect me
at all possible times. So we have to lay the boundaries,
the rules of engagement, before we actually start designing. And then we have to come up with tools. So I believe that the way
to make robots smarter is to mimic people. Now, our brains are complex,
there's a lot going on in there, and so, it'd be hard
to try to open up the brain and actually figure out
how to mimic humans. The best way is to observe,
is to actually watch people do things, and figure out what are they doing,
what are their thoughts, what are their actions,
what are their emotions? And so, part of making robots smarter
is actually trying to mimic humans, mimic how we do things, so maybe they can do it
a little bit better. And so, some of the tools are varied. And so, I'm classically trained
as an electrical engineer. I never thought I'd have to understand
things like child psychology, infant development. So, understanding that the way
infants develop to children, develop to adults,
and how they learn and interact is actually important for robotics. I didn't understand
that I'd actually have to watch tapes of monkeys
interacting and communicating, because they have
a whole social kind of mechanism where they learn from each other, and so that's really good
to make robots smarter. And, of course, neuroscience, I've always been fascinated
with neuroscience, but I never understood
that I had to figure out why do the neurons fire, what about the environment
helps us to learn, and all of those really contribute
to making robots a little bit smarter. And so, some of the things that I do --
and this is just a little snapshot -- one of the things is mirroring. So they say our ability
to look in a mirror and wave and actually recognize
that the person on the other side is us, that self-awareness, is a sign of intelligence, and that allows us
to then look at someone pitch a ball and figure out,
"OK, I know how to pitch a ball, I'm going to mirror their improvement." And so I actually have a robot where we are trying to design
a robot health coach. And so, I have an exercise physiologist showing the robot
how to do some exercises. You know, we want to get strong. And then, the other thing is learning. So, learning is important.
We do this as children, we do this even as adults,
we do this as elder. And yet, one form of learning
is muscle memory. So how many of you play an instrument? OK, so when you start off, for example,
if you think about the violin, you start off and your instructor
might actually come and move your hand a little bit
or maybe move your bow a little bit up. So they actually touch you
in order to give you muscle memory. And that helps you understand
how to do things a little better. And so we actually
have a learning methodology where of course, we're not going
to take the motors and move the legs, and so we have to Nunchuk
to give our robot muscle memory in terms of how to do dance moves. And then, lastly, is creativity. So, you might ask,
"Robots? Creativity? I don't get this. Why does the robot have to be creative?
What about creativity makes them smarter?" Well, creativity and imagination, those are the things
that allow us to create problems when we don't know how to attack it. They allow us to make
something out of nothing. I mean, if you look at the apps
that at out there and the tablets, and the iPads, and the iPhones,
and the Androids -- 20 years ago they didn't exist. So, how is it that we got from something
where there was nothing and expanded? It was our imagination.
It was our creativity. And these are the things
that allow us to figure out new things. And so, I have a robot that is creative, it plays piano, is a composer, and if you listen, it plays
"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star." (Music) So, all of this together, the last thing is interaction. So, you have a robot,
you want it to be your playmate, your teacher, your instructor, you want it to interact. And isn't it so cute? (Laughter) So, interaction is key, it is key to understanding
how to work in our world with us, and so the interaction piece
is very important. It deals with communication,
it deals with understanding, it deals with gaze,
it deals with attention. All of these things together
allow that interaction and our robots to be smart. And so these are just some of the tools that we use in order
to make robots smarter. So, I want to leave you with one thought. So, I'm all for robots and smart robots. I mean, that's what I do, I'd be out of a job
if I didn't believe in that. But yet, where does it end? How far do we push it? How far and how smart
should we make our smart robots? Thank you. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options, it shares a similar intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about a specific law that robots should not follow, while Question 2 asks about a key step in designing smart robots, which involves establishing rules of conduct. 

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ is quite specific, and the generated MCQs do not capture its exact intent. 

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose Question 2, but with the understanding that it is not a perfect match.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar So how many of you have a robot at home? OK, I see about 20, 30 hands. That's actually pretty good. How many of you would want
your own personal robot at home? I know I would! OK, so why doesn't this exist? Why can't I go to the convenience store
or the department store and, you know, go up to the cashier and say,
"Yeah, I want my personal robot"? Well, I'm going to talk to you
about how to make that happen. The thing that we need to do
is to make robots smarter. Now, no one will argue
that we don't have robots. We have rovers that are going to Mars
and are getting science data and expanding our
understanding of the world. We have manufacturing robots that are helping to build our cars
that we drive today. We even have robots
that are helping our military, that are out disposing of bombs so our soldiers can come home safely. So we have all this,
so why don't we have the personal robot? Why don't I have my robot chef?
Because I can't cook. (Laughter) So, here's one of my robots,
this is a simple walking robot, but it is by no means smart. And so, what we need to do is we need to change the definition
of what a robot is. How do we do that? Well, the first step, before we even start designing
and getting our hands dirty, we have to come up with rules,
kind of the laws, rules of conduct. And why is this?
Because if these robots are smart, they might be capable
of more than we want. And so we have to come up with rules. Thou, robot, shall not harm a human. Thou shall obey me, and only me. Thou shall always protect me
at all possible times. So we have to lay the boundaries,
the rules of engagement, before we actually start designing. And then we have to come up with tools. So I believe that the way
to make robots smarter is to mimic people. Now, our brains are complex,
there's a lot going on in there, and so, it'd be hard
to try to open up the brain and actually figure out
how to mimic humans. The best way is to observe,
is to actually watch people do things, and figure out what are they doing,
what are their thoughts, what are their actions,
what are their emotions? And so, part of making robots smarter
is actually trying to mimic humans, mimic how we do things, so maybe they can do it
a little bit better. And so, some of the tools are varied. And so, I'm classically trained
as an electrical engineer. I never thought I'd have to understand
things like child psychology, infant development. So, understanding that the way
infants develop to children, develop to adults,
and how they learn and interact is actually important for robotics. I didn't understand
that I'd actually have to watch tapes of monkeys
interacting and communicating, because they have
a whole social kind of mechanism where they learn from each other, and so that's really good
to make robots smarter. And, of course, neuroscience, I've always been fascinated
with neuroscience, but I never understood
that I had to figure out why do the neurons fire, what about the environment
helps us to learn, and all of those really contribute
to making robots a little bit smarter. And so, some of the things that I do --
and this is just a little snapshot -- one of the things is mirroring. So they say our ability
to look in a mirror and wave and actually recognize
that the person on the other side is us, that self-awareness, is a sign of intelligence, and that allows us
to then look at someone pitch a ball and figure out,
"OK, I know how to pitch a ball, I'm going to mirror their improvement." And so I actually have a robot where we are trying to design
a robot health coach. And so, I have an exercise physiologist showing the robot
how to do some exercises. You know, we want to get strong. And then, the other thing is learning. So, learning is important.
We do this as children, we do this even as adults,
we do this as elder. And yet, one form of learning
is muscle memory. So how many of you play an instrument? OK, so when you start off, for example,
if you think about the violin, you start off and your instructor
might actually come and move your hand a little bit
or maybe move your bow a little bit up. So they actually touch you
in order to give you muscle memory. And that helps you understand
how to do things a little better. And so we actually
have a learning methodology where of course, we're not going
to take the motors and move the legs, and so we have to Nunchuk
to give our robot muscle memory in terms of how to do dance moves. And then, lastly, is creativity. So, you might ask,
"Robots? Creativity? I don't get this. Why does the robot have to be creative?
What about creativity makes them smarter?" Well, creativity and imagination, those are the things
that allow us to create problems when we don't know how to attack it. They allow us to make
something out of nothing. I mean, if you look at the apps
that at out there and the tablets, and the iPads, and the iPhones,
and the Androids -- 20 years ago they didn't exist. So, how is it that we got from something
where there was nothing and expanded? It was our imagination.
It was our creativity. And these are the things
that allow us to figure out new things. And so, I have a robot that is creative, it plays piano, is a composer, and if you listen, it plays
"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star." (Music) So, all of this together, the last thing is interaction. So, you have a robot,
you want it to be your playmate, your teacher, your instructor, you want it to interact. And isn't it so cute? (Laughter) So, interaction is key, it is key to understanding
how to work in our world with us, and so the interaction piece
is very important. It deals with communication,
it deals with understanding, it deals with gaze,
it deals with attention. All of these things together
allow that interaction and our robots to be smart. And so these are just some of the tools that we use in order
to make robots smarter. So, I want to leave you with one thought. So, I'm all for robots and smart robots. I mean, that's what I do, I'd be out of a job
if I didn't believe in that. But yet, where does it end? How far do we push it? How far and how smart
should we make our smart robots? Thank you. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since Question 4 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide a more detailed analysis:

The ground truth MCQ is about mirroring, and the correct answer is "Reading a book that explains how to do physical tasks" (Option D). This question assesses the understanding of mirroring as a concept in robotics.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 is about giving robots muscle memory, which is related to mirroring. However, the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 4 is the closest, but with a caveat that it's not an exact match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4

Please note that the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new question that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ would be more accurate.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although the question itself does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, one of the options (A. Nunchuk) in Question 4 is related to the concept of muscle memory, which is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ. The speaker mentions using a Nunchuk to give robots muscle memory in terms of how to do dance moves, which is similar to the idea of muscle memory helping us learn to play a musical instrument.

However, it's worth noting that the generated MCQs do not have a direct match with the ground truth MCQ, and Question 4 is the closest one in terms of content and intent.

**Generated MCQ 9:** What is the speaker's approach to making robots learn and interact with humans? Options: A. Using machine learning, B. Using artificial intelligence, C. Observing humans and learning from them, D. Using a combination of the above Correct Option: D

This question implies that the speaker uses an interdisciplinary approach, which contradicts the statement in the ground truth MCQ.

Although there isn't a perfect match, I would say that **Generated MCQ 9** is the closest match, as it indirectly addresses the speaker's approach as being interdisciplinary.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The development and spread of railroads across the United States brought a wave of changes to American life. During the railroad boom, thousands of jobs were created, new towns were born, trade increased, transportation was faster, and the overall landscape of the nation transformed. But, perhaps the most interesting change of all is the least known: the establishment of standard time. Today, we know if it is 6:28 a.m. in Los Angeles, it is 9:28 a.m. in New York, 2:28 p.m. in London, 5:28 p.m. in Moscow, and 10:28 p.m in Tokyo. No matter where you are, the minute and second are the exact same. But, before the railroads, there was no need for a national or global clock, and each town kept its own local time. So when it was 12 noon in Chicago, it was 12:07 p.m. in Indianapolis, 11:50 a.m. in St. Louis, and 11:27 a.m. in Omaha. This worked just fine when the only modes of travel were horses or steamboats, but it became incredibly problematic when railroads came along. How can you keep a train schedule when each town has its own time? And how do you prevent collisions or accidents on the tracks if train conductors are using different clocks? It doesn't really make sense to leave a station at 12:14 p.m., travel for 22 minutes, and arrive at 12:31 p.m. In order to eliminate that confusion, the railroads of the United States and Canada instituted standard time zones on November 18, 1883 at noon. It allowed the railroad companies to operate more effectively and reduce deadly accidents. The American public, however, was not so quick to embrace this new change, as many cities continued to use their own local time. Resistance was so strong that, in some towns, clocks would show both the local time and the railway time. Imagine this conversation: "Pardon me, sir. Do you have the time?" "Why yes, which do you need? It's 12:13 local time and 12:16 railway time." Ultimately, the logic of keeping a standard time prevailed, and the United States government made time zones a matter of law with the Standard Time Act of March 19, 1918. Since then, there have been numerous changes to the time zones, but the concept of standard time has remained. But, the United States was actually not the first to develop standard time. The first company to implement the use of standard time was the Great Western Railway in 1840 in Britain, and by 1847, most British railways were using Greenwich Mean Time, or G.M.T. The British government made it official on August 2, 1880 with the Statutes, or Definition of Time, Act. But, while Britain may have been the first to establish standard time, it is Asia and the islands of the South Pacific that enjoyed the first hour of each new day. The International Date Line passes through the Pacific Ocean on the opposite side of the Earth from the Prime Meridian in Greenwich where, thanks to trains, standard time was first used. Trains have evolved over the years and remain a prominent form of transportation and trade throughout the world. And, from the New York City subways to the freight trains traveling across the Great Plains, to the trolleys in San Francisco, they all know exactly what time it is. And, thanks to them, we do too!

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it deals with the implementation of standard time in the United States.

However, since Question 3 does not specifically ask about the date of implementation, it is not a perfect match.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar generated MCQ, only because it mentions the result of the establishment of standard time in the United States, and the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ (November 18, 1883) is the date when the standard time was implemented, which is related to the result mentioned in Question 6.

However, please note that this is a very weak match, and it would be better to generate new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 6 (with a note that this is a very weak match)

This worked just fine when the only modes of travel were horses or steamboats, but it became incredibly problematic when railroads came along. How can you keep a train schedule when each town has its own time? And how do you prevent collisions or accidents on the tracks if train conductors are using different clocks? It doesn't really make sense to leave a station at 12:14 p.m., travel for 22 minutes, and arrive at 12:31 p.m. In order to eliminate that confusion, the railroads of the United States and Canada instituted standard time zones on November 18, 1883 at noon. It allowed the railroad companies to operate more effectively and reduce deadly accidents. The American public, however, was not so quick to embrace this new change, as many cities continued to use their own local time.

The first company to implement the use of standard time was the Great Western Railway in 1840 in Britain, and by 1847, most British railways were using Greenwich Mean Time, or G.M.T. The British government made it official on August 2, 1880 with the Statutes, or Definition of Time, Act. But, while Britain may have been the first to establish standard time, it is Asia and the islands of the South Pacific that enjoyed the first hour of each new day. The International Date Line passes through the Pacific Ocean on the opposite side of the Earth from the Prime Meridian in Greenwich where, thanks to trains, standard time was first used. Trains have evolved over the years and remain a prominent form of transportation and trade throughout the world. And, from the New York City subways to the freight trains traveling across the Great Plains, to the trolleys in San Francisco, they all know exactly what time it is. And, thanks to them, we do too!

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the area of the world that enjoys the first hour of the day. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 2 mentions the International Date Line and the Prime Meridian in the transcript, which is related to the concept of time zones and the first hour of the day.

However, a more relevant question is not available among the generated MCQs. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the most relevant, although it does not match the ground truth MCQ.

But since it is not a direct match I would say the answer is: None

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar How come some insects are able to walk on the surface of a pond, but you quickly sink to the bottom when you try to walk on water? And why do lakes freeze from the top down in winter? In a word, the answer to all these questions is polarity. Water is a simple molecule made up of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms, but it is essential to life. In fact, water makes up approximately 60% of the adult human being's body weight. The polarity within those water molecules gives this common substance the properties that make it unique and life-sustaining. Polarity refers to the unequal sharing of electrons within a molecule. For water, the bonding between the oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms within a single water molecule is like a tug-of-war between a big, strong football player and a cute little toddler. Oxygen is a larger atom, with more protons in its nucleus than hydrogen. These positive charges are like a person's physical strength. They're able to attract the negatively charged electrons in the bond, just like a strong individual is able to overpower a weaker individual in a tug of war. So, oxygen is able to attract more than its fair share of electrons. Because hydrogen is smaller and has less strength, or fewer protons, it loses the tug of war and attracts fewer than its fair share of electrons. So, the oxygen in water behaves as though it's negative, and the hydrogens behave as though they're positive. The bonds within a single water molecule are called polar covalent bonds. Covalent means that the electrons are shared. But, as we just learned, polar means that these electrons are not shared equally. In water, the oxygen acts negative and the hydrogens act positive. Since negative and positive attract, that oxygen is attracted to the hydrogen atoms in neighboring water molecules. A special type of bond forms between water molecules, known as a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds don't just happen in water either. They can form between a water molecule and different substances that are polar or ionic. Water's ability to stick to itself is called cohesion, while water's ability to stick to other substances is called adhesion. Now, think back to the initial questions. First, why are some insects able to walk on water? Surface tension due to hydrogen bonding creates a thin film on the surface of water that gives enough resistance for super-light insects to walk on. You can't walk on it because the hydrogen bonds aren't strong enough to hold you up. Why does ice float on top of liquid water? For most other substances, the solid state is more dense than the liquid state, but that is not the case for water! Hydrogen bonds keep water molecules farther apart in frozen water than in liquid water. The farther apart the molecules are, the less dense that solid is. So ice is about 9% less dense than water, which means it floats on the top. That's why lakes freeze from the top down and aquatic life is able to survive through a cold winter every year. It is the polarity of the water molecule and the resulting hydrogen bonding that account for water's unique properties. So, the reason that water is so special, from inside your cells to the world's oceans, is simply because it is a polar molecule.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 10. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the type of bond between oxygen and hydrogen atoms, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the definition of polarity.

A more accurate match would be a question that directly asks about the definition of polarity. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, among the given options, Question 10 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

But since question 10 does not match the ground truth question, a more suitable answer can be provided by analyzing each generated question. In this case, question 4 discusses polar covalent bonds and the unequal sharing of electrons, which is related to the concept of polarity.

So the final answer would be Question 4, as it is more closely related to the concept of polarity, although it is not a perfect match.

However, it is essential to note that the generated MCQs do not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about the definition of polarity.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar How come some insects are able to walk on the surface of a pond, but you quickly sink to the bottom when you try to walk on water? And why do lakes freeze from the top down in winter? In a word, the answer to all these questions is polarity. Water is a simple molecule made up of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms, but it is essential to life. In fact, water makes up approximately 60% of the adult human being's body weight. The polarity within those water molecules gives this common substance the properties that make it unique and life-sustaining. Polarity refers to the unequal sharing of electrons within a molecule. For water, the bonding between the oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms within a single water molecule is like a tug-of-war between a big, strong football player and a cute little toddler. Oxygen is a larger atom, with more protons in its nucleus than hydrogen. These positive charges are like a person's physical strength. They're able to attract the negatively charged electrons in the bond, just like a strong individual is able to overpower a weaker individual in a tug of war. So, oxygen is able to attract more than its fair share of electrons. Because hydrogen is smaller and has less strength, or fewer protons, it loses the tug of war and attracts fewer than its fair share of electrons. So, the oxygen in water behaves as though it's negative, and the hydrogens behave as though they're positive. The bonds within a single water molecule are called polar covalent bonds. Covalent means that the electrons are shared. But, as we just learned, polar means that these electrons are not shared equally. In water, the oxygen acts negative and the hydrogens act positive. Since negative and positive attract, that oxygen is attracted to the hydrogen atoms in neighboring water molecules. A special type of bond forms between water molecules, known as a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds don't just happen in water either. They can form between a water molecule and different substances that are polar or ionic. Water's ability to stick to itself is called cohesion, while water's ability to stick to other substances is called adhesion. Now, think back to the initial questions. First, why are some insects able to walk on water? Surface tension due to hydrogen bonding creates a thin film on the surface of water that gives enough resistance for super-light insects to walk on. You can't walk on it because the hydrogen bonds aren't strong enough to hold you up. Why does ice float on top of liquid water? For most other substances, the solid state is more dense than the liquid state, but that is not the case for water! Hydrogen bonds keep water molecules farther apart in frozen water than in liquid water. The farther apart the molecules are, the less dense that solid is. So ice is about 9% less dense than water, which means it floats on the top. That's why lakes freeze from the top down and aquatic life is able to survive through a cold winter every year. It is the polarity of the water molecule and the resulting hydrogen bonding that account for water's unique properties. So, the reason that water is so special, from inside your cells to the world's oceans, is simply because it is a polar molecule.

[Music] I want to talk to you today a little bit about the predictable irrationality and my interest in irrational behavior is started many years ago in hospital and I was burned very badly and if you spend a lot of time in hospital you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities and the one that particularly bothered me in the burned apartment was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me now you must have all taken a band-aid off at some point and you must have wondered what's the right approach do you rip it off quickly short duration but high intensity or do you take your bandage off slowly you take a long time but each second is not as painful which one of those is the right approach the nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one so they would grab hold and they would rip and they would grab hold and they would rip because I had 70% of my body burned it would take about an hour and as you can imagine I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity and I would try to reason with them and say why don't we try something else why don't we take it a little longer maybe two hours instead of an hour and have less of this intensity and the nurse just told me two things and they told me that they had the right model of the patient that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean to make suggestions or interfere or this is not just in Hebrew by the ways in every language I've had experience with so far and you know there's not much there wasn't much I could do and they kept on doing what what they were doing and about three years later when I left the hospital I started studying at the University and once the most interesting lessons I learned lessons it was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you cannot get create a replica of this question in some abstract way and you can try to examine this question maybe learn something about the world so that's what I I was still interested this question of how do you take bandages of burn patient so originally I didn't have much money so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vise and I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it and I would crunch it a little bit and I would crunch it for long periods and short periods that painted went up and when it went down and with breaks and without breaks all kinds of versions of pain and when I finished hurting people a little bit I would ask them so how painful was this oh how painful was this so if you had to choose between the last two which one would you choose I kept on doing this for a while and then like all good academic projects I got more funding I moved to sounds electrical shocks I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain but at the end of this process what I learned was that the nurses were wrong here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time it turns out that because we don't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower it turns out it would have been better to start with my face which was much more painful and moved toward my legs giving me a trend of improvement over time that would have been also less painful it also turns out would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain all of these would have been great things to do and my nurses had no idea and from that point on I started thinking are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision or is it more general case and it turns out it's a more general case there's a lot of mistakes we do and I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities and I want to talk to you about cheating and the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting but also it tells us something I think about the stock market situation we're in so my interest in cheating started when Enron came on the scene exploded all of a sudden started thinking about what is happening here is it the case that there is got a few apples who are capable of doing these things or are we talking about endemic situation that many people are actually capable of behaving this way so like we usually do I decide to do a simple experiment and here's how it went if you were in the experiment I would pass you a sheet of paper with twenty simple math problems that everybody could solve but I wouldn't give you enough time when the five minutes were over I would say pass me the sheets of paper and I'll pay you $1 per question people did this I would pay people four dollars for their task on average people would solve four problems other people I would tempt to cheat I would pass the sheet of paper when the five minutes are over I would say please shred the piece of paper put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack and tell me how many questions you got correctly people now solve seven questions on average now it wasn't as if there's a few bad apples a few people who did a lot instead what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit now in the economic theory cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis you say what's the probability of being caught how much do I stand to gain from cheating and how much punishment would I get if I get caught and you weigh these options are to do the simple cost-benefit analysis then you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not so we try to test this for some people we varied how much money they could get away with how much money they could steal we paid them ten cents per correct question 50 Cent's $1 $5 $10 per correct question you would expect it as the amount of money on the on the table increases people would cheat more but in fact it wasn't the case we got a lot of people cheating by still by a little bit what about the probability of being caught some people shredded half the sheet of paper so there was some evidence left some people shredded the whole sheet of paper some people shredded everything went out of the room and paid themselves on the ball of money that had over a hundred dollars you would expect it as the probability of being caught goes down people would cheat more but again this was not the case again a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit and they were uncensored to these economic consent so we said if people are not sensitive to the economic rationale theory explanations to these forces what could be going on and we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces at one hand we all want to look at yourself in the mirror and feel good about ourselves so we don't want to cheat and the other hand we could cheat a little bit and still feel good about ourselves so maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves we call this like a personal fudge factor now how would you test a personal fudge factor initially we said what can we do to shrink the fudge factor so we got people to the lab and we said we have two tasks for you today first we asked half the people to recall other ten books to read in high school or to recall the Ten Commandments and then we tempted them with cheating turns out the people who try to recall the Ten Commandments and in our sample nobody could recall the Ten Commandment but those people who tried to recall the Ten Commandments given the opportunity to cheat did not cheat at all it wasn't that the more religious people the people who remembered more of the commandment cheated less and the less religious people the people who could remember almost any commandment you did more the moment people thought about trying to recall the Ten Commandments they stopped cheating in fact even when we give self-declared atheists the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat they don't cheat at all now Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system so we said why don't we get people to sign the honor code so we got people to sign I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT honor code then this shredded it no cheating whatsoever and this is particularly interesting because MIT doesn't have an honor code so all this was about decreasing the fudge factor what about increasing the fudge factor the first experiment I walked around MIT and I distributed six packs of cokes in their refrigerators these were common refrigerators for the undergrads and I came back to measure what we technically called the half lifetime of coke how long does it last in the refrigerators and you can expect it doesn't last very long people take it in contrast I took a plate with six $1 bills and I left those plates in the same refrigerators no bill was ever disappeared now this is not a good social science experiment so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before a third of the people we pass the sheet they gave it back to us a third of the people we passed it they shredded it they came to us and said mr. experimenter I solved X problems give me X dollars a third of the people when they finish reading the piece of paper they came to us and said mr. experimenter I solved X problems give me X tokens we did not pay them with dollars we pay them with something else and then they took this something else they walked 12 feet to the side and exchanged it for dollars think about the following intuition how bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home compared to how bad would you feel about taking ten cents from a petty cash box these things feel very differently with being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference our subjects double their cheating I'll tell you what I think about this in stock market in a minute but this did not solve the big problem I had with anyone yet because in any one is also a social element people see each other behaving in fact every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating what does this causes us so we did another experiment we got the big group of students to be in the experiment and we prepaid them so everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment and we told them at the end we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make okay the same thing happens when we give people the opportunity to cheat they cheat that you just buy a little bit all the same but in this experiment we also higher than acting's to this acting student stood up after 30 seconds and said I solved everything what do I do now and the experimenter said if you finished everything go home that's it the task is finished so now we had a student an acting student that was a part of the group nobody knew there was though it was an actor and they clearly cheated in a very very serious way what would happen to the other people in the group will they cheat more or will they cheat less here is what happens it turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirts they are wearing here is the thing we ran this at a Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh and the Carnegie at Pittsburgh that two big universities Carnegie Mellon University of Pittsburgh all of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students when the actor was getting up was the Carnegie Mellon student pretty it was actually a con email student but he was a part of their group cheating went up but when he actually had the University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt cheating went down now this is important because remember when the moment the student stood up it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating because the experimenter said you finished everything go home and they worked with the money so it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again it was about the norms for cheating somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating we feel it's more appropriate as a group to behave this way but if it's somebody from another group these terrible people I mean not terrible in this but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with from another university another group office and people awareness of honesty goes up a little bit like the Ten Commandment experiment and people cheat even even less so what what have we learned from this about cheating we've learned that a lot of people can cheat they cheat just by a little bit when we remind people about the morality they cheat less when we get bigger distance from cheating from the object of money for example people cheat more and when we see things of cheating around us particularly if it's a part of our in-group cheating goes up now if we think about this in terms of the stock market think about what happens what happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way would they not be able to see it this way of course they would what happens when you do other things like you remove things from money you call them stock or stock option derivatives mortgage-backed securities could it be that with those more distant things it's not a token for one second it's something that these many steps removes for money for much longer time could it be but people would cheat even more and what happened to the social environment when people see other people behave around them I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market more generally I want to tell you something about behavioral economics we have many intuitions in our life and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong the question is are we going to test those intuitions we can think about how we're going to test this intuition in our private life in our business life and most particularly when it goes to policy when we think about things like No Child Left Behind when you create new stock markets when you create other policies taxation health care and so on and the difficulty of testing on intuition was was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them so I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages and I learned two interesting things one was that my favorite nurse Ettie told me that I did not take her pain into consideration she said of course you know it was very painful for you but think about me as a nurse taking removing the bandages of somebody I liked and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time creating so much torture was not something that was good for me - and she said maybe part of the reason what it was it was difficult for her which was actually more interesting than that because she said I did not think that your intuition was right I thought my intuition was correct so if you think about all of your intuitions think about it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong she said given the fact that I thought my intuition was right she thought her intuition was right it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong but the fact this is the situation we're all brawling all the time we have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things our own ability how the economy work how we should pay schoolteachers but unless we start testing those intuitions we're not going to do better and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition and how everything would have been better we would just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions thank you very much [Applause] what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's build a smarter planet

were uncensored to these economic consent so we said if people are not sensitive to the economic rationale theory explanations to these forces what could be going on and we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces at one hand we all want to look at yourself in the mirror and feel good about ourselves so we don't want to cheat and the other hand we could cheat a little bit and still feel good about ourselves so maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves we call this like a personal fudge factor now how would you test a personal fudge factor initially we said what can we do to shrink the fudge factor so we got people to the lab and we said we have two tasks for you today first we asked half the people to recall other ten books to read in high school or to recall the Ten Commandments and then we tempted them with cheating turns out the people who try to recall the Ten Commandments and in our sample nobody could recall the Ten Commandment but those people who tried to recall the Ten Commandments given the opportunity to cheat did not cheat at all it wasn't that the more religious people the people who remembered more of the commandment cheated less and the less religious people the people who could remember almost any commandment you did more the moment people thought about trying to recall the Ten Commandments they stopped cheating in fact even when we give self-declared atheists the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat they don't cheat at all now Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system so we said why don't we get people to sign the honor code so we got people to sign I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT honor code then this shredded it no cheating whatsoever and this is particularly interesting because MIT doesn't have an honor code so all this was about decreasing the fudge factor what about increasing the fudge factor the first experiment I walked around MIT and I distributed six packs of cokes in their refrigerators these were common refrigerators for the undergrads and I came back to measure what we technically called the half lifetime of coke how long does it last in the refrigerators and you can expect it doesn't last very long people take it in contrast I took a plate with six $1 bills and I left those plates in the same refrigerators no bill was ever disappeared now this is not a good social science experiment so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before a third of the people we pass the sheet they gave it back to us a third of the people we passed it they shredded it they came to us and said mr. experimenter I solved X problems give me X dollars a third of the people when they finish reading the piece of paper they came to us and said mr. experimenter I solved X problems give me X tokens we did not pay them with dollars we pay them with something else and then they took this something else they walked 12 feet to the side and exchanged it for dollars think about the following intuition how bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home compared to how bad would you feel about taking ten cents from a petty cash box these things feel very differently with being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference our subjects double their cheating I'll tell you what I think about this in stock market in a minute but this did not solve the big problem I had with anyone yet because in any one is also a social element people see each other behaving in fact every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating what does this causes us so we did another experiment we got the big group of students to be in the experiment and we prepaid them so everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment and we told them at the end we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make okay the same thing happens when we give people the opportunity to cheat they cheat that you just buy a little bit all the same but in this experiment we also higher than acting's to this acting student stood up after 30 seconds and said I solved everything what do I do now and the experimenter said if you finished everything go home that's it the task is finished so now we had a student an acting student that was a part of the group nobody knew there was though it was an actor and they clearly cheated in a very very serious way what would happen to the other people in the group will they cheat more or will they cheat less here is what happens it turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirts they are wearing here is the thing we ran this at a Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh and the Carnegie at Pittsburgh that two big universities Carnegie Mellon University of Pittsburgh all of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students when the actor was getting up was the Carnegie Mellon student pretty it was actually a con email student but he was a part of their group cheating went up but when he actually had the University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt cheating went down now this is important because remember when the moment the student stood up it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating because the experimenter said you finished everything go home and they worked with the money so it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again it was about the norms for cheating somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating we feel it's more appropriate as a group to behave this way but if it's somebody from another group these terrible people I mean not terrible in this but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with from another university another group office and people awareness of honesty goes up a little bit like the Ten Commandment experiment and people cheat even even less so what what have we learned from this about cheating we've learned that a lot of people can cheat they cheat just by a little bit when we remind people about the morality they cheat less when we get bigger distance from cheating from the object of money for example people cheat more and when we see things of cheating around us particularly if it's a part of our in-group cheating goes up now if we think about this in terms of the stock market think about what happens what happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way would they not be able to see it this way of course they would what happens when you do other things like you remove things from money you call them stock or stock option derivatives mortgage-backed securities could it be that with those more distant things it's not a token for one second it's something that these many steps removes for money for much longer time could it be but people would cheat even more and what happened to the social environment when people see other people behave around them I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market more generally I want to tell you something about behavioral economics we have many intuitions in our life and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong the question is are we going to test those intuitions we can think about how we're going to test this intuition in our private life in our business life and most particularly when it goes to policy when we think about things like No Child Left Behind when you create new stock markets when you create other policies taxation health care and so on and the difficulty of testing on intuition was was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them so I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages and I learned two interesting things one was that my favorite nurse Ettie told me that I did not take her pain into consideration she said of course you know it was very painful for you but think about me as a nurse taking removing the bandages of somebody I liked and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time creating so much torture was not something that was good for me - and she said maybe part of the reason what it was it was difficult for her which was actually more interesting than that because she said I did not think that your intuition was right I thought my intuition was correct so if you think about all of your intuitions think about it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong she said given the fact that I thought my intuition was right she thought her intuition was right it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong but the fact this is the situation we're all brawling all the time we have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things our own ability how the economy work how we should pay schoolteachers but unless we start testing those intuitions we're not going to do better and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition and how everything would have been better we would just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions thank you very much [Applause] what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's build a smarter planet

The most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

This question matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. Both questions are asking about the speaker's motivation for studying the process of removing bandages from burn patients, and both have options that relate to the speaker's personal experience and interest in the topic. 

However, since the ground truth MCQ specifically asks about the experiment carried out by Ariely due to his interest in how to remove bandages from burn patients, a more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the experiment.

A more accurate match would be:
Question 2: According to the speaker, what was the result of his experiment on removing bandages from burn patients? 

But since this question is asking about the result of the experiment, not the experiment itself, it's not a perfect match.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 1, but I would like to note that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
[Music] I want to talk to you today a little bit about the predictable irrationality and my interest in irrational behavior is started many years ago in hospital and I was burned very badly and if you spend a lot of time in hospital you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities and the one that particularly bothered me in the burned apartment was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me now you must have all taken a band-aid off at some point and you must have wondered what's the right approach do you rip it off quickly short duration but high intensity or do you take your bandage off slowly you take a long time but each second is not as painful which one of those is the right approach the nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one so they would grab hold and they would rip and they would grab hold and they would rip because I had 70% of my body burned it would take about an hour and as you can imagine I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity and I would try to reason with them and say why don't we try something else why don't we take it a little longer maybe two hours instead of an hour and have less of this intensity and the nurse just told me two things and they told me that they had the right model of the patient that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean to make suggestions or interfere or this is not just in Hebrew by the ways in every language I've had experience with so far and you know there's not much there wasn't much I could do and they kept on doing what what they were doing and about three years later when I left the hospital I started studying at the University and once the most interesting lessons I learned lessons it was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you cannot get create a replica of this question in some abstract way and you can try to examine this question maybe learn something about the world so that's what I I was still interested this question of how do you take bandages of burn patient so originally I didn't have much money so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vise and I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it and I would crunch it a little bit and I would crunch it for long periods and short periods that painted went up and when it went down and with breaks and without breaks all kinds of versions of pain and when I finished hurting people a little bit I would ask them so how painful was this oh how painful was this so if you had to choose between the last two which one would you choose I kept on doing this for a while and then like all good academic projects I got more funding I moved to sounds electrical shocks I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain but at the end of this process what I learned was that the nurses were wrong here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time it turns out that because we don't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower it turns out it would have been better to start with my face which was much more painful and moved toward my legs giving me a trend of improvement over time that would have been also less painful it also turns out would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain all of these would have been great things to do and my nurses had no idea and from that point on I started thinking are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision or is it more general case and it turns out it's a more general case there's a lot of mistakes we do and I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities and I want to talk to you about cheating and the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting but also it tells us something I think about the stock market situation we're in so my interest in cheating started when Enron came on the scene exploded all of a sudden started thinking about what is happening here is it the case that there is got a few apples who are capable of doing these things or are we talking about endemic situation that many people are actually capable of behaving this way so like we usually do I decide to do a simple experiment and here's how it went if you were in the experiment I would pass you a sheet of paper with twenty simple math problems that everybody could solve but I wouldn't give you enough time when the five minutes were over I would say pass me the sheets of paper and I'll pay you $1 per question people did this I would pay people four dollars for their task on average people would solve four problems other people I would tempt to cheat I would pass the sheet of paper when the five minutes are over I would say please shred the piece of paper put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack and tell me how many questions you got correctly people now solve seven questions on average now it wasn't as if there's a few bad apples a few people who did a lot instead what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit now in the economic theory cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis you say what's the probability of being caught how much do I stand to gain from cheating and how much punishment would I get if I get caught and you weigh these options are to do the simple cost-benefit analysis then you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not so we try to test this for some people we varied how much money they could get away with how much money they could steal we paid them ten cents per correct question 50 Cent's $1 $5 $10 per correct question you would expect it as the amount of money on the on the table increases people would cheat more but in fact it wasn't the case we got a lot of people cheating by still by a little bit what about the probability of being caught some people shredded half the sheet of paper so there was some evidence left some people shredded the whole sheet of paper some people shredded everything went out of the room and paid themselves on the ball of money that had over a hundred dollars you would expect it as the probability of being caught goes down people would cheat more but again this was not the case again a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit and they were uncensored to these economic consent so we said if people are not sensitive to the economic rationale theory explanations to these forces what could be going on and we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces at one hand we all want to look at yourself in the mirror and feel good about ourselves so we don't want to cheat and the other hand we could cheat a little bit and still feel good about ourselves so maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves we call this like a personal fudge factor now how would you test a personal fudge factor initially we said what can we do to shrink the fudge factor so we got people to the lab and we said we have two tasks for you today first we asked half the people to recall other ten books to read in high school or to recall the Ten Commandments and then we tempted them with cheating turns out the people who try to recall the Ten Commandments and in our sample nobody could recall the Ten Commandment but those people who tried to recall the Ten Commandments given the opportunity to cheat did not cheat at all it wasn't that the more religious people the people who remembered more of the commandment cheated less and the less religious people the people who could

**Transcript**:
[Music] I want to talk to you today a little bit about the predictable irrationality and my interest in irrational behavior is started many years ago in hospital and I was burned very badly and if you spend a lot of time in hospital you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities and the one that particularly bothered me in the burned apartment was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me now you must have all taken a band-aid off at some point and you must have wondered what's the right approach do you rip it off quickly short duration but high intensity or do you take your bandage off slowly you take a long time but each second is not as painful which one of those is the right approach the nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one so they would grab hold and they would rip and they would grab hold and they would rip because I had 70% of my body burned it would take about an hour and as you can imagine I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity and I would try to reason with them and say why don't we try something else why don't we take it a little longer maybe two hours instead of an hour and have less of this intensity and the nurse just told me two things and they told me that they had the right model of the patient that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean to make suggestions or interfere or this is not just in Hebrew by the ways in every language I've had experience with so far and you know there's not much there wasn't much I could do and they kept on doing what what they were doing and about three years later when I left the hospital I started studying at the University and once the most interesting lessons I learned lessons it was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you cannot get create a replica of this question in some abstract way and you can try to examine this question maybe learn something about the world so that's what I I was still interested this question of how do you take bandages of burn patient so originally I didn't have much money so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vise and I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it and I would crunch it a little bit and I would crunch it for long periods and short periods that painted went up and when it went down and with breaks and without breaks all kinds of versions of pain and when I finished hurting people a little bit I would ask them so how painful was this oh how painful was this so if you had to choose between the last two which one would you choose I kept on doing this for a while and then like all good academic projects I got more funding I moved to sounds electrical shocks I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain but at the end of this process what I learned was that the nurses were wrong here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time it turns out that because we don't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower it turns out it would have been better to start with my face which was much more painful and moved toward my legs giving me a trend of improvement over time that would have been also less painful it also turns out would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain all of these would have been great things to do and my nurses had no idea and from that point on I started thinking are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision or is it more general case and it turns out it's a more general case there's a lot of mistakes we do and I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities and I want to talk to you about cheating and the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting but also it tells us something I think about the stock market situation we're in so my interest in cheating started when Enron came on the scene exploded all of a sudden started thinking about what is happening here is it the case that there is got a few apples who are capable of doing these things or are we talking about endemic situation that many people are actually capable of behaving this way so like we usually do I decide to do a simple experiment and here's how it went if you were in the experiment I would pass you a sheet of paper with twenty simple math problems that everybody could solve but I wouldn't give you enough time when the five minutes were over I would say pass me the sheets of paper and I'll pay you $1 per question people did this I would pay people four dollars for their task on average people would solve four problems other people I would tempt to cheat I would pass the sheet of paper when the five minutes are over I would say please shred the piece of paper put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack and tell me how many questions you got correctly people now solve seven questions on average now it wasn't as if there's a few bad apples a few people who did a lot instead what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit now in the economic theory cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis you say what's the probability of being caught how much do I stand to gain from cheating and how much punishment would I get if I get caught and you weigh these options are to do the simple cost-benefit analysis then you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not so we try to test this for some people we varied how much money they could get away with how much money they could steal we paid them ten cents per correct question 50 Cent's $1 $5 $10 per correct question you would expect it as the amount of money on the on the table increases people would cheat more but in fact it wasn't the case we got a lot of people cheating by still by a little bit what about the probability of being caught some people shredded half the sheet of paper so there was some evidence left some people shredded the whole sheet of paper some people shredded everything went out of the room and paid themselves on the ball of money that had over a hundred dollars you would expect it as the probability of being caught goes down people would cheat more but again this was not the case again a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit and they were uncensored to these economic consent so we said if people are not sensitive to the economic rationale theory explanations to these forces what could be going on and we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces at one hand we all want to look at yourself in the mirror and feel good about ourselves so we don't want to cheat and the other hand we could cheat a little bit and still feel good about ourselves so maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves we call this like a personal fudge factor now how would you test a personal fudge factor initially we said what can we do to shrink the fudge factor so we got people to the lab and we said we have two tasks for you today first we asked half the people to recall other ten books to read in high school or to recall the Ten Commandments and then we tempted them with cheating turns out the people who try to recall the Ten Commandments and in our sample nobody could recall the Ten Commandment but those people who tried to recall the Ten Commandments given the opportunity to cheat did not cheat at all it wasn't that the more religious people the people who remembered more of the commandment cheated less and the less religious people the people who could remember almost any commandment you did more the moment people thought about trying to recall the Ten Commandments they stopped cheating in fact even when we give self-declared atheists the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat they don't cheat at all now Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system so we said why don't we get people to sign the honor code so we got people to sign I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT honor code then this shredded it no cheating whatsoever and this is particularly interesting because MIT doesn't have an honor code so all this was about decreasing the fudge factor what about increasing the fudge factor the first experiment I walked around MIT and I distributed six packs of cokes in their refrigerators these were common refrigerators for the undergrads and I came back to measure what we technically called the half lifetime of coke how long does it last in the refrigerators and you can expect it doesn't last very long people take it in contrast I took a plate with six $1 bills and I left those plates in the same refrigerators no bill was ever disappeared now this is not a good social science experiment so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before a third of the people we pass the sheet they gave it back to us a third of the people we passed it they shredded it they came to us and said mr. experimenter I solved X problems give me X dollars a third of the people when they finish reading the piece of paper they came to us and said mr. experimenter I solved X problems give me X tokens we did not pay them with dollars we pay them with something else and then they took this something else they walked 12 feet to the side and exchanged it for dollars think about the following intuition how bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home compared to how bad would you feel about taking ten cents from a petty cash box these things feel very differently with being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference our subjects double their cheating I'll tell you what I think about this in stock market in a minute but this did not solve the big problem I had with anyone yet because in any one is also a social element people see each other behaving in fact every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating what does this causes us so we did another experiment we got the big group of students to be in the experiment and we prepaid them so everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment and we told them at the end we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make okay the same thing happens when we give people the opportunity to cheat they cheat that you just buy a little bit all the same but in this experiment we also higher than acting's to this acting student stood up after 30 seconds and said I solved everything what do I do now and the experimenter said if you finished everything go home that's it the task is finished so now we had a student an acting student that was a part of the group nobody knew there was though it was an actor and they clearly cheated in a very very serious way what would happen to the other people in the group will they cheat more or will they cheat less here is what happens it turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirts they are wearing here is the thing we ran this at a Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh and the Carnegie at Pittsburgh that two big universities Carnegie Mellon University of Pittsburgh all of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students when the actor was getting up was the Carnegie Mellon student pretty it was actually a con email student but he was a part of their group cheating went up but when he actually had the University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt cheating went down now this is important because remember when the moment the student stood up it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating because the experimenter said you finished everything go home and they worked with the money so it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again it was about the norms for cheating somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating we feel it's more appropriate as a group to behave this way but if it's somebody from another group these terrible people I mean not terrible in this but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with from another university another group office and people awareness of honesty goes up a little bit like the Ten Commandment experiment and people cheat even even less so what what have we learned from this about cheating we've learned that a lot of people can cheat they cheat just by a little bit when we remind people about the morality they cheat less when we get bigger distance from cheating from the object of money for example people cheat more and when we see things of cheating around us particularly if it's a part of our in-group cheating goes up now if we think about this in terms of the stock market think about what happens what happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way would they not be able to see it this way of course they would what happens when you do other things like you remove things from money you call them stock or stock option derivatives mortgage-backed securities could it be that with those more distant things it's not a token for one second it's something that these many steps removes for money for much longer time could it be but people would cheat even more and what happened to the social environment when people see other people behave around them I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market more generally I want to tell you something about behavioral economics we have many intuitions in our life and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong the question is are we going to test those intuitions we can think about how we're going to test this intuition in our private life in our business life and most particularly when it goes to policy when we think about things like No Child Left Behind when you create new stock markets when you create other policies taxation health care and so on and the difficulty of testing on intuition was was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them so I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages and I learned two interesting things one was that my favorite nurse Ettie told me that I did not take her pain into consideration she said of course you know it was very painful for you but think about me as a nurse taking removing the bandages of somebody I liked and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time creating so much torture was not something that was good for me - and she said maybe part of the reason what it was it was difficult for her which was actually more interesting than that because she said I did not think that your intuition was right I thought my intuition was correct so if you think about all of your intuitions think about it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong she said given the fact that I thought my intuition was right she thought her intuition was right it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong but the fact this is the situation we're all brawling all the time we have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things our own ability how the economy work how we should pay schoolteachers but unless we start testing those intuitions we're not going to do better and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition and how everything would have been better we would just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions thank you very much [Applause] what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's build a smarter planet

she thought her intuition was right it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong but the fact this is the situation we're all brawling all the time we have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things our own ability how the economy work how we should pay schoolteachers but unless we start testing those intuitions we're not going to do better and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition and how everything would have been better we would just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions thank you very much [Applause] what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's build a smarter planet

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] in his inaugural address Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis but what did he appeal to he did not happily follow in the footsteps of his predecessor and tell us to just go shopping nor did he tell us trust us trust your country invest invest invest instead what he told us was to put aside childish things and he appealed to virtue virtue is an old-fashioned word it seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one and besides some of you might be wondering what the hell does it mean let me begin with an example these are this is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen and all of the items on it are unremarkable they're the things you would expect mop the floors sweep them empty the trash restock the cabinets it may be a little surprising how many things there are but it's not surprising what they are but the one thing I want you to notice about them is this even though this is a very long list there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings not one the janitors job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital and yet when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like they encountered Mike who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise trying to build up his strength walking slowly up and down the hall and Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisors admonition didn't vacuum the visitors lounge because there were some family members who were there all day every day who at this moment happened to be taking a nap and then there was Luke who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice because the man's father who had been keeping a vigil for six months didn't see Luke do it the first time and his father was angry and behavior like this from janitors from technicians from nurses and if we're lucky every now and then from doctors doesn't just make people feel a little better it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well now not all janitors are like this of course but the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness care and empathy are an essential part of the job and yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings these janitors have the moral will to do right by other people and beyond this they have the moral skill to figure out what doing right means practical wisdom Aristotle told us is the combination of moral will and moral skill a wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule as the janitors knew when to ignore their job duties in the service of other objectives a wise person knows how to improvise as Luke did when he rewashed the floor real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined and the context is always changing a wise person is like a jazz musician using the notes on the page but dancing around them inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand a wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims to serve other people not to manipulate other people and finally perhaps most important a wise person is made not born wisdom depends on experience and not just any experience you need the time to get to know the people that you're serving you need permission to be allowed to improvise to try new things occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures and you need to be mentored by wise teachers when you ask the janitors who behave like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their jobs they tell you that it takes lots of experience and they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans it takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people at Ted brilliance is rampant it's scary the good news is that you don't need to be brilliant to be wise the bad news is that without wisdom brilliance isn't enough it's as likely to get you into trouble and other people into trouble as anything else now I hope that we all know this there's a sense in which it's obvious and yet let me tell you a little story it's a story about lemonade a dad and his 11 year old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark his son asked him for some lemonade and dad went to the concession stand to buy it all they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade which was 5% alcohol dad being an academic had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade was it contained out at all so we brought it back and the kid was drinking it and a security guard spotted it and called the police who called an ambulance they rushed to the ballpark whisked the kid to the hospital the emergency room to ascertain that the kid had no alcohol in his blood and they were ready to let the kid go but not so fast the Wayne County Child Welfare protective agency said oh and the child was sent to a foster home for three days at that point can the child go home well a judge said yes but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel after two weeks I'm happy to report the family was reunited but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure how do things like this happen Scott Simon who told this story on NPR said rules and procedures may be dumb but they spare you from thinking and to be fair and to be fair rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lacks and they let a child go back to an abusive household fair enough when things go wrong as of course they do we reach for two tools to try to fix them one tool we reach for is rules better ones more of them the second tool we reach for is incentives better ones more of them what else after all is there we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis regulate regulate regulate fix the incentives fix the incentives fix the incentives the truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job how could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did and would you pay them a bonus for being empathic it's preposterous on its face and what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules rules and incentives may make things better in the short run but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run moral skill is chipped away by an over reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisation and moral will is on mind by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing and without intending it by appealing to rules and incentives we are engaging in a war on wisdom let me just give you a few example first of rules and the war on moral skill the lemonade story is one second no doubt more familiar to you is the nature of modern American education scripted lockstep curriculum here's an example from Chicago kindergarten reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with B the baths assemble students on a rug give students a warning about the dangers of hot water say 75 items in this script to teach a 25 page picture book all over Chicago and every kindergarten class in the city every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day we know why these scripts are there we don't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster and they prevent disaster but what they assure in its place is mediocrity don't get me wrong we need rules jazz musicians need some notes most of them need some notes on the page we need more rules for the bankers god knows but too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising and as a result they lose their gifts or worse they stop playing all together now how about incentives they seem clever if you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it right well not always sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complementing and they make people less likely to do it I'll just give you one example because time is racing in Switzerland back in about 15 years ago they were trying to decide where to cite nuclear waste dumps there was going to be a national referendum and some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed and they said would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community astonishingly 50% of the citizens said yes they knew it or thought it was dangerous they thought it would reduce their property values but it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens the psychologists asked other people a slightly different question they said if we paid you six weeks salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community two reasons it's my responsibility and I'm getting paid instead of 50% saying yes 25% said yes what happens is that the second this introduction of the incentive gets us so that instead of asking what are my responsibilities all we ask is what serves my interests when incentives don't work when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses the response is always the same get smarter incentives the truth is that there are no incentives you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough any incentive system can be subverted by bad will we need incentives people have to make a living but excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word it causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality Barack Obama said before he was inaugurated we must ask not just as it profitable but is it right and when professions are demoralized everyone in them becomes dependent on addicted to incentives and they stop asking is it right we see this in medicine and we certainly see it in the world of business it is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work so what can we do a few sources of hope we ought to try to Reem oral eyes work one way not to do it teach more ethics courses there is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course what to do instead one celebrate moral exemplars acknowledge when you go to law school that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch no ten-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions people are inspired by moral heroes but we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes well acknowledge them be proud that you have them celebrate them and demand that the people who teach you acknowledge and celebrate them too that's one thing we can do I don't know how many of you remember this another moral hero 15 years ago Aaron Feuerstein who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts they made Polartec the factory burned down 3,000 employees he kept every one of them on the payroll why because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go maybe on paper our company's worthless to Wall Street but I can tell you it's worth more we are doing fine just that this Ted we heard talks from several moral heroes to particularly inspiring to me one was Ray Anderson who turned you know turned you know a part of the evil empire into a zero footprint or almost a zero footprint business why because it was the right thing to do and a bonus he's discovering is he's actually gonna make even more money his employees are inspired by the effort why because they're happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do yesterday we heard willie smith's talk about reforesting in indonesia and in many ways this is the perfect example because it took the will to do the right thing and god knows it took a huge amount of technical skill I bottle that how much he needed to know in order and his associates in order to plot this out but most important to make it work and he emphasized this is that it took knowing the people in the communities unless the people you're working with our support are behind you this will fail and there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways so there's a lot here at Ed and at other places to celebrate and you don't have to be a mega hero there are ordinary heroes ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too as practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary if not extraordinary heroes as heads of organizations we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work if you run an organization you should be sure that none of the jobs none of the jobs have job descriptions like the job description of the janitors because the truth is that any work you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom and perhaps most important as teachers we should strive to be the ordinary heroes the moral exemplars to the people we mentor and there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers one is that we are always teaching someone is always watching the camera is always on Bill Gates talked about the importance of education and in particular the model that Kipp was providing knowledge is power and he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that Kipp is doing to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college I want to focus on one particular thing Kipp is doing that bill didn't mention and that is they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character they need to learn to respect themselves they need to learn to respect their schoolmates they need to learn to respect their teachers and most important they need to learn to respect learning that's the principal objective if you do that the rest is just pretty much a Coast downhill and the teachers the way you teach these things to kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day Obama appealed to virtue and I think he was right and the virtue that we need above all others I think is practical wisdom because it's what allows other virtues honesty kindness courage and so on to be displayed at the right time and in the right way he also appealed to hope right again I think there is reason for hope I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous in many ways it's what Ted is all about wanting to do the right thing in the white right way for the right reasons this kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention paying attention to what we do to how we do it and perhaps most importantly to the structure of the organizations within which we work so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than rather than having it suppressed thank you very much thank you if you have to go east on that side thank you very much what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're

the world of business it is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work so what can we do a few sources of hope we ought to try to Reem oral eyes work one way not to do it teach more ethics courses there is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course what to do instead one celebrate moral exemplars acknowledge when you go to law school that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch no ten-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions people are inspired by moral heroes but we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes well acknowledge them be proud that you have them celebrate them and demand that the people who teach you acknowledge and celebrate them too that's one thing we can do I don't know how many of you remember this another moral hero 15 years ago Aaron Feuerstein who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts they made Polartec the factory burned down 3,000 employees he kept every one of them on the payroll why because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go maybe on paper our company's worthless to Wall Street but I can tell you it's worth more we are doing fine just that this Ted we heard talks from several moral heroes to particularly inspiring to me one was Ray Anderson who turned you know turned you know a part of the evil empire into a zero footprint or almost a zero footprint business why because it was the right thing to do and a bonus he's discovering is he's actually gonna make even more money his employees are inspired by the effort why because they're happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do yesterday we heard willie smith's talk about reforesting in indonesia and in many ways this is the perfect example because it took the will to do the right thing and god knows it took a huge amount of technical skill I bottle that how much he needed to know in order and his associates in order to plot this out but most important to make it work and he emphasized this is that it took knowing the people in the communities unless the people you're working with our support are behind you this will fail and there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways so there's a lot here at Ed and at other places to celebrate and you don't have to be a mega hero there are ordinary heroes ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too as practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary if not extraordinary heroes as heads of organizations we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work if you run an organization you should be sure that none of the jobs none of the jobs have job descriptions like the job description of the janitors because the truth is that any work you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom and perhaps most important as teachers we should strive to be the ordinary heroes the moral exemplars to the people we mentor and there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers one is that we are always teaching someone is always watching the camera is always on Bill Gates talked about the importance of education and in particular the model that Kipp was providing knowledge is power and he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that Kipp is doing to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college I want to focus on one particular thing Kipp is doing that bill didn't mention and that is they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character they need to learn to respect themselves they need to learn to respect their schoolmates they need to learn to respect their teachers and most important they need to learn to respect learning that's the principal objective if you do that the rest is just pretty much a Coast downhill and the teachers the way you teach these things to kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day Obama appealed to virtue and I think he was right and the virtue that we need above all others I think is practical wisdom because it's what allows other virtues honesty kindness courage and so on to be displayed at the right time and in the right way he also appealed to hope right again I think there is reason for hope I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous in many ways it's what Ted is all about wanting to do the right thing in the white right way for the right reasons this kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention paying attention to what we do to how we do it and perhaps most importantly to the structure of the organizations within which we work so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than rather than having it suppressed thank you very much thank you if you have to go east on that side thank you very much what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBMer let's build a smarter planet

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] in his inaugural address Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis but what did he appeal to he did not happily follow in the footsteps of his predecessor and tell us to just go shopping nor did he tell us trust us trust your country invest invest invest instead what he told us was to put aside childish things and he appealed to virtue virtue is an old-fashioned word it seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one and besides some of you might be wondering what the hell does it mean let me begin with an example these are this is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen and all of the items on it are unremarkable they're the things you would expect mop the floors sweep them empty the trash restock the cabinets it may be a little surprising how many things there are but it's not surprising what they are but the one thing I want you to notice about them is this even though this is a very long list there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings not one the janitors job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital and yet when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like they encountered Mike who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise trying to build up his strength walking slowly up and down the hall and Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisors admonition didn't vacuum the visitors lounge because there were some family members who were there all day every day who at this moment happened to be taking a nap and then there was Luke who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice because the man's father who had been keeping a vigil for six months didn't see Luke do it the first time and his father was angry and behavior like this from janitors from technicians from nurses and if we're lucky every now and then from doctors doesn't just make people feel a little better it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well now not all janitors are like this of course but the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness care and empathy are an essential part of the job and yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings these janitors have the moral will to do right by other people and beyond this they have the moral skill to figure out what doing right means practical wisdom Aristotle told us is the combination of moral will and moral skill a wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule as the janitors knew when to ignore their job duties in the service of other objectives a wise person knows how to improvise as Luke did when he rewashed the floor real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined and the context is always changing a wise person is like a jazz musician using the notes on the page but dancing around them inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand a wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims to serve other people not to manipulate other people and finally perhaps most important a wise person is made not born wisdom depends on experience and not just any experience you need the time to get to know the people that you're serving you need permission to be allowed to improvise to try new things occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures and you need to be mentored by wise teachers when you ask the janitors who behave like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their jobs they tell you that it takes lots of experience and they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans it takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people at Ted brilliance is rampant it's scary the good news is that you don't need to be brilliant to be wise the bad news is that without wisdom brilliance isn't enough it's as likely to get you into trouble and other people into trouble as anything else now I hope that we all know this there's a sense in which it's obvious and yet let me tell you a little story it's a story about lemonade a dad and his 11 year old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark his son asked him for some lemonade and dad went to the concession stand to buy it all they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade which was 5% alcohol dad being an academic had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade was it contained out at all so we brought it back and the kid was drinking it and a security guard spotted it and called the police who called an ambulance they rushed to the ballpark whisked the kid to the hospital the emergency room to ascertain that the kid had no alcohol in his blood and they were ready to let the kid go but not so fast the Wayne County Child Welfare protective agency said oh and the child was sent to a foster home for three days at that point can the child go home well a judge said yes but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel after two weeks I'm happy to report the family was reunited but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure how do things like this happen Scott Simon who told this story on NPR said rules and procedures may be dumb but they spare you from thinking and to be fair and to be fair rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lacks and they let a child go back to an abusive household fair enough when things go wrong as of course they do we reach for two tools to try to fix them one tool we reach for is rules better ones more of them the second tool we reach for is incentives better ones more of them what else after all is there we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis regulate regulate regulate fix the incentives fix the incentives fix the incentives the truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job how could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did and would you pay them a bonus for being empathic it's preposterous on its face and what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules rules and incentives may make things better in the short run but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run moral skill is chipped away by an over reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisation and moral will is on mind by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing and without intending it by appealing to rules and incentives we are engaging in a war on wisdom let me just give you a few example first of rules and the war on moral skill the lemonade story is one second no doubt more familiar to you is the nature of modern American education scripted lockstep curriculum here's an example from Chicago kindergarten reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with B the baths assemble students on a rug give students a warning about the dangers of hot water say 75 items in this script to teach a 25 page picture book all over Chicago and every kindergarten class in the city every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day we know why these scripts are there we don't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster and they prevent disaster but what they assure in its place is mediocrity don't get me wrong we need rules jazz musicians need some notes most of them need some notes on the page we need more rules for the bankers god knows but too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising and as a result they lose their gifts or worse they stop playing all together now how about incentives they seem clever if you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it right well not always sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complementing and they make people less likely to do it I'll just give you one example because time is racing in Switzerland back in about 15 years ago they were trying to decide where to cite nuclear waste dumps there was going to be a national referendum and some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed and they said would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community astonishingly 50% of the citizens said yes they knew it or thought it was dangerous they thought it would reduce their property values but it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens the psychologists asked other people a slightly different question they said if we paid you six weeks salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community two reasons it's my responsibility and I'm getting paid instead of 50% saying yes 25% said yes what happens is that the second this introduction of the incentive gets us so that instead of asking what are my responsibilities all we ask is what serves my interests when incentives don't work when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses the response is always the same get smarter incentives the truth is that there are no incentives you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough any incentive system can be subverted by bad will we need incentives people have to make a living but excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word it causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality Barack Obama said before he was inaugurated we must ask not just as it profitable but is it right and when professions are demoralized everyone in them becomes dependent on addicted to incentives and they stop asking is it right we see this in medicine and we certainly see it in the world of business it is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work so what can we do a few sources of hope we ought to try to Reem oral eyes work one way not to do it teach more ethics courses there is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course what to do instead one celebrate moral exemplars acknowledge when you go to law school that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch no ten-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions people are inspired by moral heroes but we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes well

dad leaves the house and checks into a motel after two weeks I'm happy to report the family was reunited but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure how do things like this happen Scott Simon who told this story on NPR said rules and procedures may be dumb but they spare you from thinking and to be fair and to be fair rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lacks and they let a child go back to an abusive household fair enough when things go wrong as of course they do we reach for two tools to try to fix them one tool we reach for is rules better ones more of them the second tool we reach for is incentives better ones more of them what else after all is there we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis regulate regulate regulate fix the incentives fix the incentives fix the incentives the truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job how could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did and would you pay them a bonus for being empathic it's preposterous on its face and what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules rules and incentives may make things better in the short run but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run moral skill is chipped away by an over reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisation and moral will is on mind by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing and without intending it by appealing to rules and incentives we are engaging in a war on wisdom let me just give you a few example first of rules and the war on moral skill the lemonade story is one second no doubt more familiar to you is the nature of modern American education scripted lockstep curriculum here's an example from Chicago kindergarten reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with B the baths assemble students on a rug give students a warning about the dangers of hot water say 75 items in this script to teach a 25 page picture book all over Chicago and every kindergarten class in the city every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day we know why these scripts are there we don't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster and they prevent disaster but what they assure in its place is mediocrity don't get me wrong we need rules jazz musicians need some notes most of them need some notes on the page we need more rules for the bankers god knows but too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising and as a result they lose their gifts or worse they stop playing all together now how about incentives they seem clever if you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it right well not always sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complementing and they make people less likely to do it I'll just give you one example because time is racing in Switzerland back in about 15 years ago they were trying to decide where to cite nuclear waste dumps there was going to be a national referendum and some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed and they said would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community astonishingly 50% of the citizens said yes they knew it or thought it was dangerous they thought it would reduce their property values but it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens the psychologists asked other people a slightly different question they said if we paid you six weeks salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community two reasons it's my responsibility and I'm getting paid instead of 50% saying yes 25% said yes what happens is that the second this introduction of the incentive gets us so that instead of asking what are my responsibilities all we ask is what serves my interests when incentives don't work when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses the response is always the same get smarter incentives the truth is that there are no incentives you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough any incentive system can be subverted by bad will we need incentives people have to make a living but excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word it causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality Barack Obama said before he was inaugurated we must ask not just as it profitable but is it right and when professions are demoralized everyone in them becomes dependent on addicted to incentives and they stop asking is it right we see this in medicine and we certainly see it in the world of business it is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work so what can we do a few sources of hope we ought to try to Reem oral eyes work one way not to do it teach more ethics courses there is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course what to do instead one celebrate moral exemplars acknowledge when you go to law school that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch no ten-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions people are inspired by moral heroes but we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes well acknowledge them be proud that you have them celebrate them and demand that the people who teach you acknowledge and celebrate them too that's one thing we can do I don't know how many of you remember this another moral hero 15 years ago Aaron Feuerstein who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts they made Polartec the factory burned down 3,000 employees he kept every one of them on the payroll why because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go maybe on paper our company's worthless to Wall Street but I can tell you it's worth more we are doing fine just that this Ted we heard talks from several moral heroes to particularly inspiring to me one was Ray Anderson who turned you know turned you know a part of the evil empire into a zero footprint or almost a zero footprint business why because it was the right thing to do and a bonus he's discovering is he's actually gonna make even more money his employees are inspired by the effort why because they're happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do yesterday we heard willie smith's talk about reforesting in indonesia and in many ways this is the perfect example because it took the will to do the right thing and god knows it took a huge amount of technical skill I bottle that how much he needed to know in order and his associates in order to plot this out but most important to make it work and he emphasized this is that it took knowing the people in the communities unless the people you're working with our support are behind you this will fail and there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways so there's a lot here at Ed and at other places to celebrate and you don't have to be a mega hero there are ordinary heroes ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too as practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary if not extraordinary heroes as heads of organizations we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work if you run an organization you should be sure that none of the jobs none of the jobs have job descriptions like the job description of the janitors because the truth is that any work you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom and perhaps most important as teachers we should strive to be the ordinary heroes the moral exemplars to the people we mentor and there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers one is that we are always teaching someone is always watching the camera is always on Bill Gates talked about the importance of education and in particular the model that Kipp was providing knowledge is power and he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that Kipp is doing to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college I want to focus on one particular thing Kipp is doing that bill didn't mention and that is they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character they need to learn to respect themselves they need to learn to respect their schoolmates they need to learn to respect their teachers and most important they need to learn to respect learning that's the principal objective if you do that the rest is just pretty much a Coast downhill and the teachers the way you teach these things to kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day Obama appealed to virtue and I think he was right and the virtue that we need above all others I think is practical wisdom because it's what allows other virtues honesty kindness courage and so on to be displayed at the right time and in the right way he also appealed to hope right again I think there is reason for hope I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous in many ways it's what Ted is all about wanting to do the right thing in the white right way for the right reasons this kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention paying attention to what we do to how we do it and perhaps most importantly to the structure of the organizations within which we work so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than rather than having it suppressed thank you very much thank you if you have to go east on that side thank you very much what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBMer let's build a smarter planet

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] in his inaugural address Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis but what did he appeal to he did not happily follow in the footsteps of his predecessor and tell us to just go shopping nor did he tell us trust us trust your country invest invest invest instead what he told us was to put aside childish things and he appealed to virtue virtue is an old-fashioned word it seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one and besides some of you might be wondering what the hell does it mean let me begin with an example these are this is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen and all of the items on it are unremarkable they're the things you would expect mop the floors sweep them empty the trash restock the cabinets it may be a little surprising how many things there are but it's not surprising what they are but the one thing I want you to notice about them is this even though this is a very long list there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings not one the janitors job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital and yet when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like they encountered Mike who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise trying to build up his strength walking slowly up and down the hall and Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisors admonition didn't vacuum the visitors lounge because there were some family members who were there all day every day who at this moment happened to be taking a nap and then there was Luke who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice because the man's father who had been keeping a vigil for six months didn't see Luke do it the first time and his father was angry and behavior like this from janitors from technicians from nurses and if we're lucky every now and then from doctors doesn't just make people feel a little better it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well now not all janitors are like this of course but the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness care and empathy are an essential part of the job and yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings these janitors have the moral will to do right by other people and beyond this they have the moral skill to figure out what doing right means practical wisdom Aristotle told us is the combination of moral will and moral skill a wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule as the janitors knew when to ignore their job duties in the service of other objectives a wise person knows how to improvise as Luke did when he rewashed the floor real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined and the context is always changing a wise person is like a jazz musician using the notes on the page but dancing around them inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand a wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims to serve other people not to manipulate other people and finally perhaps most important a wise person is made not born wisdom depends on experience and not just any experience you need the time to get to know the people that you're serving you need permission to be allowed to improvise to try new things occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures and you need to be mentored by wise teachers when you ask the janitors who behave like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their jobs they tell you that it takes lots of experience and they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans it takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people at Ted brilliance is rampant it's scary the good news is that you don't need to be brilliant to be wise the bad news is that without wisdom brilliance isn't enough it's as likely to get you into trouble and other people into trouble as anything else now I hope that we all know this there's a sense in which it's obvious and yet let me tell you a little story it's a story about lemonade a dad and his 11 year old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark his son asked him for some lemonade and dad went to the concession stand to buy it all they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade which was 5% alcohol dad being an academic had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade was it contained out at all so we brought it back and the kid was drinking it and a security guard spotted it and called the police who called an ambulance they rushed to the ballpark whisked the kid to the hospital the emergency room to ascertain that the kid had no alcohol in his blood and they were ready to let the kid go but not so fast the Wayne County Child Welfare protective agency said oh and the child was sent to a foster home for three days at that point can the child go home well a judge said yes but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel after two weeks I'm happy to report the family was reunited but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure how do things like this happen Scott Simon who told this story on NPR said rules and procedures may be dumb but they spare you from thinking and to be fair and to be fair rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lacks and they let a child go back to an abusive household fair enough when things go wrong as of course they do we reach for

[Music] so I want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood I love the science fiction movies here it is this island earth and leave it to Hollywood to get it just right two and a half years in the making I mean even the creationists give us 6,000 but Hollywood goes to the chase and in this movie we see what we think is out there flying saucers and aliens every world has an alien and every alien world has the flying saucer and they move about with great speed aliens well don brownlee my friend and i finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the TV and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night and tried to write a counter-argument to it and put out what does it really take for an earth to be habitable for a planet to be an earth to have a place where you could probably get not just life but complexity which requires a huge amount of evolution and therefore constancy of conditions so in 2000 rewrote rare earth in 2003 we then asked let's not think about where earths are in space but how long is Earth Ben Earth if you go back to billion years you're not on an earth-like planet anymore what we call an earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time well rare earth actually taught me off a lot about meeting the public right after I got an invitation go to a science fiction convention and with all great earnestness walked in David Brin was going to debate me on this and as I walked in the crowd of 100 started Bowie and lustily but a girl came up and said my dad says you're the devil you cannot take people's aliens away from them and expect to be anybody's friends well the second part of that soon after and I was talking to Paul Allen and I saw him in the audience I handed him a copy of rare earth and Jill tarter was there and she turned to me and she looked to me just like that girl in the Exorcist it was it burns it burns because Eddie doesn't want to hear this said he wants there to be stuff out there I really applaud the SETI efforts but we have not heard anything yet and I really do think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't now I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that even if SETI does hear something can we figure out what they said because this is a slide that was passed between the two major intelligence is on earth a Mac to a PC and it can't even get the letters right so how are we going to talk to the aliens and if there are 50 light-years away and we call them up and you buf about and then 50 years later comes back and they say please repeat I mean there we are our planet is the good planet because you can keep water Mars is a bad planet but it's still good enough for us to go there and to live on its surface for protected but Venus is a very bad the worst planet even though it's Earth like it even though early in its history made very well of Harvard earth-like life it's sue succumbed to runaway greenhouse that's an 800 degrees centigrade surface because of rampant carbon dioxide well we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what's going to happen to our particular planet we are right now and the beautiful Oreo of existence of at least life on planet Earth following the first horrible microbial age in the Cambrian explosion life emerged from the swamps complexity arose and from what we can tell we're halfway through we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now till we hit the second microbial age and that will happen paradoxically everything here about global warming when we hit co2 down to ten parts per million we are no longer going to have to have plants or allowed to have any photosynthesis and there go animals so after that we probably have 7 billion years the Sun increases in its intensity and its brightness and finally at about 12 billion years after first our turd the earth is consumed by a large Sun and this is what's left so our planet like us is going to have an age at an old age and we are in its golden summer age right now but there's two phase two everything isn't there now a lot of you are going to die of old age but some of you horribly enough are going to die in an accident and that's the fate of a platitude earth if we're lucky enough if it doesn't get hit by a pale Bop or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years we'll finally be your fate but what about accidental death well paleontologists for the last 200 years have been charting death it's strange extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about until Baron Cuvier and France found this first Mastodon he couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet and he said AHA extinct and very soon after the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals that have been his complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record in that complex record of fossils there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly and the father/mother geologists called these mass extinctions along was thought to be either act of god or perhaps long slow climate change and that really changed in 1980 in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio where walter alvarez trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks which held creatures of the Cretaceous period and the pink rocks above which held tertiary fossils how long did it take to go from one system to the next and what they found is something unexpected they found in this gap in between a very thin clay layer and that clay layer this very thin red layer here is filled with iridium and not just iridium is filled with glassy cereals and has filled the quartz grains that have been subjected to enormous pressure shock quartz now in this life the white is chalk and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean the chalk itself is composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor so the 90% of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff and then you have that millimeter thick red layer and then you have black rock and the black rock is the sediment on that sea bottom in the absence of plankton and that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe because that's what this was of course this is the famous KT a ten kilometer body hit the planet the effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet and we had very quickly the depth of the dinosaurs the death of these beautiful ammonites lasts until here and selasa furs over here and so much else I mean it must be true because we've had to Hollywood blockbusters since that time and this paradigm from 1980 to about 2000 totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes prior to that uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past there were present-day processes that will explain it but we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact so this is a type of neo catastrophism and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips that yes we were hit and yes the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction well there are five major mass extinctions the last 500 million years called the Big Five they range from 450 billion years ago to the last the KT number for the biggest of all was the P or the Permian extinction sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions and every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large body impact but is this true the most recent the Permian was thought to have been impact because of this beautiful structure on the right this is a buckminsterfullerene a carbon 60 because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes of my late beloved 60s they're called bucky balls this evidence was used to suggest at the end of the Permian 250 million years ago a comet hit us and when the comet hits the pressure produces the bucky balls and it captures bits of the comet helium-3 very rare in the surface of the earth very common in space but is this true in 1990 working on the KT extinction for ten years I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year in the great karoo desert I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa into the new South Africa as I went year by year and I worked on this Permian extinction camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time and the fossils are extraordinary you know gaze upon your very distant ancestors these are mammal-like reptiles they are culturally invisible we do not make movies about these this is gorgon opción or Gorgon that's an 18 inch long skull of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet sprawled like a lizard probably had a head like a lion this is the top carnivore the t-rex of his time there's lots of stuff this is my poor son Patrick this is called paleontological child abuse hold still you're the scale there was big stuff back then 55 species of mammal like reptiles the age of mammals had well and truly started 250 million years ago and then a catastrophe happened and what happens next is the age of dinosaurs it was all a mistake it should have never happened but it did now luckily this throwing acid on the size of a robin egg here this is a skull discovered just before taking this picture there's a pen for scale it's really tiny this is in the lowest Triassic after the mass extinction is finished you can see the eye socket you can see the little teeth in the front if that does not survive I'm not the thing giving this talk something else is because if that doesn't survive we are not here there are no mammals is that close one species eats through well can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't here's sort of the end of that ten years of work the ranges of stuff the red line is the mass extinction but we've got survivors and things that get through and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold Bloods warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time the survivors that do get through produced this world of crocodile-like creatures there's no dinosaurs yet just the smo saurian scaly nasty swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes and there they would hide for 160 million years until liberated by that KT asteroid so not impact what and the what I think is that we returned over and over and over again to the Precambrian world at first microbial age and the microbes are still out there they hate we animals they really want their world and they've tried over and over and over again and suggested me the life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti Guyon this whole Gaia idea the life makes the world better for itself and it would have been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Gaia theory no so I really suspect there's an alternative and that life does actually try to do itself in not consciously but just because it does and here's the weapon it seems that it did so over the last 500 million years there are microbes which through the metabolism produce hydrogen sulfide and they do so in large amounts hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to humans as small as 200 parts per million will kill you you only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places some lakes and get down and you'll find that the water itself turns purple turns purple for the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide and we can detect their presence today we can see them but we can also detect their presence in the past and the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field I am almost extinct I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils but the new wave of paleontologists my graduate students collect biomarkers they take the set of it itself they extract the oil from it and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups is because lipids are so tough they can get preserved in sediment and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary and be extracted and tell us who was there and we know who was there at the end of the Permian at many of these mass extinction boundaries this is what we find I saw Ernie retain its very specific it can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide enough for instance to come out of solution this led Lee Kump and others from Penn State and my group to propose what I call the comp I pas thesis many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen by high co2 and the worst effect of global warming it turns out hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans well what's the source of this in this particular case the source over and over been flood basalts this is a view of the earth now if we extract a lot of it and each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb actually the effects are even worse this is one deep earth material comes to the surface spreads out over the surface of the planet well it's not the lava that kills anything it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it this isn't Volvos this is volcanoes but carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide so these are new data about burger dive from Yale put together and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record we can do this from a variety of means and put on the red lines here when these what I call greenhouse mass extinctions took place and there's two things they're really evident here to me is that these extinctions take place when co2 is going up but the second thing that's not shown on here the earth has never had any ice on it when we've had a thousand parts per million co2 we are a 380 in climbing we should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most but my friend David Bautista in Seattle says he thinks a hundred years so there goes the ice caps and there comes 240 feet of sea-level rise I live in a view house now I'm going to have waterfront alright what's the consequence the oceans probably turn purple and we think this is the reason the complexity took so long to take place on planet Earth we had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period they stopped complex life from existing we know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet and I throw this slide and this is B actually two months ago let's throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal chambered nautilus it's been on this planets this animals for started 500 million years this is a tracking experiment interview scuba divers you want to get involved one of the coolest projects ever this is off the Great Barrier Reef and as we speak now these Nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us but the thing about this is that every once in a while divers can run into trouble so I'm gonna do little thought experiment here this is a great white shark that ate some of my traps we pulled it up up it comes so it's out there with me at night so I'm swimming along and it takes off my leg I'm 80 miles from shore what's going to happen to me well now I died five years from now this is what I hope happens to me I've taken back to the boat I'm given a gas mask eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide I'm then throwing a nice pond I'm cooled fifteen degrees lower and I can be taken to a critical care hospital and the reason I could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events and our bodies have adapted and we can now use this is what I think will be a major medical breakthrough this is Mark Roth he was funded by DARPA trying to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries he believes out pigs he puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions and he turns a mammal into a reptile I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to h2s I got this email from him two years ago he said I think I got an answer to some of your questions so he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours sometimes six hours and these are brand new data he sent me on the way over here on the top now that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through the dotted line to temperature so the temperature starts 225 centigrade and down it goes down it goes six hours later up goes the temperature now the same mouse is given eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph and look what happens to his temperature its temperature drops it goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35 and comes out of this perfectly fine here is a way we can get people to critical care here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care now you're all thinking yeah what about the brain tissue and so this is one of the great challenges is going to happen you're in an accident you got two choices you're going to die or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and say 75% of you is safe mentally what are you going to do do we all have to have little buttons say let me die this is coming towards this I think this is going to be a revolution we're going to save lives but there's going to be a cost to it the new view of mass extinctions yes we were hit and yes we have to think about the long term because we will get hit again but there's a far worse danger confronting us we can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world give us a few millennia and we humans children ask those few millennia will it happen again if we continue it will happen again how many of us flew here how many of us have gone through our entire Kyoto quota just for flying this year how many of you have exceeded it yeah I've certainly exceeded it we have a huge problem facing us as a species we have to beat this I want to be able to go back to this reef thank you the one question to Peter so am i understanding you right that what you're saying here is that we have in our own bodies a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change yeah every single cell in us can produce my new quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises this is what Roth is found out so what we're looking at now does it leave a signal doesn't leave a signal in bone or in plant we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past it's simultaneously an incredible medical technique but also a terrifying blessing and curse you

lot of it and each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb actually the effects are even worse this is one deep earth material comes to the surface spreads out over the surface of the planet well it's not the lava that kills anything it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it this isn't Volvos this is volcanoes but carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide so these are new data about burger dive from Yale put together and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record we can do this from a variety of means and put on the red lines here when these what I call greenhouse mass extinctions took place and there's two things they're really evident here to me is that these extinctions take place when co2 is going up but the second thing that's not shown on here the earth has never had any ice on it when we've had a thousand parts per million co2 we are a 380 in climbing we should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most but my friend David Bautista in Seattle says he thinks a hundred years so there goes the ice caps and there comes 240 feet of sea-level rise I live in a view house now I'm going to have waterfront alright what's the consequence the oceans probably turn purple and we think this is the reason the complexity took so long to take place on planet Earth we had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period they stopped complex life from existing we know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet and I throw this slide and this is B actually two months ago let's throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal chambered nautilus it's been on this planets this animals for started 500 million years this is a tracking experiment interview scuba divers you want to get involved one of the coolest projects ever this is off the Great Barrier Reef and as we speak now these Nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us but the thing about this is that every once in a while divers can run into trouble so I'm gonna do little thought experiment here this is a great white shark that ate some of my traps we pulled it up up it comes so it's out there with me at night so I'm swimming along and it takes off my leg I'm 80 miles from shore what's going to happen to me well now I died five years from now this is what I hope happens to me I've taken back to the boat I'm given a gas mask eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide I'm then throwing a nice pond I'm cooled fifteen degrees lower and I can be taken to a critical care hospital and the reason I could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events and our bodies have adapted and we can now use this is what I think will be a major medical breakthrough this is Mark Roth he was funded by DARPA trying to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries he believes out pigs he puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions and he turns a mammal into a reptile I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to h2s I got this email from him two years ago he said I think I got an answer to some of your questions so he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours sometimes six hours and these are brand new data he sent me on the way over here on the top now that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through the dotted line to temperature so the temperature starts 225 centigrade and down it goes down it goes six hours later up goes the temperature now the same mouse is given eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph and look what happens to his temperature its temperature drops it goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35 and comes out of this perfectly fine here is a way we can get people to critical care here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care now you're all thinking yeah what about the brain tissue and so this is one of the great challenges is going to happen you're in an accident you got two choices you're going to die or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and say 75% of you is safe mentally what are you going to do do we all have to have little buttons say let me die this is coming towards this I think this is going to be a revolution we're going to save lives but there's going to be a cost to it the new view of mass extinctions yes we were hit and yes we have to think about the long term because we will get hit again but there's a far worse danger confronting us we can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world give us a few millennia and we humans children ask those few millennia will it happen again if we continue it will happen again how many of us flew here how many of us have gone through our entire Kyoto quota just for flying this year how many of you have exceeded it yeah I've certainly exceeded it we have a huge problem facing us as a species we have to beat this I want to be able to go back to this reef thank you the one question to Peter so am i understanding you right that what you're saying here is that we have in our own bodies a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change yeah every single cell in us can produce my new quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises this is what Roth is found out so what we're looking at now does it leave a signal doesn't leave a signal in bone or in plant we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past it's simultaneously an incredible medical technique but also a terrifying blessing and curse you

**Transcript**:
[Music] so I want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood I love the science fiction movies here it is this island earth and leave it to Hollywood to get it just right two and a half years in the making I mean even the creationists give us 6,000 but Hollywood goes to the chase and in this movie we see what we think is out there flying saucers and aliens every world has an alien and every alien world has the flying saucer and they move about with great speed aliens well don brownlee my friend and i finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the TV and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night and tried to write a counter-argument to it and put out what does it really take for an earth to be habitable for a planet to be an earth to have a place where you could probably get not just life but complexity which requires a huge amount of evolution and therefore constancy of conditions so in 2000 rewrote rare earth in 2003 we then asked let's not think about where earths are in space but how long is Earth Ben Earth if you go back to billion years you're not on an earth-like planet anymore what we call an earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time well rare earth actually taught me off a lot about meeting the public right after I got an invitation go to a science fiction convention and with all great earnestness walked in David Brin was going to debate me on this and as I walked in the crowd of 100 started Bowie and lustily but a girl came up and said my dad says you're the devil you cannot take people's aliens away from them and expect to be anybody's friends well the second part of that soon after and I was talking to Paul Allen and I saw him in the audience I handed him a copy of rare earth and Jill tarter was there and she turned to me and she looked to me just like that girl in the Exorcist it was it burns it burns because Eddie doesn't want to hear this said he wants there to be stuff out there I really applaud the SETI efforts but we have not heard anything yet and I really do think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't now I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that even if SETI does hear something can we figure out what they said because this is a slide that was passed between the two major intelligence is on earth a Mac to a PC and it can't even get the letters right so how are we going to talk to the aliens and if there are 50 light-years away and we call them up and you buf about and then 50 years later comes back and they say please repeat I mean there we are our planet is the good planet because you can keep water Mars is a bad planet but it's still good enough for us to go there and to live on its surface for protected but Venus is a very bad the worst planet even though it's Earth like it even though early in its history made very well of Harvard earth-like life it's sue succumbed to runaway greenhouse that's an 800 degrees centigrade surface because of rampant carbon dioxide well we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what's going to happen to our particular planet we are right now and the beautiful Oreo of existence of at least life on planet Earth following the first horrible microbial age in the Cambrian explosion life emerged from the swamps complexity arose and from what we can tell we're halfway through we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now till we hit the second microbial age and that will happen paradoxically everything here about global warming when we hit co2 down to ten parts per million we are no longer going to have to have plants or allowed to have any photosynthesis and there go animals so after that we probably have 7 billion years the Sun increases in its intensity and its brightness and finally at about 12 billion years after first our turd the earth is consumed by a large Sun and this is what's left so our planet like us is going to have an age at an old age and we are in its golden summer age right now but there's two phase two everything isn't there now a lot of you are going to die of old age but some of you horribly enough are going to die in an accident and that's the fate of a platitude earth if we're lucky enough if it doesn't get hit by a pale Bop or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years we'll finally be your fate but what about accidental death well paleontologists for the last 200 years have been charting death it's strange extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about until Baron Cuvier and France found this first Mastodon he couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet and he said AHA extinct and very soon after the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals that have been his complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record in that complex record of fossils there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly and the father/mother geologists called these mass extinctions along was thought to be either act of god or perhaps long slow climate change and that really changed in 1980 in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio where walter alvarez trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks which held creatures of the Cretaceous period and the pink rocks above which held tertiary fossils how long did it take to go from one system to the next and what they found is something unexpected they found in this gap in between a very thin clay layer and that clay layer this very thin red layer here is filled with iridium and not just iridium is filled with glassy cereals and has filled the quartz grains that have been subjected to enormous pressure shock quartz now in this life the white is chalk and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean the chalk itself is composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor so the 90% of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff and then you have that millimeter thick red layer and then you have black rock and the black rock is the sediment on that sea bottom in the absence of plankton and that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe because that's what this was of course this is the famous KT a ten kilometer body hit the planet the effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet and we had very quickly the depth of the dinosaurs the death of these beautiful ammonites lasts until here and selasa furs over here and so much else I mean it must be true because we've had to Hollywood blockbusters since that time and this paradigm from 1980 to about 2000 totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes prior to that uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past there were present-day processes that will explain it but we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact so this is a type of neo catastrophism and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips that yes we were hit and yes the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction well there are five major mass extinctions the last 500 million years called the Big Five they range from 450 billion years ago to the last the KT number for the biggest of all was the P or the Permian extinction sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions and every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large body impact but is this true the most recent the Permian was thought to have been impact because of this beautiful structure on the right this is a buckminsterfullerene a carbon 60 because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes of my late beloved 60s they're called bucky balls this evidence was used to suggest at the end of the Permian 250 million years ago a comet hit us and when the comet hits the pressure produces the bucky balls and it captures bits of the comet helium-3 very rare in the surface of the earth very common in space but is this true in 1990 working on the KT extinction for ten years I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year in the great karoo desert I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa into the new South Africa as I went year by year and I worked on this Permian extinction camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time and the fossils are extraordinary you know gaze upon your very distant ancestors these are mammal-like reptiles they are culturally invisible we do not make movies about these this is gorgon opción or Gorgon that's an 18 inch long skull of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet sprawled like a lizard probably had a head like a lion this is the top carnivore the t-rex of his time there's lots of stuff this is my poor son Patrick this is called paleontological child abuse hold still you're the scale there was big stuff back then 55 species of mammal like reptiles the age of mammals had well and truly started 250 million years ago and then a catastrophe happened and what happens next is the age of dinosaurs it was all a mistake it should have never happened but it did now luckily this throwing acid on the size of a robin egg here this is a skull discovered just before taking this picture there's a pen for scale it's really tiny this is in the lowest Triassic after the mass extinction is finished you can see the eye socket you can see the little teeth in the front if that does not survive I'm not the thing giving this talk something else is because if that doesn't survive we are not here there are no mammals is that close one species eats through well can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't here's sort of the end of that ten years of work the ranges of stuff the red line is the mass extinction but we've got survivors and things that get through and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold Bloods warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time the survivors that do get through produced this world of crocodile-like creatures there's no dinosaurs yet just the smo saurian scaly nasty swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes and there they would hide for 160 million years until liberated by that KT asteroid so not impact what and the what I think is that we returned over and over and over again to the Precambrian world at first microbial age and the microbes are still out there they hate we animals they really want their world and they've tried over and over and over again and suggested me the life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti Guyon this whole Gaia idea the life makes the world better for itself and it would have been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Gaia theory no so I really suspect there's an alternative and that life does actually try to do itself in not consciously but just because it does and here's the weapon it seems that it did so over the last 500 million years there are microbes which through the metabolism produce hydrogen sulfide and they do so in large amounts hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to humans as small as 200 parts per million will kill you you only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places some lakes and get down and you'll find that the water itself turns purple turns purple for the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide and we can detect their presence today we can see them but we can also detect their presence in the past and the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field I am almost extinct I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils but the new wave of paleontologists my graduate students collect biomarkers they take the set of it itself they extract the oil from it and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups is because lipids are so tough they can get preserved in sediment and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary and be extracted and tell us who was there and we know who was there at the end of the Permian at many of these mass extinction boundaries this is what we find I saw Ernie retain its very specific it can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide enough for instance to come out of solution this led Lee Kump and others from Penn State and my group to propose what I call the comp I pas thesis many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen by high co2 and the worst effect of global warming it turns out hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans well what's the source of this in this particular case the source over and over been flood basalts this is a view of the earth now if we extract a lot of it and each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb actually the effects are even worse this is one deep earth material comes to the surface spreads out over the surface of the planet well it's not the lava that kills anything it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it this isn't Volvos this is volcanoes but carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide so these are new data about burger dive from Yale put together and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record we can do this from a variety of means and put on the red lines here when these what I call greenhouse mass extinctions took place and there's two things they're really evident here to me is that these extinctions take place when co2 is going up but the second thing that's not shown on here the earth has never had any ice on it when we've had a thousand parts per million co2 we are a 380 in climbing we should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most but my friend David Bautista in Seattle says he thinks a hundred years so there goes the ice caps and there comes 240 feet of sea-level rise I live in a view house now I'm going to have waterfront alright what's the consequence the oceans probably turn purple and we think this is the reason the complexity took so long to take place on planet Earth we had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period they stopped complex life from existing we know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet and I throw this slide and this is B actually two months ago let's throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal chambered nautilus it's been on this planets this animals for started 500 million years this is a tracking experiment interview scuba divers you want to get involved one of the coolest projects ever this is off the Great Barrier Reef and as we speak now these Nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us but the thing about this is that every once in a while divers can run into trouble so I'm gonna do little thought experiment here this is a great white shark that ate some of my traps we pulled it up up it comes so it's out there with me at night so I'm swimming along and it takes off my leg I'm 80 miles from shore what's going to happen to me well now I died five years from now this is what I hope happens to me I've taken back to the boat I'm given a gas mask eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide I'm then throwing a nice pond I'm cooled fifteen degrees lower and I can be taken to a critical care hospital and the reason I could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events and our bodies have adapted and we can now use this is what I think will be a major medical breakthrough this is Mark Roth he was funded by DARPA trying to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries he believes out pigs he puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions and he turns a mammal into a reptile I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to h2s I got this email from him two years ago he said I think I got an answer to some of your questions so he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours sometimes six hours and these are brand new data he sent me on the way over here on the top now that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through the dotted line to temperature so the temperature starts 225 centigrade and down it goes down it goes six hours later

degrees centigrade from 35 and comes out of this perfectly fine here is a way we can get people to critical care here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care now you're all thinking yeah what about the brain tissue and so this is one of the great challenges is going to happen you're in an accident you got two choices you're going to die or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and say 75% of you is safe mentally what are you going to do do we all have to have little buttons say let me die this is coming towards this I think this is going to be a revolution

[Music] so I want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood I love the science fiction movies here it is this island earth and leave it to Hollywood to get it just right two and a half years in the making I mean even the creationists give us 6,000 but Hollywood goes to the chase and in this movie we see what we think is out there flying saucers and aliens every world has an alien and every alien world has the flying saucer and they move about with great speed aliens well don brownlee my friend and i finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the TV and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night and tried to write a counter-argument to it and put out what does it really take for an earth to be habitable for a planet to be an earth to have a place where you could probably get not just life but complexity which requires a huge amount of evolution and therefore constancy of conditions so in 2000 rewrote rare earth in 2003 we then asked let's not think about where earths are in space but how long is Earth Ben Earth if you go back to billion years you're not on an earth-like planet anymore what we call an earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time well rare earth actually taught me off a lot about meeting the public right after I got an invitation go to a science fiction convention and with all great earnestness walked in David Brin was going to debate me on this and as I walked in the crowd of 100 started Bowie and lustily but a girl came up and said my dad says you're the devil you cannot take people's aliens away from them and expect to be anybody's friends well the second part of that soon after and I was talking to Paul Allen and I saw him in the audience I handed him a copy of rare earth and Jill tarter was there and she turned to me and she looked to me just like that girl in the Exorcist it was it burns it burns because Eddie doesn't want to hear this said he wants there to be stuff out there I really applaud the SETI efforts but we have not heard anything yet and I really do think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't now I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that even if SETI does hear something can we figure out what they said because this is a slide that was passed between the two major intelligence is on earth a Mac to a PC and it can't even get the letters right so how are we going to talk to the aliens and if there are 50 light-years away and we call them up and you buf about and then 50 years later comes back and they say please repeat I mean there we are our planet is the good planet because you can keep water Mars is a bad planet but it's still good enough for us to go there and to live on its surface for protected but Venus is a very bad the worst planet even though it's Earth like it even though early in its history made very well of Harvard earth-like life it's sue succumbed to runaway greenhouse that's an 800 degrees centigrade surface because of rampant carbon dioxide well we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what's going to happen to our particular planet we are right now and the beautiful Oreo of existence of at least life on planet Earth following the first horrible microbial age in the Cambrian explosion life emerged from the swamps complexity arose and from what we can tell we're halfway through we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now till we hit the second microbial age and that will happen paradoxically everything here about global warming when we hit co2 down to ten parts per million we are no longer going to have to have plants or allowed to have any photosynthesis and there go animals so after that we probably have 7 billion years the Sun increases in its intensity and its brightness and finally at about 12 billion years after first our turd the earth is consumed by a large Sun and this is what's left so our planet like us is going to have an age at an old age and we are in its golden summer age right now but there's two phase two everything isn't there now a lot of you are going to die of old age but some of you horribly enough are going to die in an accident and that's the fate of a platitude earth if we're lucky enough if it doesn't get hit by a pale Bop or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years we'll finally be your fate but what about accidental death well paleontologists for the last 200 years have been charting death it's strange extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about until Baron Cuvier and France found this first Mastodon he couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet and he said AHA extinct and very soon after the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals that have been his complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record in that complex record of fossils there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly and the father/mother geologists called these mass extinctions along was thought to be either act of god or perhaps long slow climate change and that really changed in 1980 in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio where walter alvarez trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks which held creatures of the Cretaceous period and the pink rocks above which held tertiary fossils how long did it take to go from one system to the next and what they found is something unexpected they found in this gap in between a very thin clay layer and that clay layer this very thin red layer here is filled with iridium and not just iridium is filled with glassy cereals and has filled the quartz grains that have been subjected to enormous pressure shock quartz now in this life the white is chalk and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean the chalk itself is composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor so the 90% of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff and then you have that millimeter thick red layer and then you have black rock and the black rock is the sediment on that sea bottom in the absence of plankton and that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe because that's what this was of course this is the famous KT a ten kilometer body hit the planet the effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet and we had very quickly the depth of the dinosaurs the death of these beautiful ammonites lasts until here and selasa furs over here and so much else I mean it must be true because we've had to Hollywood blockbusters since that time and this paradigm from 1980 to about 2000 totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes prior to that uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past there were present-day processes that will explain it but we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact so this is a type of neo catastrophism and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips that yes we were hit and yes the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction well there are five major mass extinctions the last 500 million years called the Big Five they range from 450 billion years ago to the last the KT number for the biggest of all was the P or the Permian extinction sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions and every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large body impact but is this true the most recent the Permian was thought to have been impact because of this beautiful structure on the right this is a buckminsterfullerene a carbon 60 because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes of my late beloved 60s they're called bucky balls this evidence was used to suggest at the end of the Permian 250 million years ago a comet hit us and when the comet hits the pressure produces the bucky balls and it captures bits of the comet helium-3 very rare in the surface of the earth very common in space but is this true in 1990 working on the KT extinction for ten years I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year in the great karoo desert I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa into the new South Africa as I went year by year and I worked on this Permian extinction camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time and the fossils are extraordinary you know gaze upon your very distant ancestors these are mammal-like reptiles they are culturally invisible we do not make movies about these this is gorgon opción or Gorgon that's an 18 inch long skull of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet sprawled like a lizard probably had a head like a lion this is the top carnivore the t-rex of his time there's lots of stuff this is my poor son Patrick this is called paleontological child abuse hold still you're the scale there was big stuff back then 55 species of mammal like reptiles the age of mammals had well and truly started 250 million years ago and then a catastrophe happened and what happens next is the age of dinosaurs it was all a mistake it should have never happened but it did now luckily this throwing acid on the size of a robin egg here this is a skull discovered just before taking this picture there's a pen for scale it's really tiny this is in the lowest Triassic after the mass extinction is finished you can see the eye socket you can see the little teeth in the front if that does not survive I'm not the thing giving this talk something else is because if that doesn't survive we are not here there are no mammals is that close one species eats through well can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't here's sort of the end of that ten years of work the ranges of stuff the red line is the mass extinction but we've got survivors and things that get through and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold Bloods warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time the survivors that do get through produced this world of crocodile-like creatures there's no dinosaurs yet just the smo saurian scaly nasty swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes and there they would hide for 160 million years until liberated by that KT asteroid so not impact what and the what I think is that we returned over and over and over again to the Precambrian world at first microbial age and the microbes are still out there they hate we animals they really want their world and they've tried over and over and over again and suggested me the life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti Guyon this whole Gaia idea the life makes the world better for itself and it would have been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Gaia theory no so I really suspect there's an alternative and that life does actually try to do itself in not consciously but just because it does and here's the weapon it seems that it did so over the last 500 million years there are microbes which through the metabolism produce hydrogen sulfide and they do so in large amounts hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to humans as small as 200 parts per million will kill you you only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places some lakes and get down and you'll find that the water itself turns purple turns purple for the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide and we can detect their presence today we can see them but we can also detect their presence in the past and the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field I am almost extinct I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils but the new wave of paleontologists my graduate students collect biomarkers they take the set of it itself they extract the oil from it and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups is because lipids are so tough they can get preserved in sediment and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary and be extracted and tell us who was there and we know who was there at the end of the Permian at many of these mass extinction boundaries this is what we find I saw Ernie retain its very specific it can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide enough for instance to come out of solution this led Lee Kump and others from Penn State and my group to propose what I call the comp I pas thesis many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen by high co2 and the worst effect of global warming it turns out hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans well what's the source of this in this particular case the source over and over been flood basalts this is a view of the earth now if we extract a lot of it and each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb actually the effects are even worse this is one deep earth material comes to the surface spreads out over the surface of the planet well it's not the lava that kills anything it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it this isn't Volvos this is volcanoes but carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide so these are new data about burger dive from Yale put together and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record we can do this from a variety of means and put on the red lines here when these what I call greenhouse mass extinctions took place and there's two things they're really evident here to me is that these extinctions take place when co2 is going up but the second thing that's not shown on here the earth has never had any ice on it when we've had a thousand parts per million co2 we are a 380 in climbing we should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most but my friend David Bautista in Seattle says he thinks a hundred years so there goes the ice caps and there comes 240 feet of sea-level rise I live in a view house now I'm going to have waterfront alright what's the consequence the oceans probably turn purple and we think this is the reason the complexity took so long to take place on planet Earth we had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period they stopped complex life from existing we know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet and I throw this slide and this is B actually two months ago let's throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal chambered nautilus it's been on this planets this animals for started 500 million years this is a tracking experiment interview scuba divers you want to get involved one of the coolest projects ever this is off the Great Barrier Reef and as we speak now these Nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us but the thing about this is that every once in a while divers can run into trouble so I'm gonna do little thought experiment here this is a great white shark that ate some of my traps we pulled it up up it comes so it's out there with me at night so I'm swimming along and it takes off my leg I'm 80 miles from shore what's going to happen to me well now I died five years from now this is what I hope happens to me I've taken back to the boat I'm given a gas mask eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide I'm then throwing a nice pond I'm cooled fifteen degrees lower and I can be taken to a critical care hospital and the reason I could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events and our bodies have adapted and we can now use this is what I think will be a major medical breakthrough this is Mark Roth he was funded by DARPA trying to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries he believes out pigs he puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions and he turns a mammal into a reptile I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to h2s I got this email from him two years ago he said I think I got an answer to some of your questions so he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours sometimes six hours and these are brand new data he sent me on the way over here on the top now that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through the dotted line to temperature so the temperature starts 225 centigrade and down it goes down it goes six hours later up goes the temperature now the same mouse is given eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph and look what happens to his temperature its temperature drops it goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35 and comes out of this perfectly fine here is a way we can get people to critical care here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care now you're all thinking yeah what about the brain tissue and so this is one of the great challenges is going to happen you're in an accident you got two choices you're going to die or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and say 75% of you is safe mentally what are you going to do do we all have to have little buttons say let me die this is coming towards this I think this is going to be a revolution we're going to save lives but there's going to be a cost to it the new view of mass extinctions yes we were hit and yes we have to think about the long term because we will get hit again but there's a far worse danger confronting us we can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world give us a few millennia and we humans children ask those few millennia will it happen again if we continue it will happen again how many of us flew here how many of us have gone through our entire Kyoto quota just for flying this year how many of you have exceeded it yeah I've certainly exceeded it we have a huge problem facing us as a species we have to beat this I want to be able to go back to this reef thank you the one question to Peter so am i understanding you right that what you're saying here is that we have in our own bodies a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change yeah every single cell in us can produce my new quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises this is what Roth is found out so what we're looking at now does it leave a signal doesn't leave a signal in bone or in plant we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past it's simultaneously an incredible medical technique but also a terrifying blessing and curse you

millions of years necessary and be extracted and tell us who was there and we know who was there at the end of the Permian at many of these mass extinction boundaries this is what we find I saw Ernie retain its very specific it can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide enough for instance to come out of solution this led Lee Kump and others from Penn State and my group to propose what I call the comp I pas thesis many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen by high co2 and the worst effect of global warming it turns out hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans well what's the source of this in this particular case the source over and over been flood basalts this is a view of the earth now if we extract a lot of it and each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb actually the effects are even worse this is one deep earth material comes to the surface spreads out over the surface of the planet well it's not the lava that kills anything it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it this isn't Volvos this is volcanoes but carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide so these are new data about burger dive from Yale put together and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record we can do this from a variety of means and put on the red lines here when these what I call greenhouse mass extinctions took place and there's two things they're really evident here to me is that these extinctions take place when co2 is going up but the second thing that's not shown on here the earth has never had any ice on it when we've had a thousand parts per million co2 we are a 380 in climbing we should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most but my friend David Bautista in Seattle says he thinks a hundred years so there goes the ice caps and there comes 240 feet of sea-level rise I live in a view house now I'm going to have waterfront alright what's the consequence the oceans probably turn purple and we think this is the reason the complexity took so long to take place on planet Earth we had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period they stopped complex life from existing we know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet and I throw this slide and this is B actually two months ago let's throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal chambered nautilus it's been on this planets this animals for started 500 million years this is a tracking experiment interview scuba divers you want to get involved one of the coolest projects ever this is off the Great Barrier Reef and as we speak now these Nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us but the thing about this is that every once in a while divers can run into trouble so I'm gonna do little thought experiment here this is a great white shark that ate some of my traps we pulled it up up it comes so it's out there with me at night so I'm swimming along and it takes off my leg I'm 80 miles from shore what's going to happen to me well now I died five years from now this is what I hope happens to me I've taken back to the boat I'm given a gas mask eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide I'm then throwing a nice pond I'm cooled fifteen degrees lower and I can be taken to a critical care hospital and the reason I could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events and our bodies have adapted and we can now use this is what I think will be a major medical breakthrough this is Mark Roth he was funded by DARPA trying to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries he believes out pigs he puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions and he turns a mammal into a reptile I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to h2s I got this email from him two years ago he said I think I got an answer to some of your questions so he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours sometimes six hours and these are brand new data he sent me on the way over here on the top now that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through the dotted line to temperature so the temperature starts 225 centigrade and down it goes down it goes six hours later up goes the temperature now the same mouse is given eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph and look what happens to his temperature its temperature drops it goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35 and comes out of this perfectly fine here is a way we can get people to critical care here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care now you're all thinking yeah what about the brain tissue and so this is one of the great challenges is going to happen you're in an accident you got two choices you're going to die or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and say 75% of you is safe mentally what are you going to do do we all have to have little buttons say let me die this is coming towards this I think this is going to be a revolution we're going to save lives but there's going to be a cost to it the new view of mass extinctions yes we were hit and yes we have to think about the long term because we will get hit again but there's a far worse danger confronting us we can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world give us a few millennia and we humans children ask those few millennia will it happen again if we continue it will happen again how many of us flew here how many of us have gone through our entire Kyoto quota just for flying this year how many of you have exceeded it yeah I've certainly exceeded it we have a huge problem facing us as a species we have to beat this I want to be able to go back to this reef thank you the one question to Peter so am i understanding you right that what you're saying here is that we have in our own bodies a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change yeah every single cell in us can produce my new quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises this is what Roth is found out so what we're looking at now does it leave a signal doesn't leave a signal in bone or in plant we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past it's simultaneously an incredible medical technique but also a terrifying blessing and curse you

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar A couple of years ago I started using Twitter, and one of the things that really charmed me about Twitter is that people would wake up in the morning and they would say, "Good morning!" which I thought, I'm a Canadian, so I was a little bit, I liked that politeness. And so, I'm also a giant nerd, and so I wrote a computer program that would record 24 hours of everybody on Twitter saying, "Good morning!" And then I asked myself my favorite question, "What would that look like?" Well, as it turns out, I think it would look something like this. Right, so we'd see this wave of people saying, "Good morning!" across the world as they wake up. Now the green people, these are people that wake up at around 8 o'clock in the morning, Who wakes up at 8 o'clock or says, "Good morning!" at 8? And the orange people, they say, "Good morning!" around 9. And the red people, they say, "Good morning!" around 10. Yeah, more at 10's than, more at 10's than 8's. And actually if you look at this map, we can learn a little bit about how people wake up in different parts of the world. People on the West Coast, for example, they wake up a little bit later than those people on the East Coast. But that's not all that people say on Twitter, right? We also get these really important tweets, like, "I just landed in Orlando!! [plane sign, plane sign]" Or, or, "I just landed in Texas [exclamation point]!" Or "I just landed in Honduras!" These lists, they go on and on and on, all these people, right? So, on the outside, these people are just telling us something about how they're traveling. But we know the truth, don't we? These people are show-offs! They are showing off that they're in Cape Town and I'm not. So I thought, how can we take this vanity and turn it into utility? So using a similar approach that I did with "Good morning," I mapped all those people's trips because I know where they're landing, they just told me, and I know where they live because they share that information on their Twitter profile. So what I'm able to do with 36 hours of Twitter is create a model of how people are traveling around the world during that 36 hours. And this is kind of a prototype because I think if we listen to everybody on Twitter and Facebook and the rest of our social media, we'd actually get a pretty clear picture of how people are traveling from one place to the other, which is actually turns out to be a very useful thing for scientists, particularly those who are studying how disease is spread. So, I work upstairs in the New York Times, and for the last two years, we've been working on a project called, "Cascade," which in some ways is kind of similar to this one. But instead of modeling how people move, we're modeling how people talk. We're looking at what does a discussion look like. Well, here's an example. This is a discussion around an article called, "The Island Where People Forget to Die". It's about an island in Greece where people live a really, really, really, really, really, really long time. And what we're seeing here is we're seeing a conversation that's stemming from that first tweet down in the bottom, left-hand corner. So we get to see the scope of this conversation over about 9 hours right now, we're going to creep up to 12 hours here in a second. But, we can also see what that conversation looks like in three dimensions. And that three-dimensional view is actually much more useful for us. As humans, we are really used to things that are structured as three dimensions. So, we can look at those little off-shoots of conversation, we can find out what exactly happened. And this is an interactive, exploratory tool so we can go through every step in the conversation. We can look at who the people were, what they said, how old they are, where they live, who follows them, and so on, and so on, and so on. So, the Times creates about 6,500 pieces of content every month, and we can model every single one of the conversations that happen around them. And they look somewhat different. Depending on the story and depending on how fast people are talking about it and how far the conversation spreads, these structures, which I call these conversational architectures, end up looking different. So, these projects that I've shown you, I think they all involve the same thing: we can take small pieces of data and by putting them together, we can generate more value, we can do more exciting things with them. But so far we've only talked about Twitter, right? And Twitter isn't all the data. We learned a moment ago that there is tons and tons, tons more data out there. And specifically, I want you to think about one type of data because all of you guys, everybody in this audience, we, we, me as well, are data-making machines. We are producing data all the time. Every single one of us, we're producing data. Somebody else, though, is storing that data. Usually we put our trust into companies to store that data, but what I want to suggest here is that rather than putting our trust in companies to store that data, we should put the trust in ourselves because we actually own that data. Right, that is something we should remember. Everything that someone else measures about you, you actually own. So, it's my hope, maybe because I'm a Canadian, that all of us can come together with this really valuable data that we've been storing, and we can collectively launch that data toward some of the world's most difficulty problems because big data can solve big problems, but I think it can do it the best if it's all of us who are in control. Thank you.

As humans, we are really used to things that are structured as three dimensions. So, we can look at those little off-shoots of conversation, we can find out what exactly happened. And this is an interactive, exploratory tool so we can go through every step in the conversation. We can look at who the people were, what they said, how old they are, where they live, who follows them, and so on, and so on, and so on. So, the Times creates about 6,500 pieces of content every month, and we can model every single one of the conversations that happen around them. And they look somewhat different. Depending on the story and depending on how fast people are talking about it and how far the conversation spreads, these structures, which I call these conversational architectures, end up looking different. So, these projects that I've shown you, I think they all involve the same thing: we can take small pieces of data and by putting them together, we can generate more value, we can do more exciting things with them. But so far we've only talked about Twitter, right? And Twitter isn't all the data. We learned a moment ago that there is tons and tons, tons more data out there. And specifically, I want you to think about one type of data because all of you guys, everybody in this audience, we, we, me as well, are data-making machines. We are producing data all the time. Every single one of us, we're producing data. Somebody else, though, is storing that data. Usually we put our trust into companies to store that data, but what I want to suggest here is that rather than putting our trust in companies to store that data, we should put the trust in ourselves because we actually own that data. Right, that is something we should remember. Everything that someone else measures about you, you actually own. So, it's my hope, maybe because I'm a Canadian, that all of us can come together with this really valuable data that we've been storing, and we can collectively launch that data toward some of the world's most difficulty problems because big data can solve big problems, but I think it can do it the best if it's all of us who are in control. Thank you.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Fourth and nineteen, folks, they've gotta have a play as time's ticking away because they've got to stay in this ball game, they've got to win. They come out lined up in the empty set, three receivers to the right, two to the left. Defense looks like they're gonna to man up with no safety. This is the exact offensive match-up that they want: the best receiver lined up against the linebacker. Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun. He takes a snap, drops three steps, he plants his back foot, he's looking for an opening. There's a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush. He's looking down field. He's got the inside receiver making a cut. He's got a step on the linebacker. Quarterback has a beat on it. He lets the ball go, it's in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender. He's got it beat! He's out in front, racing for the ball! It's coming down! He cradles it at the fifteen! He's at the ten, five! Touchdown! Unbelievable play! Now, wait a minute. Of course, it's believable, it's physics, specifically the differences between scalars and vectors. So, let's just see that replay. "Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun." Stop. See, measurements are defined as two different quantities. Scalars are measurements with only numbers, and vectors are measurements with direction. For example, when that quarterback takes the snap, he's five yards away, but from where? Back from the line of scrimmage, so the five yards by itself is a scalar quantity. When you add a direction, like five yards deep, it becomes a vector quantity. Five yards - scalar, five yards deep - vector. OK, go ahead. "He takes a snap, drops three steps. He plants his back foot, he's looking for an opening. There's a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush." Whoa! Here's a difference between distance and displacement. Distance is a measurement without identifying where you moved. It's a scalar quantity. When the quarterback makes a three-step drop, he moves about three yards back. When he moves about another three yards forward, when he steps up into the pocket, so that quarterback moves a total distance of six yards. That's a distance, that's a scalar. Now, displacement is a vector quantity, describing about how far out of place the object is. So the quarterback dropped back three yards and then moved back forward three yards, he's in the exact same place where he started. So, his displacement is zero yards. Distance - six yards, displacement - zero yards. So, let's look at what happened next. "Quarterback has a beat on it, he let's the ball go! It's in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender." Stop. So, here's speed and velocity, but let's just do one thing at a time. So, speed is measurement without direction, it's a scalar quantity. Velocity is a vector quantity. It is that object's speed, but with a direction of motion. So the receiver accelerates away, gaining both speed and distance. This takes the receiver 5 seconds to run those 50 yards. So his average speed, in any given time, is 10 yards/second. The linebacker tries to keep up, but his overall speed is slower, he only goes 35 yards in those 5 seconds, so his average speed is only 7 yards/second. They're both traveling in a forward direction, so their velocity is also positive. You can't go from resting to your peak speed immediately. You've got to build up to it. This is acceleration. At first the linebacker can keep up with that receiver, but eventually the faster receiver pulls away. That's acceleration, the change in speed over time. Acceleration is a vector quantity. It describes a rate at which an object changes velocity. Like velocity, acceleration is a vector. It happens in a direction. So let's just look at that play just one more time. "Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun." Vector! "He takes a snap, drops three steps, he plants his back foot. He's looking for an opening. There's a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush." Displacement! "He's got the inside receiver making a cut. He's got a step on the linebacker. The quarterback has a beat on it. He let's the ball go! It's in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender!" Velocity! "He's got it beat! He's out in front, racing for the ball! It's coming down! He cradles it at the fifteen, he's at the ten, five!" Acceleration! "Touchdown! Unbelievable play! That was a great play as time expired, resulting in the touchdown and ultimately the win and pure effort." And pure science.

When he moves about another three yards forward, when he steps up into the pocket, so that quarterback moves a total distance of six yards. That's a distance, that's a scalar. Now, displacement is a vector quantity, describing about how far out of place the object is. So the quarterback dropped back three yards and then moved back forward three yards, he's in the exact same place where he started. So, his displacement is zero yards. Distance - six yards, displacement - zero yards. So, let's look at what happened next. "Quarterback has a beat on it, he let's the ball go! It's in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender." Stop. So, here's speed and velocity, but let's just do one thing at a time. So, speed is measurement without direction, it's a scalar quantity. Velocity is a vector quantity. It is that object's speed, but with a direction of motion. So the receiver accelerates away, gaining both speed and distance. This takes the receiver 5 seconds to run those 50 yards. So his average speed, in any given time, is 10 yards/second. The linebacker tries to keep up, but his overall speed is slower, he only goes 35 yards in those 5 seconds, so his average speed is only 7 yards/second. They're both traveling in a forward direction, so their velocity is also positive. You can't go from resting to your peak speed immediately. You've got to build up to it. This is acceleration. At first the linebacker can keep up with that receiver, but eventually the faster receiver pulls away. That's acceleration, the change in speed over time. Acceleration is a vector quantity. It describes a rate at which an object changes velocity. Like velocity, acceleration is a vector. It happens in a direction. So let's just look at that play just one more time. "Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun." Vector! "He takes a snap, drops three steps, he plants his back foot. He's looking for an opening. There's a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush." Displacement! "He's got the inside receiver making a cut. He's got a step on the linebacker. The quarterback has a beat on it. He let's the ball go! It's in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender!" Velocity! "He's got it beat! He's out in front, racing for the ball! It's coming down! He cradles it at the fifteen, he's at the ten, five!" Acceleration! "Touchdown! Unbelievable play! That was a great play as time expired, resulting in the touchdown and ultimately the win and pure effort." And pure science.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Fourth and nineteen, folks, they've gotta have a play as time's ticking away because they've got to stay in this ball game, they've got to win. They come out lined up in the empty set, three receivers to the right, two to the left. Defense looks like they're gonna to man up with no safety. This is the exact offensive match-up that they want: the best receiver lined up against the linebacker. Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun. He takes a snap, drops three steps, he plants his back foot, he's looking for an opening. There's a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush. He's looking down field. He's got the inside receiver making a cut. He's got a step on the linebacker. Quarterback has a beat on it. He lets the ball go, it's in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender. He's got it beat! He's out in front, racing for the ball! It's coming down! He cradles it at the fifteen! He's at the ten, five! Touchdown! Unbelievable play! Now, wait a minute. Of course, it's believable, it's physics, specifically the differences between scalars and vectors. So, let's just see that replay. "Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun." Stop. See, measurements are defined as two different quantities. Scalars are measurements with only numbers, and vectors are measurements with direction. For example, when that quarterback takes the snap, he's five yards away, but from where? Back from the line of scrimmage, so the five yards by itself is a scalar quantity. When you add a direction, like five yards deep, it becomes a vector quantity. Five yards - scalar, five yards deep - vector. OK, go ahead. "He takes a snap, drops three steps. He plants his back foot, he's looking for an opening. There's a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush." Whoa! Here's a difference between distance and displacement. Distance is a measurement without identifying where you moved. It's a scalar quantity. When the quarterback makes a three-step drop, he moves about three yards back. When he moves about another three yards forward, when he steps up into the pocket, so that quarterback moves a total distance of six yards. That's a distance, that's a scalar.

Distance - six yards, displacement - zero yards. So, let's look at what happened next. "Quarterback has a beat on it, he let's the ball go! It's in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender."

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Ever see a medieval painting of baby Jesus sitting or standing on his mother's lap and wonder why she's so large? Paintings like Cimabue's enthroned Madonna with angels or Duccio's Maesta also appear out of proportion. If Mary were to stand up, it seems, the angels in the picture would be as tall as her shin bone, and her torso would be disproportionately small when compared to her legs. Maybe you thought the artist simply wasn't skilled enough to paint realistically or lacked the mathematical skill of perspective. But that's not the full story. To understand why, we need to go back to the late fifth century when the city of Rome was attacked by the Goths. Rome was built in marble and meant to last forever. It represented, for many years, the pinnacle of human civilization, so its destruction left a huge void. Theologians, who preached about a world beyond the physical, began attracting an audience as Rome crumbled, and Christianity started to fill the void left by the Empire. As a replacement for the physical beauty of Rome, Christianity offered a metaphysical beauty of virtue and an eternal heaven that could not be destroyed as Rome had. After the fall of Rome, early medieval theologians turned away from physical beauty, rejecting it in favor of inner-beauty. They maintained that while the physical world was temporary, virtue and religion were permanent. Beautiful objects could lead to a misguided worship of the object rather than the worship of goodness. It is said that the early sixth century preacher, St. Benedict, upon thinking of a beautiful woman, threw himself into a thorn patch, and through his suffering, regained his focus on spiritual beauty. He feared his desire for the beautiful woman would distract him from his desire to love God. As European civilization transitioned away from empires and towards religion, monasteries became the gatekeepers of knowledge, which meant that classical books that praised physical pleasures were not copied or protected. Without protection, they became the victims of natural decay, fire, flooding, or pests. And without the help of monks transcribing new copies, these texts and the philosophies they carried disappeared in Western Europe and were replaced by the works of people like St. Benedict, which brings us back to these depictions of Jesus and Mary. Because Christianity had so fervently rejected physical beauty, these medieval artists purposefully avoided aesthetically pleasing forms. At first, decorations for churches or palaces were limited to interesting geometric patterns, which could be pleasing without inspiring sinful thoughts of physical pleasure. As the medieval period progressed, depictions of Jesus and Mary were tolerated, but the artist clearly made an effort to veil Mary and give her disproportionately large legs, with those enormous shin bones. The fear remained that a beautiful illustration of Mary might inspire the viewer to love the painting or the physical form of Mary, rather than the virtue she's meant to represent. So even though it may be fun to think we can paint more realistically than Cimabuey or Duccio, we need to remember that they had different goals when picking up a paintbrush.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Ever see a medieval painting of baby Jesus sitting or standing on his mother's lap and wonder why she's so large? Paintings like Cimabue's enthroned Madonna with angels or Duccio's Maesta also appear out of proportion. If Mary were to stand up, it seems, the angels in the picture would be as tall as her shin bone, and her torso would be disproportionately small when compared to her legs. Maybe you thought the artist simply wasn't skilled enough to paint realistically or lacked the mathematical skill of perspective. But that's not the full story. To understand why, we need to go back to the late fifth century when the city of Rome was attacked by the Goths. Rome was built in marble and meant to last forever. It represented, for many years, the pinnacle of human civilization, so its destruction left a huge void. Theologians, who preached about a world beyond the physical, began attracting an audience as Rome crumbled, and Christianity started to fill the void left by the Empire. As a replacement for the physical beauty of Rome, Christianity offered a metaphysical beauty of virtue and an eternal heaven that could not be destroyed as Rome had. After the fall of Rome, early medieval theologians turned away from physical beauty, rejecting it in favor of inner-beauty. They maintained that while the physical world was temporary, virtue and religion were permanent. Beautiful objects could lead to a misguided worship of the object rather than the worship of goodness. It is said that the early sixth century preacher, St. Benedict, upon thinking of a beautiful woman, threw himself into a thorn patch, and through his suffering, regained his focus on spiritual beauty. He feared his desire for the beautiful woman would distract him from his desire to love God. As European civilization transitioned away from empires and towards religion, monasteries became the gatekeepers of knowledge, which meant that classical books that praised physical pleasures were not copied or protected. Without protection, they became the victims of natural decay, fire, flooding, or pests. And without the help of monks transcribing new copies, these texts and the philosophies they carried disappeared in Western Europe and were replaced by the works of people like St. Benedict, which brings us back to these depictions of Jesus and Mary. Because Christianity had so fervently rejected physical beauty, these medieval artists purposefully avoided aesthetically pleasing forms. At first, decorations for churches or palaces were limited to interesting geometric patterns, which could be pleasing without inspiring sinful thoughts of physical pleasure. As the medieval period progressed, depictions of Jesus and Mary were tolerated, but the artist clearly made an effort to veil Mary and give her disproportionately large legs, with those enormous shin bones. The fear remained that a beautiful illustration of Mary might inspire the viewer to love the painting or the physical form of Mary, rather than the virtue she's meant to represent. So even though it may be fun to think we can paint more realistically than Cimabuey or Duccio, we need to remember that they had different goals when picking up a paintbrush.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The Oval Office, Inauguration Day, Rose Garden signings, and secret service agents with dark sunglasses and cool wrist radios. For a moment, forget all of it. Toss out everything you know about the President. Now, start over. What would you do if you had to invent the President? That was the question facing the 55 men who got together in secret to draw up the plans for a new American government in the summer of 1787 in Philadelphia, in the same place where the Declaration of Independence had been written eleven years earlier. Declaring independence had been risky business, demanding ferocious courage that put lives and fortunes in jeopardy. But, inventing a new government was no field day either, especially when it's summer and you're in scratchy suits, and the windows are closed because you don't want anybody to hear what you are saying, and the air conditioning doesn't work because it won't be invented for nearly 200 years. And, when you don't agree on things, it gets even hotter. For the framers, the question they argued over most while writing the Constitution and creating three branches of government had to do with the executive department. One man or three to do the job? How long should he serve? What would he really do? Who would pick him? How to get rid of him if he's doing a bad job or he's a crook? And, of course, they all meant him, and he would be a white man. The idea of a woman or an African American, for instance, holding this high office was not a glimmer in their eyes. But the framers knew they needed someone who could take charge, especially in a crisis, like an invasion or a rebellion, or negotiating treaties. Congress was not very good at making such important decisions without debates and delays. But the framers thought America needed a man who was decisive and could act quickly. They called it energy and dispatch. One thing they were dead-set against: there would be no king. They had fought a war against a country with a monarch and were afraid that one man with unchecked powers, in charge of an army, could take over the country. Instead, they settled on a president and laid out his powers in Article 2 of the Constitution. But who would choose him? Not the people, they were too liable to be misled as one framer worried. Not the legislature, that would lead to cabal and factions. Got it: electors, wise, informed men who have time to make a good decision. And if they didn't produce a winner, then the decision would go to one of the other branches of government, the Congress. The House of Representatives would step in and make the choice, which they did in 1801 and 1825. In the long, hot summer of 1787, compromises were made to invent the presidency, like counting slaves as 3/5 of a person, giving the President command of the army but Congress the power to declare war, and unlimited four-year terms. Since then, some of those compromises have been amended and the men in office have sometimes been too strong or too weak. But, if you could start from scratch, how would you redesign the Oval Office?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The Oval Office, Inauguration Day, Rose Garden signings, and secret service agents with dark sunglasses and cool wrist radios. For a moment, forget all of it. Toss out everything you know about the President. Now, start over. What would you do if you had to invent the President? That was the question facing the 55 men who got together in secret to draw up the plans for a new American government in the summer of 1787 in Philadelphia, in the same place where the Declaration of Independence had been written eleven years earlier. Declaring independence had been risky business, demanding ferocious courage that put lives and fortunes in jeopardy. But, inventing a new government was no field day either, especially when it's summer and you're in scratchy suits, and the windows are closed because you don't want anybody to hear what you are saying, and the air conditioning doesn't work because it won't be invented for nearly 200 years. And, when you don't agree on things, it gets even hotter. For the framers, the question they argued over most while writing the Constitution and creating three branches of government had to do with the executive department. One man or three to do the job? How long should he serve? What would he really do? Who would pick him? How to get rid of him if he's doing a bad job or he's a crook? And, of course, they all meant him, and he would be a white man. The idea of a woman or an African American, for instance, holding this high office was not a glimmer in their eyes. But the framers knew they needed someone who could take charge, especially in a crisis, like an invasion or a rebellion, or negotiating treaties. Congress was not very good at making such important decisions without debates and delays. But the framers thought America needed a man who was decisive and could act quickly. They called it energy and dispatch. One thing they were dead-set against: there would be no king. They had fought a war against a country with a monarch and were afraid that one man with unchecked powers, in charge of an army, could take over the country. Instead, they settled on a president and laid out his powers in Article 2 of the Constitution. But who would choose him? Not the people, they were too liable to be misled as one framer worried. Not the legislature, that would lead to cabal and factions. Got it: electors, wise, informed men who have time to make a good decision. And if they didn't produce a winner, then the decision would go to one of the other branches of government, the Congress. The House of Representatives would step in and make the choice, which they did in 1801 and 1825. In the long, hot summer of 1787, compromises were made to invent the presidency, like counting slaves as 3/5 of a person, giving the President command of the army but Congress the power to declare war, and unlimited four-year terms. Since then, some of those compromises have been amended and the men in office have sometimes been too strong or too weak. But, if you could start from scratch, how would you redesign the Oval Office?

so basically we have public leaders public officials who are out of control they're writing bills that are unintelligible and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40,000 pages of regulations total complexity which has a dramatically negative impact on our life if you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits if you're trying to get a small business loan you face a blizzard of paperwork what are we going to do about it i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity transparency and empathy building humanity into communications I've been simplifying things for 30 years I come over the out of the advertising and design business my focus is understanding you people and how you interact with the government to get your benefits how you interact with corporations decide who you're going to do business with and how you view brands so very quickly when President Obama said I don't see why we can't have a one-page plain English consumer credit agreement so I locked myself in a room figured out the content organize the document and wrote it in plain English I've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country this is a real thing now I want one step further and said why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document let's go online so many people might need help in computation working with the Harvard Business School you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payments if you spend sixty two dollars for a meal the longer you take to pay out that loan you see over a period of time using the minimum payment it's 99 dollars and 17 cents how about that you think your bank is going to show that to people but it's going to work it's more effective than just computational aids and what about terms like over the limit perhaps a stealth thing to find it in context tell people what it means when you put it in plain English you almost force the institution to give the people away i default out of that and not put themselves at risk plain english is about changing the content and one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for IBM it's a grid its calendar at such-and-such a date IBM F responsibilities you have responsibilities received very favorably by by business and there's some good news to report today each year one in ten taxpayers receive a notice from the IRS there are 200 million letters that go out running through this typical letter that they had I ran it through my simplicity lab it's pretty unintelligible all the parts of the document in red are not intelligible we looked at doing over a thousand letters that cover 70% of the transactions they're in plain English they've been tested in the laboratory when I run it through my lab this heat mapping shows everything is intelligible and the IRS has introduced the program looking at there's one there are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your attention there's a lot of discussion now about consumer financial protection agency how to mandate simplicity we see all this complexity it's incumbent upon us and this organization I believe to make clarity transparency and empathy a national priority there is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate there is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that aren't intelligible so how are we going to change the world make clarity transparency and simplicity a national priority what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's build a smarter planet

**Transcript**:
I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values now it's generally understood that that questions of morality questions of good and evil and right and wrong are questions about which science officially has no opinion it's thought that science can can help us get what we value but it can never tell us what we ought to value and consequently most people I think most people probably here think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life questions like what is worth living for what is worth dying for what what constitutes a good life so I'm going to argue that this is an illusion of the separation between science and human values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history now it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values because science deals with facts and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres it's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be but I think this is quite clearly untrue but values are a certain kind of fact okay they are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks why don't we feel compassion for rocks so because we don't think rocks can suffer and if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects as indeed we are it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering now the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim this is something we could be right or wrong about if we've misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects okay there is no notion no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and it's possible changes even if you get your values from religion even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes and to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim which of course may or may not be true now to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life for human beings we know that there is a continuum of such facts we know that it's possible to live in a failed state where everything that can go wrong does go wrong where mothers cannot feed their children we're strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration where people are murdered indiscriminately and we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic that - a place where a conference like this is even conceivable and we know we know that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space and what would would adding cholera to the water be a good idea Oh probably not it would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye so that when bad things happen to them they immediately blame their neighbors probably not there are truths to be known about how human communities flourish whether or not we understand these truths and morality relates to these truths so in talking about values we are talking about facts now of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels there's the from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements but if we're going to talk about human well-being we are of necessity talking about the human brain because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain whatever happens after death even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife in this life his personality is rather unfortunate personality is the product of his brain okay and so and the contributions of culture if culture changes us as indeed it does it changes us by changing our brains and and so therefore the whatever cultural variation there is and how human beings flourish can at least in principle be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind neuroscience psychology etc so what I'm arguing is that values reduce to facts to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beans and I think this is a kind of moral landscape with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures both personal and collective and one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access that few people access and these await our discovery perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual perhaps our other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other Minds possibly could access them now let me be clear about what I'm not saying I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question I don't think for instance that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities or whether you can deduct the full cost of Ted as a business expense but if questions affect human wellbeing then they do have answers whether or not we can find them and just admitting this just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish will change the way we talk about morality and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future and for instance there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board heart under raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin and a hundreds of thousands of children instantly are subjected to this every year the locations of these enlightened districts I think will fail to surprise you we're not talking about Connecticut and the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod less we spoil the child this is in proverbs 13 and 20 and I believe 23 but we can ask the obvious question okay is is it a good idea generally speaking to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and and good behavior okay is there any doubt that this question has an answer and that it matters now many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined and seemingly perpetually open to be reconstructing their be a an objective notion of well-being well consider by analogy the concept of physical health the concept of physical health is undefined as we just heard from Michael Spector it has changed over the years when this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably thirty he is now around 80 in the developed world there may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability you know people send you donations when you're in that notice that that the fact that the concept of health is open genuinely open for revision does not make it vacuous the distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science now another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape there may be equivalent ways to thrive there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing now why wouldn't this undermine a an objective morality well think of how we talk about food I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat it's clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food but there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison okay the fact that there are many right answers to the question what is food does not make the decisions not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition now many people worry that that a universal Mara morality would would require moral precepts that that admit of no exceptions so for instance if it's really wrong to lie it must always be wrong to lie and if you can find an exception well then there's no such thing as moral truth now why would we think this consider by analogy the game chess now if you're going to play good chess a principle like don't lose your queen is very good to follow okay but it clearly admits of exceptions with their moments we're losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do there are moments where is the only good thing you can do and yet the chess is a domain of perfect objectivity the fact that there are exceptions here does not does not change that at all now this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere okay consider the great problem of women's bodies what to do about them well this is one thing you can do about them you can cover them up now it is the position generally speaking of our intellectual community that well we might not like this we might think of this as wrong in Boston or Palo Alto who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags who are we to say even that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way okay who are we not to say this who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil and women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as I'm concerned but what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped her father's first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame but just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her what what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing now to say this it's not to say that we have got the the perfect solution in our own society commit for instance this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world now granted for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images but if we are in a reflective mood we can ask is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children probably not okay so so perhaps our someplace on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of a better balance perhaps perhaps there are many such places again we're given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape but the thing to notice is that there'll be many more ways not to be on a peak now the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another and of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind okay not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being and in fact the the endurance of religion as a as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue but the demagogues are right about one thing we need a universal conception of human values now what stands in the way of this well one thing to notice is that we we do something different when talking about morality especially secular academic scientist types when talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives so for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness yeah on the other hand we have someone like Ted Bundy Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women okay so we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say well there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about really right about or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science okay that we you know he likes chocolate he likes vanilla there's there's no there's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other now notice that we don't do this in science on the left you have Edward Witten he's a string theorist if you ask the smartest physicists around who's the smartest physicist around in my experience half of them will say ed Witten the other half will tell you they don't like the question so what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said string theory is bogus you know it doesn't resonate with me it's not how I choose to view the universe the smallest scale I'm not a fan well well nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist I don't understand string theory I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member okay but this is just the point okay whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded that is what it is to have a domain of expertise that is what it is for knowledge to count how have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise or moral talent or moral genius even how have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count how have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering no okay how is how is their ignorance how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being so so this I think is what the world needs now it needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing and morality relates to that domain of facts it is possible for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things which is to say it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality okay we live in it in a in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they will one day mean nothing we live in a world filled with destructive technology and this technology cannot be uninvented it will always be easier to break things than to fix them it seems to me therefore patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in in notions of human wellbeing then then we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads or in the in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes we simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life and to do that we have to admit that these questions have answers thank you very much thank you go ahead of us sir so some combustible material there yeah whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world hearing some of this they've all be doing the screaming with rage thing all right there as well some of them language seems to be is really important here you do when you talk about the veil you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags you know I've lived in the Muslim world spoken with a lot of Muslim women and some of them would say something else they would say no you know this is a celebration of female specialness it helps build that and it's an expression it's a result of the fact that and is arguably a sophisticated psychological view that male lust is not to be trusted ROH I mean can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeing kind of cultural imperialist yeah well I think this is I tried to broach this in a sentence watching the clock ticking but the the question is what is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations and certain and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself and so if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil or a very funny hat or tattoo their faces or do I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under and and so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it especially and when it's 120 degrees out and you're you're wearing a full burqa a lot of people you know want to believe in this this concept of moral progress but can you reconcile that I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with the world that doesn't become one-dimensional well we all have to think the same paint your picture of what you know rolling the clock 50 years forward 100 years forward how you would like to think of the world balancing moral progress with richness well I think once you admit that we are on path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail then you have to admit that that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail so we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it whether they're genetic whether they're how people talk to one another whether they're economic systems and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on on that fact space so everything is not going to be up for grabs it's not going to be like you know veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as as teaching her to be confident and and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women you know so it's it's it's we oh I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that veiling compulsory veiling is a bad idea but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them you know I mean do people love their daughters just as much in these in these systems and I think I think they're right clearly right answers to that and if the results come out that actually they do are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues well yeah modulo one obvious fact that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system so that you can say like because I I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he if he found a boyfriend I chopped his head off and that was the most compassionate thing I can do if you get all those parts

**Transcript**:
I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values now it's generally understood that that questions of morality questions of good and evil and right and wrong are questions about which science officially has no opinion it's thought that science can can help us get what we value but it can never tell us what we ought to value and consequently most people I think most people probably here think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life questions like what is worth living for what is worth dying for what what constitutes a good life so I'm going to argue that this is an illusion of the separation between science and human values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history now it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values because science deals with facts and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres it's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be but I think this is quite clearly untrue but values are a certain kind of fact okay they are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks why don't we feel compassion for rocks so because we don't think rocks can suffer and if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects as indeed we are it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering now the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim this is something we could be right or wrong about if we've misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects okay there is no notion no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and it's possible changes even if you get your values from religion even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes and to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim which of course may or may not be true now to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life for human beings we know that there is a continuum of such facts we know that it's possible to live in a failed state where everything that can go wrong does go wrong where mothers cannot feed their children we're strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration where people are murdered indiscriminately and we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic that - a place where a conference like this is even conceivable and we know we know that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space and what would would adding cholera to the water be a good idea Oh probably not it would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye so that when bad things happen to them they immediately blame their neighbors probably not there are truths to be known about how human communities flourish whether or not we understand these truths and morality relates to these truths so in talking about values we are talking about facts now of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels there's the from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements but if we're going to talk about human well-being we are of necessity talking about the human brain because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain whatever happens after death even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife in this life his personality is rather unfortunate personality is the product of his brain okay and so and the contributions of culture if culture changes us as indeed it does it changes us by changing our brains and and so therefore the whatever cultural variation there is and how human beings flourish can at least in principle be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind neuroscience psychology etc so what I'm arguing is that values reduce to facts to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beans and I think this is a kind of moral landscape with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures both personal and collective and one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access that few people access and these await our discovery perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual perhaps our other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other Minds possibly could access them now let me be clear about what I'm not saying I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question I don't think for instance that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities or whether you can deduct the full cost of Ted as a business expense but if questions affect human wellbeing then they do have answers whether or not we can find them and just admitting this just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish will change the way we talk about morality and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future and for instance there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board heart under raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin and a hundreds of thousands of children instantly are subjected to this every year the locations of these enlightened districts I think will fail to surprise you we're not talking about Connecticut and the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod less we spoil the child this is in proverbs 13 and 20 and I believe 23 but we can ask the obvious question okay is is it a good idea generally speaking to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and and good behavior okay is there any doubt that this question has an answer and that it matters now many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined and seemingly perpetually open to be reconstructing their be a an objective notion of well-being well consider by analogy the concept of physical health the concept of physical health is undefined as we just heard from Michael Spector it has changed over the years when this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably thirty he is now around 80 in the developed world there may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability you know people send you donations when you're in that notice that that the fact that the concept of health is open genuinely open for revision does not make it vacuous the distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science now another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape there may be equivalent ways to thrive there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing now why wouldn't this undermine a an objective morality well think of how we talk about food I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat it's clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food but there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison okay the fact that there are many right answers to the question what is food does not make the decisions not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition now many people worry that that a universal Mara morality would would require moral precepts that that admit of no exceptions so for instance if it's really wrong to lie it must always be wrong to lie and if you can find an exception well then there's no such thing as moral truth now why would we think this consider by analogy the game chess now if you're going to play good chess a principle like don't lose your queen is very good to follow okay but it clearly admits of exceptions with their moments we're losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do there are moments where is the only good thing you can do and yet the chess is a domain of perfect objectivity the fact that there are exceptions here does not does not change that at all now this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere okay consider the great problem of women's bodies what to do about them well this is one thing you can do about them you can cover them up now it is the position generally speaking of our intellectual community that well we might not like this we might think of this as wrong in Boston or Palo Alto who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags who are we to say even that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way okay who are we not to say this who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil and women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as I'm concerned but what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped her father's first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame but just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her what what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing now to say this it's not to say that we have got the the perfect solution in our own society commit for instance this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world now granted for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images but if we are in a reflective mood we can ask is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children probably not okay so so perhaps our someplace on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of a better balance perhaps perhaps there are many such places again we're given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape but the thing to notice is that there'll be many more ways not to be on a peak now the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another and of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind okay not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being and in fact the the endurance of religion as a as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue but the demagogues are right about one thing we need a universal conception of human values now what stands in the way of this well one thing to notice is that we we do something different when talking about morality especially secular academic scientist types when talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives so for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness yeah on the other hand we have someone like Ted Bundy Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women okay so we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say well there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about really right about or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science okay that we you know he likes chocolate he likes vanilla there's there's no there's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other now notice that we don't do this in science on the left you have Edward Witten he's a string theorist if you ask the smartest physicists around who's the smartest physicist around in my experience half of them will say ed Witten the other half will tell you they don't like the question so what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said string theory is bogus you know it doesn't resonate with me it's not how I choose to view the universe the smallest scale I'm not a fan well well nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist I don't understand string theory I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member okay but this is just the point okay whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded that is what it is to have a domain of expertise that is what it is for knowledge to count how have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise or moral talent or moral genius even how have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count how have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering no okay how is how is their ignorance how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being so so this I think is what the world needs now it needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing and morality relates to that domain of facts it is possible for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things which is to say it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality okay we live in it in a in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they will one day mean nothing we live in a world filled with destructive technology and this technology cannot be uninvented it will always be easier to break things than to fix them it seems to me therefore patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in in notions of human wellbeing then then we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads or in the in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes we simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life and to do that we have to admit that these questions have answers thank you very much thank you go ahead of us sir so some combustible material there yeah whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world hearing some of this they've all be doing the screaming with rage thing all right there as well some of them language seems to be is really important here you do when you talk about the veil you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags you know I've lived in the Muslim world spoken with a lot of Muslim women and some of them would say something else they would say no you know this is a celebration of female specialness it helps build that and it's an expression it's a result of the fact that and is arguably a sophisticated psychological view that male lust is not to be trusted ROH I mean can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeing kind of cultural imperialist yeah well I think this is I tried to broach this in a sentence watching the clock ticking but the the question is what is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations and certain and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself and so if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil or a very funny hat or tattoo their faces or do I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under and and so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it especially and when it's 120 degrees out and you're you're wearing a full burqa a lot of people you know want to believe in this this concept of moral progress but can you reconcile that I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with the world that doesn't become one-dimensional well we all have to think the same paint your picture of what you know rolling the clock 50 years forward 100 years forward how you would like to think of the world balancing moral progress with richness well I think once you admit that we are on path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail then you have to admit that that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail so we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it whether they're genetic whether they're how people talk to one another whether they're economic systems and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on on that fact space so everything is not going to be up for grabs it's not going to be like you know veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as as teaching her to be confident and and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women you know so it's it's it's we oh I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that veiling compulsory veiling is a bad idea but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them you know I mean do people love their daughters just as much in these in these systems and I think I think they're right clearly right answers to that and if the results come out that actually they do are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues well yeah modulo one obvious fact that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system so that you can say like because I I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he if he found a boyfriend I chopped his head off and that was the most compassionate thing I can do if you get all those parts aligned yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love but again then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context you know it's all of us in this together it's not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus some this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours we don't have that layout if you know the time thank you that means that

of this as wrong in Boston or Palo Alto who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags who are we to say even that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way okay who are we not to say this who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil and women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as I'm concerned but what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped her father's first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame but just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her what what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing now to say this it's not to say that we have got the the perfect solution in our own society commit for instance this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world now granted for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images but if we are in a reflective mood we can ask is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children probably not okay so so perhaps our someplace on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of a better balance perhaps perhaps there are many such places again we're given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape but the thing to notice is that there'll be many more ways not to be on a peak now the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another and of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind okay not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being and in fact the the endurance of religion as a as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue but the demagogues are right about one thing we need a universal conception of human values now what stands in the way of this well one thing to notice is that we we do something different when talking about morality especially secular academic scientist types when talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives so for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness yeah on the other hand we have someone like Ted Bundy Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women okay so we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say well there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about really right about or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science okay that we you know he likes chocolate he likes vanilla there's there's no there's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other now notice that we don't do this in science on the left you have Edward Witten he's a string theorist if you ask the smartest physicists around who's the smartest physicist around in my experience half of them will say ed Witten the other half will tell you they don't like the question so what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said string theory is bogus you know it doesn't resonate with me it's not how I choose to view the universe the smallest scale I'm not a fan well well nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist I don't understand string theory I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member okay but this is just the point okay whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded that is what it is to have a domain of expertise that is what it is for knowledge to count how have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise or moral talent or moral genius even how have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count how have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering no okay how is how is their ignorance how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being so so this I think is what the world needs now it needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing and morality relates to that domain of facts it is possible for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things which is to say it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality okay we live in it in a in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they will one day mean nothing we live in a world filled with destructive technology and this technology cannot be uninvented it will always be easier to break things than to fix them it seems to me therefore patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in in notions of human wellbeing then then we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads or in the in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes we simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life and to do that we have to admit that these questions have answers thank you very much thank you go ahead of us sir so some combustible material there yeah whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world hearing some of this they've all be doing the screaming with rage thing all right there as well some of them language seems to be is really important here you do when you talk about the veil you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags you know I've lived in the Muslim world spoken with a lot of Muslim women and some of them would say something else they would say no you know this is a celebration of female specialness it helps build that and it's an expression it's a result of the fact that and is arguably a sophisticated psychological view that male lust is not to be trusted ROH I mean can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeing kind of cultural imperialist yeah well I think this is I tried to broach this in a sentence watching the clock ticking but the the question is what is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations and certain and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself and so if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil or a very funny hat or tattoo their faces or do I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under and and so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it especially and when it's 120 degrees out and you're you're wearing a full burqa a lot of people you know want to believe in this this concept of moral progress but can you reconcile that I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with the world that doesn't become one-dimensional well we all have to think the same paint your picture of what you know rolling the clock 50 years forward 100 years forward how you would like to think of the world balancing moral progress with richness well I think once you admit that we are on path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail then you have to admit that that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail so we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it whether they're genetic whether they're how people talk to one another whether they're economic systems and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on on that fact space so everything is not going to be up for grabs it's not going to be like you know veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as as teaching her to be confident and and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women you know so it's it's it's we oh I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that veiling compulsory veiling is a bad idea but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them you know I mean do people love their daughters just as much in these in these systems and I think I think they're right clearly right answers to that and if the results come out that actually they do are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues well yeah modulo one obvious fact that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system so that you can say like because I I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he if he found a boyfriend I chopped his head off and that was the most compassionate thing I can do if you get all those parts aligned yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love but again then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context you know it's all of us in this together it's not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus some this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours we don't have that layout if you know the time thank you that means that really an archaic what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's build a smarter planet

**Transcript**:
I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values now it's generally understood that that questions of morality questions of good and evil and right and wrong are questions about which science officially has no opinion it's thought that science can can help us get what we value but it can never tell us what we ought to value and consequently most people I think most people probably here think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life questions like what is worth living for what is worth dying for what what constitutes a good life so I'm going to argue that this is an illusion of the separation between science and human values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history now it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values because science deals with facts and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres it's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be but I think this is quite clearly untrue but values are a certain kind of fact okay they are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks why don't we feel compassion for rocks so because we don't think rocks can suffer and if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects as indeed we are it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering now the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim this is something we could be right or wrong about if we've misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects okay there is no notion no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and it's possible changes even if you get your values from religion even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes and to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim which of course may or may not be true now to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life for human beings we know that there is a continuum of such facts we know that it's possible to live in a failed state where everything that can go wrong does go wrong where mothers cannot feed their children we're strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration where people are murdered indiscriminately and we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic that - a place where a conference like this is even conceivable and we know we know that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space and what would would adding cholera to the water be a good idea Oh probably not it would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye so that when bad things happen to them they immediately blame their neighbors probably not there are truths to be known about how human communities flourish whether or not we understand these truths and morality relates to these truths so in talking about values we are talking about facts now of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels there's the from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements but if we're going to talk about human well-being we are of necessity talking about the human brain because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain whatever happens after death even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife in this life his personality is rather unfortunate personality is the product of his brain okay and so and the contributions of culture if culture changes us as indeed it does it changes us by changing our brains and and so therefore the whatever cultural variation there is and how human beings flourish can at least in principle be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind neuroscience psychology etc so what I'm arguing is that values reduce to facts to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beans and I think this is a kind of moral landscape with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures both personal and collective and one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access that few people access and these await our discovery perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual perhaps our other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other Minds possibly could access them now let me be clear about what I'm not saying I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question I don't think for instance that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities or whether you can deduct the full cost of Ted as a business expense but if questions affect human wellbeing then they do have answers whether or not we can find them and just admitting this just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish will change the way we talk about morality and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future and for instance there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board heart under raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin and a hundreds of thousands of children instantly are subjected to this every year the locations of these enlightened districts I think will fail to surprise you we're not talking about Connecticut and the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod less we spoil the child this is in proverbs 13 and 20 and I believe 23 but we can ask the obvious question okay is is it a good idea generally speaking to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and and good behavior okay is there any doubt that this question has an answer and that it matters now many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined and seemingly perpetually open to be reconstructing their be a an objective notion of well-being well consider by analogy the concept of physical health the concept of physical health is undefined as we just heard from Michael Spector it has changed over the years when this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably thirty he is now around 80 in the developed world there may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability you know people send you donations when you're in that notice that that the fact that the concept of health is open genuinely open for revision does not make it vacuous the distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science now another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape there may be equivalent ways to thrive there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing now why wouldn't this undermine a an objective morality well think of how we talk about food I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat it's clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food but there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison okay the fact that there are many right answers to the question what is food does not make the decisions not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition now many people worry that that a universal Mara morality would would require moral precepts that that admit of no exceptions so for instance if it's really wrong to lie it must always be wrong to lie and if you can find an exception well then there's no such thing as moral truth now why would we think this consider by analogy the game chess now if you're going to play good chess a principle like don't lose your queen is very good to follow okay but it clearly admits of exceptions with their moments we're losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do there are moments where is the only good thing you can do and yet the chess is a domain of perfect objectivity the fact that there are exceptions here does not does not change that at all now this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere okay consider the great problem of women's bodies what to do about them well this is one thing you can do about them you can cover them up now it is the position generally speaking of our intellectual community that well we might not like this we might think of this as wrong in Boston or Palo Alto who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags who are we to say even that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way okay who are we not to say this who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil and women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as I'm concerned but what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped her father's first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame but just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her what what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing now to say this it's not to say that we have got the the perfect solution in our own society commit for instance this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world now granted for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images but if we are in a reflective mood we can ask is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to

**Transcript**:
I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values now it's generally understood that that questions of morality questions of good and evil and right and wrong are questions about which science officially has no opinion it's thought that science can can help us get what we value but it can never tell us what we ought to value and consequently most people I think most people probably here think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life questions like what is worth living for what is worth dying for what what constitutes a good life so I'm going to argue that this is an illusion of the separation between science and human values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history now it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values because science deals with facts and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres it's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be but I think this is quite clearly untrue but values are a certain kind of fact okay they are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks why don't we feel compassion for rocks so because we don't think rocks can suffer and if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects as indeed we are it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering now the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim this is something we could be right or wrong about if we've misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects okay there is no notion no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and it's possible changes even if you get your values from religion even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes and to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim which of course may or may not be true now to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life for human beings we know that there is a continuum of such facts we know that it's possible to live in a failed state where everything that can go wrong does go wrong where mothers cannot feed their children we're strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration where people are murdered indiscriminately and we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic that - a place where a conference like this is even conceivable and we know we know that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space and what would would adding cholera to the water be a good idea Oh probably not it would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye so that when bad things happen to them they immediately blame their neighbors probably not there are truths to be known about how human communities flourish whether or not we understand these truths and morality relates to these truths so in talking about values we are talking about facts now of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels there's the from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements but if we're going to talk about human well-being we are of necessity talking about the human brain because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain whatever happens after death even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife in this life his personality is rather unfortunate personality is the product of his brain okay and so and the contributions of culture if culture changes us as indeed it does it changes us by changing our brains and and so therefore the whatever cultural variation there is and how human beings flourish can at least in principle be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind neuroscience psychology etc so what I'm arguing is that values reduce to facts to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beans and I think this is a kind of moral landscape with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures both personal and collective and one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access that few people access and these await our discovery perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual perhaps our other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other Minds possibly could access them now let me be clear about what I'm not saying I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question I don't think for instance that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities or whether you can deduct the full cost of Ted as a business expense but if questions affect human wellbeing then they do have answers whether or not we can find them and just admitting this just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish will change the way we talk about morality and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future and for instance there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board heart under raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin and a hundreds of thousands of children instantly are subjected to this every year the locations of these enlightened districts I think will fail to surprise you we're not talking about Connecticut and the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod less we spoil the child this is in proverbs 13 and 20 and I believe 23 but we can ask the obvious question okay is is it a good idea generally speaking to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and and good behavior okay is there any doubt that this question has an answer and that it matters now many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined and seemingly perpetually open to be reconstructing their be a an objective notion of well-being well consider by analogy the concept of physical health the concept of physical health is undefined as we just heard from Michael Spector it has changed over the years when this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably thirty he is now around 80 in the developed world there may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability you know people send you donations when you're in that notice that that the fact that the concept of health is open genuinely open for revision does not make it vacuous the distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science now another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape there may be equivalent ways to thrive there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing now why wouldn't this undermine a an objective morality well think of how we talk about food I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat it's clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food but there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison okay the fact that there are many right answers to the question what is food does not make the decisions not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition now many people worry that that a universal Mara morality would would require moral precepts that that admit of no exceptions so for instance if it's really wrong to lie it must always be wrong to lie and if you can find an exception well then there's no such thing as moral truth now why would we think this consider by analogy the game chess now if you're going to play good chess a principle like don't lose your queen is very good to follow okay but it clearly admits of exceptions with their moments we're losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do there are moments where is the only good thing you can do and yet the chess is a domain of perfect objectivity the fact that there are exceptions here does not does not change that at all now this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere okay consider the great problem of women's bodies what to do about them well this is one thing you can do about them you can cover them up now it is the position generally speaking of our intellectual community that well we might not like this we might think of this as wrong in Boston or Palo Alto who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags who are we to say even that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way okay who are we not to say this who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil and women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as I'm concerned but what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped her father's first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame but just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her what what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing now to say this it's not to say that we have got the the perfect solution in our own society commit for instance this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world now granted for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images but if we are in a reflective mood we can ask is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children probably not okay so so perhaps our someplace on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of a better balance perhaps perhaps there are many such places again we're given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape but the thing to notice is that there'll be many more ways not to be on a peak now the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another and of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind okay not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being and in fact the the endurance of religion as a as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue but the demagogues are right about one thing we need a universal conception of human values now what stands in the way of this well one thing to notice is that we we do something different when talking about morality especially secular academic scientist types when talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives so for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness yeah on the other hand we have someone like Ted Bundy Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women okay so we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say well there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about really right about or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science okay that we you know he likes chocolate he likes vanilla there's there's no there's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other now notice that we don't do this in science on the left you have Edward Witten he's a string theorist if you ask the smartest physicists around who's the smartest physicist around in my experience half of them will say ed Witten the other half will tell you they don't like the question so what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said string theory is bogus you know it doesn't resonate with me it's not how I choose to view the universe the smallest scale I'm not a fan well well nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist I don't understand string theory I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member okay but this is just the point okay whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded that is what it is to have a domain of expertise that is what it is for knowledge to count how have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise or moral talent or moral genius even how have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count how have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering no okay how is how is their ignorance how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being so so this I think is what the world needs now it needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing and morality relates to that domain of facts it is possible for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things which is to say it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality okay we live in it in a in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they will one day mean nothing we live in a world filled with destructive technology and this technology cannot be uninvented it will always be easier to break things than to fix them it seems to me therefore patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in in notions of human wellbeing then then we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads or in the in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes we simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life and to do that we have to admit that these questions have answers thank you very much thank you go ahead of us sir so some combustible material there yeah whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world hearing some of this they've all be doing the screaming with rage thing all right there as well some of them language seems to be is really important here you do when you talk about the veil you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags you know I've lived in the Muslim world spoken with a lot of Muslim women and some of them would say something else they would say no you know this is a celebration of female specialness it helps build that and it's an expression it's a result of the fact that and is arguably a sophisticated psychological view that male lust is not to be trusted ROH I mean can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeing kind of cultural imperialist yeah well I think this is I tried to broach this in a sentence watching the clock ticking but the the question is what is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations and certain and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself and so if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil or a very funny hat or tattoo their faces or do I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under and and so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it especially and when it's 120 degrees out and you're you're wearing a full burqa a lot of people you know want to believe in this this concept of moral progress but can you reconcile that I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with the world that doesn't become one-dimensional well we all have to think the same paint your picture of what you know rolling the clock 50 years forward 100 years forward how you would like to think of the world balancing moral progress with richness well I think once you admit that we are on path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail then you have to admit that that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail so we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it whether they're genetic whether they're how people talk to one another whether they're economic systems and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on on that fact space so everything is not going to be up for grabs it's not going to be like you know veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as as teaching her to be confident and and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women you know so it's it's it's we oh I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that veiling compulsory veiling is a bad idea but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them you know I mean do people love their daughters just as much in these in these systems and I think I think they're right clearly right answers to that and if the results come out that actually they do are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues well yeah modulo one obvious fact that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system so that you can say like because I I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he if he found a boyfriend I chopped his head off and that was the most compassionate thing I can do if you get all those parts aligned yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love but again then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context you know it's all of us in this together it's not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus some this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours we don't have that layout if you know the time thank you that means that really an archaic what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's build a smarter planet

[Music] I built my first myself a guitar which was using a cooking I mean a container that used to contain cooking oil and fishing line and for me it was just more of a toy to play with I didn't know that it was going to take me to this hi I like the people to sort of like really come and relax because this is going to be more of a fully balanced plate of music and poetry written in the sky it's not just only about you know the message and all that I think the music as well has to P the whole feeling you know and having those hunting Melodies and everything and also because I'm singing in quite a lot of different languages I use several languages in my work uh because I think language as well plays important role in the society if you learn to speak other people's language you learn more to respect them and to understand their culture and this is also what I'm trying to sort of you know people to see that you know when I'm singing in different languages I'm trying not just you know my message or my music to be accessible to every listener uh but U it's something that everybody has has to to feel it and live it you know the footprints of a painful history your body is shaking I remember one woman uh after the show they came and was like the message about you know forgiveness and all that it's like you know you were talking to me I hated my mother and after hearing this you know um I think I'm going to have the cats now to go and ask for forgiveness if you learn to forgive you learn more to release more calmness within the innermost of yourself and to come more free you know it's like a it's like a a diamond diamond you know uh but if you don't forgive uh you become like a bitter leaf that can just be squashed or be swept away by the wind anytime so forgiveness is more important it's more about you the forgiver not those of forgiving [Music] sing in uh Amanda the film when I met the the the director Le he first came to me he was he was sort of like looking for protest music uh and um the the whole thing sort of changed you know into the Amanda thing which is uh the film and what I like about it is that you know the reality about it nothing it's sort of like real stage or script writed or whatever it's real I took him to quite a lot of different places where things were happening in Mass funerals in political rallies and all that and uh also just to show that you know music really played quite a lot of important role uh without music you know I think uh the world out there wouldn't have known uh what was really happening you know back in South Africa with us music for me and at my country music has played quite a lot of a important role uh when I grew up of course I grew up being a happy uh kid and I didn't know that there was any imbalances in in my country until 1976 you know this so to Uprising came and that's when I started you know asking questions what was happening and that's when my political uh education started the confusion and the frustration is checking the youth know my country who are a bit more ignorant about where we come from where we are now and uh done something that really uh worries me is that they forgot you know that the Privileges uh or the rights that they having today people fought for and people died for and in some way they need some kind of a cultural [Music] revolution at first the reality about it this album was supposed to be an acoustic album uh because the people have been performing quite a lot solo you know and people just love that accent of acoustic and voes voice and they asking me when are you going to sort of come up with with a solo album because this is what we like likeing on you so this album was much more focused on that but in some way you know the songs or the music really uh directed themselves where they wanted to go and I had to follow that I was very much you know fortunate and honor that to have uh the respectable Mr Dave Matthews um who really helped me quite a lot also you know to be released here in the state and of course that was just a musical decision nothing else and uh I have also the respectable Baba Joseph shabala from ladies with black mambas who also guest in the album one uh big thing that I'm going to do here is um uh is um a show that I'll be doing in um La where is to organize you know um how can I put it English English

**Transcript**:
so I've known a lot of fish in my life I've loved only two that first one was it was more like a passionate affair it was a beautiful fish flavorful textured meaty the best seller on the menu what a fish even better it was farm raised to the suppose that highest standards of sustainability so you could feel good about selling it I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months one day the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm sustainability absolutely I said here was a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for our chefs how do we keep fish on our menus for the past 50 years we've been fishing the Seas like we clear-cut forests it's hard to overstate the destruction 90% of large fish the ones we love the tunas the halibuts the Salmons swordfish if collapse those nothing left so for better for worse aquaculture fish farming it's giving a part of our future a lot of arguments against it fish farms pollute most of them do anyway and they're inefficient take tuna a major drawback it's got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to 1 that means it takes 15 pounds of wild fish to get you one pound a farm tuna not very sustainable it doesn't taste very good either so here finally was a company trying to do it right I wanted to support him the day before the event I called the head of PR for the company let's call him Don Don I said just to get the facts straight you guys are famous for for farming so far out to see you you don't pollute that's right he said we're so far out the waste from our fish gets distributed not concentrated and then he added or basically a world unto ourselves that feed conversion ratio 2.5 to 1 he said best in the business 2.5 to one great like 2.5 what what do you feed sustainable proteins he said great I said got off the phone and that night I was lying in bed and I thought what the hell is a sustainable protein so the next day just before the event I called Don I said Don what are some examples of sustainable proteins said he didn't know he would ask around well I got on the phone with a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally I got on the phone with the head biologist let's call him Don to Don I said what are some examples of sustainable proteins well he mentioned some algie's and some fish meals and then he said chicken pellets it's a chicken pellets he said yeah a feathered skin bone meal scraps dried and processed in defeat I said what percentage of your feed is chicken thinking you know two percent that's about 30 percent he said I said Don what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish there is a long pause on the line and he said there's just too much chicken in the world okay I fell out of love with this fish now not because I'm some self-righteous goody two-shoes foodie I actually am now I fell out of love with this fish because I swear to God after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken this second fish it's different kind of love story it's the romantic kind the kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain a journalist friend have been talking about this fish for a long time she kind of set us up okay it came to the table a bright almost shimmering white color the chef's had overcooked it like twice over okay amazingly it was still delicious who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked I can't but this guy can't let's call him Miguel actually his name is Miguel and no he didn't cooked the fish and he's not a chef at least in the way that you and I understand it he's a biologist at vector La Palma it's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain it's at the tip of the Guadalcanal rêveur until the 1980s the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians they raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands they did it by draining the land they built this intricate series of canals and they pushed water off the land and out into the river well they couldn't make it work not economically and ecologically it was a disaster killed like 90% of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds and so in 1982 a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do they reversed the flow of water they literally flipped the switch instead of pushing water out they use the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canals they created a 27,000 acre fish pond vast mullet shrimp eel and in the process Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction the farms incredible I mean you've never seen anything like this you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland I was there not long ago with Miguel he's an amazing guy like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee okay there we are slogging through the wetland you know I'm panting and sweating up mud up to my knees and Miguel was calmly conducting a biology lecture here he's pointing out a rare black shoulder-height now he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton and here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian giraffe it turns out Miguel spent the better part of his career in the mikuni National Park in Africa I asked him how he became such an expert on fish I said fish I didn't know anything about fish I'm an expert in relationships and then he's off launching it to more talk about rare birds and algie's and strange aquatic plants and don't get me wrong I was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged its kind of thing you know it's great but I was in love and my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before so I interrupted my said Miguel what makes your fish taste so good he pointed at the algae I know dude the algae the phytoplankton the relationships this is amazing right but what are your fish eating and what's the feed conversion ratio we goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what the beating in the wild the plant biomass the phytoplankton zooplankton it's what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it's totally self renewing there is no feed ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals later that day I was driving around this property with Miguel and I asked him I said for a place it seems so natural unlike any fish for Alligator Farm I'd ever been at how do you measure success well at that moment it's as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see that success he said look at their bellies pink they're feasting cheese thing let's totally confuse I said Miguel aren't they feasting on your fish yes he said we lose 20% of our fish and fish eggs to birds right well last year this property had 600,000 Birds on it more than 250 different species it's become today the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe I said Miguel isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm he shook his head no he said we farm extensively not intensively this is an ecological network the flamingoes eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the phytoplankton so the pink of the belly the better the system okay so let's review a farm that doesn't feed its animals and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldn't even be there in the first place they brood in a town 150 miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nests every morning they fly 150 miles into the farm and every evening they file 150 miles back they do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway a 92 no kidding you know I was imagining a march of the Penguins thing you know so I looked at Miguel I said Miguel do they fly 150 miles to the farm and then do they fly 150 miles back at night did they do that for the children he looked at me like I just quoted a Whitney Houston song he said no they do it cuz the food's better you know I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish which was delicious and I don't like fish skin I don't like it seared I don't like it crispy it's that acrid tar-like flavor I almost never cook with it yet when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain it tasted not at all like fish skin it tasted sweet and clean like you were taking a bite of the ocean I mentioned that to Miguel he nodded he said the skin acts like a sponge it's the last defense before anything enters the body it evolved to soak up impurities and then he added but our water has no impurities okay a farm that doesn't feed its fish a farm the measures of success by the success of its predators and then I realized when he says a farm that has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River it's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days chemical contaminants pesticide runoff and when it works its way through the system and leaves the water it's cleaner than when it entered the system is so healthy it purifies the water so not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals not just a farm that measures the health its success by the health of its predators but a farm that's literally a water purification plant and not just for those fish but for you and me as well because when that water leaves it dumps out into the Atlantic dropped in the ocean I know but I'll take it and so should you because this love story however romantic is also instructive you might say it's a recipe for the future of good food whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle what we need now is a radically new conception of Agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good right look for a lot of people that's a bit too radical we're not realists us foodies we're lovers we love farmers markets we love small family farms we talk about local food we eat organic and when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food someone somewhere stands up and says hey guy I love pink flamingos but how you gonna feed the world how are you gonna feed the world can I be honest I don't love that question no not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world 1 billion people will go hungry today 1 billion that's more than ever before because of gross inequalities and distribution not tonnage now I don't love this question because it's determine the logic of our food system for last 50 years feed grain to herbivores pesticides to monocultures chemicals to soil chicken to fish and all along agribusiness has simply asked if we're feeding more people more cheaply how terrible could that be that's been the motivation it's been the justification it's been the business plan of American agriculture we should call it what it is a business in liquidation a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible that's not a business and is agriculture our breadbasket is threatened today not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources not by the latest combine and tractor invention but by fertile land not fight pumps but by fresh water not by chainsaws but by forests and not by fishing boats and nets but by fish in the sea want to feed the world let's start by asking how am I gonna feed ourselves or better how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself to do that don't look at the agribusiness model for the future it's really old and it's tired it's high on capital chemistry and machines and it's never produced anything really good to eat instead let's look to the ecological model that's the one that relies on 2 billion years of on-the-job experience look to Miguel farmers like Miguel farms that aren't worlds unto themselves farms that restore instead of deplete farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively farmers that are not just producers but experts in relationships because they're the ones that are experts in flavor - and if I'm going to be really honest there are better chef than I'll ever be you know I'm ok with that because if that's the future of good food it's going to be delicious thank you what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBMer let's build a smarter planet

is a lot of birds and so in 1982 a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do they reversed the flow of water they literally flipped the switch instead of pushing water out they use the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canals they created a 27,000 acre fish pond vast mullet shrimp eel and in the process Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction the farms incredible I mean you've never seen anything like this you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland I was there not long ago with Miguel he's an amazing guy like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee okay there we are slogging through the wetland you know I'm panting and sweating up mud up to my knees and Miguel was calmly conducting a biology lecture here he's pointing out a rare black shoulder-height now he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton and here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian giraffe it turns out Miguel spent the better part of his career in the mikuni National Park in Africa I asked him how he became such an expert on fish I said fish I didn't know anything about fish I'm an expert in relationships and then he's off launching it to more talk about rare birds and algie's and strange aquatic plants and don't get me wrong I was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged its kind of thing you know it's great but I was in love and my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before so I interrupted my said Miguel what makes your fish taste so good he pointed at the algae I know dude the algae the phytoplankton the relationships this is amazing right but what are your fish eating and what's the feed conversion ratio we goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what the beating in the wild the plant biomass the phytoplankton zooplankton it's what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it's totally self renewing there is no feed ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals later that day I was driving around this property with Miguel and I asked him I said for a place it seems so natural unlike any fish for Alligator Farm I'd ever been at how do you measure success well at that moment it's as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see that success he said look at their bellies pink they're feasting cheese thing let's totally confuse I said Miguel aren't they feasting on your fish yes he said we lose 20% of our fish and fish eggs to birds right well last year this property had 600,000 Birds on it more than 250 different species it's become today the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe I said Miguel isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm he shook his head no he said we farm extensively not intensively this is an ecological network the flamingoes eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the phytoplankton so the pink of the belly the better the system okay so let's review a farm that doesn't feed its animals and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldn't even be there in the first place they brood in a town 150 miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nests every morning they fly 150 miles into the farm and every evening they file 150 miles back they do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway a 92 no kidding you know I was imagining a march of the Penguins thing you know so I looked at Miguel I said Miguel do they fly 150 miles to the farm and then do they fly 150 miles back at night did they do that for the children he looked at me like I just quoted a Whitney Houston song he said no they do it cuz the food's better you know I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish which was delicious and I don't like fish skin I don't like it seared I don't like it crispy it's that acrid tar-like flavor I almost never cook with it yet when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain it tasted not at all like fish skin it tasted sweet and clean like you were taking a bite of the ocean I mentioned that to Miguel he nodded he said the skin acts like a sponge it's the last defense before anything enters the body it evolved to soak up impurities and then he added but our water has no impurities okay a farm that doesn't feed its fish a farm the measures of success by the success of its predators and then I realized when he says a farm that has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River it's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days chemical contaminants pesticide runoff and when it works its way through the system and leaves the water it's cleaner than when it entered the system is so healthy it purifies the water so not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals not just a farm that measures the health its success by the health of its predators but a farm that's literally a water purification plant and not just for those fish but for you and me as well because when that water leaves it dumps out into the Atlantic dropped in the ocean I know but I'll take it and so should you because this love story however romantic is also instructive you might say it's a recipe for the future of good food whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle what we need now is a radically new conception of Agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good right look for a lot of people that's a bit too radical we're not realists us foodies we're lovers we love farmers markets we love small family farms we talk about local food we eat organic and when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food someone somewhere stands up and says hey guy I love pink flamingos but how you gonna feed the world how are you gonna feed the world can I be honest I don't love that question no not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world 1 billion people will go hungry today 1 billion that's more than ever before because of gross inequalities and distribution not tonnage now I don't love this question because it's determine the logic of our food system for last 50 years feed grain to herbivores pesticides to monocultures chemicals to soil chicken to fish and all along agribusiness has simply asked if we're feeding more people more cheaply how terrible could that be that's been the motivation it's been the justification it's been the business plan of American agriculture we should call it what it is a business in liquidation a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible that's not a business and is agriculture our breadbasket is threatened today not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources not by the latest combine and tractor invention but by fertile land not fight pumps but by fresh water not by chainsaws but by forests and not by fishing boats and nets but by fish in the sea want to feed the world let's start by asking how am I gonna feed ourselves or better how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself to do that don't look at the agribusiness model for the future it's really old and it's tired it's high on capital chemistry and machines and it's never produced anything really good to eat instead let's look to the ecological model that's the one that relies on 2 billion years of on-the-job experience look to Miguel farmers like Miguel farms that aren't worlds unto themselves farms that restore instead of deplete farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively farmers that are not just producers but experts in relationships because they're the ones that are experts in flavor - and if I'm going to be really honest there are better chef than I'll ever be you know I'm ok with that because if that's the future of good food it's going to be delicious thank you what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBMer let's build a smarter planet

**Transcript**:
so I've known a lot of fish in my life I've loved only two that first one was it was more like a passionate affair it was a beautiful fish flavorful textured meaty the best seller on the menu what a fish even better it was farm raised to the suppose that highest standards of sustainability so you could feel good about selling it I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months one day the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm sustainability absolutely I said here was a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for our chefs how do we keep fish on our menus for the past 50 years we've been fishing the Seas like we clear-cut forests it's hard to overstate the destruction 90% of large fish the ones we love the tunas the halibuts the Salmons swordfish if collapse those nothing left so for better for worse aquaculture fish farming it's giving a part of our future a lot of arguments against it fish farms pollute most of them do anyway and they're inefficient take tuna a major drawback it's got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to 1 that means it takes 15 pounds of wild fish to get you one pound a farm tuna not very sustainable it doesn't taste very good either so here finally was a company trying to do it right I wanted to support him the day before the event I called the head of PR for the company let's call him Don Don I said just to get the facts straight you guys are famous for for farming so far out to see you you don't pollute that's right he said we're so far out the waste from our fish gets distributed not concentrated and then he added or basically a world unto ourselves that feed conversion ratio 2.5 to 1 he said best in the business 2.5 to one great like 2.5 what what do you feed sustainable proteins he said great I said got off the phone and that night I was lying in bed and I thought what the hell is a sustainable protein so the next day just before the event I called Don I said Don what are some examples of sustainable proteins said he didn't know he would ask around well I got on the phone with a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally I got on the phone with the head biologist let's call him Don to Don I said what are some examples of sustainable proteins well he mentioned some algie's and some fish meals and then he said chicken pellets it's a chicken pellets he said yeah a feathered skin bone meal scraps dried and processed in defeat I said what percentage of your feed is chicken thinking you know two percent that's about 30 percent he said I said Don what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish there is a long pause on the line and he said there's just too much chicken in the world okay I fell out of love with this fish now not because I'm some self-righteous goody two-shoes foodie I actually am now I fell out of love with this fish because I swear to God after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken this second fish it's different kind of love story it's the romantic kind the kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain a journalist friend have been talking about this fish for a long time she kind of set us up okay it came to the table a bright almost shimmering white color the chef's had overcooked it like twice over okay amazingly it was still delicious who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked I can't but this guy can't let's call him Miguel actually his name is Miguel and no he didn't cooked the fish and he's not a chef at least in the way that you and I understand it he's a biologist at vector La Palma it's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain it's at the tip of the Guadalcanal

biomass the phytoplankton zooplankton it's what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it's totally self renewing there is no feed ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals later that day I was driving around this property with Miguel and I asked him I said for a place it seems so natural unlike any fish for Alligator Farm I'd ever been at how do you measure success well at that moment it's as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see that success he said look at their bellies pink they're feasting cheese thing let's totally confuse I said Miguel aren't they feasting on your fish yes he said we lose 20% of our fish and fish eggs to birds right well last year this property had 600,000 Birds on it more than 250 different species it's become today the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe I said Miguel isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm he shook his head no he said we farm extensively not intensively this is an ecological network the flamingoes eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the phytoplankton so the pink of the belly the better the system okay so let's review a farm that doesn't feed its animals and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldn't even be there in the first place they brood in a town 150 miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nests every morning they fly 150 miles into the farm and every evening they file 150 miles back they do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway a 92 no kidding you know I was imagining a march of the Penguins thing you know so I looked at Miguel I said Miguel do they fly 150 miles to the farm and then do they fly 150 miles back at night did they do that for the children he looked at me like I just quoted a Whitney Houston song he said no they do it cuz the food's better you know I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish which was delicious and I don't like fish skin I don't like it seared I don't like it crispy it's that acrid tar-like flavor I almost never cook with it yet when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain it tasted not at all like fish skin it tasted sweet and clean like you were taking a bite of the ocean I mentioned that to Miguel he nodded he said the skin acts like a sponge it's the last defense before anything enters the body it evolved to soak up impurities and then he added but our water has no impurities okay a farm that doesn't feed its fish a farm the measures of success by the success of its predators and then I realized when he says a farm that has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River it's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days chemical contaminants pesticide runoff and when it works its way through the system and leaves the water it's cleaner than when it entered the system is so healthy it purifies the water so not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals not just a farm that measures the health its success by the health of its predators but a farm that's literally a water purification plant and not just for those fish but for you and me as well because when that water leaves it dumps out into the Atlantic dropped in the ocean I know but I'll take it and so should you because this love story however romantic is also instructive you might say it's a recipe for the future of good food whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle what we need now is a radically new conception of Agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good right look for a lot of people that's a bit too radical we're not realists us foodies we're lovers we love farmers markets we love small family farms we talk about local food we eat organic and when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food someone somewhere stands up and says hey guy I love pink flamingos but how you gonna feed the world how are you gonna feed the world can I be honest I don't love that question no not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world 1 billion people will go hungry today 1 billion that's more than ever before because of gross inequalities and distribution not tonnage now I don't love this question because it's determine the logic of our food system for last 50 years feed grain to herbivores pesticides to monocultures chemicals to soil chicken to fish and all along agribusiness has simply asked if we're feeding more people more cheaply how terrible could that be that's been the motivation it's been the justification it's been the business plan of American agriculture we should call it what it is a business in liquidation a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible that's not a business and is agriculture our breadbasket is threatened today not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources not by the latest combine and tractor invention but by fertile land not fight pumps but by fresh water not by chainsaws but by forests and not by fishing boats and nets but by fish in the sea want to feed the world let's start by asking how am I gonna feed ourselves or better how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself to do that don't look at the agribusiness model for the future it's really old and it's tired it's high on capital chemistry and machines and it's never produced anything really good to eat instead let's look to the ecological model that's the one that relies on 2 billion years of on-the-job experience look to Miguel farmers like Miguel farms that aren't worlds unto themselves farms that restore instead of deplete farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively farmers that are not just producers but experts in relationships because they're the ones that are experts in flavor - and if I'm going to be really honest there are better chef than I'll ever be you know I'm ok with that because if that's the future of good food it's going to be delicious thank you what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBMer let's build a smarter planet

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You might have heard that we're running out of fresh water. This might sound strange to you because, if you live in a place where water flows freely from the tap or shower at any time, it sure doesn't seem like a big deal. It's just there, right? Wrong! The only obvious thing about fresh water is how much we need it. Because it's essential to life, we need to think about it carefully. Right now, at this very moment, some people, women and girls in particular, walk hours and miles per day to get fresh water, and even then, it may not be clean. Every 15 seconds, a child dies due to water-born diseases. This is tragic! The most compelling reasons to think about fresh water, therefore, have to do with what we might call the global common good. This is not something we normally think about, but it means recognizing how much fresh water matters for the flourishing of human and non-human life on Earth now and in the future. How do we think about something as local as our faucets and as global as fresh water? Is there a connection between them? Many people assume that fresh water shortages are due to individual wastefulness: running the water while you brush your teeth, for example, or taking really long showers. Most of us assume, therefore, that water shortages can be fixed by improving our personal habits: taking shorter showers or turning off the water while we brush our teeth. But, global fresh water scarcity neither starts nor ends in your shower. Globally, domestic use of fresh water accounts for only 8% of consumption, 8%!! Compare that to the 70% that goes to agriculture and the 22% that goes to industrial uses. Now, hold up - you're not off the hook! Individual habits are still part of the puzzle. You should still cultivate water virtue in your daily life, turn off the tap when you brush your teeth. But still, it's true. Taking shorter showers won't solve global problems, which is too bad. It would be much more straightforward and easier if virtuous, individual actions could do the trick. You'd just stand there for 30 seconds less, and you'd be done with that irksome, planet-saving task for the day. Well, that's not so much the case. Agricultural and industrial patterns of water use need serious attention. How do our societies value water? Distribute it? Subsidize its use in agriculture? Incentivize its consumption or pollution? These are all questions that stem from how we think about fresh water's value. Is it an economic commodity? A human right? A public good? Nobel prize winners, global water justice activists, transnational institutions like the United Nations, and even the Catholic Church are at work on the issue. But, it's tricky, too, because the business of water became very profitable in the 20th century. And profit is not the same thing as the common good. We need to figure out how to value fresh water as a public good, something that's vital for human and non-human life, now and in the future. Now that's a virtuous, collective task that goes far beyond your shower.

Agricultural and industrial patterns of water use need serious attention. How do our societies value water? Distribute it? Subsidize its use in agriculture? Incentivize its consumption or pollution? These are all questions that stem from how we think about fresh water's value. Is it an economic commodity? A human right? A public good? Nobel prize winners, global water justice activists, transnational institutions like the United Nations, and even the Catholic Church are at work on the issue. But, it's tricky, too, because the business of water became very profitable in the 20th century. And profit is not the same thing as the common good. We need to figure out how to value fresh water as a public good, something that's vital for human and non-human life, now and in the future. Now that's a virtuous, collective task that goes far beyond your shower.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You might have heard that we're running out of fresh water. This might sound strange to you because, if you live in a place where water flows freely from the tap or shower at any time, it sure doesn't seem like a big deal. It's just there, right? Wrong! The only obvious thing about fresh water is how much we need it. Because it's essential to life, we need to think about it carefully. Right now, at this very moment, some people, women and girls in particular, walk hours and miles per day to get fresh water, and even then, it may not be clean. Every 15 seconds, a child dies due to water-born diseases. This is tragic! The most compelling reasons to think about fresh water, therefore, have to do with what we might call the global common good. This is not something we normally think about, but it means recognizing how much fresh water matters for the flourishing of human and non-human life on Earth now and in the future. How do we think about something as local as our faucets and as global as fresh water? Is there a connection between them? Many people assume that fresh water shortages are due to individual wastefulness: running the water while you brush your teeth, for example, or taking really long showers. Most of us assume, therefore, that water shortages can be fixed by improving our personal habits: taking shorter showers or turning off the water while we brush our teeth. But, global fresh water scarcity neither starts nor ends in your shower. Globally, domestic use of fresh water accounts for only 8% of consumption, 8%!! Compare that to the 70% that goes to agriculture and the 22% that goes to industrial uses. Now, hold up - you're not off the hook! Individual habits are still part of the puzzle. You should still cultivate water virtue in your daily life, turn off the tap when you brush your teeth. But still, it's true. Taking shorter showers won't solve global problems, which is too bad. It would be much more straightforward and easier if virtuous, individual actions could do the trick. You'd just stand there for 30 seconds less, and you'd be done with that irksome, planet-saving task for the day. Well, that's not so much the case. Agricultural and industrial patterns of water use need serious attention. How do our societies value water? Distribute it? Subsidize its use in agriculture? Incentivize its consumption or pollution?

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Hello, my name is Christian Rudder, and I was one of the founders of OkCupid. It's now one of the biggest
dating sites in the United States. Like most everyone at the site,
I was a math major, As you may expect, we're known
for the analytic approach we take to love. We call it our matching algorithm. Basically, OkCupid's matching
algorithm helps us decide whether two people should go on a date. We built our entire business around it. Now, algorithm is a fancy word, and people like to drop it
like it's this big thing. But really, an algorithm
is just a systematic, step-by-step way to solve a problem. It doesn't have to be fancy at all. Here in this lesson, I'm going to explain how we arrived
at our particular algorithm, so you can see how it's done. Now, why are algorithms even important? Why does this lesson even exist? Well, notice one very significant
phrase I used above: they are a step-by-step
way to solve a problem, and as you probably know, computers
excel at step-by-step processes. A computer without an algorithm is basically an expensive paperweight. And since computers are such
a pervasive part of everyday life, algorithms are everywhere. The math behind OkCupid's matching
algorithm is surprisingly simple. It's just some addition, multiplication,
a little bit of square roots. The tricky part in designing it was figuring out how to take
something mysterious, human attraction, and break it into components
that a computer can work with. The first thing we needed
to match people up was data, something for the algorithm to work with. The best way to get data quickly
from people is to just ask for it. So we decided that OkCupid
should ask users questions, stuff like, "Do you want
to have kids one day?" "How often do you brush your teeth?" "Do you like scary movies?" And big stuff like,
"Do you believe in God?" Now, a lot of the questions
are good for matching like with like, that is, when both people
answer the same way. For example, two people
who are both into scary movies are probably a better match
than one person who is and one who isn't. But what about a question like, "Do you like to be
the center of attention?" If both people in a relationship
are saying yes to this, they're going to have massive problems. We realized this early on, and so we decided we needed
a bit more data from each question. We had to ask people to specify
not only their own answer, but the answer they wanted
from someone else. That worked really well. But we needed one more dimension. Some questions tell you more
about a person than others. For example, a question
about politics, something like, "Which is worse:
book burning or flag burning?" might reveal more about someone
than their taste in movies. And it doesn't make sense
to weigh all things equally, so we added one final data point. For everything that OkCupid asks you, you have a chance to tell us
the role it plays in your life. And this ranges
from irrelevant to mandatory. So now, for every question,
we have three things for our algorithm: first, your answer; second, how you want someone else --
your potential match -- to answer; and third, how important
the question is to you at all. With all this information, OkCupid can figure out
how well two people will get along. The algorithm crunches the numbers
and gives us a result. As a practical example, let's look at how we'd match you
with another person. Let's call him "B." Your match percentage with B is based
on questions you've both answered. Let's call that set
of common questions "s." As a very simple example,
we use a small set "s" with just two questions in common, and compute a match from that. Here are our two example questions. The first one, let's say, is,
"How messy are you?" And the answer possibilities are: very messy, average and very organized. And let's say you answered
"very organized," and you'd like someone else
to answer "very organized," and the question is very important to you. Basically, you're a neat freak. You're neat, you want someone else
to be neat, and that's it. And let's say B is a little bit different. He answered "very organized" for himself, but "average" is OK with him
as an answer from someone else, and the question is only
a little important to him. Let's look at the second question,
from our previous example: "Do you like to be
the center of attention?" The answers are "yes" and "no." You've answered "no," you want
someone else to answer "no," and the question is only
a little important to you. Now B, he's answered "yes." He wants someone else to answer "no," because he wants the spotlight on him, and the question is somewhat
important to him. So, let's try to compute all of this. Our first step is, since we use
computers to do this, we need to assign numerical values to ideas like "somewhat
important" and "very important," because computers need
everything in numbers. We at OkCupid decided
on the following scale: "Irrelevant" is worth 0. "A little important" is worth 1. "Somewhat important" is worth 10. "Very important" is 50. And "absolutely mandatory" is 250. Next, the algorithm makes
two simple calculations. The first is: How much did
B's answers satisfy you? That is, how many possible points
did B score on your scale? Well, you indicated that B's answer
to the first question, about messiness, was very important to you. It's worth 50 points and B got that right. The second question is worth only 1, because you said
it was only a little important. B got that wrong, so B's answers were 50
out of 51 possible points. That's 98% satisfactory. Pretty good. The second question the algorithm
looks at is: How much did you satisfy B? Well, B placed 1 point on your answer
to the messiness question and 10 on your answer to the second. Of those 11, that's 1 plus 10,
you earned 10 -- you guys satisfied each other
on the second question. So your answers were 10 out of 11
equals 91 percent satisfactory to B. That's not bad. The final step is to take
these two match percentages and get one number for the both of you. To do this, the algorithm
multiplies your scores, then takes the nth root, where "n" is the number of questions. Because s, which is the number
of questions in this sample, is only 2, we have: match percentage
equals the square root of 98 percent times 91 percent. That equals 94 percent. That 94 percent is your match
percentage with B. It's a mathematical expression
of how happy you'd be with each other, based on what we know. Now, why does the algorithm multiply, as opposed to, say, average
the two match scores together, and do the square-root business? In general, this formula
is called the geometric mean. It's a great way to combine
values that have wide ranges and represent very different properties. In other words, it's perfect
for romantic matching. You've got wide ranges and you've got
tons of different data points, like I said, about movies, politics,
religion -- everything. Intuitively, too, this makes sense. Two people satisfying
each other 50 percent should be a better match
than two others who satisfy 0 and 100, because affection needs to be mutual. After adding a little correction
for margin of error, in the case where we have
a small number of questions, like we do in this example, we're good to go. Any time OkCupid matches two people, it goes through the steps
we just outlined. First it collects data about your answers, then it compares your choices
and preferences to other people's in simple, mathematical ways. This, the ability to take
real-world phenomena and make them something
a microchip can understand, is, I think, the most important skill
anyone can have these days. Like you use sentences
to tell a story to a person, you use algorithms
to tell a story to a computer. If you learn the language,
you can go out and tell your stories. I hope this will help you do that.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Hello, my name is Christian Rudder, and I was one of the founders of OkCupid. It's now one of the biggest
dating sites in the United States. Like most everyone at the site,
I was a math major, As you may expect, we're known
for the analytic approach we take to love. We call it our matching algorithm. Basically, OkCupid's matching
algorithm helps us decide whether two people should go on a date. We built our entire business around it. Now, algorithm is a fancy word, and people like to drop it
like it's this big thing. But really, an algorithm
is just a systematic, step-by-step way to solve a problem. It doesn't have to be fancy at all. Here in this lesson, I'm going to explain how we arrived
at our particular algorithm, so you can see how it's done. Now, why are algorithms even important? Why does this lesson even exist? Well, notice one very significant
phrase I used above: they are a step-by-step
way to solve a problem, and as you probably know, computers
excel at step-by-step processes. A computer without an algorithm is basically an expensive paperweight. And since computers are such
a pervasive part of everyday life, algorithms are everywhere. The math behind OkCupid's matching
algorithm is surprisingly simple. It's just some addition, multiplication,
a little bit of square roots. The tricky part in designing it was figuring out how to take
something mysterious, human attraction, and break it into components
that a computer can work with. The first thing we needed
to match people up was data, something for the algorithm to work with. The best way to get data quickly
from people is to just ask for it. So we decided that OkCupid
should ask users questions, stuff like, "Do you want
to have kids one day?" "How often do you brush your teeth?" "Do you like scary movies?" And big stuff like,
"Do you believe in God?" Now, a lot of the questions
are good for matching like with like, that is, when both people
answer the same way. For example, two people
who are both into scary movies are probably a better match
than one person who is and one who isn't. But what about a question like, "Do you like to be
the center of attention?" If both people in a relationship
are saying yes to this, they're going to have massive problems. We realized this early on, and so we decided we needed
a bit more data from each question. We had to ask people to specify
not only their own answer, but the answer they wanted
from someone else. That worked really well. But we needed one more dimension. Some questions tell you more
about a person than others. For example, a question
about politics, something like, "Which is worse:
book burning or flag burning?" might reveal more about someone
than their taste in movies. And it doesn't make sense
to weigh all things equally, so we added one final data point. For everything that OkCupid asks you, you have a chance to tell us
the role it plays in your life. And this ranges
from irrelevant to mandatory. So now, for every question,
we have three things for our algorithm: first, your answer; second, how you want someone else --
your potential match -- to answer; and third, how important
the question is to you at all. With all this information, OkCupid can figure out
how well two people will get along. The algorithm crunches the numbers
and gives us a result. As a practical example, let's look at how we'd match you
with another person. Let's call him "B." Your match percentage with B is based
on questions you've both answered. Let's call that set
of common questions "s." As a very simple example,
we use a small set "s" with just two questions in common, and compute a match from that. Here are our two example questions. The first one, let's say, is,
"How messy are you?" And the answer possibilities are: very messy, average and very organized. And let's say you answered
"very organized," and you'd like someone else
to answer "very organized," and the question is very important to you. Basically, you're a neat freak. You're neat, you want someone else
to be neat, and that's it. And let's say B is a little bit different. He answered "very organized" for himself, but "average" is OK with him
as an answer from someone else, and the question is only
a little important to him. Let's look at the second question,
from our previous example: "Do you like to be
the center of attention?" The answers are "yes" and "no." You've answered "no," you want
someone else to answer "no," and the question is only
a little important to you. Now B, he's answered "yes." He wants someone else to answer "no," because he wants the spotlight on him, and the question is somewhat
important to him. So, let's try to compute all of this. Our first step is, since we use
computers to do this, we need to assign numerical values to ideas like "somewhat
important" and "very important," because computers need
everything in numbers. We at OkCupid decided
on the following scale: "Irrelevant" is worth 0. "A little important" is worth 1. "Somewhat important" is worth 10. "Very important" is 50. And "absolutely mandatory" is 250. Next, the algorithm makes
two simple calculations. The first is: How much did
B's answers satisfy you? That is, how many possible points
did B score on your scale? Well, you indicated that B's answer
to the first question, about messiness, was very important to you. It's worth 50 points and B got that right. The second question is worth only 1, because you said
it was only a little important. B got that wrong, so B's answers were 50
out of 51 possible points. That's 98% satisfactory. Pretty good. The second question the algorithm
looks at is: How much did you satisfy B? Well, B placed 1 point on your answer
to the messiness question and 10 on your answer to the second. Of those 11, that's 1 plus 10,
you earned 10 -- you guys satisfied each other
on the second question. So your answers were 10 out of 11
equals 91 percent satisfactory to B. That's not bad. The final step is to take
these two match percentages and get one number for the both of you. To do this, the algorithm
multiplies your scores, then takes the nth root, where "n" is the number of questions. Because s, which is the number
of questions in this sample, is only 2, we have: match percentage
equals the square root of 98 percent times 91 percent. That equals 94 percent. That 94 percent is your match
percentage with B. It's a mathematical expression
of how happy you'd be with each other, based on what we know. Now, why does the algorithm multiply, as opposed to, say, average
the two match scores together, and do the square-root business? In general, this formula
is called the geometric mean. It's a great way to combine
values that have wide ranges and represent very different properties. In other words, it's perfect
for romantic matching. You've got wide ranges and you've got
tons of different data points, like I said, about movies, politics,
religion -- everything. Intuitively, too, this makes sense. Two people satisfying
each other 50 percent should be a better match
than two others who satisfy 0 and 100, because affection needs to be mutual. After adding a little correction
for margin of error, in the case where we have
a small number of questions, like we do in this example, we're good to go. Any time OkCupid matches two people, it goes through the steps
we just outlined. First it collects data about your answers, then it compares your choices
and preferences to other people's in simple, mathematical ways. This, the ability to take
real-world phenomena and make them something
a microchip can understand, is, I think, the most important skill
anyone can have these days. Like you use sentences
to tell a story to a person, you use algorithms
to tell a story to a computer. If you learn the language,
you can go out and tell your stories. I hope this will help you do that.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What was the last data point that OkCupid needed from each question?
Options: A. The ability to express discomfort with the question by changing at least two answers, B. What percentage of the entire population answers the same way you do, C. If you think people will judge you for feeling a certain way, D. The role each question plays in your life (from irrelevant to mandatory)
Correct Option: D

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the significance of the "role" data point added to the algorithm?
Options: A. It helps to determine the importance of a question, B. It provides additional demographic information, C. It allows users to specify their preferences, D. It helps to identify potential matches
Correct Option: A

2. Evaluate each matched MCQ pair based on the following criteria:
   - **Relevance (0.0000 - 1.0000)**: Assess how closely the generated question aligns with the content and intent of the ground truth question.
   - **Correct Answer Matching (0.0000 - 1.0000)**: Check if the correct answer option in the generated question matches the ground truth answer.

of questions in this sample, is only 2, we have: match percentage
equals the square root of 98 percent times 91 percent. That equals 94 percent. That 94 percent is your match
percentage with B. It's a mathematical expression
of how happy you'd be with each other, based on what we know. Now, why does the algorithm multiply, as opposed to, say, average
the two match scores together, and do the square-root business? In general, this formula
is called the geometric mean. It's a great way to combine
values that have wide ranges and represent very different properties. In other words, it's perfect
for romantic matching. You've got wide ranges and you've got
tons of different data points, like I said, about movies, politics,
religion -- everything. Intuitively, too, this makes sense. Two people satisfying
each other 50 percent should be a better match
than two others who satisfy 0 and 100, because affection needs to be mutual. After adding a little correction
for margin of error, in the case where we have
a small number of questions, like we do in this example, we're good to go. Any time OkCupid matches two people, it goes through the steps
we just outlined. First it collects data about your answers, then it compares your choices
and preferences to other people's in simple, mathematical ways. This, the ability to take
real-world phenomena and make them something
a microchip can understand, is, I think, the most important skill
anyone can have these days. Like you use sentences
to tell a story to a person, you use algorithms
to tell a story to a computer. If you learn the language,
you can go out and tell your stories. I hope this will help you do that.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar At birth, our bodies are roughly 75% water. We remain mostly water for the rest of our lives. We cannot survive even a week without fresh water. There's no life without it for ecosystems, societies, and individuals. So, how much usable water is there on Earth? Most of the water on Earth is ocean, a salty 97.5%, to be precise, and the remaining 2.5% is fresh water. That little sliver of liquid sustains human life on Earth, it literally holds up civilizations. 2.5% is a small proportion to be sure, and even that is broken down into smaller parts: surface water, water in ice caps and polar regions, and ground water. First, surface water. All the liquid water above ground is surface water and it is a tiny blip of an amount. 0.3% of all fresh water is surface water. It may seem counterintuitive, but it accounts for little streams all over the planet. All rivers, including the Nile, the Jordan, and the Mississippi, and lakes, large to small, like Victoria, the Great Lakes, and Baikal. Second, ice caps and polar regions freeze up to 70% of the planet's fresh water. This water is significant, but it isn't available for human use in a regular way. Finally, nearly 30% of all water on Earth is ground water. As the name suggests, that's water in the ground. It can rest still and deep in huge caverns, or it can snuggle in the little crevices of rock and pebble. The upshot - thank goodness for ground water! It's invisible to us, but it is much more plentiful than surface water. It is much more reliable and easier to obtain than frozen water. Without ground water, our societies would be parched. So, how are we using that water? As a result of industrialization and population growth, demand for fresh water skyrocketed in the last century. Where is all that water going? First, we have to remember that fresh water is a global concern, but it is always local. Context matters. The Sahara is not Seattle. Still, some general information can help us get a handle on major trends. Who consumes the most fresh water? And, what sectors consume the most fresh water? First, who. Well, the United States consumes the most water per capita of any country in the entire world, followed by parts of Europe and large industrializing nations like China. But, this doesn't tell us what water is being used for. So let's look at it another way. If we ask what kinds of uses water is going towards, we see a different picture. Agriculture accounts for roughly 70% of global fresh water consumption. Again, remember the numbers vary by region, but still, it's a staggering amount. And, this makes a certain kind of sense: we need to eat, we need water to grow food; the bigger the population, the more food we need; and, the wealthier we get, the more meat we eat, and the more water is required to produce our food. Furthermore, 22% of all fresh water worldwide goes to industrial uses. This includes the production of electricity, the extraction of fossil fuels, and the manufacturing of all manner of goods, from microchips, to paper, to blimps. 70% to agriculture, 22% to industrial uses, what's left? 8% All those domestic uses - cooking, cleaning, bathing, drinking - it's a drop in the bucket of overall water use.

It may seem counterintuitive, but it accounts for little streams all over the planet. All rivers, including the Nile, the Jordan, and the Mississippi, and lakes, large to small, like Victoria, the Great Lakes, and Baikal. Second, ice caps and polar regions freeze up to 70% of the planet's fresh water. This water is significant, but it isn't available for human use in a regular way. Finally, nearly 30% of all water on Earth is ground water. As the name suggests, that's water in the ground. It can rest still and deep in huge caverns, or it can snuggle in the little crevices of rock and pebble. The upshot - thank goodness for ground water! It's invisible to us, but it is much more plentiful than surface water. It is much more reliable and easier to obtain than frozen water. Without ground water, our societies would be parched. So, how are we using that water? As a result of industrialization and population growth, demand for fresh water skyrocketed in the last century. Where is all that water going? First, we have to remember that fresh water is a global concern, but it is always local. Context matters. The Sahara is not Seattle. Still, some general information can help us get a handle on major trends. Who consumes the most fresh water? And, what sectors consume the most fresh water? First, who. Well, the United States consumes the most water per capita of any country in the entire world, followed by parts of Europe and large industrializing nations like China. But, this doesn't tell us what water is being used for. So let's look at it another way. If we ask what kinds of uses water is going towards, we see a different picture. Agriculture accounts for roughly 70% of global fresh water consumption. Again, remember the numbers vary by region, but still, it's a staggering amount. And, this makes a certain kind of sense: we need to eat, we need water to grow food; the bigger the population, the more food we need; and, the wealthier we get, the more meat we eat, and the more water is required to produce our food. Furthermore, 22% of all fresh water worldwide goes to industrial uses. This includes the production of electricity, the extraction of fossil fuels, and the manufacturing of all manner of goods, from microchips, to paper, to blimps. 70% to agriculture, 22% to industrial uses, what's left? 8% All those domestic uses - cooking, cleaning, bathing, drinking - it's a drop in the bucket of overall water use.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar About 100 days ago, we landed a two-ton SUV
on the surface of another planet, on the surface of Mars. This is one of the first pictures
we took there with our rover, looking out at Mount Sharp. I kind of cry a little bit, choke up, when I see this picture. Why Mars and why do we look
at these other planets? Part of it is to understand
our own planet -- what's the context for us? We live on this amazing planet,
but Mars is a lot like Earth. It's similar in size. During the daytime, it can
get up to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. So, it's so like Earth,
but at the same time, this is a barren landscape. You don't see any trees,
you don't see any cactuses growing, anything like that. Today I'm going to tell you
about how we got from Earth to Mars and why it's so cool. So one of the things we start with
is a blank sheet of paper. We knew from the previous missions
in 2004, Spirit and Opportunity, there was water on Mars in the past. But what's the next step? We're looking for an even more
fundamental level of, what does it take to have life survive? And so, to have that kind
of knowledge and understanding, we have to carry
a mass amount of instruments. We have to carry the kind of labs that people have whole rooms
devoted to on Earth inside of, essentially, a small car. And we shrunk it all down to something that weighs
about as much as I do, and then put it inside of this rover
that weighs as much as your car does. And that rover is now
on the surface of Mars, but it's so heavy, and so it kind of takes
a special challenge for us to make it all work and come together. So we look at our tool of,
what do we have to land stuff on Mars? And one of the options is airbags. We've done it before. Airbags are pretty cool,
they bounce around a lot. You could never put a human
inside of an airbag, because they would get squashed. But the problem with airbags is,
the airbags you see here, which landed the smaller rover --
it's like 400 pounds, the entire rover -- were about the size of this room. So you can imagine the size
of airbags it would take to land a two-ton rover on Mars. And they'd have to be made
out of materials that don't even exist today, so it'd be some kind of exotic material
that we'd have to develop and it may or may not work. So, what about rockets? You know, you see all the rocket ships
landing in old movies, all rockets on the bottom --
it's a cool idea. It works when they're pretty light still, but the problem is, these rockets
have to be pretty strong to actually softly land you on Mars. And so they would be so powerful
they could dig holes into the ground and then you would just
end up inside of a hole and not be able to drive out of it. So, not the best design. But what if I could take the rockets
and move them up? And that's what we came up with. It's a rocket-powered jet pack;
we call it the Sky Crane. Basically, this big rocket
sits on top of our rover and when we're ready to land,
the rocket hovers in place and we slowly lower
the rover to the ground. And then we touch down,
we're actually on the wheels, we're ready to drive, day one. But in addition to that,
the scientists were like, "We actually want to go
somewhere interesting." The last two missions were cool, but they basically landed in what was like
landing in the plains or desert. Not very exciting. We all know from the exciting places
on Earth like the Grand Canyon, those are, for the scientists,
the most interesting, because you see that whole layer, you see years and years
of history all in one place. The same thing is true
for where we landed. We wanted to land somewhere
that was unique, that had this crater wall
where things had been dug up for us, where mountains were pushing things up. But the problem is, if you landed
with the older systems, you could've landed on the side
of that mountain and just tumbled off, could've been the side of a cliff,
the crater wall or a large boulder. So we needed a kind of technology to help us land in a very small area, and that was this little
guided entry from Apollo. We took it from the 1960s. We flew over like the manned vehicle,
because they have to pick up men, you can't just land all over the place. And then we landed, like,
spot-on in the middle. And in fact, it was so spot-on
that when we did it, it was basically like a quarterback
launching towards Mars -- like a quarterback, though,
that was in Seattle, throwing at a receiver that was moving
here in Giants Stadium. That's how accurate we were.
Kind of awesome. But you only get one shot, and so we actually have to design a system that we can build and test and operate, and so it's not just about
can we get it to Mars, but, if it's only one chance, how do you make sure
that one chance goes well? So there's all these processes
to make sure things are built properly. Then we go out to the desert
and drive around and test it. We fly things in F-18s to make sure
the radar systems work in high speeds. Then, most importantly, we test the team
to make sure they know how to operate it. We don't want to miss it
because we sent the wrong command and now it's going
to be rebooting forever. So, that guy Fred there,
he did a lot of that. And then we launched it
on this rocket to Mars. We landed 2,000 pounds on Mars, but the entire thing
was about 10,000 pounds when we lifted off from Earth, all the fuel and the solar arrays
and everything else that we needed. And, again, we were so accurate that we landed in this, like,
little pin-point on Mars. In the meantime, though, we had to design
a landing system that worked. And I told you about the actual physics
of it, but here's the catch: Mars is about 14 minutes
away from Earth in light speed, which means if I try
to control it with a joystick, I would be always controlling
to 14 minutes in advance, so it wouldn't work. So we had to give it all the smarts
and knowledge it needed to make it happen. So we built in all these
smarts and algorithms and told it here's what
you're going to have to do, and it goes from basically
five times the speed of a speeding bullet to about a baby's crawl, all within about seven minutes, which are called
the seven minutes of terror, because I was about to throw up. (Laughter) But today we're on the surface of Mars,
and this was one of the panoramas we took a couple days after we landed, and it's amazing to me,
because you look at this, and can see the Grand Canyon, you can see your own planet,
you can imagine walking on the surface. And so what we're going to do
and continue to do is to understand
what makes Mars so special and what makes Earth even more special that we're all here together today. So we'll see where Curiosity takes us -- not just our rover, but our sense of exploration. Thank you. (Applause)

Kind of awesome. But you only get one shot, and so we actually have to design a system that we can build and test and operate, and so it's not just about
can we get it to Mars, but, if it's only one chance, how do you make sure
that one chance goes well? So there's all these processes
to make sure things are built properly. Then we go out to the desert
and drive around and test it. We fly things in F-18s to make sure
the radar systems work in high speeds. Then, most importantly, we test the team
to make sure they know how to operate it. We don't want to miss it
because we sent the wrong command and now it's going
to be rebooting forever. So, that guy Fred there,
he did a lot of that. And then we launched it
on this rocket to Mars. We landed 2,000 pounds on Mars, but the entire thing
was about 10,000 pounds when we lifted off from Earth, all the fuel and the solar arrays
and everything else that we needed. And, again, we were so accurate that we landed in this, like,
little pin-point on Mars. In the meantime, though, we had to design
a landing system that worked. And I told you about the actual physics
of it, but here's the catch: Mars is about 14 minutes
away from Earth in light speed, which means if I try
to control it with a joystick, I would be always controlling
to 14 minutes in advance, so it wouldn't work. So we had to give it all the smarts
and knowledge it needed to make it happen. So we built in all these
smarts and algorithms and told it here's what
you're going to have to do, and it goes from basically
five times the speed of a speeding bullet to about a baby's crawl, all within about seven minutes, which are called
the seven minutes of terror, because I was about to throw up. (Laughter) But today we're on the surface of Mars,
and this was one of the panoramas we took a couple days after we landed, and it's amazing to me,
because you look at this, and can see the Grand Canyon, you can see your own planet,
you can imagine walking on the surface. And so what we're going to do
and continue to do is to understand
what makes Mars so special and what makes Earth even more special that we're all here together today. So we'll see where Curiosity takes us -- not just our rover, but our sense of exploration. Thank you. (Applause)

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar About 100 days ago, we landed a two-ton SUV
on the surface of another planet, on the surface of Mars. This is one of the first pictures
we took there with our rover, looking out at Mount Sharp. I kind of cry a little bit, choke up, when I see this picture. Why Mars and why do we look
at these other planets? Part of it is to understand
our own planet -- what's the context for us? We live on this amazing planet,
but Mars is a lot like Earth. It's similar in size. During the daytime, it can
get up to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. So, it's so like Earth,
but at the same time, this is a barren landscape. You don't see any trees,
you don't see any cactuses growing, anything like that. Today I'm going to tell you
about how we got from Earth to Mars and why it's so cool. So one of the things we start with
is a blank sheet of paper. We knew from the previous missions
in 2004, Spirit and Opportunity, there was water on Mars in the past. But what's the next step? We're looking for an even more
fundamental level of, what does it take to have life survive? And so, to have that kind
of knowledge and understanding, we have to carry
a mass amount of instruments. We have to carry the kind of labs that people have whole rooms
devoted to on Earth inside of, essentially, a small car. And we shrunk it all down to something that weighs
about as much as I do, and then put it inside of this rover
that weighs as much as your car does. And that rover is now
on the surface of Mars, but it's so heavy, and so it kind of takes
a special challenge for us to make it all work and come together. So we look at our tool of,
what do we have to land stuff on Mars? And one of the options is airbags. We've done it before. Airbags are pretty cool,
they bounce around a lot. You could never put a human
inside of an airbag, because they would get squashed. But the problem with airbags is,
the airbags you see here, which landed the smaller rover --
it's like 400 pounds, the entire rover -- were about the size of this room. So you can imagine the size
of airbags it would take to land a two-ton rover on Mars. And they'd have to be made
out of materials that don't even exist today, so it'd be some kind of exotic material
that we'd have to develop and it may or may not work. So, what about rockets? You know, you see all the rocket ships
landing in old movies, all rockets on the bottom --
it's a cool idea. It works when they're pretty light still, but the problem is, these rockets
have to be pretty strong to actually softly land you on Mars. And so they would be so powerful
they could dig holes into the ground and then you would just
end up inside of a hole and not be able to drive out of it. So, not the best design. But what if I could take the rockets
and move them up? And that's what we came up with. It's a rocket-powered jet pack;
we call it the Sky Crane. Basically, this big rocket
sits on top of our rover and when we're ready to land,
the rocket hovers in place and we slowly lower
the rover to the ground. And then we touch down,
we're actually on the wheels, we're ready to drive, day one. But in addition to that,
the scientists were like, "We actually want to go
somewhere interesting." The last two missions were cool, but they basically landed in what was like
landing in the plains or desert. Not very exciting. We all know from the exciting places
on Earth like the Grand Canyon, those are, for the scientists,
the most interesting, because you see that whole layer, you see years and years
of history all in one place. The same thing is true
for where we landed. We wanted to land somewhere
that was unique, that had this crater wall
where things had been dug up for us, where mountains were pushing things up. But the problem is, if you landed
with the older systems, you could've landed on the side
of that mountain and just tumbled off, could've been the side of a cliff,
the crater wall or a large boulder. So we needed a kind of technology to help us land in a very small area, and that was this little
guided entry from Apollo. We took it from the 1960s. We flew over like the manned vehicle,
because they have to pick up men, you can't just land all over the place. And then we landed, like,
spot-on in the middle. And in fact, it was so spot-on
that when we did it, it was basically like a quarterback
launching towards Mars -- like a quarterback, though,
that was in Seattle, throwing at a receiver that was moving
here in Giants Stadium. That's how accurate we were.
Kind of awesome. But you only get one shot, and so we actually have to design a system that we can build and test and operate, and so it's not just about

**Transcript**:
bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth they've been here for billions of years and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms so they're one cell and they have the special property that they only have one piece of DNA so they have very few genes and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out and the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment they grow to twice their size they cut themselves down in the middle and one cell becomes two and so on and so on so they just grow and divide and grow and divide so kind of boring life except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters I know you guys think of yourself as humans and this is sort of how I think of you and so this man is supposed to represent a generic human being and all of the circles in that man are all the cells that make up your body so there's about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do but you have ten trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life so 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being and so of course it's the DNA that counts so here's all the 80 G's and C's that make up your genetic code and give you all your charming characteristics so you have about 30,000 genes well it turns out you have a hundred times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life and so at the best your 10% human we're more likely about 1% human depending on which of these metrics you like so I know you think of yourself as human beings but I think of you as ninety or ninety two point nine percent bacterial and these bacteria are not passive writers these are incredibly important they keep us alive they cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy they digest our food they make our vitamins they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out so they do all these amazing things that help us and keep in our vital for keeping us alive and they never get any press for that but they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well so there's all insert bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time and if they are they make you incredibly sick and so the question from my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do or all the bad things that bacteria do the question we had is how could they do anything at all I mean they're incredibly small you have to have a microscope to see one they live this soaring sort of boring life where they grow and divide and they've always been to consider to be these a social reclusive organisms and so it seemed to us that they're just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals and so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way the bacteria live and the clue to this came from another marine bacterium and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri and so what you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean named Vibrio fischeri and this bacterium has the special property that it makes light so it makes bioluminescence like fireflies make light so we're not doing anything to the cells here we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room and this is what we see and was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light but when the bacteria made light what we noticed is when the bacteria were alone so when they were in dilute suspension they made no light but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously and so the question that we had is how can bacteria these primitive organisms tell the difference from times when they're alone and times when they're in a community and then all do something together and what we figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other and they talk with a chemical language so this is now supposed to be my bacterial cell when it's alone it doesn't make any light but what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones and these are the red triangles and when the bacteria ours alone the molecules just float away and so no light but when the bacteria grow and double and they're all participating in making these molecules the molecule the extracellular amount that molecule increases in proportion to cell number and when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors they are they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony and so that's how bioluminescence works they're talking with these chemical words and the reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology so again another plug for the animals in the ocean the real fish fry lives in this squid what you're looking at is the Hawaiian bobtail squid and it's been turned on its back and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these how's the Vibrio fischeri cells they live in there at high cell number that molecule is there and they're making light and the reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light and so the way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii so just in a sort of shallow knee-deep water and the squid is nocturnal so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps but then at night it has to come out to hunt and so on bright nights when there's lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in since it's just in those couple feet of water and what the squid has developed is a shutter they can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria and then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back and it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom which is made by the bacterium exactly matches how much light hits the squids back so the squid doesn't make a shadow so it actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter illuminate itself in an anti predation device and so it so predators can't see its shadow calculate its trajectory and eat it and so this is like the stealth bomber of the ocean but then if you think about it this squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying stick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that and so what happens is every morning when the Sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep it buries itself in the sand and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm and when the Sun comes up it pumps out like 95% of the bacteria and so now the bacteria are dilute that little hormone molecule is gone so they're not making light but of course squid doesn't care it's asleep in the sand and as the day goes by the bacteria doubled they release the molecule and then light comes on at night exactly when the squid wants it and so first we figured out how and this bacterium does this but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this to figure out really what's the mechanism and what we found so this is now supposed to be again my bacterial cell is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein that's the red box it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule the red triangle and then as the cells grow they're all releasing that molecule into the environment so there's lots of molecule there and the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule these are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells and so when the molecule increases to a certain amount which says something about the number of cells it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light and why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean all bacteria have systems like this so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other they make chemical words they recognize those words and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison and so now we have a fancy name for this we call it quorum sensing they vote with these chemical votes the vote gets counted and then everybody responds to the vote and what's important for today's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions but the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence so it's not like a couple bacteria get in you and then they start secreting some toxins you're enormous that would have no effect on you you're huge but what they do we now understand is they get in you they wait they start growing they count themselves with these little molecules and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launched their virulence attack together they're going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host so bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing and so that's how it works we also then went to look at what are these molecules so these were the red triangles on my slides before and so this is the Vibrio fischeri molecule this is the word that it talks with and then we started to look at other bacteria and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered and what I hope you can see is that the molecules are related so the left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria but the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species and what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages so each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other so these are private secret conversations these conversations are for interest species communication each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's it like its language that allows it to count its own siblings and so once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors but we started what we're really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves they live in incredible mixtures with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria and that's depicted on this slide this is your skin so this is just a picture a micrograph of your skin anywhere on your body it looks pretty much like this and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there and so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria and it's about counting your neighbors it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species there has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population so we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria and what we found now is that in fact bacteria are multilingual so they all have a species specific system they have a molecule that says me but then running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered that's generic so they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria it's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication and so what happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you and they take that in for Meishan inside and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population and so then again we turn to chemistry and we figured out what this generic molecule is so that was the pink ovals on my last slide this is it it's a very small five carbon molecule and what the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule so they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication so this is the bacterial Esperanto and so once we got that far we've started to learn the bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language but what we started to think is that maybe there's something practical that we can do here as well so I've told you the bacteria do you have all these social behaviors that they communicate with these molecules and of course I've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing so we thought what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics and of course you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics bacteria are incredibly multi drug-resistant right now and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria so they either pop the bacterial membrane they make that bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA we kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants and so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases so we thought well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications just make these bacteria so they can't talk they can't count and they don't know to launch virulence and so that's exactly what we've done and we've sort of taken two strategies the first one is we've targeted the intra species communication system so we've made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules which you saw but they're a little bit different and so they lock into those receptors and they Jam recognition of the real thing and so by targeting the red system what we are able to do is to make species specific or disease specific anti quorum sensing molecules we've also done the same thing with the pink system we've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we've made in goodness of the interspecies communication system and these the hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria and so to finish I'll just show you the strategy and this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule but the logic is exactly the same so what you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal in this case a mouse it doesn't initiate virulence right away it gets in it starts growing it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they're going to launch their attack and the animal dies and so what we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections but we give them in conjunction with our anti quorum sensing molecules so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide and what we now know is that if we treat the animal with the pathogenic bacterium a multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacterium in at the same time we give our anti quorum sensing molecule in fact the animal lives and so we think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around at least initially this big problem of resistance so what I hope you think is the bacteria can talk to each other they use chemicals as their words they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about and of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular right and so in the spirit of Ted they are doing things together because it makes a difference right so what happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals and what I would hope that I could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity bacteria had been on the year on the earth for billions of years humans a couple hundred thousands so we think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular an organization works and and we think by studying bacteria we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body so we know that the principles and the rules if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from others so by using these two molecules they can say me and they can say you and again of course that's what we do both as Malec in in a molecular way and then also in an outward way but I think about the molecular stuff this is exactly what happens in your body it's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is and what their tasks should be and so again we think that bacteria invented that and then you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study and then the final thing is again just to reiterate that there's this practical part and so we've made these anti quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics but then to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the earth we've also made Pro quorum sensing molecules so we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better and so remember you have these ten times or more bacterial cells in your on you keeping you healthy what we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualist with you in the hopes of making you more healthy making those conversations better so bacteria can do things that we want them to do by in here better than they would be on their own and then finally I wanted to show you this is my gang at Princeton New Jersey everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture and I hope when you learn things like about how the natural world works I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child so science is done by that demographic there all of those people are between 20 and 30 years old and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country and it's a really lucky demographic to work with I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age and it's just Anna crazy delightful job and I want to thank you for inviting me here it's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference you

**Transcript**:
bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth they've been here for billions of years and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms so they're one cell and they have the special property that they only have one piece of DNA so they have very few genes and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out and the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment they grow to twice their size they cut themselves down in the middle and one cell becomes two and so on and so on so they just grow and divide and grow and divide so kind of boring life except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters I know you guys think of yourself as humans and this is sort of how I think of you and so this man is supposed to represent a generic human being and all of the circles in that man are all the cells that make up your body so there's about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do but you have ten trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life so 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being and so of course it's the DNA that counts so here's all the 80 G's and C's that make up your genetic code and give you all your charming characteristics so you have about 30,000 genes well it turns out you have a hundred times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life and so at the best your 10% human we're more likely about 1% human depending on which of these metrics you like so I know you think of yourself as human beings but I think of you as ninety or ninety two point nine percent bacterial and these bacteria are not passive writers these are incredibly important they keep us alive they cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy they digest our food they make our vitamins they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out so they do all these amazing things that help us and keep in our vital for keeping us alive and they never get any press for that but they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well so there's all insert bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time and if they are they make you incredibly sick and so the question from my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do or all the bad things that bacteria do the question we had is how could they do anything at all I mean they're incredibly small you have to have a microscope to see one they live this soaring sort of boring life where they grow and divide and they've always been to consider to be these a

at Princeton New Jersey everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture and I hope when you learn things like about how the natural world works I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child so science is done by that demographic there all of those people are between 20 and 30 years old and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country and it's a really lucky demographic to work with I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age and it's just Anna crazy delightful job and I want to thank you for inviting me here it's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference you

**Transcript**:
bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth they've been here for billions of years and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms so they're one cell and they have the special property that they only have one piece of DNA so they have very few genes and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out and the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment they grow to twice their size they cut themselves down in the middle and one cell becomes two and so on and so on so they just grow and divide and grow and divide so kind of boring life except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters I know you guys think of yourself as humans and this is sort of how I think of you and so this man is supposed to represent a generic human being and all of the circles in that man are all the cells that make up your body so there's about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do but you have ten trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life so 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being and so of course it's the DNA that counts so here's all the 80 G's and C's that make up your genetic code and give you all your charming characteristics so you have about 30,000 genes well it turns out you have a hundred times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life and so at the best your 10% human we're more likely about 1% human depending on which of these metrics you like so I know you think of yourself as human beings but I think of you as ninety or ninety two point nine percent bacterial and these bacteria are not passive writers these are incredibly important they keep us alive they cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy they digest our food they make our vitamins they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out so they do all these amazing things that help us and keep in our vital for keeping us alive and they never get any press for that but they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well so there's all insert bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time and if they are they make you incredibly sick and so the question from my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do or all the bad things that bacteria do the question we had is how could they do anything at all I mean they're incredibly small you have to have a microscope to see one they live this soaring sort of boring life where they grow and divide and they've always been to consider to be these a social reclusive organisms and so it seemed to us that they're just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals and so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way the bacteria live and the clue to this came from another marine bacterium and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri and so what you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean named Vibrio fischeri and this bacterium has the special property that it makes light so it makes bioluminescence like fireflies make light so we're not doing anything to the cells here we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room and this is what we see and was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light but when the bacteria made light what we noticed is when the bacteria were alone so when they were in dilute suspension they made no light but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously and so the question that we had is how can bacteria these primitive organisms tell the difference from times when they're alone and times when they're in a community and then all do something together and what we figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other and they talk with a chemical language so this is now supposed to be my bacterial cell when it's alone it doesn't make any light but what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones and these are the red triangles and when the bacteria ours alone the molecules just float away and so no light but when the bacteria grow and double and they're all participating in making these molecules the molecule the extracellular amount that molecule increases in proportion to cell number and when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors they are they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony and so that's how bioluminescence works they're talking with these chemical words and the reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology so again another plug for the animals in the ocean the real fish fry lives in this squid what you're looking at is the Hawaiian bobtail squid and it's been turned on its back and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these how's the Vibrio fischeri cells they live in there at high cell number that molecule is there and they're making light and the reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light and so the way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii so just in a sort of shallow knee-deep water and the squid is nocturnal so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps but then at night it has to come out to hunt and so on bright nights when there's lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in since it's just in those couple feet of water and what the squid has developed is a shutter they can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria and then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back and it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom which is made by the bacterium exactly matches how much light hits the squids back so the squid doesn't make a shadow so it actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter illuminate itself in an anti predation device and so it so predators can't see its shadow calculate its trajectory and eat it and so this is like the stealth bomber of the ocean but then if you think about it this squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying stick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that and so what happens is every morning when the Sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep it buries itself in the sand and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm and when the Sun comes up it pumps out like 95% of the bacteria and so now the bacteria are dilute that little hormone molecule is gone so they're not making light but of course squid doesn't care it's asleep in the sand and as the day goes by the bacteria doubled they release the molecule and then light comes on at night exactly when the squid wants it and so first we figured out how and this bacterium does this but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this to figure out really what's the mechanism and what we found so this is now supposed to be again my bacterial cell is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein that's the red box it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule the red triangle and then as the cells grow they're all releasing that molecule into the environment so there's lots of molecule there and the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule these are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells and so when the molecule increases to a certain amount which says something about the number of cells it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light and why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean all bacteria have systems like this so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other they make chemical words they recognize those words and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison and so now we have a fancy name for this we call it quorum sensing they vote with these chemical votes the vote gets counted and then everybody responds to the vote and what's important for today's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions but the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence so it's not like a couple bacteria get in you and then they start secreting some toxins you're enormous that would have no effect on you you're huge but what they do we now understand is they get in you they wait they start growing they count themselves with these little molecules and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launched their virulence attack together they're going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host so bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing and so that's how it works we also then went to look at what are these molecules so these were the red triangles on my slides before and so this is the Vibrio fischeri molecule this is the word that it talks with and then we started to look at other bacteria and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered and what I hope you can see is that the molecules are related so the left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria but the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species and what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages so each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other so these are private secret conversations these conversations are for interest species communication each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's it like its language that allows it to count its own siblings and so once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors but we started what we're really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves they live in incredible mixtures with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria and that's depicted on this slide this is your skin so this is just a picture a micrograph of your skin anywhere on your body it looks pretty much like this and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there and so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria and it's about counting your neighbors it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species there has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population so we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria and what we found now is that in fact bacteria are multilingual so they all have a species specific system they have a molecule that says me but then running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered that's generic so they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria it's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication and so what happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you and they take that in for Meishan inside and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population and so then again we turn to chemistry and we figured out what this generic molecule is so that was the pink ovals on my last slide this is it it's a very small five carbon molecule and what the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule so they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication so this is the bacterial Esperanto and so once we got that far we've started to learn the bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language but what we started to think is that maybe there's something practical that we can do here as well so I've told you the bacteria do you have all these social behaviors that they communicate with these molecules and of course I've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing so we thought what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics and of course you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics bacteria are incredibly multi drug-resistant right now and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria so they either pop the bacterial membrane they make that bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA we kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants and so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases so we thought well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications just make these bacteria so they can't talk they can't count and they don't know to launch virulence and so that's exactly what we've done and we've sort of taken two strategies the first one is we've targeted the intra species communication system so we've made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules which you saw but they're a little bit different and so they lock into those receptors and they Jam recognition of the real thing and so by targeting the red system what we are able to do is to make species specific or disease specific anti quorum sensing molecules we've also done the same thing with the pink system we've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we've made in goodness of the interspecies communication system and these the hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria and so to finish I'll just show you the strategy and this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule but the logic is exactly the same so what you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal in this case a mouse it doesn't initiate virulence right away it gets in it starts growing it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they're going to launch their attack and the animal dies and so what we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections but we give them in conjunction with our anti quorum sensing molecules so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide and what we now know is that if we treat the animal with the pathogenic bacterium a multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacterium in at the same time we give our anti quorum sensing molecule in fact the animal lives and so we think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around at least initially this big problem of resistance so what I hope you think is the bacteria can talk to each other they use chemicals as their words they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about and of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular right and so in the spirit of Ted they are doing things together because it makes a difference right so what happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals and what I would hope that I could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity bacteria had been on the year on the earth for billions of years humans a couple hundred thousands so we think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular an organization works and and we think by studying bacteria we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body so we know that the principles and the rules if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from others so by using these two molecules they can say me and they can say you and again of course that's what we do both as Malec in in a molecular way and then also in an outward way but I think about the molecular stuff this is exactly what happens in your body it's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is and what their tasks should be and so again we think that bacteria invented that and then you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study and then the final thing is again just to reiterate that there's this practical part and so we've made these anti quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics but then to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the earth we've also made Pro quorum sensing molecules so we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better and so remember you have these ten times or more bacterial cells in your on you keeping you healthy what we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualist with you in the hopes of making you more healthy making those conversations better so bacteria can do things that we want them to do by in here better than they would be on their own and then finally I wanted to show you this is my gang at Princeton New Jersey everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture and I hope when you learn things like about how the natural world works I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child so science is done by that demographic there all of those people are between 20 and 30 years old and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country and it's a really lucky demographic to work with I keep getting older and older and they're

a human being and so of course it's the DNA that counts so here's all the 80 G's and C's that make up your genetic code and give you all your charming characteristics so you have about 30,000 genes well it turns out you have a hundred times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life and so at the best your 10% human we're more likely about 1% human depending on which of these metrics you like so I know you think of yourself as human beings but I think of you as ninety or ninety two point nine percent bacterial and these bacteria are not passive writers these are incredibly important they keep us alive they cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy they digest our food they make our vitamins they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out so they do all these amazing things that help us and keep in our vital for keeping us alive and they never get any press for that but they get a lot

that's how it works we also then went to look at what are these molecules so these were the red triangles on my slides before and so this is the Vibrio fischeri molecule this is the word that it talks with and then we started to look at other bacteria and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered and what I hope you can see is that the molecules are related so the left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria but the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species and what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages so each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other so these are private secret conversations these conversations are for interest species communication each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's it like its language that allows it to count its own siblings and so once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors but we started what we're really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves they live in incredible mixtures with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria and that's depicted on this slide this is your skin so this is just a picture a micrograph of your skin anywhere on your body it looks pretty much like this and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there and so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria and it's about counting your neighbors it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species there has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population so we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria and what we found now is that in fact bacteria are multilingual so they all have a species specific system they have a molecule that says me but then running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered that's generic so they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria it's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication and so what happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you and they take that in for Meishan inside and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population and so then again we turn to chemistry and we figured out what this generic molecule is so that was the pink ovals on my last slide this is it it's a very small five carbon molecule and what the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule so they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication so this is the bacterial Esperanto and so once we got that far we've started to learn the bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language but what we started to think is that maybe there's something practical that we can do here as well so I've told you the bacteria do you have all these social behaviors that they communicate with these molecules and of course I've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing so we thought what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics and of course you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics bacteria are incredibly multi drug-resistant right now and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria so they either pop the bacterial membrane they make that bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA we kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants and so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases so we thought well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications just make these bacteria so they can't talk they can't count and they don't know to launch virulence and so that's exactly what we've done and we've sort of taken two strategies the first one is we've targeted the intra species communication system so we've made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules which you saw but they're a little bit different and so they lock into those receptors and they Jam recognition of the real thing and so by targeting the red system what we are able to do is to make species specific or disease specific anti quorum sensing molecules we've also done the same thing with the pink system we've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we've made in goodness of the interspecies communication system and these the hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria and so to finish I'll just show you the strategy and this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule but the logic is exactly the same so what you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal in this case a mouse it doesn't initiate virulence right away it gets in it starts growing it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they're going to launch their attack and the animal dies and so what we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections but we give them in conjunction with our anti quorum sensing molecules so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide and what we now know is that if we treat the animal with the pathogenic bacterium a multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacterium in at the same time we give our anti quorum sensing molecule in fact the animal lives and so we think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around at least initially this big problem of resistance so what I hope you think is the bacteria can talk to each other they use chemicals as their words they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about and of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular right and so in the spirit of Ted they are doing things together because it makes a difference right so what happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals and what I would hope that I could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity bacteria had been on the year on the earth for billions of years humans a couple hundred thousands so we think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular an organization works and and we think by studying bacteria we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body so we know that the principles and the rules if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from others so by using these two molecules they can say me and they can say you and again of course that's what we do both as Malec in in a molecular way and then also in an outward way but I think about the molecular stuff this is exactly what happens in your body it's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is and what their tasks should be and so again we think that bacteria invented that and then you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study and then the final thing is again just to reiterate that there's this practical part and so we've made these anti quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics but then to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the earth we've also made Pro quorum sensing molecules so we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better and so remember you have these ten times or more bacterial cells in your on you keeping you healthy what we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualist with you in the hopes of making you more healthy making those conversations better so bacteria can do things that we want them to do by in here better than they would be on their own and then finally I wanted to show you this is my gang at Princeton New Jersey everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture and I hope when you learn things like about how the natural world works I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child so science is done by that demographic there all of those people are between 20 and 30 years old and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country and it's a really lucky demographic to work with I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age and it's just Anna crazy delightful job and I want to thank you for inviting me here it's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference you

[Music] [Music] openness it's a word that uh denotes opportunity and possibilities open-ended open harsh open source open door policy open bar and everywhere the world is opening up and it's a good thing why is this happening a technology Revolution is opening the world yesterday's internet was a platform for the presentation of content the internet of today is a platform for computation the internet is becoming a giant Global computer and every time you go on it you upload a video you do a Google search You remix something you're programming this big Global computer that we all share humanity is building a machine and this enables us to collaborate in new ways collaboration can occur on an astronomical basis now a new generation is opening up the world as well I started studying kids about 15 years ago so actually 20 years ago now and I noticed how my own children were effortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology and at first I thought my children are prodigies and uh but then I noticed all the friends were like them so that was a bad Theory so I started working with a few hundred uh kids and I came to the conclusion that this is the first generation to come of age in the digital age to be bathed in bits I called them the net generation I said these kids are different they have no fear of Technology because it's not there it's like the air sort of like I have no fear of a refrigerator and uh there there's no more powerful force to change every Institution than the first generation of digital natives I'm a digital immigrant I had to learn the language the global economic crisis is opening up the world as well our opaque institutions from the Industrial Age everything from old models of the corporation government media Wall Street are in various stages of being stalled or frozen or an atrophy or even failing and this is now creating a burning platform in the world I mean think about Wall Street the core modus operandi of Wall Street almost brought down global capitalism now you know the idea of a burning platform that you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are become greater than the cost of moving to something different perhaps something radically different and we need to change and open up all of our institutions so this technology push a demographic kick from a new generation and a demand pull from a new economic global environment is causing the world to open up now I think in fact we're at a turning point in human history where we can finally now rebuild many of the institutions of the Industrial Age around a new set of principles now what is openness well as it turns out openness has a number of different meanings and for each there's a corresponding principle for the transformation of civilization the first is collab ation now this is openness in the sense of the boundaries of organizations becoming more porous and fluid and open the guy in the picture here I'll tell you a story is his name is Rob mchan I'd like to say I have this stink tank we scour the world for amazing case studies the reason I know this story is because he's my neighbor um he actually moved across the street from us and he held a cocktail party to meet the neighbors and he says you're you're Don tavs Scot read some of your books I said great what do you do and he says well I used to be a banker and now I'm a gold miner and he tells me this amazing story he takes over this gold Min and his geologist can't tell him where the gold is he gives him more money for geological data they come back they can't tell him where to go into production after a few years he's so frustrated he's ready to give up but he has an epiphany one day he wonders if my geologists don't know where the gold is maybe somebody else does so he does a radical thing he takes his geological data he publishes it and he holds a contest on the internet called the gold Corp challenge it's basically uh half a million dollar in prize money for anyone who can tell me do I have any gold and if so where is it he gets submissions from all around the world they use techniques that he's never heard heard of and for his half a million dollars in prize money rob McKuen finds 3.4 billion doll worth of gold the market value of his company goes from 90 million to 10 billion dollars and I can tell you because he's my neighbor he's a happy camper you know conventional wisdom says Talent is inside right your most precious asso goes out the elevator every night he viewed Talent differently he wondered who are their peers he should have fired his geology Department uh but he didn't you know some of the best submissions didn't come from uh geologists they came from computer scientists engineers the winner was computer Graphics company that built a three-dimensional model of the Mind where you can helicopter underground and see where the gold is he helped us understand that social media is becoming social production this is not about hooking up online this is a new means of production in the making and this idea aora that he created an open market aora for uniquely qualified Minds was part of a change a profound change in the Deep structure and architecture of of our organizations and how we sort of uh orchestrate capability to innovate to create goods and services to engage with the rest of the world in terms of government how we create public value openness is about collaboration now secondly openness is about transparency this is different here we're talking about the communication of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations employees customers business partners shareholders and so on and everywhere our institutions are becoming naked people are all bent out of shape about Wikileaks but that's just the tip of the iceberg you see people at their fingertips now everybody not just jul Assange have have these powerful tools for finding out what's going on scrutinizing informing others and even organizing Collective responses institutions are becoming naked and if you're going to be naked well uh there are some crawler that flow from that I mean one is Fitness is no longer optional you know or if you're going to be naked you better get buff Now by Buff I mean you need to have good value because value is evidence like never before you say have good products they better be good but you also need to have values you need to have integrity as part of your bones and your DNA as an organization because if you don't You' be unable to build trust and trust is a sign of clome this new network world so this is good it's not bad sunlight is the best disinfectant and we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world now the third meaning and corresponding principle of openness is about sharing now this is different than transparency transparency is about the communication of information sharing is about giving up assets intellectual property there are all kinds of famous stories about this IBM gave away $400 million of software to the Linux movement and that gave them a multi-billion dollar payoff now convention wisdom says well hey our intellectual property belongs to us and if someone tries to infringe it we're going to get out our lawyers and we're going to sue them well it didn't work so well for the record labels did it I mean they they took they had a technology disruption and rather than taking a business model Innovation to correspond to that they took and sought a legal solution and the industry that brought you Elvis and The Beatles is now suing children is and is in danger of collapse so we need to think differently about intellectual property I'll give you an example the pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble first of all there aren't a lot of big inventions in the pipeline and this is a big problem for human health and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem that they're about to fall off something called the patent Cliff do you know about this they're going to lose 20 to 35% of their revenue in the next 12 months now what are you going to do like cut back on paper clips or something no we need to reinvent the whole model of of scientific research the pharmaceutical industry needs to place Assets in a Commons they need to start sharing pre-competitive research they need to start sharing clinical trial data and in doing so create a rising tide that could lift all boats not just for the industry but for Humanity now the fourth meaning of openness and corresponding principle is about empowerment I'm not talking about the motherhood sense here knowledge and intelligence is power and as it becomes more distributed there's a a concominant distribution and decentralization and disaggregation of power that's underway in the world today the open world is bringing Freedom now take the Arab Spring the debate about the role of social media and social change has been settled you know one word Tunisia and then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too but in the Tunisian Revolution the New Media didn't cause the revolution it was caused by Injustice social media didn't create the revolution it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who who didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore but just as the internet drops transaction and collaboration costs in business and government it also drops the cost of dissent of rebellion and even Insurrection in ways that people didn't understand you know during the Tunisian Revolution snipers associated with the regime were killing unarmed students in the street so the students would take their mobile devices take a picture triangulate the location send that picture to Friendly military units who'd come in and take out the snipers you think that social media is about hooking up online for these kids it was a military tool to defend unarmed people from murderers as a tool of self-defense you know as we speak today young people are being killed in Syria and up until 3 months ago if you were injured on the street an ambulance would pick you up take you to the hospital you'd go in say with a broken leg and you come out with a bullet in your head so these 20s somethings create an alternative Health Care System where what they did is they used Twitter and basic publicly available tools that when someone's in injured a car would show up it would pick them up take them to a makeshift Medical Clinic where you get medical treatment as opposed to being executed so this is a time of great change now it's not without its problems up until two years ago all Revolutions in human history had a leadership and when the old regime fell the the leadership the organization would take power well thesei Wiki revolutions happen so fast they create a vacuum and politics abhor vacuum and unsavory forces can fill that typically the old regime or extremists or fundamentalist forces you can see this playing out today in Egypt but that doesn't matter because this is moving forward the train has left the station the cat is out of the bag the the horse is out of the bar help me out here okay the toothpaste is out of the tube I mean we're not putting this one back the open world is bringing empowerment and freedom I think at the end of these four days that you'll come to conclude that the Ark of history is a positive one and it's towards openness if you go back few hundred years all around the world it was a very close Society it was agrarian and the means of production and political system was called feudalism and knowledge was concentrated in the church and the and and the nobility people didn't know about things there was no concept of progress you were born you lived your life and you died but then Johannes Gutenberg came along with with his great invention and over time the society opened up people started to learn about things and when they did the institutions of feudal society appeared to be stalled or frozen or failing it didn't make sense for the church to be responsible for medicine when people had knowledge so we saw the Protestant Reformation Martin Luther called the printing press God's highest ACT of Grace creation of a corporation science the university eventually the Industrial Revolution and it was all good but it came with a cost and now once again the technology Genie is out of the bottle but this time it's different the printing press gave us access to the written word the internet enables each of us to be a producer the the printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge the internet gives us access not just to information and knowledge but to the intelligence contained in the crany of other people on a on a global basis to me this is not an Information Age it's an age of networked intelligence it's an age of vast promise an age of collaboration where the boundaries of our organizations are changing of transparency where sunlight is disinfecting civilization an age of sharing and understanding the new power of the commons and it's an age of empowerment and of freedom now what I'd like to do is uh to close to share with you uh some research that I've been doing I've tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like but I've been studying nature recently you know bees come in swarms and fish come in schools starlings in the area around Edinburgh in the Moors of England come in something called called a murmuration and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings of the birds and throughout the day the starlings are out over a 20 M radius sort of doing their Starling thing and at night they come together and they create one of the most spectacular things in all of Nature and it's called a murmuration um and scientists that have studied this has said they'd never seen an accident now this thing has a function it protects the birds you can see on the right here there's a predator being chased away by the collective power of the birds apparently this is a frightening thing if you're a predator of Starlings and there's leadership but there's no one leader now is this some kind of fanciful analogy or could we actually learn something from this well the murmuration function still cord a number of principles and they're basically the principles that I describe to you today this is a huge collaboration it's an openness there a sharing of all kinds of information not just about location and trajectory and and danger and so on but about food sources and there's a real sense of interdependence of that the individual birds somehow understand that their interests are in the interests of the collective perhaps like we should understand that the the business can't succeed in a world that's failing well I look at this thing and I get lot of Hope think about the kids today in in the Arab Spring and you see something like this that's underway and imagine just consider this idea if you would what if we could connect ourselves in this world through a vast network of air and glass could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge could we start to share our intelligence could we create some kind of collective int intelligence that goes beyond an individual or a group or a team to create perhaps some kind of Consciousness on a global basis well if we could do this we could attack some big problems in the world and I look at this thing and I I don't know I get a lot of hope that maybe this smaller networked open world that our kids inherit might be a better one and that this new age of networked intelligence could be an age of of promise fulfilled and of peril unrequited let's do this thank [Applause] [Music] you

structure and architecture of of our organizations and how we sort of uh orchestrate capability to innovate to create goods and services to engage with the rest of the world in terms of government how we create public value openness is about collaboration now secondly openness is about transparency this is different here we're talking about the communication of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations employees customers business partners shareholders and so on and everywhere our institutions are becoming naked people are all bent out of shape about Wikileaks but that's just the tip of the iceberg you see people at their fingertips now everybody not just jul Assange have have these powerful tools for finding out what's going on scrutinizing informing others and even organizing Collective responses institutions are becoming naked and if you're going to be naked well uh there are some crawler that flow from that I mean one is Fitness is no longer optional you know or if you're going to be naked you better get buff Now by Buff I mean you need to have good value because value is evidence like never before you say have good products they better be good but you also need to have values you need to have integrity as part of your bones and your DNA as an organization because if you don't You' be unable to build trust and trust is a sign of clome this new network world so this is good it's not bad sunlight is the best disinfectant and we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world now the third meaning and corresponding principle of openness is about sharing now this is different than transparency transparency is about the communication of information sharing is about giving up assets intellectual property there are all kinds of famous stories about this IBM gave away $400 million of software to the Linux movement and that gave them a multi-billion dollar payoff now convention wisdom says well hey our intellectual property belongs to us and if someone tries to infringe it we're going to get out our lawyers and we're going to sue them well it didn't work so well for the record labels did it I mean they they took they had a technology disruption and rather than taking a business model Innovation to correspond to that they took and sought a legal solution and the industry that brought you Elvis and The Beatles is now suing children is and is in danger of collapse so we need to think differently about intellectual property I'll give you an example the pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble first of all there aren't a lot of big inventions in the pipeline and this is a big problem for human health and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem that they're about to fall off something called the patent Cliff do you know about this they're going to lose 20 to 35% of their revenue in the next 12 months now what are you going to do like cut back on paper clips or something no we need to reinvent the whole model of of scientific research the pharmaceutical industry needs to place Assets in a Commons they need to start sharing pre-competitive research they need to start sharing clinical trial data and in doing so create a rising tide that could lift all boats not just for the industry but for Humanity now the fourth meaning of openness and corresponding principle is about empowerment I'm not talking about the motherhood sense here knowledge and intelligence is power and as it becomes more distributed there's a a concominant distribution and decentralization and disaggregation of power that's underway in the world today the open world is bringing Freedom now take the Arab Spring the debate about the role of social media and social change has been settled you know one word Tunisia and then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too but in the Tunisian Revolution the New Media didn't cause the revolution it was caused by Injustice social media didn't create the revolution it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who who didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore but just as the internet drops transaction and collaboration costs in business and government it also drops the cost of dissent of rebellion and even Insurrection in ways that people didn't understand you know during the Tunisian Revolution snipers associated with the regime were killing unarmed students in the street so the students would take their mobile devices take a picture triangulate the location send that picture to Friendly military units who'd come in and take out the snipers you think that social media is about hooking up online for these kids it was a military tool to defend unarmed people from murderers as a tool of self-defense you know as we speak today young people are being killed in Syria and up until 3 months ago if you were injured on the street an ambulance would pick you up take you to the hospital you'd go in say with a broken leg and you come out with a bullet in your head so these 20s somethings create an alternative Health Care System where what they did is they used Twitter and basic publicly available tools that when someone's in injured a car would show up it would pick them up take them to a makeshift Medical Clinic where you get medical treatment as opposed to being executed so this is a time of great change now it's not without its problems up until two years ago all Revolutions in human history had a leadership and when the old regime fell the the leadership the organization would take power well thesei Wiki revolutions happen so fast they create a vacuum and politics abhor vacuum and unsavory forces can fill that typically the old regime or extremists or fundamentalist forces you can see this playing out today in Egypt but that doesn't matter because this is moving forward the train has left the station the cat is out of the bag the the horse is out of the bar help me out here okay the toothpaste is out of the tube I mean we're not putting this one back the open world is bringing empowerment and freedom I think at the end of these four days that you'll come to conclude that the Ark of history is a positive one and it's towards openness if you go back few hundred years all around the world it was a very close Society it was agrarian and the means of production and political system was called feudalism and knowledge was concentrated in the church and the and and the nobility people didn't know about things there was no concept of progress you were born you lived your life and you died but then Johannes Gutenberg came along with with his great invention and over time the society opened up people started to learn about things and when they did the institutions of feudal society appeared to be stalled or frozen or failing it didn't make sense for the church to be responsible for medicine when people had knowledge so we saw the Protestant Reformation Martin Luther called the printing press God's highest ACT of Grace creation of a corporation science the university eventually the Industrial Revolution and it was all good but it came with a cost and now once again the technology Genie is out of the bottle but this time it's different the printing press gave us access to the written word the internet enables each of us to be a producer the the printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge the internet gives us access not just to information and knowledge but to the intelligence contained in the crany of other people on a on a global basis to me this is not an Information Age it's an age of networked intelligence it's an age of vast promise an age of collaboration where the boundaries of our organizations are changing of transparency where sunlight is disinfecting civilization an age of sharing and understanding the new power of the commons and it's an age of empowerment and of freedom now what I'd like to do is uh to close to share with you uh some research that I've been doing I've tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like but I've been studying nature recently you know bees come in swarms and fish come in schools starlings in the area around Edinburgh in the Moors of England come in something called called a murmuration and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings of the birds and throughout the day the starlings are out over a 20 M radius sort of doing their Starling thing and at night they come together and they create one of the most spectacular things in all of Nature and it's called a murmuration um and scientists that have studied this has said they'd never seen an accident now this thing has a function it protects the birds you can see on the right here there's a predator being chased away by the collective power of the birds apparently this is a frightening thing if you're a predator of Starlings and there's leadership but there's no one leader now is this some kind of fanciful analogy or could we actually learn something from this well the murmuration function still cord a number of principles and they're basically the principles that I describe to you today this is a huge collaboration it's an openness there a sharing of all kinds of information not just about location and trajectory and and danger and so on but about food sources and there's a real sense of interdependence of that the individual birds somehow understand that their interests are in the interests of the collective perhaps like we should understand that the the business can't succeed in a world that's failing well I look at this thing and I get lot of Hope think about the kids today in in the Arab Spring and you see something like this that's underway and imagine just consider this idea if you would what if we could connect ourselves in this world through a vast network of air and glass could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge could we start to share our intelligence could we create some kind of collective int intelligence that goes beyond an individual or a group or a team to create perhaps some kind of Consciousness on a global basis well if we could do this we could attack some big problems in the world and I look at this thing and I I don't know I get a lot of hope that maybe this smaller networked open world that our kids inherit might be a better one and that this new age of networked intelligence could be an age of of promise fulfilled and of peril unrequited let's do this thank [Applause] [Music] you

[Music] [Music] openness it's a word that uh denotes opportunity and possibilities open-ended open harsh open source open door policy open bar and everywhere the world is opening up and it's a good thing why is this happening a technology Revolution is opening the world yesterday's internet was a platform for the presentation of content the internet of today is a platform for computation the internet is becoming a giant Global computer and every time you go on it you upload a video you do a Google search You remix something you're programming this big Global computer that we all share humanity is building a machine and this enables us to collaborate in new ways collaboration can occur on an astronomical basis now a new generation is opening up the world as well I started studying kids about 15 years ago so actually 20 years ago now and I noticed how my own children were effortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology and at first I thought my children are prodigies and uh but then I noticed all the friends were like them so that was a bad Theory so I started working with a few hundred uh kids and I came to the conclusion that this is the first generation to come of age in the digital age to be bathed in bits I called them the net generation I said these kids are different they have no fear of Technology because it's not there it's like the air sort of like I have no fear of a refrigerator and uh there there's no more powerful force to change every Institution than the first generation of digital natives I'm a digital immigrant I had to learn the language the global economic crisis is opening up the world as well our opaque institutions from the Industrial Age everything from old models of the corporation government media Wall Street are in various stages of being stalled or frozen or an atrophy or even failing and this is now creating a burning platform in the world I mean think about Wall Street the core modus operandi of Wall Street almost brought down global capitalism now you know the idea of a burning platform that you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are become greater than the cost of moving to something different perhaps something radically different and we need to change and open up all of our institutions so this technology push a demographic kick from a new generation and a demand pull from a new economic global environment is causing the world to open up now I think in fact we're at a turning point in human history where we can finally now rebuild many of the institutions of the Industrial Age around a new set of principles now what is openness well as it turns out openness has a number of different meanings and for each there's a corresponding principle for the transformation of civilization the first is collab ation now this is openness in the sense of the boundaries of organizations becoming more porous and fluid and open the guy in the picture here I'll tell you a story is his name is Rob mchan I'd like to say I have this stink tank we scour the world for amazing case studies the reason I know this story is because he's my neighbor um he actually moved across the street from us and he held a cocktail party to meet the neighbors and he says you're you're Don tavs Scot read some of your books I said great what do you do and he says well I used to be a banker and now I'm a gold miner and he tells me this amazing story he takes over this gold Min and his geologist can't tell him where the gold is he gives him more money for geological data they come back they can't tell him where to go into production after a few years he's so frustrated he's ready to give up but he has an epiphany one day he wonders if my geologists don't know where the gold is maybe somebody else does so he does a radical thing he takes his geological data he publishes it and he holds a contest on the internet called the gold Corp challenge it's basically uh half a million dollar in prize money for anyone who can tell me do I have any gold and if so where is it he gets submissions from all around the world they use techniques that he's never heard heard of and for his half a million dollars in prize money rob McKuen finds 3.4 billion doll worth of gold the market value of his company goes from 90 million to 10 billion dollars and I can tell you because he's my neighbor he's a happy camper you know conventional wisdom says Talent is inside right your most precious asso goes out the elevator every night he viewed Talent differently he wondered who are their peers he should have fired his geology Department uh but he didn't you know some of the best submissions didn't come from uh geologists they came from computer scientists engineers the winner was computer Graphics company that

prize money rob McKuen finds 3.4 billion doll worth of gold the market value of his company goes from 90 million to 10 billion dollars and I can tell you because he's my neighbor he's a happy camper you know conventional wisdom says Talent is inside right your most precious asso goes out the elevator every night he viewed Talent differently he wondered who are their peers he should have fired his geology Department uh but he didn't you know some of the best submissions didn't come from uh geologists they came from computer scientists engineers the winner was computer Graphics company that built a three-dimensional model of the Mind where you can helicopter underground and see where the gold is he helped us understand that social media is becoming social production this is not about hooking up online this is a new means of production in the making and this idea aora that he created an open market aora for uniquely qualified Minds was part of a change a profound change in the Deep structure and architecture of of our organizations and how we sort of uh orchestrate capability to innovate to create goods and services to engage with the rest of the world in terms of government how we create public value openness is about collaboration now secondly openness is about transparency this is different here we're talking about the communication of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations employees customers business partners shareholders and so on and everywhere our institutions are becoming naked people are all bent out of shape about Wikileaks but that's just the tip of the iceberg you see people at their fingertips now everybody not just jul Assange have have these powerful tools for finding out what's going on scrutinizing informing others and even organizing Collective responses institutions are becoming naked and if you're going to be naked well uh there are some crawler that flow from that I mean one is Fitness is no longer optional you know or if you're going to be naked you better get buff Now by Buff I mean you need to have good value because value is evidence like never before you say have good products they better be good but you also need to have values you need to have integrity as part of your bones and your DNA as an organization because if you don't You' be unable to build trust and trust is a sign of clome this new network world so this is good it's not bad sunlight is the best disinfectant and we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world now the third meaning and corresponding principle of openness is about sharing now this is different than transparency transparency is about the communication of information sharing is about giving up assets intellectual property there are all kinds of famous stories about this IBM gave away $400 million of software to the Linux movement and that gave them a multi-billion dollar payoff now convention wisdom says well hey our intellectual property belongs to us and if someone tries to infringe it we're going to get out our lawyers and we're going to sue them well it didn't work so well for the record labels did it I mean they they took they had a technology disruption and rather than taking a business model Innovation to correspond to that they took and sought a legal solution and the industry that brought you Elvis and The Beatles is now suing children is and is in danger of collapse so we need to think differently about intellectual property I'll give you an example the pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble first of all there aren't a lot of big inventions in the pipeline and this is a big problem for human health and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem that they're about to fall off something called the patent Cliff do you know about this they're going to lose 20 to 35% of their revenue in the next 12 months now what are you going to do like cut back on paper clips or something no we need to reinvent the whole model of of scientific research the pharmaceutical industry needs to place Assets in a Commons they need to start sharing pre-competitive research they need to start sharing clinical trial data and in doing so create a rising tide that could lift all boats not just for the industry but for Humanity now the fourth meaning of openness and corresponding principle is about empowerment I'm not talking about the motherhood sense here knowledge and intelligence is power and as it becomes more distributed there's a a concominant distribution and decentralization and disaggregation of power that's underway in the world today the open world is bringing Freedom now take the Arab Spring the debate about the role of social media and social change has been settled you know one word Tunisia and then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too but in the Tunisian Revolution the New Media didn't cause the revolution it was caused by Injustice social media didn't create the revolution it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who who didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore but just as the internet drops transaction and collaboration costs in business and government it also drops the cost of dissent of rebellion and even Insurrection in ways that people didn't understand you know during the Tunisian Revolution snipers associated with the regime were killing unarmed students in the street so the students would take their mobile devices take a picture triangulate the location send that picture to Friendly military units who'd come in and take out the snipers you think that social media is about hooking up online for these kids it was a military tool to defend unarmed people from murderers as a tool of self-defense you know as we speak today young people are being killed in Syria and up until 3 months ago if you were injured on the street an ambulance would pick you up take you to the hospital you'd go in say with a broken leg and you come out with a bullet in your head so these 20s somethings create an alternative Health Care System where what they did is they used Twitter and basic publicly available tools that when someone's in injured a car would show up it would pick them up take them to a makeshift Medical Clinic where you get medical treatment as opposed to being executed so this is a time of great change now it's not without its problems up until two years ago all Revolutions in human history had a leadership and when the old regime fell the the leadership the organization would take power well thesei Wiki revolutions happen so fast they create a vacuum and politics abhor vacuum and unsavory forces can fill that typically the old regime or extremists or fundamentalist forces you can see this playing out today in Egypt but that doesn't matter because this is moving forward the train has left the station the cat is out of the bag the the horse is out of the bar help me out here okay the toothpaste is out of the tube I mean we're not putting this one back the open world is bringing empowerment and freedom I think at the end of these four days that you'll come to conclude that the Ark of history is a positive one and it's towards openness if you go back few hundred years all around the world it was a very close Society it was agrarian and the means of production and political system was called feudalism and knowledge was concentrated in the church and the and and the nobility people didn't know about things there was no concept of progress you were born you lived your life and you died but then Johannes Gutenberg came along with with his great invention and over time the society opened up people started to learn about things and when they did the institutions of feudal society appeared to be stalled or frozen or failing it didn't make sense for the church to be responsible for medicine when people had knowledge so we saw the Protestant Reformation Martin Luther called the printing press God's highest ACT of Grace creation of a corporation science the university eventually the Industrial Revolution and it was all good but it came with a cost and now once again the technology Genie is out of the bottle but this time it's different the printing press gave us access to the written word the internet enables each of us to be a producer the the printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge the internet gives us access not just to information and knowledge but to the intelligence contained in the crany of other people on a on a global basis to me this is not an Information Age it's an age of networked intelligence it's an age of vast promise an age of collaboration where the boundaries of our organizations are changing of transparency where sunlight is disinfecting civilization an age of sharing and understanding the new power of the commons and it's an age of empowerment and of freedom now what I'd like to do is uh to close to share with you uh some research that I've been doing I've tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like but I've been studying nature recently you know bees come in swarms and fish come in schools starlings in the area around Edinburgh in the Moors of England come in something called called a murmuration and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings of the birds and throughout the day the starlings are out over a 20 M radius sort of doing their Starling thing and at night they come together and they create one of the most spectacular things in all of Nature and it's called a murmuration um and scientists that have studied this has said they'd never seen an accident now this thing has a function it protects the birds you can see on the right here there's a predator being chased away by the collective power of the birds apparently this is a frightening thing if you're a predator of Starlings and there's leadership but there's no one leader now is this some kind of fanciful analogy or could we actually learn something from this well the murmuration function still cord a number of principles and they're basically the principles that I describe to you today this is a huge collaboration it's an openness there a sharing of all kinds of information not just about location and trajectory and and danger and so on but about food sources and there's a real sense of interdependence of that the individual birds somehow understand that their interests are in the interests of the collective perhaps like we should understand that the the business can't succeed in a world that's failing well I look at this thing and I get lot of Hope think about the kids today in in the Arab Spring and you see something like this that's underway and imagine just consider this idea if you would what if we could connect ourselves in this world through a vast network of air and glass could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge could we start to share our intelligence could we create some kind of collective int intelligence that goes beyond an individual or a group or a team to create perhaps some kind of Consciousness on a global basis well if we could do this we could attack some big problems in the world and I look at this thing and I I don't know I get a lot of hope that maybe this smaller networked open world that our kids inherit might be a better one and that this new age of networked intelligence could be an age of of promise fulfilled and of peril unrequited let's do this thank [Applause] [Music] you

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you heard the one about Thomas Jefferson and the Louisiana Territory? Thomas Jefferson, author of The Declaration of Independence, was not a fan of the new constitution presented in 1787. He was very worried that The Constitution gave too much power to the new, national government, and not enough power to the states, an issue known as "big government". Jefferson only reluctantly agreed to support it when his friend, James Madison, promised to propose a bill of rights after it was ratified. But Jefferson's fears about big government did not go away. For example, Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, proposed a national bank in 1790, and Jefferson knew there was no provision in The Constitution to permit such a thing. Hamilton claimed some sort of implied powers mumbo-jumbo. Sure, it wasn't written in The Constitution, but The Constitution implied that it could be done. But, Jefferson wasn't buying it. Nonetheless, the bank was established by Hamilton and President Washington. When Jefferson was sworn in as President in 1801, he pledged to reduce the size and scope of the national government. But, of course, things didn't go exactly as he had planned. Spain secretly transferred the Louisiana Territory to France right beneath Jefferson's nose. When Congress found out, they quickly began discussions with France to buy a piece of the territory along the Mississippi River for about $2 million. But, there was one little problem: Jefferson knew there was no provision in The Constitution to buy foreign territory. So what was a strict constructionist to do? First, he tried to get an amendment to The Constitution passed that would expressly permit the purchase, but Congress wasn't willing to do it. Then, without permission, the U.S. negotiators in France cut a deal for all of the territory for a cool $15 million dollars. That new land doubled the size of the nation! Now Jefferson was really stuck. He knew that the territory would be a great acquisition for the country, providing lots of new land for farmers and other settlers, but how could he constitutionally justify it? In the end, Jefferson turned to the argument used by his old foe Alexander Hamilton. He claimed that the power to purchase the territory is implied in The Constitution's treaty-making power. This was the exact argument that he had mocked openly a decade before, so it must have crushed his pride to have to use it. But more importantly, he may have committed the biggest big government play ever! How ironic is it that one of the biggest opponents of big government doubled the size of the young country and did so while openly questioning its constitutionality? At $15 million, which is about three cents an acre, it has been called by many the greatest real estate deal in the history of the United States.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

When Congress found out, they quickly began discussions with France to buy a piece of the territory along the Mississippi River for about $2 million. But, there was one little problem: Jefferson knew there was no provision in The Constitution to buy foreign territory. So what was a strict constructionist to do? First, he tried to get an amendment to The Constitution passed that would expressly permit the purchase, but Congress wasn't willing to do it. Then, without permission, the U.S. negotiators in France cut a deal for all of the territory for a cool $15 million dollars. That new land doubled the size of the nation! Now Jefferson was really stuck. He knew that the territory would be a great acquisition for the country, providing lots of new land for farmers and other settlers, but how could he constitutionally justify it? In the end, Jefferson turned to the argument used by his old foe Alexander Hamilton. He claimed that the power to purchase the territory is implied in The Constitution's treaty-making power. This was the exact argument that he had mocked openly a decade before, so it must have crushed his pride to have to use it. But more importantly, he may have committed the biggest big government play ever! How ironic is it that one of the biggest opponents of big government doubled the size of the young country and did so while openly questioning its constitutionality?

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you heard the one about Thomas Jefferson and the Louisiana Territory? Thomas Jefferson, author of The Declaration of Independence, was not a fan of the new constitution presented in 1787. He was very worried that The Constitution gave too much power to the new, national government, and not enough power to the states, an issue known as "big government". Jefferson only reluctantly agreed to support it when his friend, James Madison, promised to propose a bill of rights after it was ratified. But Jefferson's fears about big government did not go away. For example, Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, proposed a national bank in 1790, and Jefferson knew there was no provision in The Constitution to permit such a thing. Hamilton claimed some sort of implied powers mumbo-jumbo. Sure, it wasn't written in The Constitution, but The Constitution implied that it could be done. But, Jefferson wasn't buying it. Nonetheless, the bank was established by Hamilton and President Washington. When Jefferson was sworn in as President in 1801, he pledged to reduce the size and scope of the national government. But, of course, things didn't go exactly as he had planned. Spain secretly transferred the Louisiana Territory to France right beneath Jefferson's nose. When Congress found out, they quickly began discussions with France to buy a piece of the territory along the Mississippi River for about $2 million. But, there was one little problem: Jefferson knew there was no provision in The Constitution to buy foreign territory. So what was a strict constructionist to do?

Now Jefferson was really stuck.

In the end, Jefferson turned to the argument used by his old foe Alexander Hamilton. He claimed that the power to purchase the territory is implied in The Constitution's treaty-making power.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar So how many of you have a robot at home? OK, I see about 20, 30 hands. That's actually pretty good. How many of you would want
your own personal robot at home? I know I would! OK, so why doesn't this exist? Why can't I go to the convenience store
or the department store and, you know, go up to the cashier and say,
"Yeah, I want my personal robot"? Well, I'm going to talk to you
about how to make that happen. The thing that we need to do
is to make robots smarter. Now, no one will argue
that we don't have robots. We have rovers that are going to Mars
and are getting science data and expanding our
understanding of the world. We have manufacturing robots that are helping to build our cars
that we drive today. We even have robots
that are helping our military, that are out disposing of bombs so our soldiers can come home safely. So we have all this,
so why don't we have the personal robot? Why don't I have my robot chef?
Because I can't cook. (Laughter) So, here's one of my robots,
this is a simple walking robot, but it is by no means smart. And so, what we need to do is we need to change the definition
of what a robot is. How do we do that? Well, the first step, before we even start designing
and getting our hands dirty, we have to come up with rules,
kind of the laws, rules of conduct. And why is this?
Because if these robots are smart, they might be capable
of more than we want. And so we have to come up with rules. Thou, robot, shall not harm a human. Thou shall obey me, and only me. Thou shall always protect me
at all possible times. So we have to lay the boundaries,
the rules of engagement, before we actually start designing. And then we have to come up with tools. So I believe that the way
to make robots smarter is to mimic people. Now, our brains are complex,
there's a lot going on in there, and so, it'd be hard
to try to open up the brain and actually figure out
how to mimic humans. The best way is to observe,
is to actually watch people do things, and figure out what are they doing,
what are their thoughts, what are their actions,
what are their emotions? And so, part of making robots smarter
is actually trying to mimic humans, mimic how we do things, so maybe they can do it
a little bit better. And so, some of the tools are varied. And so, I'm classically trained
as an electrical engineer. I never thought I'd have to understand
things like child psychology, infant development. So, understanding that the way
infants develop to children, develop to adults,
and how they learn and interact is actually important for robotics. I didn't understand
that I'd actually have to watch tapes of monkeys
interacting and communicating, because they have
a whole social kind of mechanism where they learn from each other, and so that's really good
to make robots smarter. And, of course, neuroscience, I've always been fascinated
with neuroscience, but I never understood
that I had to figure out why do the neurons fire, what about the environment
helps us to learn, and all of those really contribute
to making robots a little bit smarter. And so, some of the things that I do --
and this is just a little snapshot -- one of the things is mirroring. So they say our ability
to look in a mirror and wave and actually recognize
that the person on the other side is us, that self-awareness, is a sign of intelligence, and that allows us
to then look at someone pitch a ball and figure out,
"OK, I know how to pitch a ball, I'm going to mirror their improvement." And so I actually have a robot where we are trying to design
a robot health coach. And so, I have an exercise physiologist showing the robot
how to do some exercises. You know, we want to get strong. And then, the other thing is learning. So, learning is important.
We do this as children, we do this even as adults,
we do this as elder. And yet, one form of learning
is muscle memory. So how many of you play an instrument? OK, so when you start off, for example,
if you think about the violin, you start off and your instructor
might actually come and move your hand a little bit
or maybe move your bow a little bit up. So they actually touch you
in order to give you muscle memory. And that helps you understand
how to do things a little better. And so we actually
have a learning methodology where of course, we're not going
to take the motors and move the legs, and so we have to Nunchuk
to give our robot muscle memory in terms of how to do dance moves. And then, lastly, is creativity. So, you might ask,
"Robots? Creativity? I don't get this. Why does the robot have to be creative?
What about creativity makes them smarter?" Well, creativity and imagination, those are the things
that allow us to create problems when we don't know how to attack it. They allow us to make
something out of nothing. I mean, if you look at the apps
that at out there and the tablets, and the iPads, and the iPhones,
and the Androids -- 20 years ago they didn't exist. So, how is it that we got from something
where there was nothing and expanded? It was our imagination.
It was our creativity. And these are the things
that allow us to figure out new things. And so, I have a robot that is creative, it plays piano, is a composer, and if you listen, it plays
"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star." (Music) So, all of this together, the last thing is interaction. So, you have a robot,
you want it to be your playmate, your teacher, your instructor, you want it to interact. And isn't it so cute? (Laughter) So, interaction is key, it is key to understanding
how to work in our world with us, and so the interaction piece
is very important. It deals with communication,
it deals with understanding, it deals with gaze,
it deals with attention. All of these things together
allow that interaction and our robots to be smart. And so these are just some of the tools that we use in order
to make robots smarter. So, I want to leave you with one thought. So, I'm all for robots and smart robots. I mean, that's what I do, I'd be out of a job
if I didn't believe in that. But yet, where does it end? How far do we push it? How far and how smart
should we make our smart robots? Thank you. (Applause)

Because if these robots are smart, they might be capable
of more than we want. And so we have to come up with rules. Thou, robot, shall not harm a human. Thou shall obey me, and only me. Thou shall always protect me
at all possible times. So we have to lay the boundaries,
the rules of engagement, before we actually start designing. And then we have to come up with tools. So I believe that the way
to make robots smarter is to mimic people. Now, our brains are complex,
there's a lot going on in there, and so, it'd be hard
to try to open up the brain and actually figure out
how to mimic humans. The best way is to observe,
is to actually watch people do things, and figure out what are they doing,
what are their thoughts, what are their actions,
what are their emotions? And so, part of making robots smarter
is actually trying to mimic humans, mimic how we do things, so maybe they can do it
a little bit better. And so, some of the tools are varied. And so, I'm classically trained
as an electrical engineer. I never thought I'd have to understand
things like child psychology, infant development. So, understanding that the way
infants develop to children, develop to adults,
and how they learn and interact is actually important for robotics. I didn't understand
that I'd actually have to watch tapes of monkeys
interacting and communicating, because they have
a whole social kind of mechanism where they learn from each other, and so that's really good
to make robots smarter. And, of course, neuroscience, I've always been fascinated
with neuroscience, but I never understood
that I had to figure out why do the neurons fire, what about the environment
helps us to learn, and all of those really contribute
to making robots a little bit smarter. And so, some of the things that I do --
and this is just a little snapshot -- one of the things is mirroring. So they say our ability
to look in a mirror and wave and actually recognize
that the person on the other side is us, that self-awareness, is a sign of intelligence, and that allows us
to then look at someone pitch a ball and figure out,
"OK, I know how to pitch a ball, I'm going to mirror their improvement." And so I actually have a robot where we are trying to design
a robot health coach. And so, I have an exercise physiologist showing the robot
how to do some exercises. You know, we want to get strong. And then, the other thing is learning. So, learning is important.
We do this as children, we do this even as adults,
we do this as elder. And yet, one form of learning
is muscle memory. So how many of you play an instrument? OK, so when you start off, for example,
if you think about the violin, you start off and your instructor
might actually come and move your hand a little bit
or maybe move your bow a little bit up. So they actually touch you
in order to give you muscle memory. And that helps you understand
how to do things a little better. And so we actually
have a learning methodology where of course, we're not going
to take the motors and move the legs, and so we have to Nunchuk
to give our robot muscle memory in terms of how to do dance moves. And then, lastly, is creativity. So, you might ask,
"Robots? Creativity? I don't get this. Why does the robot have to be creative?
What about creativity makes them smarter?" Well, creativity and imagination, those are the things
that allow us to create problems when we don't know how to attack it. They allow us to make
something out of nothing. I mean, if you look at the apps
that at out there and the tablets, and the iPads, and the iPhones,
and the Androids -- 20 years ago they didn't exist. So, how is it that we got from something
where there was nothing and expanded? It was our imagination.
It was our creativity. And these are the things
that allow us to figure out new things. And so, I have a robot that is creative, it plays piano, is a composer, and if you listen, it plays
"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star." (Music) So, all of this together, the last thing is interaction. So, you have a robot,
you want it to be your playmate, your teacher, your instructor, you want it to interact. And isn't it so cute? (Laughter) So, interaction is key, it is key to understanding
how to work in our world with us, and so the interaction piece
is very important. It deals with communication,
it deals with understanding, it deals with gaze,
it deals with attention. All of these things together
allow that interaction and our robots to be smart. And so these are just some of the tools that we use in order
to make robots smarter. So, I want to leave you with one thought. So, I'm all for robots and smart robots. I mean, that's what I do, I'd be out of a job
if I didn't believe in that. But yet, where does it end? How far do we push it? How far and how smart
should we make our smart robots? Thank you. (Applause)

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar So how many of you have a robot at home? OK, I see about 20, 30 hands. That's actually pretty good. How many of you would want
your own personal robot at home? I know I would! OK, so why doesn't this exist? Why can't I go to the convenience store
or the department store and, you know, go up to the cashier and say,
"Yeah, I want my personal robot"? Well, I'm going to talk to you
about how to make that happen. The thing that we need to do
is to make robots smarter. Now, no one will argue
that we don't have robots. We have rovers that are going to Mars
and are getting science data and expanding our
understanding of the world. We have manufacturing robots that are helping to build our cars
that we drive today. We even have robots
that are helping our military, that are out disposing of bombs so our soldiers can come home safely. So we have all this,
so why don't we have the personal robot? Why don't I have my robot chef?
Because I can't cook. (Laughter) So, here's one of my robots,
this is a simple walking robot, but it is by no means smart. And so, what we need to do is we need to change the definition
of what a robot is. How do we do that? Well, the first step, before we even start designing

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The development and spread of railroads across the United States brought a wave of changes to American life. During the railroad boom, thousands of jobs were created, new towns were born, trade increased, transportation was faster, and the overall landscape of the nation transformed. But, perhaps the most interesting change of all is the least known: the establishment of standard time. Today, we know if it is 6:28 a.m. in Los Angeles, it is 9:28 a.m. in New York, 2:28 p.m. in London, 5:28 p.m. in Moscow, and 10:28 p.m in Tokyo. No matter where you are, the minute and second are the exact same. But, before the railroads, there was no need for a national or global clock, and each town kept its own local time. So when it was 12 noon in Chicago, it was 12:07 p.m. in Indianapolis, 11:50 a.m. in St. Louis, and 11:27 a.m. in Omaha. This worked just fine when the only modes of travel were horses or steamboats, but it became incredibly problematic when railroads came along. How can you keep a train schedule when each town has its own time? And how do you prevent collisions or accidents on the tracks if train conductors are using different clocks? It doesn't really make sense to leave a station at 12:14 p.m., travel for 22 minutes, and arrive at 12:31 p.m. In order to eliminate that confusion, the railroads of the United States and Canada instituted standard time zones on November 18, 1883 at noon. It allowed the railroad companies to operate more effectively and reduce deadly accidents. The American public, however, was not so quick to embrace this new change, as many cities continued to use their own local time. Resistance was so strong that, in some towns, clocks would show both the local time and the railway time. Imagine this conversation: "Pardon me, sir. Do you have the time?" "Why yes, which do you need? It's 12:13 local time and 12:16 railway time." Ultimately, the logic of keeping a standard time prevailed, and the United States government made time zones a matter of law with the Standard Time Act of March 19, 1918. Since then, there have been numerous changes to the time zones, but the concept of standard time has remained. But, the United States was actually not the first to develop standard time. The first company to implement the use of standard time was the Great Western Railway in 1840 in Britain, and by 1847, most British railways were using Greenwich Mean Time, or G.M.T. The British government made it official on August 2, 1880 with the Statutes, or Definition of Time, Act. But, while Britain may have been the first to establish standard time, it is Asia and the islands of the South Pacific that enjoyed the first hour of each new day. The International Date Line passes through the Pacific Ocean on the opposite side of the Earth from the Prime Meridian in Greenwich where, thanks to trains, standard time was first used. Trains have evolved over the years and remain a prominent form of transportation and trade throughout the world. And, from the New York City subways to the freight trains traveling across the Great Plains, to the trolleys in San Francisco, they all know exactly what time it is. And, thanks to them, we do too!

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The development and spread of railroads across the United States brought a wave of changes to American life. During the railroad boom, thousands of jobs were created, new towns were born, trade increased, transportation was faster, and the overall landscape of the nation transformed. But, perhaps the most interesting change of all is the least known: the establishment of standard time. Today, we know if it is 6:28 a.m. in Los Angeles, it is 9:28 a.m. in New York, 2:28 p.m. in London, 5:28 p.m. in Moscow, and 10:28 p.m in Tokyo. No matter where you are, the minute and second are the exact same. But, before the railroads, there was no need for a national or global clock, and each town kept its own local time. So when it was 12 noon in Chicago, it was 12:07 p.m. in Indianapolis, 11:50 a.m. in St. Louis, and 11:27 a.m. in Omaha. This worked just fine when the only modes of travel were horses or steamboats, but it became incredibly problematic when railroads came along. How can you keep a train schedule when each town has its own time? And how do you prevent collisions or accidents on the tracks if train conductors are using different clocks? It doesn't really make sense to leave a station at 12:14 p.m., travel for 22 minutes, and arrive at 12:31 p.m. In order to eliminate that confusion, the railroads of the United States and Canada instituted standard time zones on November 18, 1883 at noon. It allowed the railroad companies to operate more effectively and reduce deadly accidents. The American public, however, was not so quick to embrace this new change, as many cities continued to use their own local time. Resistance was so strong that, in some towns, clocks would show both the local time and the railway time. Imagine this conversation: "Pardon me, sir. Do you have the time?" "Why yes, which do you need? It's 12:13 local time and 12:16 railway time." Ultimately, the logic of keeping a standard time prevailed, and the United States government made time zones a matter of law with the Standard Time Act of March 19, 1918. Since then, there have been numerous changes to the time zones, but the concept of standard time has remained. But, the United States was actually not the first to develop standard time. The first company to implement the use of standard time was the Great Western Railway in 1840 in Britain, and by 1847, most British railways were using Greenwich Mean Time, or G.M.T. The British government made it official on August 2, 1880 with the Statutes, or Definition of Time, Act. But, while Britain may have been the first to establish standard time, it is Asia and the islands of the South Pacific that enjoyed the first hour of each new day. The International Date Line passes through the Pacific Ocean on the opposite side of the Earth from the Prime Meridian in Greenwich where, thanks to trains, standard time was first used. Trains have evolved over the years and remain a prominent form of transportation and trade throughout the world. And, from the New York City subways to the freight trains traveling across the Great Plains, to the trolleys in San Francisco, they all know exactly what time it is. And, thanks to them, we do too!

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar How come some insects are able to walk on the surface of a pond, but you quickly sink to the bottom when you try to walk on water?

Water is a simple molecule made up of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms, but it is essential to life. In fact, water makes up approximately 60% of the adult human being's body weight. The polarity within those water molecules gives this common substance the properties that make it unique and life-sustaining. Polarity refers to the unequal sharing of electrons within a molecule. For water, the bonding between the oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms within a single water molecule is like a tug-of-war between a big, strong football player and a cute little toddler. Oxygen is a larger atom, with more protons in its nucleus than hydrogen. These positive charges are like a person's physical strength. They're able to attract the negatively charged electrons in the bond, just like a strong individual is able to overpower a weaker individual in a tug of war. So, oxygen is able to attract more than its fair share of electrons. Because hydrogen is smaller and has less strength, or fewer protons, it loses the tug of war and attracts fewer than its fair share of electrons. So, the oxygen in water behaves as though it's negative, and the hydrogens behave as though they're positive. The bonds within a single water molecule are called polar covalent bonds. Covalent means that the electrons are shared. But, as we just learned, polar means that these electrons are not shared equally. In water, the oxygen acts negative and the hydrogens act positive. Since negative and positive attract, that oxygen is attracted to the hydrogen atoms in neighboring water molecules. A special type of bond forms between water molecules, known as a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds don't just happen in water either. They can form between a water molecule and different substances that are polar or ionic. Water's ability to stick to itself is called cohesion, while water's ability to stick to other substances is called adhesion. Now, think back to the initial questions. First, why are some insects able to walk on water? Surface tension due to hydrogen bonding creates a thin film on the surface of water that gives enough resistance for super-light insects to walk on. You can't walk on it because the hydrogen bonds aren't strong enough to hold you up. Why does ice float on top of liquid water? For most other substances, the solid state is more dense than the liquid state, but that is not the case for water! Hydrogen bonds keep water molecules farther apart in frozen water than in liquid water. The farther apart the molecules are, the less dense that solid is. So ice is about 9% less dense than water, which means it floats on the top. That's why lakes freeze from the top down and aquatic life is able to survive through a cold winter every year. It is the polarity of the water molecule and the resulting hydrogen bonding that account for water's unique properties. So, the reason that water is so special, from inside your cells to the world's oceans, is simply because it is a polar molecule.

**Transcript**:
[Music] I want to talk to you today a little bit about the predictable irrationality and my interest in irrational behavior is started many years ago in hospital and I was burned very badly and if you spend a lot of time in hospital you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities and the one that particularly bothered me in the burned apartment was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me now you must have all taken a band-aid off at some point and you must have wondered what's the right approach do you rip it off quickly short duration but high intensity or do you take your bandage off slowly you take a long time but each second is not as painful which one of those is the right approach the nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one so they would grab hold and they would rip and they would grab hold and they would rip because I had 70% of my body burned it would take about an hour and as you can imagine I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity and I would try to reason with them and say why don't we try something else why don't we take it a little longer maybe two hours instead of an hour and have less of this intensity and the nurse just told me two things and they told me that they had the right model of the patient that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean to make suggestions or interfere or this is not just in Hebrew by the ways in every language I've had experience with so far and you know there's not much there wasn't much I could do and they kept on doing what what they were doing and about three years later when I left the hospital I started studying at the University and once the most interesting lessons I learned lessons it was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you cannot get create a replica of this question in some abstract way and you can try to examine this question maybe learn something about the world so that's what I I was still interested this question of how do you take bandages of burn patient so originally I didn't have much money so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vise and I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it and I would crunch it a little bit and I would crunch it for long periods and short periods that painted went up and when it went down and with breaks and without breaks all kinds of versions of pain and when I finished hurting people a little bit I would ask them so how painful was this oh how painful was this so if you had to choose between the last two which one would you choose I kept on doing this for a while and then like all good academic projects I got more funding I moved to sounds electrical shocks I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain but at the end of this process what I learned was that the nurses were wrong here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time it turns out that because we don't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower it turns out it would have been better to start with my face which was much more painful and moved toward my legs giving me a trend of improvement over time that would have been also less painful it also turns out would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain all of these would have been great things to do and my nurses had no idea and from that point on I started thinking are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision or is it more general case and it turns out it's a more general case there's a lot of mistakes we do and I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities and I want to talk to you about cheating and the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting but also it tells us something I think about the stock market situation we're in so my interest in cheating started when Enron came on the scene exploded all of a sudden started thinking about what is happening here is it the case that there is got a few apples who are capable of doing these things or are we talking about endemic situation that many people are actually capable of behaving this way so like we usually do I decide to do a simple experiment and here's how it went if you were in the experiment I would pass you a sheet of paper with twenty simple math problems that everybody could solve but I wouldn't give you enough time when the five minutes were over I would say pass me the sheets of paper and I'll pay you $1 per question people did this I would pay people four dollars for their task on average people would solve four problems other people I would tempt to cheat I would pass the sheet of paper when the five minutes are over I would say please shred the piece of paper put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack and tell me how many questions you got correctly people now solve seven questions on average now it wasn't as if there's a few bad apples a few people who did a lot instead what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit now in the economic theory cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis you say what's the probability of being caught how much do I stand to gain from cheating and how much punishment would I get if I get caught and you weigh these options are to do the simple cost-benefit analysis then you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not so we try to test this for some people we varied how much money they could get away with how much money they could steal we paid them ten cents per correct question 50 Cent's $1 $5 $10 per correct question you would expect it as the amount of money on the on the table increases people would cheat more but in fact it wasn't the case we got a lot of people cheating by still by a little bit what about the probability of being caught some people shredded half the sheet of paper so there was some evidence left some people shredded the whole sheet of paper some people shredded everything went out of the room and paid themselves on the ball of money that had over a hundred dollars you would expect it as the probability of being caught goes down people would cheat more but again this was not the case again a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit and they were uncensored to these economic consent so we said if people are not sensitive to the economic rationale theory explanations to these forces what could be going on and we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces at one hand we all want to look at yourself in the mirror and feel good about ourselves so we don't want to cheat and the other hand we could cheat a little bit and still feel good about ourselves so maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves we call this like a personal fudge factor now how would you test a personal fudge factor initially we said what can we do to shrink the fudge factor so we got people to the lab and we said we have two tasks for you today first we asked half the people to recall other ten books to read in high school or to recall the Ten Commandments and then we tempted them with cheating turns out the people who try to recall the Ten Commandments and in our sample nobody could recall the Ten Commandment but those people who tried to recall the Ten Commandments given the opportunity to cheat did not cheat at all it wasn't that the more religious people the people who remembered more of the commandment cheated less and the less religious people the people who could remember almost any commandment you did more the moment people thought about trying to recall the Ten Commandments they stopped cheating in fact even when we give self-declared atheists the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat they don't cheat at all now Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system so we said why don't we get people to sign the honor code so we got people to sign I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT honor code then this shredded it no cheating whatsoever and this is particularly interesting because MIT doesn't have an honor code so all this was about decreasing the fudge factor what about increasing the fudge factor the first experiment I walked around MIT and I distributed six packs of cokes in their refrigerators these were common refrigerators for the undergrads and I came back to measure what we technically called the half lifetime of coke how long does it last in the refrigerators and you can expect it doesn't last very long people take it in contrast I took a plate with six $1 bills and I left those plates in the same refrigerators no bill was ever disappeared now this is not a good social science experiment so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before a third of the people we pass the sheet they gave it back to us a third of the people we passed it they shredded it they came to us and said mr. experimenter I solved X problems give me X dollars a third of the people when they finish reading the piece of paper they came to us and said mr. experimenter I solved X problems give me X tokens we did not pay them with dollars we pay them with something else and then they took this something else they walked 12 feet to the side and exchanged it for dollars think about the following intuition how bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home compared to how bad would you feel about taking ten cents from a petty cash box these things feel very differently with being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference our subjects double their cheating I'll tell you what I think about this in stock market in a minute but this did not solve the big problem I had with anyone yet because in any one is also a social element people see each other behaving in fact every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating what does this causes us so we did another experiment we got the big group of students to be in the experiment and we prepaid them so everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment and we told them at the end we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make okay the same thing happens when we give people the opportunity to cheat they cheat that you just buy a little bit all the same but in this experiment we also higher than acting's to this acting student stood up after 30 seconds and said I solved everything what do I do now and the experimenter said if you finished everything go home that's it the task is finished so now we had a student an acting student that was a part of the group nobody knew there was though it was an actor and they clearly cheated in a very very serious way what would happen to the other people in the group will they cheat more or will they cheat less here is what happens it turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirts they are wearing here is the thing we ran this at a Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh and the Carnegie at Pittsburgh that two big universities Carnegie Mellon University of Pittsburgh all of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students when the actor was getting up was the Carnegie Mellon student pretty it was actually a con email student but he was a part of their group cheating went up but when he actually had the University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt cheating went down now this is important because remember when the moment the student stood up it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating because the experimenter said you finished everything go home and they worked with the money so it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again it was about the norms for cheating somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating we feel it's more appropriate as a group to behave this way but if it's somebody from another group these terrible people I mean not terrible in this but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with from another university another group office and people awareness of honesty goes up a little bit like the Ten Commandment experiment and people cheat even even less so what what have we learned from this about cheating we've learned that a lot of people can cheat they cheat just by a little bit when we remind people about the morality they cheat less when we get bigger distance from cheating from the object of money for example people cheat more and when we see things of cheating around us particularly if it's a part of our in-group cheating goes up now if we think about this in terms of the stock market think about what happens what happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way would they not be able to see it this way of course they would what happens when you do other things like you remove things from money you call them stock or stock option derivatives mortgage-backed securities could it be that with those more distant things it's not a token for one second it's something that these many steps removes for money for much longer time could it be but people would cheat even more and what happened to the social environment when people see other people behave around them I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market more generally I want to tell you something about behavioral economics we have many intuitions in our life and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong the question is are we going to test those intuitions we can think about how we're going to test this intuition in our private life in our business life and most particularly when it goes to policy when we think about things like No Child Left Behind when you create new stock markets when you create other policies taxation health care and so on and the difficulty of testing on intuition was was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them so I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages and I learned two interesting things one was that my favorite nurse Ettie told me that I did not take her pain into consideration she said of course you know it was very painful for you but think about me as a nurse taking removing the bandages of somebody I liked and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time creating so much torture was not something that was good for me - and she said maybe part of the reason what it was it was difficult for her which was actually more interesting than that because she said I did not think that your intuition was right I thought my intuition was correct so if you think about all of your intuitions think about it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong she said given the fact that I thought my intuition was right she thought her intuition was right it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong but the fact this is the situation we're all brawling all the time we have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things our own ability how the economy work how we should pay schoolteachers but unless we start testing those intuitions we're not going to do better and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition and how everything would have been better we would just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions thank you very much [Applause] what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's build a smarter planet

**Transcript**:
[Music] I want to talk to you today a little bit about the predictable irrationality and my interest in irrational behavior is started many years ago in hospital and I was burned very badly and if you spend a lot of time in hospital you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities and the one that particularly bothered me in the burned apartment was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me now you must have all taken a band-aid off at some point and you must have wondered what's the right approach do you rip it off quickly short duration but high intensity or do you take your bandage off slowly you take a long time but each second is not as painful which one of those is the right approach the nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one so they would grab hold and they would rip and they would grab hold and they would rip because I had 70% of my body burned it would take about an hour and as you can imagine I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity and I would try to reason with them and say why don't we try something else why don't we take it a little longer maybe two hours instead of an hour and have less of this intensity and the nurse just told me two things and they told me that they had the right model of the patient that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean to make suggestions or interfere or this is not just in Hebrew by the ways in every language I've had experience with so far and you know there's not much there wasn't much I could do and they kept on doing what what they were doing and about three years later when I left the hospital I started studying at the University and once the most interesting lessons I learned lessons it was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you cannot get create a replica of this question in some abstract way and you can try to examine this question maybe learn something about the world so that's what I I was still interested this question of how do you take bandages of burn patient so originally I didn't have much money so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vise and I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it and I would crunch it a little bit and I would crunch it for long periods and short periods that painted went up and when it went down and with breaks and without breaks all kinds of versions of pain and when I finished hurting people a little bit I would ask them so how painful was this oh how painful was this so if you had to choose between the last two which one would you choose I kept on doing this for a while and then like all good academic projects I got more funding I moved to sounds electrical shocks I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain but at the end of this process what I learned was that the nurses were wrong here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time it turns out that because we don't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower it turns out it would have been better to start with my face which was much more painful and moved toward my legs giving me a trend of improvement over time that would have been also less painful it also turns out would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain all of these would have been great things to do and my nurses had no idea and from that point on I started thinking are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision or is it more general case and it turns out it's a more general case there's a lot of mistakes we do and I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities and I want to talk to you about cheating and the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting but also it tells us something I think about the stock market situation we're in so my interest in cheating started when Enron came on the scene exploded all of a sudden started thinking about what is happening here is it the case that there is got a few apples who are capable of doing these things or are we talking about endemic situation that many people are actually capable of behaving this way so like we usually do I decide to do a simple experiment and here's how it went if you were in the experiment I would pass you a sheet of paper with twenty simple math problems that everybody could solve but I wouldn't give you enough time when the five minutes were over I would say pass me the sheets of paper and I'll pay you $1 per question people did this I would pay people four dollars for their task on average people would solve four problems other people I would tempt to cheat I would pass the sheet of paper when the five minutes are over I would say please shred the piece of paper put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack and tell me how many questions you got correctly people now solve seven questions on average now it wasn't as if there's a few bad apples a few people who did a lot instead what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit now in the economic theory cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis you say what's the probability of being caught how much do I stand to gain from cheating and how much punishment would I get if I get caught and you weigh these options are to do the simple cost-benefit analysis then you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not so we try to test this for some people we varied how much money they could get away with how much money they could steal we paid them ten cents per correct question 50 Cent's $1 $5 $10 per correct question you would expect it as the amount of money on the on the table increases people would cheat more but in fact it wasn't the case we got a lot of people cheating by still by a little bit what about the probability of being caught some people shredded half the sheet of paper so there was some evidence left some people shredded the whole sheet of paper some people shredded everything went out of the room and paid themselves on the ball of money that had over a hundred dollars you would expect it as the probability of being caught goes down people would cheat more but again this was not the case again a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit and they were uncensored to these economic consent so we said if people are not sensitive to the economic rationale theory explanations to these forces what could be going on and we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces at one hand we all want to look at yourself in the mirror and feel good about ourselves so we don't want to cheat and the other hand we could cheat a little bit and still feel good about ourselves so maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves we call this like a personal fudge factor now how would you test a personal fudge factor initially we said what can we do to shrink the fudge factor so we got people to the lab and we said we have two tasks for you today first we asked half the people to recall other ten books to read in high school or to recall the Ten Commandments and then we tempted them with cheating turns out the people who try to recall the Ten Commandments and in our sample nobody could recall the Ten Commandment but those people who tried to recall the Ten Commandments given the opportunity to cheat did not cheat at all it wasn't that the more religious people the people who remembered more of the commandment cheated less and the less religious people the people who could remember almost any commandment you did more the moment people thought about trying to recall the Ten Commandments they stopped cheating in fact even when we give self-declared atheists the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat they don't cheat at all now Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system so we said why don't we get people to sign the honor code so we got people to sign I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT honor code then this shredded it no cheating whatsoever and this is particularly interesting because MIT doesn't have an honor code so all this was about decreasing the fudge factor what about increasing the fudge factor the first experiment I walked around MIT and I distributed six packs of cokes in their refrigerators these were common refrigerators for the undergrads and I came back to measure what we technically called the half lifetime of coke how long does it last in the refrigerators and you can expect it doesn't last very long people take it in contrast I took a plate with six $1 bills and I left those plates in the same refrigerators no bill was ever disappeared now this is not a good social science experiment so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before a third of the people we pass the sheet they gave it back to us a third of the people we passed it they shredded it they came to us and said mr. experimenter I solved X problems give me X dollars a third of the people when they finish reading the piece of paper they came to us and said mr. experimenter I solved X problems give me X tokens we did not pay them with dollars we pay them with something else and then they took this something else they walked 12 feet to the side and exchanged it for dollars think about the following intuition how bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home compared to how bad would you feel about taking ten cents from a petty cash box these things feel very differently with being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference our subjects double their cheating I'll tell you what I think about this in stock market in a minute but this did not solve the big problem I had with anyone yet because in any one is also a social element people see each other behaving in fact every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating what does this causes us so we did another experiment we got the big group of students to be in the experiment and we prepaid them so everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment and we told them at the end we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make okay the same thing happens when we give people the opportunity to cheat they cheat that you just buy a little bit all the same but in this experiment we also higher than acting's to this acting student stood up after 30 seconds and said I solved everything what do I do now and the experimenter said if you finished everything go home that's it the task is finished so now we had a student an acting student that was a part of the group nobody knew there was though it was an actor and they clearly cheated in a very very serious way what would happen to the other people in the group will they cheat more or will they cheat less here is what happens it turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirts they are wearing here is the thing we ran this at a Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh and the Carnegie at Pittsburgh that two big universities Carnegie Mellon University of Pittsburgh all of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students when the actor was getting up was the Carnegie Mellon student pretty it was actually a con email student but he was a part of their group cheating went up but when he actually had the University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt cheating went down now this is important because remember when the moment the student stood up it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating because the experimenter said you finished everything go home and they worked with the money so it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again it was about the norms for cheating somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating we feel it's more appropriate as a group to behave this way but if it's somebody from another group these terrible people I mean not terrible in this but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with from another university another group office and people awareness of honesty goes up a little bit like the Ten Commandment experiment and people cheat even even less so what what have we learned from this about cheating we've learned that a lot of people can cheat they cheat just by a little bit when we remind people about the morality they cheat less when we get bigger distance from cheating from the object of money for example people cheat more and when we see things of cheating around us particularly if it's a part of our in-group cheating goes up now if we think about this in terms of the stock market think about what happens what happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way would they not be able to see it this way of course they would what happens when you do other things like you remove things from money you call them stock or stock option derivatives mortgage-backed securities could it be that with those more distant things it's not a token for one second it's something that these many steps removes for money for much longer time could it be but people would cheat even more and what happened to the social environment when people see other people behave around them I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market more generally I want to tell you something about behavioral economics we have many intuitions in our life and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong the question is are we going to test those intuitions we can think about how we're going to test this intuition in our private life in our business life and most particularly when it goes to policy when we think about things like No Child Left Behind when you create new stock markets when you create other policies taxation health care and so on and the difficulty of testing on intuition was was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them so I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages and I learned two interesting things one was that my favorite nurse Ettie told me that I did not take her pain into consideration she said of course you know it was very painful for you but think about me as a nurse taking removing the bandages of somebody I liked and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time creating so much torture was not something that was good for me - and she said maybe part of the reason what it was it was difficult for her which was actually more interesting than that because she said I did not think that your intuition was right I thought my intuition was correct so if you think about all of your intuitions think about it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong she said given the fact that I thought my intuition was right she thought her intuition was right it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong but the fact this is the situation we're all brawling all the time we have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things our own ability how the economy work how we should pay schoolteachers but unless we start testing those intuitions we're not going to do better and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition and how everything would have been better we would just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions thank you very much [Applause] what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's build a smarter planet

business life and most particularly when it goes to policy when we think about things like No Child Left Behind when you create new stock markets when you create other policies taxation health care and so on and the difficulty of testing on intuition was was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them so I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages and I learned two interesting things one was that my favorite nurse Ettie told me that I did not take her pain into consideration she said of course you know it was very painful for you but think about me as a nurse taking removing the bandages of somebody I liked and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time creating so much torture was not something that was good for me - and she said maybe part of the reason what it was it was difficult for her which was actually more interesting than that because she said I did not think that your intuition was right I thought my intuition was correct so if you think about all of your intuitions think about it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong she said given the fact that I thought my intuition was right she thought her intuition was right it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong but the fact this is the situation we're all brawling all the time we have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things our own ability how the economy work how we should pay schoolteachers but unless we start testing those intuitions we're not going to do better and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition and how everything would have been better we would just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions thank you very much [Applause] what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's build a smarter planet

**Transcript**:
[Music] I want to talk to you today a little bit about the predictable irrationality and my interest in irrational behavior is started many years ago in hospital and I was burned very badly and if you spend a lot of time in hospital you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities and the one that particularly bothered me in the burned apartment was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me now you must have all taken a band-aid off at some point and you must have wondered what's the right approach do you rip it off quickly short duration but high intensity or do you take your bandage off slowly you take a long time but each second is not as painful which one of those is the right approach the nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one so they would grab hold and they would rip and they would grab hold and they would rip because I had 70% of my body burned it would take about an hour and as you can imagine I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity and I would try to reason with them and say why don't we try something else why don't we take it a little longer maybe two hours instead of an hour and have less of this intensity and the nurse just told me two things and they told me that they had the right model of the patient that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean to make suggestions or interfere or this is not just in Hebrew by the ways in every language I've had experience with so far and you know there's not much there wasn't much I could do and they kept on doing what what they were doing and about three years later when I left the hospital I started studying at the University and once the most interesting lessons I learned lessons it was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you cannot get create a replica of this question in some abstract way and you can try to examine this question maybe learn something about the world so that's what I I was still interested this question of how do you take bandages of burn patient so originally I didn't have much money so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vise and I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it and I would crunch it a little bit and I would crunch it for long periods and short periods that painted went up and when it went down and with breaks and without breaks all kinds of versions of pain and when I finished hurting people a little bit I would ask them so how painful was this oh how painful was this so if you had to choose between the last two which one would you choose I kept on doing this for a while and then like all good academic projects I got more funding I moved to sounds electrical shocks I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain but at the end of this process what I learned was that the nurses were wrong here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time it turns out that because we don't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower it turns out it would have been better to start with my face which was much more painful and moved toward my legs giving me a trend of improvement over time that would have been also less painful it also turns out would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain all of these would have been great things to do and my nurses had no idea and from that point on I started thinking are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision or is it more general case and it turns out it's a more general case there's a lot of mistakes we do and I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities and I want to talk to you about cheating and the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting but also it tells us something I think about the stock market situation we're in so my interest in cheating started when Enron came on the scene exploded all of a sudden started thinking about what is happening here is it the case that there is got a few apples who are capable of doing these things or are we talking about endemic situation that many people are actually capable of behaving this way so like we usually do I decide to do a simple experiment and here's how it went if you were in the experiment I would pass you a sheet of paper with twenty simple math problems that everybody could solve but I wouldn't give you enough time when the five minutes were over I would say pass me the sheets of paper and I'll pay you $1 per question people did this I would pay people four dollars for their task on average people would solve four problems other people I would tempt to cheat I would pass the sheet of paper when the five minutes are over I would say please shred the piece of paper put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack and tell me how many questions you got correctly people now solve seven questions on average now it wasn't as if there's a few bad apples a few people who did a lot instead what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit now in the economic theory cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis you say what's the probability of being caught how much do I stand to gain from cheating and how much punishment would I get if I get caught and you weigh these options are to do the simple cost-benefit analysis then you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not so we try to test this for some people we varied how much money they could get away with how much money they could steal we paid them ten cents per correct question 50 Cent's $1 $5 $10 per correct question you would expect it as the amount of money on the on the table increases people would cheat more but in fact it wasn't the case we got a lot of people cheating by still by a little bit what about the probability of being caught some people shredded half the sheet of paper so there was some evidence left some people shredded the whole sheet of paper some people shredded everything went out of the room and paid themselves on the ball of money that had over a hundred dollars you would expect it as the probability of being caught goes down people would cheat more but again this was not the case again a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit and they were uncensored to these economic consent so we said if people are not sensitive to the economic rationale theory explanations to these forces what could be going on and we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces at one hand we all want to look at yourself in the mirror and feel good about ourselves so we don't want to cheat and the other hand we could cheat a little bit and still feel good about ourselves so maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves we call this like a personal fudge factor now how would you test a personal fudge factor initially we said what can we do to shrink the fudge factor so we got people to the lab and we said we have two tasks for you today first we asked half the people to recall other ten books to read in high school or to recall the Ten Commandments and then we tempted them with cheating turns out the people who try to recall the Ten Commandments and in our sample nobody could recall the Ten Commandment but those people who tried to recall the Ten Commandments given the opportunity to cheat did not cheat at all it wasn't that the more religious people the people who remembered more of the commandment cheated less and the less religious people the people who could remember almost any commandment you did more the moment people thought about trying to recall the Ten Commandments they stopped cheating in fact even when we give self-declared atheists the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat they don't cheat at all now Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system so we said why don't we get people to sign the honor code so we got people to sign I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT honor code then this shredded it no cheating whatsoever and this is particularly interesting because MIT doesn't have an honor code so all this was about decreasing the fudge factor what about increasing the fudge factor the first experiment I walked around MIT and I distributed six packs of cokes in their refrigerators these were common refrigerators for the undergrads and I came back to measure what we technically called the half lifetime of coke how long does it last in the refrigerators and you can expect it doesn't last very long people take it in contrast I took a plate with six $1 bills and I left those plates in the same refrigerators no bill was ever disappeared now this is not a good social science experiment so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before a third of the people we pass the sheet they gave it back to us a third of the people we passed it they shredded it they came to us and said mr. experimenter I solved X problems give me X dollars a third of the people when they finish reading the piece of paper they came to us and said mr. experimenter I solved X problems give me X tokens we did not pay them with dollars we pay them with something else and then they took this something else they walked 12 feet to the side and exchanged it for dollars think about the following intuition how bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home compared to how bad would you feel about taking ten cents from a petty cash box these things feel very differently with being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference our subjects double their cheating I'll tell you what I think about this in stock market in a minute but this did not solve the big problem I had with anyone yet because in any one is also a social element people see each other behaving in fact every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating what does this causes us so we did another experiment we got the big group of students to be in the experiment and we prepaid them so everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment and we told them at the end we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make okay the same thing happens when we give people the opportunity to cheat they cheat that you just buy a little bit all the same but in this experiment we also higher than acting's to this acting student stood up after 30 seconds and said I solved everything what do I do now and the experimenter said if you finished everything go home that's it the task is finished so now we had a student an acting student that was a part of the group nobody knew there was though it was an actor and they clearly cheated in a very very serious way what would happen to the other people in the group will they cheat more or will they cheat less here is what happens it turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirts they are wearing here is the thing we ran this at a Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh and the Carnegie at Pittsburgh that two big universities Carnegie Mellon University of Pittsburgh all of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students when the actor was getting up was the Carnegie Mellon student pretty it was actually a con email student but he was a part of their group cheating went up but when he actually had the University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt cheating went down now this is important because remember when the moment the student stood up it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating because the experimenter said you finished everything go home and they worked with the money so it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again it was about the norms for cheating somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating we feel it's more appropriate as a group to behave this way but if it's somebody from another group these terrible people I mean not terrible in this but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with from another university another group office and people awareness of honesty goes up a little bit like the Ten Commandment experiment and people cheat even even less so what what have we learned from this about cheating we've learned that a lot of people can cheat they cheat just by a little bit when we remind people about the morality they cheat less when we get bigger distance from cheating from the object of money for example people cheat more and when we see things of cheating around us particularly if it's a part of our in-group cheating goes up now if we think about this in terms of the stock market think about what happens what happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way would they not be able to see it this way of course they would what happens when you do other things like you remove things from money you call them stock or stock option derivatives mortgage-backed securities could it be that with those more distant things it's not a token for one second it's something that these many steps removes for money for much longer time could it be but people would cheat even more and what happened to the social environment when people see other people behave around them I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market more generally I want to tell you something about behavioral economics we have many intuitions in our life and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong the question is are we going to test those intuitions we can think about how we're going to test this intuition in our private life in our business life and most particularly when it goes to policy when we think about things like No Child Left Behind when you create new stock markets when you create other policies taxation health care

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] in his inaugural address Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis but what did he appeal to he did not happily follow in the footsteps of his predecessor and tell us to just go shopping nor did he tell us trust us trust your country invest invest invest instead what he told us was to put aside childish things and he appealed to virtue virtue is an old-fashioned word it seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one and besides some of you might be wondering what the hell does it mean let me begin with an example these are this is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen and all of the items on it are unremarkable they're the things you would expect mop the floors sweep them empty the trash restock the cabinets it may be a little surprising how many things there are but it's not surprising what they are but the one thing I want you to notice about them is this even though this is a very long list there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings not one the janitors job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital and yet when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like they encountered Mike who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise trying to build up his strength walking slowly up and down the hall and Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisors admonition didn't vacuum the visitors lounge because there were some family members who were there all day every day who at this moment happened to be taking a nap and then there was Luke who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice because the man's father who had been keeping a vigil for six months didn't see Luke do it the first time and his father was angry and behavior like this from janitors from technicians from nurses and if we're lucky every now and then from doctors doesn't just make people feel a little better it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well now not all janitors are like this of course but the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness care and empathy are an essential part of the job and yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings these janitors have the moral will to do right by other people and beyond this they have the moral skill to figure out what doing right means practical wisdom Aristotle told us is the combination of moral will and moral skill a wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule as the janitors knew when to ignore their job duties in the service of other objectives a wise person knows how to improvise as Luke did when he rewashed the floor real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined and the context is always changing a wise person is like a jazz musician using the notes on the page but dancing around them inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand a wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims to serve other people not to manipulate other people and finally perhaps most important a wise person is made not born wisdom depends on experience and not just any experience you need the time to get to know the people that you're serving you need permission to be allowed to improvise to try new things occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures and you need to be mentored by wise teachers when you ask the janitors who behave like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their jobs they tell you that it takes lots of experience and they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans it takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people at Ted brilliance is rampant it's scary the good news is that you don't need to be brilliant to be wise the bad news is that without wisdom brilliance isn't enough it's as likely to get you into trouble and other people into trouble as anything else now I hope that we all know this there's a sense in which it's obvious and yet let me tell you a little story it's a story about lemonade a dad and his 11 year old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark his son asked him for some lemonade and dad went to the concession stand to buy it all they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade which was 5% alcohol dad being an academic had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade was it contained out at all so we brought it back and the kid was drinking it and a security guard spotted it and called the police who called an ambulance they rushed to the ballpark whisked the kid to the hospital the emergency room to ascertain that the kid had no alcohol in his blood and they were ready to let the kid go but not so fast the Wayne County Child Welfare protective agency said oh and the child was sent to a foster home for three days at that point can the child go home well a judge said yes but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel after two weeks I'm happy to report the family was reunited but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure how do things like this happen Scott Simon who told this story on NPR said rules and procedures may be dumb but they spare you from thinking and to be fair and to be fair rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lacks and they let a child go back to an abusive household fair enough when things go wrong as of course they do we reach for two tools to try to fix them one tool we reach for is rules better ones more of them the second tool we reach for is incentives better ones more of them what else after all is there we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis regulate regulate regulate fix the incentives fix the incentives fix the incentives the truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job how could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did and would you pay them a bonus for being empathic it's preposterous on its face and what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules rules and incentives may make things better in the short run but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run moral skill is chipped away by an over reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisation and moral will is on mind by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing and without intending it by appealing to rules and incentives we are engaging in a war on wisdom let me just give you a few example first of rules and the war on moral skill the lemonade story is one second no doubt more familiar to you is the nature of modern American education scripted lockstep curriculum here's an example from Chicago kindergarten reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with B the baths assemble students on a rug give students a warning about the dangers of hot water say 75 items in this script to teach a 25 page picture book all over Chicago and every kindergarten class in the city every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day we know why these scripts are there we don't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster and they prevent disaster but what they assure in its place is mediocrity don't get me wrong we need rules jazz musicians need some notes most of them need some notes on the page we need more rules for the bankers god knows but too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising and as a result they lose their gifts or worse they stop playing all together now how about incentives they seem clever if you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it right well not always sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complementing and they make people less likely to do it I'll just give you one example because time is racing in Switzerland back in about 15 years ago they were trying to decide where to cite nuclear waste dumps there was going to be a national referendum and some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed and they said would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community astonishingly 50% of the citizens said yes they knew it or thought it was dangerous they thought it would reduce their property values but it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens the psychologists asked other people a slightly different question they said if we paid you six weeks salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community two reasons it's my responsibility and I'm getting paid instead of 50% saying yes 25% said yes what happens is that the second this introduction of the incentive gets us so that instead of asking what are my responsibilities all we ask is what serves my interests when incentives don't work when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses the response is always the same get smarter incentives the truth is that there are no incentives you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough any incentive system can be subverted by bad will we need incentives people have to make a living but excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word it causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality Barack Obama said before he was inaugurated we must ask not just as it profitable but is it right and when professions are demoralized everyone in them becomes dependent on addicted to incentives and they stop asking is it right we see this in medicine and we certainly see it in the world of business it is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work so what can we do a few sources of hope we ought to try to Reem oral eyes work one way not to do it teach more ethics courses there is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course what to do instead one celebrate moral exemplars acknowledge when you go to law school that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch no ten-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions people are inspired by moral heroes but we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes well acknowledge them be proud that you have them celebrate them and demand that the people who teach you acknowledge and celebrate them too that's one thing we can do I don't know how many of you remember this another moral hero 15 years ago Aaron Feuerstein who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts they made Polartec the factory burned down 3,000 employees he kept every one of them on the payroll why because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go maybe on paper our company's worthless to Wall Street but I can tell you it's worth more we are doing fine just that this Ted we heard talks from several moral heroes to particularly inspiring to me one was Ray Anderson who turned you know turned you know a part of the evil empire into a zero footprint or almost a zero footprint business why because it was the right thing to do and a bonus he's discovering is he's actually gonna make even more money his employees are inspired by the effort why because they're happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do yesterday we heard willie smith's talk about reforesting in indonesia and in many ways this is the perfect example because it took the will to do the right thing and god knows it took a huge amount of technical skill I bottle that how much he needed to know in order and his associates in order to plot this out but most important to make it work and he emphasized this is that it took knowing the people in the communities unless the people you're working with our support are behind you this will fail and there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways so there's a lot here at Ed and at other places to celebrate and you don't have to be a mega hero there are ordinary heroes ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too as practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary if not extraordinary heroes as heads of organizations we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work if you run an organization you should be sure that none of the jobs none of the jobs have job descriptions like the job description of the janitors because the truth is that any work you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom and perhaps most important as teachers we should strive to be the ordinary heroes the moral exemplars to the people we mentor and there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers one is that we are always teaching someone is always watching the camera is always on Bill Gates talked about the importance of education and in particular the model that Kipp was providing knowledge is power and he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that Kipp is doing to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college I want to focus on one particular thing Kipp is doing that bill didn't mention and that is they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character they need to learn to respect themselves they need to learn to respect their schoolmates they need to learn to respect their teachers and most important they need to learn to respect learning that's the principal objective if you do that the rest is just pretty much a Coast downhill and the teachers the way you teach these things to kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day Obama appealed to virtue and I think he was right and the virtue that we need above all others I think is practical wisdom because it's what allows other virtues honesty kindness courage and so on to be displayed at the right time and in the right way he also appealed to hope right again I think there is reason for hope I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous in many ways it's what Ted is all about wanting to do the right thing in the white right way for the right reasons this kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention paying attention to what we do to how we do it and perhaps most importantly to the structure of the organizations within which we work so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than rather than having it suppressed thank you very much thank you if you have to go east on that side thank you very much what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] in his inaugural address Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis but what did he appeal to he did not happily follow in the footsteps of his predecessor and tell us to just go shopping nor did he tell us trust us trust your country invest invest invest instead what he told us was to put aside childish things and he appealed to virtue virtue is an old-fashioned word it seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one and besides some of you might be wondering what the hell does it mean let me begin with an example these are this is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen and all of the items on it are unremarkable they're the things you would expect mop the floors sweep them empty the trash restock the cabinets it may be a little surprising how many things there are but it's not surprising what they are but the one thing I want you to notice about them is this even though this is a very long list there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings not one the janitors job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital and yet when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like they encountered Mike who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise trying to build up his strength walking slowly up and down the hall and Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisors admonition didn't vacuum the visitors lounge because there were some family members who were there all day every day who at this moment happened to be taking a nap and then there was Luke who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice because the man's father who had been keeping a vigil for six months didn't see Luke do it the first time and his father was angry and behavior like this from janitors from technicians from nurses and if we're lucky every now and then from doctors doesn't just make people feel a little better it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well now not all janitors are like this of course but the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness care and empathy are an essential part of the job and yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings these janitors have the moral will to do right by other people and beyond this they have the moral skill to figure out what doing right means practical wisdom Aristotle told us is the combination of moral will and moral skill a wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule as the janitors knew when to ignore their job duties in the service of other objectives a wise person knows how to improvise as Luke did when he rewashed the floor real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined and the context is always changing a wise person is like a jazz musician using the notes on the page but dancing around them inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand a wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims to serve other people not to manipulate other people and finally perhaps most important a wise person is made not born wisdom depends on experience and not just any experience you need the time to get to know the people that you're serving you need permission to be allowed to improvise to try new things occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures and you need to be mentored by wise teachers when you ask the janitors who behave like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their jobs they tell you that it takes lots of experience and they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans it takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people at Ted brilliance is rampant it's scary the good news is that you don't need to be brilliant to be wise the bad news is that without wisdom brilliance isn't enough it's as likely to get you into trouble and other people into trouble as anything else now I hope that we all know this there's a sense in which it's obvious and yet let me tell you a little story it's a story about lemonade a dad and his 11 year old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark his son asked him for some lemonade and dad went to the concession stand to buy it all they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade which was 5% alcohol dad being an academic had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade was it contained out at all so we brought it back and the kid was drinking it and a security guard spotted it and called the police who called an ambulance they rushed to the ballpark whisked the kid to the hospital the emergency room to ascertain that the kid had no alcohol in his blood and they were ready to let the kid go but not so fast the Wayne County Child Welfare protective agency said oh and the child was sent to a foster home for three days at that point can the child go home well a judge said yes but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel after two weeks I'm happy to report the family was reunited but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure how do things like this happen Scott Simon who told this story on NPR said rules and procedures may be dumb but they spare you from thinking and to be fair and to be fair rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lacks and they let a child go back to an abusive household fair enough when things go wrong as of course they do we reach for two tools to try to fix them one tool we reach for is rules better ones more of them the second tool we reach for is incentives better ones more of them what else after all is there we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis regulate regulate regulate fix the incentives fix the incentives fix the incentives the truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job how could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did and would you pay them a bonus for being empathic it's preposterous on its face and what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules rules and incentives may make things better in the short run but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run moral skill is chipped away by an over reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisation and moral will is on mind by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing and without intending it by appealing to rules and incentives we are engaging in a war on wisdom let me just give you a few example first of rules and the war on moral skill the lemonade story is one second no doubt more familiar to you is the nature of modern American education scripted lockstep curriculum here's an example from Chicago kindergarten reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with B the baths assemble students on a rug give students a warning about the dangers of hot water say 75 items in this script to teach a 25 page picture book all over Chicago and every kindergarten class in the city every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day we know why these scripts are there we don't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster and they prevent disaster but what they assure in its place is mediocrity don't get me wrong we need rules jazz musicians need some notes most of them need some notes on the page we need more rules for the bankers god knows but too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising and as a result they lose their gifts or worse they stop playing all together now how about incentives they seem clever if you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it right well not always sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complementing and they make people less likely to do it I'll just give you one example because time is racing in Switzerland back in about 15 years ago they were trying to decide where to cite nuclear waste dumps there was going to be a national referendum and some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed and they said would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community astonishingly 50% of the citizens said yes they knew it or thought it was dangerous they thought it would reduce their property values but it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens the psychologists asked other people a slightly different question they said if we paid you six weeks salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community two reasons it's my responsibility and I'm getting paid instead of 50% saying yes 25% said yes what happens is that the second this introduction of the incentive gets us so that instead of asking what are my responsibilities all we ask is what serves my interests when incentives don't work when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses the response is always the same get smarter incentives the truth is that there are no incentives you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough any incentive system can be subverted by bad will we need incentives people have to make a living but excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word it causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality Barack Obama said before he was inaugurated we must ask not just as it profitable but is it right and when professions are demoralized everyone in them becomes dependent on addicted to incentives and they stop asking is it right we see this in medicine and we certainly see it in the world of business it is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work so what can we do a few sources of hope we ought to try to Reem oral eyes work one way not to do it teach more ethics courses there is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course what to do instead one celebrate moral exemplars acknowledge when you go to law school that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch no ten-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions people are inspired by moral heroes but we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes well

so that instead of asking what are my responsibilities all we ask is what serves my interests when incentives don't work when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses the response is always the same get smarter incentives the truth is that there are no incentives you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough any incentive system can be subverted by bad will we need incentives people have to make a living but excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word it causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality Barack Obama said before he was inaugurated we must ask not just as it profitable but is it right and when professions are demoralized everyone in them becomes dependent on addicted to incentives and they stop asking is it right we see this in medicine and we certainly see it in the world of business it is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work so what can we do a few sources of hope we ought to try to Reem oral eyes work one way not to do it teach more ethics courses there is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course what to do instead one celebrate moral exemplars acknowledge when you go to law school that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch no ten-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions people are inspired by moral heroes but we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes well acknowledge them be proud that you have them celebrate them and demand that the people who teach you acknowledge and celebrate them too that's one thing we can do I don't know how many of you remember this another moral hero 15 years ago Aaron Feuerstein who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts they made Polartec the factory burned down 3,000 employees he kept every one of them on the payroll why because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go maybe on paper our company's worthless to Wall Street but I can tell you it's worth more we are doing fine just that this Ted we heard talks from several moral heroes to particularly inspiring to me one was Ray Anderson who turned you know turned you know a part of the evil empire into a zero footprint or almost a zero footprint business why because it was the right thing to do and a bonus he's discovering is he's actually gonna make even more money his employees are inspired by the effort why because they're happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do yesterday we heard willie smith's talk about reforesting in indonesia and in many ways this is the perfect example because it took the will to do the right thing and god knows it took a huge amount of technical skill I bottle that how much he needed to know in order and his associates in order to plot this out but most important to make it work and he emphasized this is that it took knowing the people in the communities unless the people you're working with our support are behind you this will fail and there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways so there's a lot here at Ed and at other places to celebrate and you don't have to be a mega hero there are ordinary heroes ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too as practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary if not extraordinary heroes as heads of organizations we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work if you run an organization you should be sure that none of the jobs none of the jobs have job descriptions like the job description of the janitors because the truth is that any work you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom and perhaps most important as teachers we should strive to be the ordinary heroes the moral exemplars to the people we mentor and there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers one is that we are always teaching someone is always watching the camera is always on Bill Gates talked about the importance of education and in particular the model that Kipp was providing knowledge is power and he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that Kipp is doing to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college I want to focus on one particular thing Kipp is doing that bill didn't mention and that is they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character they need to learn to respect themselves they need to learn to respect their schoolmates they need to learn to respect their teachers and most important they need to learn to respect learning that's the principal objective if you do that the rest is just pretty much a Coast downhill and the teachers the way you teach these things to kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day Obama appealed to virtue and I think he was right and the virtue that we need above all others I think is practical wisdom because it's what allows other virtues honesty kindness courage and so on to be displayed at the right time and in the right way he also appealed to hope right again I think there is reason for hope I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous in many ways it's what Ted is all about wanting to do the right thing in the white right way for the right reasons this kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention paying attention to what we do to how we do it and perhaps most importantly to the structure of the organizations within which we work so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than rather than having it suppressed thank you very much thank you if you have to go east on that side thank you very much what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] in his inaugural address Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis but what did he appeal to he did not happily follow in the footsteps of his predecessor and tell us to just go shopping nor did he tell us trust us trust your country invest invest invest instead what he told us was to put aside childish things and he appealed to virtue virtue is an old-fashioned word it seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one and besides some of you might be wondering what the hell does it mean let me begin with an example these are this is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen and all of the items on it are unremarkable they're the things you would expect mop the floors sweep them empty the trash restock the cabinets it may be a little surprising how many things there are but it's not surprising what they are but the one thing I want you to notice about them is this even though this is a very long list there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings not one the janitors job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital and yet when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like they encountered Mike who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise trying to build up his strength walking slowly up and down the hall and Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisors admonition didn't vacuum the visitors lounge because there were some family members who were there all day every day who at this moment happened to be taking a nap and then there was Luke who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice because the man's father who had been keeping a vigil for six months didn't see Luke do it the first time and his father was angry and behavior like this from janitors from technicians from nurses and if we're lucky every now and then from doctors doesn't just make people feel a little better it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well now not all janitors are like this of course but the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness care and empathy are an essential part of the job and yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings these janitors have the moral will to do right by other people and beyond this they have the moral skill to figure out what doing right means practical wisdom Aristotle told us is the combination of moral will and moral skill a wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule as the janitors knew when to ignore their job duties in the service of other objectives a wise person knows how to improvise as Luke did when he rewashed the floor real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined and the context is always changing a wise person is like a jazz musician using the notes on the page but dancing around them inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand a wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims to serve other people not to manipulate other people and finally perhaps most important a wise person is made not born wisdom depends on experience and not just any experience you need the time to get to know the people that you're serving you need permission to be allowed to improvise to try new things occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures and you need to be mentored by wise teachers when you ask the janitors who behave like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their jobs they tell you that it takes lots of experience and they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans it takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people at Ted brilliance is rampant it's scary the good news is that you don't need to be brilliant to be wise the bad news is that without wisdom brilliance isn't enough it's as likely to get you into trouble and other people into trouble as anything else now I hope that we all know this there's a sense in which it's obvious and yet let me tell you a little story it's a story about lemonade a dad and his 11 year old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark his son asked him for some lemonade and dad went to the concession stand to buy it all they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade which was 5% alcohol dad being an academic had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade was it contained out at all so we brought it back and the kid was drinking it and a security guard spotted it and called the police who called an ambulance they rushed to the ballpark whisked the kid to the hospital the emergency room to ascertain that the kid had no alcohol in his blood and they were ready to let the kid go but not so fast the Wayne County Child Welfare protective agency said oh and the child was sent to a foster home for three days at that point can the child go home well a judge said yes but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel after two weeks I'm happy to report the family was reunited but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure how do things like this happen Scott Simon who told this story on NPR said rules and procedures may be dumb but they spare you from thinking and to be fair and to be fair rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lacks and they let a child go back to an abusive household fair enough when things go wrong as of course they do we reach for two tools to try to fix them one tool we reach for is rules better ones more of them the second tool we reach for is incentives better ones more of them what else after all is there we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis regulate regulate regulate fix the incentives fix the incentives fix the incentives the truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job how could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did and would you pay them a bonus for being empathic it's preposterous on its face and what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules rules and incentives may make things better in the short run but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run moral skill is chipped away by an over reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisation and moral will is on mind by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing and without intending it by appealing to rules and incentives we are engaging in a war on wisdom let me just give you a few example first of rules and the war on moral skill the lemonade story is one second no doubt more familiar to you is the nature of modern American education scripted lockstep curriculum here's an example from Chicago kindergarten reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with B the baths assemble students on a rug give students a warning about the dangers of hot water say 75 items in this script to teach a 25 page picture book all over Chicago and every kindergarten class in the city every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day we know why these scripts are there we don't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster and they prevent disaster but what they assure in its place is mediocrity don't get me wrong we need rules jazz musicians need some notes most of them need some notes on the page we need more rules for the bankers god knows but too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising and as a result they lose their gifts or worse they stop playing all together now how about incentives they seem clever if you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it right well not always sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complementing and they make people less likely to do it I'll just give you one example because time is racing in Switzerland back in about 15 years ago they were trying to decide where to cite nuclear waste dumps there was going to be a national referendum and some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed and they said would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community astonishingly 50% of the citizens said yes they knew it or thought it was dangerous they thought it would reduce their property values but it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens the psychologists asked other people a slightly different question they said if we paid you six weeks salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community two reasons it's my responsibility and I'm getting paid instead of 50% saying yes 25% said yes what happens is that the second this introduction of the incentive gets us so that instead of asking what are my responsibilities all we ask is what serves my interests when incentives don't work when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses the response is always the same get smarter incentives the truth is that there are no incentives you can devise that are ever going to be smart

ethics courses there is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course what to do instead one celebrate moral exemplars acknowledge when you go to law school that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch no ten-year-old goes to law

and words that begin with B the baths assemble students on a rug give students a warning about the dangers of hot water say 75 items in this script to teach a 25 page picture book all over Chicago and every kindergarten class in the city every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day we know why these scripts are there we don't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster and they prevent disaster but what they assure in its place is mediocrity don't get me wrong we need rules jazz musicians need some notes most of them need some notes on the page we need more rules for the bankers god knows but too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising and as a result they lose their gifts or worse they stop playing all together now how about incentives they seem clever if you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it right well not always sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complementing and they make people less likely to do it I'll just give you one example because time is racing in Switzerland back in about 15 years ago they were trying to decide where to cite nuclear waste dumps there was going to be a national referendum and some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed and they said would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community astonishingly 50% of the citizens said yes they knew it or thought it was dangerous they thought it would reduce their property values but it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens the psychologists asked other people a slightly different question they said if we paid you six weeks salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community two reasons it's my responsibility and I'm getting paid instead of 50% saying yes 25% said yes what happens is that the second this introduction of the incentive gets us so that instead of asking what are my responsibilities all we ask is what serves my interests when incentives don't work when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses the response is always the same get smarter incentives the truth is that there are no incentives you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough any incentive system can be subverted by bad will we need incentives people have to make a living but excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word it causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality Barack Obama said before he was inaugurated we must ask not just as it profitable but is it right and when professions are demoralized everyone in them becomes dependent on addicted to incentives and they stop asking is it right we see this in medicine and we certainly see it in the world of business it is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work so what can we do a few sources of hope we ought to try to Reem oral eyes work one way not to do it teach more ethics courses there is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course what to do instead one celebrate moral exemplars acknowledge when you go to law school that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch no ten-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions people are inspired by moral heroes but we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes well acknowledge them be proud that you have them celebrate them and demand that the people who teach you acknowledge and celebrate them too that's one thing we can do I don't know how many of you remember this another moral hero 15 years ago Aaron Feuerstein who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts they made Polartec the factory burned down 3,000 employees he kept every one of them on the payroll why because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go maybe on paper our company's worthless to Wall Street but I can tell you it's worth more we are doing fine just that this Ted we heard talks from several moral heroes to particularly inspiring to me one was Ray Anderson who turned you know turned you know a part of the evil empire into a zero footprint or almost a zero footprint business why because it was the right thing to do and a bonus he's discovering is he's actually gonna make even more money his employees are inspired by the effort why because they're happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do yesterday we heard willie smith's talk about reforesting in indonesia and in many ways this is the perfect example because it took the will to do the right thing and god knows it took a huge amount of technical skill I bottle that how much he needed to know in order and his associates in order to plot this out but most important to make it work and he emphasized this is that it took knowing the people in the communities unless the people you're working with our support are behind you this will fail and there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways so there's a lot here at Ed and at other places to celebrate and you don't have to be a mega hero there are ordinary heroes ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too as practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary if not extraordinary heroes as heads of organizations we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work if you run an organization you should be sure that none of the jobs none of the jobs have job descriptions like the job description of the janitors because the truth is that any work you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom and perhaps most important as teachers we should strive to be the ordinary heroes the moral exemplars to the people we mentor and there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers one is that we are always teaching someone is always watching the camera is always on Bill Gates talked about the importance of education and in particular the model that Kipp was providing knowledge is power and he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that Kipp is doing to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college I want to focus on one particular thing Kipp is doing that bill didn't mention and that is they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character they need to learn to respect themselves they need to learn to respect their schoolmates they need to learn to respect their teachers and most important they need to learn to respect learning that's the principal objective if you do that the rest is just pretty much a Coast downhill and the teachers the way you teach these things to kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day Obama appealed to virtue and I think he was right and the virtue that we need above all others I think is practical wisdom because it's what allows other virtues honesty kindness courage and so on to be displayed at the right time and in the right way he also appealed to hope right again I think there is reason for hope I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous in many ways it's what Ted is all about wanting to do the right thing in the white right way for the right reasons this kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention paying attention to what we do to how we do it and perhaps most importantly to the structure of the organizations within which we work so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than rather than having it suppressed thank you very much thank you if you have to go east on that side thank you very much what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBMer let's build a smarter planet

**Transcript**:
[Music] so I want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood I love the science fiction movies here it is this island earth and leave it to Hollywood to get it just right two and a half years in the making I mean even the creationists give us 6,000 but Hollywood goes to the chase and in this movie we see what we think is out there flying saucers and aliens every world has an alien and every alien world has the flying saucer and they move about with great speed aliens well don brownlee my friend and i finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the TV and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night and tried to write a counter-argument to it and put out what does it really take for an earth to be habitable for a planet to be an earth to have a place where you could probably get not just life but complexity which requires a huge amount of evolution and therefore constancy of conditions so in 2000 rewrote rare earth in 2003 we then asked let's not think about where earths are in space but how long is Earth Ben Earth if you go back to billion years you're not on an earth-like planet anymore what we call an earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time well rare earth actually taught me off a lot about meeting the public right after I got an invitation go to a science fiction convention and with all great earnestness walked in David Brin was going to debate me on this and as I walked in the crowd of 100 started Bowie and lustily but a girl came up and said my dad says you're the devil you cannot take people's aliens away from them and expect to be anybody's friends well the second part of that soon after and I was talking to Paul Allen and I saw him in the audience I handed him a copy of rare earth and Jill tarter was there and she turned to me and she looked to me just like that girl in the Exorcist it was it burns it burns because Eddie doesn't want to hear this said he wants there to be stuff out there I really applaud the SETI efforts but we have not heard anything yet and I really do think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't now I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that even if SETI does hear something can we figure out what they said because this is a slide that was passed between the two major intelligence is on earth a Mac to a PC and it can't even get the letters right so how are we going to talk to the aliens and if there are 50 light-years away and we call them up and you buf about and then 50 years later comes back and they say please repeat I mean there we are our planet is the good planet because you can keep water Mars is a bad planet but it's still good enough for us to go there and to live on its surface for protected but Venus is a very bad the worst planet even though it's Earth like it even though early in its history made very well of Harvard earth-like life it's sue succumbed to runaway greenhouse that's an 800 degrees centigrade surface because of rampant carbon dioxide well we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what's going to happen to our particular planet we are right now and the beautiful Oreo of existence of at least life on planet Earth following the first horrible microbial age in the Cambrian explosion life emerged from the swamps complexity arose and from what we can tell we're halfway through we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now till we hit the second microbial age and that will happen paradoxically everything here about global warming when we hit co2 down to ten parts per million we are no longer going to have to have plants or allowed to have any photosynthesis and there go animals so after that we probably have 7 billion years the Sun increases in its intensity and its brightness and finally at about 12 billion years after first our turd the earth is consumed by a large Sun and this is what's left so our planet like us is going to have an age at an old age and we are in its golden summer age right now but there's two phase two everything isn't there now a lot of you are going to die of old age but some of you horribly enough are going to die in an accident and that's the fate of a platitude earth if we're lucky enough if it doesn't get hit by a pale Bop or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years we'll finally be your fate but what about accidental death well paleontologists for the last 200 years have been charting death it's strange extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about until Baron Cuvier and France found this first Mastodon he couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet and he said AHA extinct and very soon after the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals that have been his complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record in that complex record of fossils there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly and the father/mother geologists called these mass extinctions along was thought to be either act of god or perhaps long slow climate change and that really changed in 1980 in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio where walter alvarez trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks which held creatures of the Cretaceous period and the pink rocks above which held tertiary fossils how long did it take to go from one system to the next and what they found is something unexpected they found in this gap in between a very thin clay layer and that clay layer this very thin red layer here is filled with iridium and not just iridium is filled with glassy cereals and has filled the quartz grains that have been subjected to enormous pressure shock quartz now in this life the white is chalk and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean the chalk itself is composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor so the 90% of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff and then you have that millimeter thick red layer and then you have black rock and the black rock is the sediment on that sea bottom in the absence of plankton and that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe because that's what this was of course this is the famous KT a ten kilometer body hit the planet the effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet and we had very quickly the depth of the dinosaurs the death of these beautiful ammonites lasts until here and selasa furs over here and so much else I mean it must be true because we've had to Hollywood blockbusters since that time and this paradigm from 1980 to about 2000 totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes prior to that uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past there were present-day processes that will explain it but we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact so this is a type of neo catastrophism and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips that yes we were hit and yes the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction well there are five major mass extinctions the last 500 million years called the Big Five they range from 450 billion years ago to the last the KT number for the biggest of all was the P or the Permian extinction sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions and every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large body impact but is this true the most recent the Permian was thought to have been impact because of this beautiful structure on the right this is a buckminsterfullerene a carbon 60 because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes of my late beloved 60s they're called bucky balls this evidence was used to suggest at the end of the Permian 250 million years ago a comet hit us and when the comet hits the pressure produces the bucky balls and it captures bits of the comet helium-3 very rare in the surface of the earth very common in space but is this true in 1990 working on the KT extinction for ten years I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year in the great karoo desert I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa into the new South Africa as I went year by year and I worked on this Permian extinction camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time and the fossils are extraordinary you know gaze upon your very distant ancestors these are mammal-like reptiles they are culturally invisible we do not make movies about these this is gorgon opción or Gorgon that's an 18 inch long skull of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet sprawled like a lizard probably had a head like a lion this is the top carnivore the t-rex of his time there's lots of stuff this is my poor son Patrick this is called paleontological child abuse hold still you're the scale there was big stuff back then 55 species of mammal like reptiles the age of mammals had well and truly started 250 million years ago and then a catastrophe happened and what happens next is the age of dinosaurs it was all a mistake it should have never happened but it did now luckily this throwing acid on the size of a robin egg here this is a skull discovered just before taking this picture there's a pen for scale it's really tiny this is in the lowest Triassic after the mass extinction is finished you can see the eye socket you can see the little teeth in the front if that does not survive I'm not the thing giving this talk something else is because if that doesn't survive we are not here there are no mammals is that close one species eats through well can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't here's sort of the end of that ten years of work the ranges of stuff the red line is the mass extinction but we've got survivors and things that get through and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold Bloods warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time the survivors that do get through produced this world of crocodile-like creatures there's no dinosaurs yet just the smo saurian scaly nasty swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes and there they would hide for 160 million years until liberated by that KT asteroid so not impact what and the what I think is that we returned over and over and over again to the Precambrian world at first microbial age and the microbes are still out there they hate we animals they really want their world and they've tried over and over and over again and suggested me the life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti Guyon this whole Gaia idea the life makes the world better for itself and it would have been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Gaia theory no so I really suspect there's an alternative and that life does actually try to do itself in not consciously but just because it does and here's the weapon it seems that it did so over the last 500 million years there are microbes which through the metabolism produce hydrogen sulfide and they do so in large amounts hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to humans as small as 200 parts per million will kill you you only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places some lakes and get down and you'll find that the water itself turns purple turns purple for the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide and we can detect their presence today we can see them but we can also detect their presence in the past and the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field I am almost extinct I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils but the new wave of paleontologists my graduate students collect biomarkers they take the set of it itself they extract the oil from it and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups is because lipids are so tough they can get preserved in sediment and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary and be extracted and tell us who was there and we know who was there at the end of the Permian at many of these mass extinction boundaries this is what we find I saw Ernie retain its very specific it can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide enough for instance to come out of solution this led Lee Kump and others from Penn State and my group to propose what I call the comp I pas thesis many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen by high co2 and the worst effect of global warming it turns out hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans well what's the source of this in this particular case the source over and over been flood basalts this is a view of the earth now if we extract a lot of it and each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb actually the effects are even worse this is one deep earth material comes to the surface spreads out over the surface of the planet well it's not the lava that kills anything it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it this isn't Volvos this is volcanoes but carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide so these are new data about burger dive from Yale put together and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record we can do this from a variety of means and put on the red lines here when these what I call greenhouse mass extinctions took place and there's two things they're really evident here to me is that these extinctions take place when co2 is going up but the second thing that's not shown on here the earth has never had any ice on it when we've had a thousand parts per million co2 we are a 380 in climbing we should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most but my friend David Bautista in Seattle says he thinks a hundred years so there goes the ice caps and there comes 240 feet of sea-level rise I live in a view house now I'm going to have waterfront alright what's the consequence the oceans probably turn purple and we think this is the reason the complexity took so long to take place on planet Earth we had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period they stopped complex life from existing we know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet and I throw this slide and this is B actually two months ago let's throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal chambered nautilus it's been on this planets this animals for started 500 million years this is a tracking experiment interview scuba divers you want to get involved one of the coolest projects ever this is off the Great Barrier Reef and as we speak now these Nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us but the thing about this is that every once in a while divers can run into trouble so I'm gonna do little thought experiment here this is a great white shark that ate some of my traps we pulled it up up it comes so it's out there with me at night so I'm swimming along and it takes off my leg I'm 80 miles from shore what's going to happen to me well now I died five years from now this is what I hope happens to me I've taken back to the boat I'm given a gas mask eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide I'm then throwing a nice pond I'm cooled fifteen degrees lower and I can be taken to a critical care hospital and the reason I could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events and our bodies have adapted and we can now use this is what I think will be a major medical breakthrough this is Mark Roth he was funded by DARPA trying to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries he believes out pigs he puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions and he turns a mammal into a reptile I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to h2s I got this email from him two years ago he said I think I got an answer to some of your questions so he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours sometimes six hours and these are brand new data he sent me on the way over here on the top now that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through the dotted line to temperature so the temperature starts 225 centigrade and down it goes down it goes six hours later up goes the temperature now the same mouse is given eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph and look what happens to his temperature its temperature drops it goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35 and comes out of this perfectly fine here is a way we can get people to critical care here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care now you're all thinking yeah what about the brain tissue and so this is one of the great challenges is going to happen you're in an accident you got two choices you're going to die or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and say 75% of you is safe mentally what are you going to do do we all have to have little buttons say let me die this is coming towards this I think this is going to be a revolution we're going to save lives but there's going to be a cost to it the new view of mass extinctions yes we were hit and yes we have to think about the long term because we will get hit again but there's a far worse danger confronting us we can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world give us a few millennia and we humans children ask those few millennia will it happen again if we continue it will happen again how many of us flew here how many of us have gone through our entire Kyoto quota just for flying this year how many of you have exceeded it yeah I've certainly exceeded it we have a huge problem facing us as a species we have to beat this I want to be able to go back to this reef thank you the one question to Peter so am i understanding you right that what you're saying here is that we have in our own bodies a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change yeah every single cell in us can produce my new quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises this is what Roth is found out so what we're looking at now does it leave a signal doesn't leave a signal in bone or in plant we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past it's simultaneously an incredible medical technique but also a terrifying blessing and curse you

people's aliens away from them and expect to be anybody's friends well the second part of that soon after and I was talking to Paul Allen and I saw him in the audience I handed him a copy of rare earth and Jill tarter was there and she turned to me and she looked to me just like that girl in the Exorcist it was it burns it burns because Eddie doesn't want to hear this said he wants there to be stuff out there I really applaud the SETI efforts but we have not heard anything yet and I really do think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't now I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that even if SETI does hear something can we figure out what they said because this is a slide that was passed between the two major intelligence is on earth a Mac to a PC and it can't even get the letters right so how are we going to talk to the aliens and if there are 50 light-years away and we call them up and you buf about and then 50 years later comes back and they say please repeat I mean there we are our planet is the good planet because you can keep water Mars is a bad planet but it's still good enough for us to go there and to live on its surface for protected but Venus is a very bad the worst planet even though it's Earth like it even though early in its history made very well of Harvard earth-like life it's sue succumbed to runaway greenhouse that's an 800 degrees centigrade surface because of rampant carbon dioxide well we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what's going to happen to our particular planet we are right now and the beautiful Oreo of existence of at least life on planet Earth following the first horrible microbial age in the Cambrian explosion life emerged from the swamps complexity arose and from what we can tell we're halfway through we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now till we hit the second microbial age and that will happen paradoxically everything here about global warming when we hit co2 down to ten parts per million we are no longer going to have to have plants or allowed to have any photosynthesis and there go animals so after that we probably have 7 billion years the Sun increases in its intensity and its brightness and finally at about 12 billion years after first our turd the earth is consumed by a large Sun and this is what's left so our planet like us is going to have an age at an old age and we are in its golden summer age right now but there's two phase two everything isn't there now a lot of you are going to die of old age but some of you horribly enough are going to die in an accident and that's the fate of a platitude earth if we're lucky enough if it doesn't get hit by a pale Bop or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years we'll finally be your fate but what about accidental death well paleontologists for the last 200 years have been charting death it's strange extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about until Baron Cuvier and France found this first Mastodon he couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet and he said AHA extinct and very soon after the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals that have been his complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record in that complex record of fossils there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly and the father/mother geologists called these mass extinctions along was thought to be either act of god or perhaps long slow climate change and that really changed in 1980 in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio where walter alvarez trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks which held creatures of the Cretaceous period and the pink rocks above which held tertiary fossils how long did it take to go from one system to the next and what they found is something unexpected they found in this gap in between a very thin clay layer and that clay layer this very thin red layer here is filled with iridium and not just iridium is filled with glassy cereals and has filled the quartz grains that have been subjected to enormous pressure shock quartz now in this life the white is chalk and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean the chalk itself is composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor so the 90% of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff and then you have that millimeter thick red layer and then you have black rock and the black rock is the sediment on that sea bottom in the absence of plankton and that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe because that's what this was of course this is the famous KT a ten kilometer body hit the planet the effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet and we had very quickly the depth of the dinosaurs the death of these beautiful ammonites lasts until here and selasa furs over here and so much else I mean it must be true because we've had to Hollywood blockbusters since that time and this paradigm from 1980 to about 2000 totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes prior to that uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past there were present-day processes that will explain it but we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact so this is a type of neo catastrophism and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips that yes we were hit and yes the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction well there are five major mass extinctions the last 500 million years called the Big Five they range from 450 billion years ago to the last the KT number for the biggest of all was the P or the Permian extinction sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions and every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large body impact but is this true the most recent the Permian was thought to have been impact because of this beautiful structure on the right this is a buckminsterfullerene a carbon 60 because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes of my late beloved 60s they're called bucky balls this evidence was used to suggest at the end of the Permian 250 million years ago a comet hit us and when the comet hits the pressure produces the bucky balls and it captures bits of the comet helium-3 very rare in the surface of the earth very common in space but is this true in 1990 working on the KT extinction for ten years I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year in the great karoo desert I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa into the new South Africa as I went year by year and I worked on this Permian extinction camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time and the fossils are extraordinary you know gaze upon your very distant ancestors these are mammal-like reptiles they are culturally invisible we do not make movies about these this is gorgon opción or Gorgon that's an 18 inch long skull of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet sprawled like a lizard probably had a head like a lion this is the top carnivore the t-rex of his time there's lots of stuff this is my poor son Patrick this is called paleontological child abuse hold still you're the scale there was big stuff back then 55 species of mammal like reptiles the age of mammals had well and truly started 250 million years ago and then a catastrophe happened and what happens next is the age of dinosaurs it was all a mistake it should have never happened but it did now luckily this throwing acid on the size of a robin egg here this is a skull discovered just before taking this picture there's a pen for scale it's really tiny this is in the lowest Triassic after the mass extinction is finished you can see the eye socket you can see the little teeth in the front if that does not survive I'm not the thing giving this talk something else is because if that doesn't survive we are not here there are no mammals is that close one species eats through well can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't here's sort of the end of that ten years of work the ranges of stuff the red line is the mass extinction but we've got survivors and things that get through and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold Bloods warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time the survivors that do get through produced this world of crocodile-like creatures there's no dinosaurs yet just the smo saurian scaly nasty swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes and there they would hide for 160 million years until liberated by that KT asteroid so not impact what and the what I think is that we returned over and over and over again to the Precambrian world at first microbial age and the microbes are still out there they hate we animals they really want their world and they've tried over and over and over again and suggested me the life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti Guyon this whole Gaia idea the life makes the world better for itself and it would have been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Gaia theory no so I really suspect there's an alternative and that life does actually try to do itself in not consciously but just because it does and here's the weapon it seems that it did so over the last 500 million years there are microbes which through the metabolism produce hydrogen sulfide and they do so in large amounts hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to humans as small as 200 parts per million will kill you you only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places some lakes and get down and you'll find that the water itself turns purple turns purple for the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide and we can detect their presence today we can see them but we can also detect their presence in the past and the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field I am almost extinct I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils but the new wave of paleontologists my graduate students collect biomarkers they take the set of it itself they extract the oil from it and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups is because lipids are so tough they can get preserved in sediment and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary and be extracted and tell us who was there and we know who was there at the end of the Permian at many of these mass extinction boundaries this is what we find I saw Ernie retain its very specific it can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide enough for instance to come out of solution this led Lee Kump and others from Penn State and my group to propose what I call the comp I pas thesis many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen by high co2 and the worst effect of global warming it turns out hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans well what's the source of this in this particular case the source over and over been flood basalts this is a view of the earth now if we extract a lot of it and each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb actually the effects are even worse this is one deep earth material comes to the surface spreads out over the surface of the planet well it's not the lava that kills anything it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it this isn't Volvos this is volcanoes but carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide so these are new data about burger dive from Yale put together and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record we can do this from a variety of means and put on the red lines here when these what I call greenhouse mass extinctions took place and there's two things they're really evident here to me is that these extinctions take place when co2 is going up but the second thing that's not shown on here the earth has never had any ice on it when we've had a thousand parts per million co2 we are a 380 in climbing we should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most but my friend David Bautista in Seattle says he thinks a hundred years so there goes the ice caps and there comes 240 feet of sea-level rise I live in a view house now I'm going to have waterfront alright what's the consequence the oceans probably turn purple and we think this is the reason the complexity took so long to take place on planet Earth we had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period they stopped complex life from existing we know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet and I throw this slide and this is B actually two months ago let's throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal chambered nautilus it's been on this planets this animals for started 500 million years this is a tracking experiment interview scuba divers you want to get involved one of the coolest projects ever this is off the Great Barrier Reef and as we speak now these Nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us but the thing about this is that every once in a while divers can run into trouble so I'm gonna do little thought experiment here this is a great white shark that ate some of my traps we pulled it up up it comes so it's out there with me at night so I'm swimming along and it takes off my leg I'm 80 miles from shore what's going to happen to me well now I died five years from now this is what I hope happens to me I've taken back to the boat I'm given a gas mask eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide I'm then throwing a nice pond I'm cooled fifteen degrees lower and I can be taken to a critical care hospital and the reason I could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events and our bodies have adapted and we can now use this is what I think will be a major medical breakthrough this is Mark Roth he was funded by DARPA trying to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries he believes out pigs he puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions and he turns a mammal into a reptile I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to h2s I got this email from him two years ago he said I think I got an answer to some of your questions so he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours sometimes six hours and these are brand new data he sent me on the way over here on the top now that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through the dotted line to temperature so the temperature starts 225 centigrade and down it goes down it goes six hours later up goes the temperature now the same mouse is given eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph and look what happens to his temperature its temperature drops it goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35 and comes out of this perfectly fine here is a way we can get people to critical care here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care now you're all thinking yeah what about the brain tissue and so this is one of the great challenges is going to happen you're in an accident you got two choices you're going to die or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and say 75% of you is safe mentally what are you going to do do we all have to have little buttons say let me die this is coming towards this I think this is going to be a revolution we're going to save lives but there's going to be a cost to it the new view of mass extinctions yes we were hit and yes we have to think about the long term because we will get hit again but there's a far worse danger confronting us we can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world give us a few millennia and we humans children ask those few millennia will it happen again if we continue it will happen again how many of us flew here how many of us have gone through our entire Kyoto quota just for flying this year how many of you have exceeded it yeah I've certainly exceeded it we have a huge problem facing us as a species we have to beat this I want to be able to go back to this reef thank you the one question to Peter so am i understanding you right that what you're saying here is that we have in our own bodies a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change yeah every single cell in us can produce my new quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises this is what Roth is found out so what we're looking at now does it leave a signal doesn't leave a signal in bone or in plant we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past it's simultaneously an incredible medical technique but also a terrifying blessing and curse you

[Music] so I want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood I love the science fiction movies here it is this island earth and leave it to Hollywood to get it just right two and a half years in the making I mean even the creationists give us 6,000 but Hollywood goes to the chase and in this movie we see what we think is out there flying saucers and aliens every world has an alien and every alien world has the flying saucer and they move about with great speed aliens well don brownlee my friend and i finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the TV and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night and tried to write a counter-argument to it and put out what does it really take for an earth to be habitable for a planet to be an earth to have a place where you could probably get not just life but complexity which requires a huge amount of evolution and therefore constancy of conditions so in 2000 rewrote rare earth in 2003 we then asked let's not think about where earths are in space but how long is Earth Ben Earth if you go back to billion years you're not on an earth-like planet anymore what we call an earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time well rare earth actually taught me off a lot about meeting the public right after I got an invitation go to a science fiction convention and with all great earnestness walked in David Brin was going to debate me on this and as I walked in the crowd of 100 started Bowie and lustily but a girl came up and said my dad says you're the devil you cannot take people's aliens away from them and expect to be anybody's friends well the second part of that soon after and I was talking to Paul Allen and I saw him in the audience I handed him a copy of rare

funded by DARPA trying to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries he believes out pigs he puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions and he turns a mammal into a reptile I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to h2s I got this email from him two years ago he said I think I got an answer to some of your questions so he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours sometimes six hours and these are brand new data he sent me on the way over here on the top now that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through the dotted line to temperature so the temperature starts 225 centigrade and down it goes down it goes six hours later up goes the temperature now the same mouse is given eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph and look what happens to his temperature its temperature drops it goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35 and comes out of this perfectly fine here is a way we can get people to critical care here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care now you're all thinking yeah what about the brain tissue and so this is one of the great challenges is going to happen you're in an accident you got two choices you're going to die or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and say 75% of you is safe mentally what are you going to do do we all have to have little buttons say let me die this is coming towards this I think this is going to be a revolution we're going to save lives but there's going to be a cost to it the new view of mass extinctions yes we were hit and yes we have to think about the long term because we will get hit again but there's a far worse danger confronting us we can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world give us a few millennia and we humans children ask those few millennia will it happen again if we continue it will happen again how many of us flew here how many of us have gone through our entire Kyoto quota just for flying this year how many of you have exceeded it yeah I've certainly exceeded it we have a huge problem facing us as a species we have to beat this I want to be able to go back to this reef thank you the one question to Peter so am i understanding you right that what you're saying here is that we have in our own bodies a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change yeah every single cell in us can produce my new quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises this is what Roth is found out so what we're looking at now does it leave a signal doesn't leave a signal in bone or in plant we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past it's simultaneously an incredible medical technique but also a terrifying blessing and curse you

**Transcript**:
[Music] so I want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood I love the science fiction movies here it is this island earth and leave it to Hollywood to get it just right two and a half years in the making I mean even the creationists give us 6,000 but Hollywood goes to the chase and in this movie we see what we think is out there flying saucers and aliens every world has an alien and every alien world has the flying saucer and they move about with great speed aliens well don brownlee my friend and i finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the TV and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night and tried to write a counter-argument to it and put out what does it really take for an earth to be habitable for a planet to be an earth to have a place where you could probably get not just life but complexity which requires a huge amount of evolution and therefore constancy of conditions so in 2000 rewrote rare earth in 2003 we then asked let's not think about where earths are in space but how long is Earth Ben Earth if you go back to billion years you're not on an earth-like planet anymore what we call an earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time well rare earth actually taught me off a lot about meeting the public right after I got an invitation go to a science fiction convention and with all great earnestness walked in David Brin was going to debate me on this and as I walked in the crowd of 100 started Bowie and lustily but a girl came up and said my dad says you're the devil you cannot take people's aliens away from them and expect to be anybody's friends well the second part of that soon after and I was talking to Paul Allen and I saw him in the audience I handed him a copy of rare earth and Jill tarter was there and she turned to me and she looked to me just like that girl in the Exorcist it was it burns it burns because Eddie doesn't want to hear this said he wants there to be stuff out there I really applaud the SETI efforts but we have not heard anything yet and I really do think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't now I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that even if SETI does hear something can we figure out what they said because this is a slide that was passed between the two major intelligence is on earth a Mac to a PC and it can't even get the letters right so how are we going to talk to the aliens and if there are 50 light-years away and we call them up and you buf about and then 50 years later comes back and they say please repeat I mean there we are our planet is the good planet because you can keep water Mars is a bad planet but it's still good enough for us to go there and to live on its surface for protected but Venus is a very bad the worst planet even though it's Earth like it even though early in its history made very well of Harvard earth-like life it's sue succumbed to runaway greenhouse that's an 800 degrees centigrade surface because of rampant carbon dioxide well we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what's going to happen to our particular planet we are right now and the beautiful Oreo of existence of at least life on planet Earth following the first horrible microbial age in the Cambrian explosion life emerged from the swamps complexity arose and from what we can tell we're halfway through we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now till we hit the second microbial age and that will happen paradoxically everything here about global warming when we hit co2 down to ten parts per million we are no longer going to have to have plants or allowed to have any photosynthesis and there go animals so after that we probably have 7 billion years the Sun increases in its intensity and its brightness and finally at about 12 billion years after first our turd the earth is consumed by a large Sun and this is what's left so our planet like us is going to have an age at an old age and we are in its golden summer age right now but there's two phase two everything isn't there now a lot of you are going to die of old age but some of you horribly enough are going to die in an accident and that's the fate of a platitude earth if we're lucky enough if it doesn't get hit by a pale Bop or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years we'll finally be your fate but what about accidental death well paleontologists for the last 200 years have been charting death it's strange extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about until Baron Cuvier and France found this first Mastodon he couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet and he said AHA extinct and very soon after the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals that have been his complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record in that complex record of fossils there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly and the father/mother geologists called these mass extinctions along was thought to be either act of god or perhaps long slow climate change and that really changed in 1980 in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio where walter alvarez trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks which held creatures of the Cretaceous period and the pink rocks above which held tertiary fossils how long did it take to go from one system to the next and what they found is something unexpected they found in this gap in between a very thin clay layer and that clay layer this very thin red layer here is filled with iridium and not just iridium is filled with glassy cereals and has filled the quartz grains that have been subjected to enormous pressure shock quartz now in this life the white is chalk and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean the chalk itself is composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor so the 90% of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff and then you have that millimeter thick red layer and then you have black rock and the black rock is the sediment on that sea bottom in the absence of plankton and that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe because that's what this was of course this is the famous KT a ten kilometer body hit the planet the effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet and we had very quickly the depth of the dinosaurs the death of these beautiful ammonites lasts until here and selasa furs over here and so much else I mean it must be true because we've had to Hollywood blockbusters since that time and this paradigm from 1980 to about 2000 totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes prior to that uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past there were present-day processes that will explain it but we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact so this is a type of neo catastrophism and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips that yes we were hit and yes the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction well there are five major mass extinctions the last 500 million years called the Big Five they range from 450 billion years ago to the last the KT number for the biggest of all was the P or the Permian extinction sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions and every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large body impact but is this true the most recent the Permian was thought to have been impact because of this beautiful structure on the right this is a buckminsterfullerene a carbon 60 because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes of my late beloved 60s they're called bucky balls this evidence was used to suggest at the end of the Permian 250 million years ago a comet hit us and when the comet hits the pressure produces the bucky balls and it captures bits of the comet helium-3 very rare in the surface of the earth very common in space but is this true in 1990 working on the KT extinction for ten years I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year in the great karoo desert I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa into the new South Africa as I went year by year and I worked on this Permian extinction camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time and the fossils are extraordinary you know gaze upon your very distant ancestors these are mammal-like reptiles they are culturally invisible we do not make movies about these this is gorgon opción or Gorgon that's an 18 inch long skull of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet sprawled like a lizard probably had a head like a lion this is the top carnivore the t-rex of his time there's lots of stuff this is my poor son Patrick this is called paleontological child abuse hold still you're the scale there was big stuff back then 55 species of mammal like reptiles the age of mammals had well and truly started 250 million years ago and then a catastrophe happened and what happens next is the age of dinosaurs it was all a mistake it should have never happened but it did now luckily this throwing acid on the size of a robin egg here this is a skull discovered just before taking this picture there's a pen for scale it's really tiny this is in the lowest Triassic after the mass extinction is finished you can see the eye socket you can see the little teeth in the front if that does not survive I'm not the thing giving this talk something else is because if that doesn't survive we are not here there are no mammals is that close one species eats through well can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't here's sort of the end of that ten years of work the ranges of stuff the red line is the mass extinction but we've got survivors and things that get through and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold Bloods warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time the survivors that do get through produced this world of crocodile-like creatures there's no dinosaurs yet just the smo saurian scaly nasty swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes and there they would hide for 160 million years until liberated by that KT asteroid so not impact what and the what I think is that we returned over and over and over again to the Precambrian world at first microbial age and the microbes are still out there they hate we animals they really want their world and they've tried over and over and over again and suggested me the life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti Guyon this whole Gaia idea the life makes the world better for itself and it would have been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Gaia theory no so I really suspect there's an alternative and that life does actually try to do itself in not consciously but just because it does and here's the weapon it seems that it did so over the last 500 million years there are microbes which through the metabolism produce hydrogen sulfide and they do so in large amounts hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to humans as small as 200 parts per million will kill you you only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places some lakes and get down and you'll find that the water itself turns purple turns purple for the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide and we can detect their presence today we can see them but we can also detect their presence in the past and the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field I am almost extinct I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils but the new wave of paleontologists my graduate students collect biomarkers they take the set of it itself they extract the oil from it and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups is because lipids are so tough they can get preserved in sediment and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary and be extracted and tell us who was there and we know who was there at the end of the Permian at many of these mass extinction boundaries this is what we find I saw Ernie retain its very specific it can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide enough for instance to come out of solution this led Lee Kump and others from Penn State and my group to propose what I call the comp I pas thesis many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen by high co2 and the worst effect of global warming it turns out hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans well what's the source of this in this particular case the source over and over been flood basalts this is a view of the earth now if we extract a lot of it and each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb actually the effects are even worse this is one deep earth material comes to the surface spreads out over the surface of the planet well it's not the lava that kills anything it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it this isn't Volvos this is volcanoes but carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide so these are new data about burger dive from Yale put together and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record we can do this from a variety of means and put on the red lines here when these what I call greenhouse mass extinctions took place and there's two things they're really evident here to me is that these extinctions take place when co2 is going up but the second thing that's not shown on here the earth has never had any ice on it when we've had a thousand parts per million co2 we are a 380 in climbing we should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most but my friend David Bautista in Seattle says he thinks a hundred years so there goes the ice caps and there comes 240 feet of sea-level rise I live in a view house now I'm going to have waterfront alright what's the consequence the oceans probably turn purple and we think this is the reason the complexity took so long to take place on planet Earth we had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period they stopped complex life from existing we know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet and I throw this slide and this is B actually two months ago let's throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal chambered nautilus it's been on this planets this animals for started 500 million years this is a tracking experiment interview scuba divers you want to get involved one of the coolest projects ever this is off the Great Barrier Reef and as we speak now these Nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us but the thing about this is that every once in a while divers can run into trouble so I'm gonna do little thought experiment here this is a great white shark that ate some of my traps we pulled it up up it comes so it's out there with me at night so I'm swimming along and it takes off my leg I'm 80 miles from shore what's going to happen to me well now I died five years from now this is what I hope happens to me I've taken back to the boat I'm given a gas mask eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide I'm then throwing a nice pond I'm cooled fifteen degrees lower and I can be taken to a critical care hospital and the reason I could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events and our bodies have adapted and we can now use this is what I think will be a major medical breakthrough this is Mark Roth he was funded by DARPA trying to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries he believes out pigs he puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions and he turns a mammal into a reptile I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to h2s I got this email from him two years ago he said I think I got an answer to some of your questions so he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours sometimes six hours and these are brand new data he sent me on the way over here on the top now that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through the dotted line to temperature so the temperature starts 225 centigrade and down it goes down it goes six hours later

number for the biggest of all was the P or the Permian extinction sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions and every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large body impact but is this true the most recent the Permian was thought to have been impact because of this beautiful structure on the right this is a buckminsterfullerene a carbon 60 because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes of my late beloved 60s they're called bucky balls this evidence was used to suggest at the end of the Permian 250 million years ago a comet hit us and when the comet hits the pressure produces the bucky balls and it captures bits of the comet helium-3 very rare in the surface of the earth very common in space but is this true in 1990 working on the KT extinction for ten years I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year in the great karoo desert I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa into the new South Africa as I went year by year and I worked on this Permian extinction camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time and the fossils are extraordinary you know gaze upon your very distant ancestors these are mammal-like reptiles they are culturally invisible we do not make movies about these this is gorgon opción or Gorgon that's an 18 inch long skull of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet sprawled like a lizard probably had a head like a lion this is the top carnivore the t-rex of his time there's lots of stuff this is my poor son Patrick this is called paleontological child abuse hold still you're the scale there was big stuff back then 55 species of mammal like reptiles the age of mammals had well and truly started 250 million years ago and then a catastrophe happened and what happens next is the age of dinosaurs it was all a mistake it should have never happened but it did now luckily this throwing acid on the size of a robin egg here this is a skull discovered just before taking this picture there's a pen for scale it's really tiny this is in the lowest Triassic after the mass extinction is finished you can see the eye socket you can see the little teeth in the front if that does not survive I'm not the thing giving this talk something else is because if that doesn't survive we are not here there are no mammals is that close one species eats through well can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't here's sort of the end of that ten years of work the ranges of stuff the red line is the mass extinction but we've got survivors and things that get through and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold Bloods warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time the survivors that do get through produced this world of crocodile-like creatures there's no dinosaurs yet just the smo saurian scaly nasty swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes and there they would hide for 160 million years until liberated by that KT asteroid so not impact what and the what I think is that we returned over and over and over again to the Precambrian world at first microbial age and the microbes are still out there they hate we animals they really want their world and they've tried over and over and over again and suggested me the life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti Guyon this whole Gaia idea the life makes the world better for itself and it would have been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Gaia theory no so I really suspect there's an alternative and that life does actually try to do itself in not consciously but just because it does and here's the weapon it seems that it did so over the last 500 million years there are microbes which through the metabolism produce hydrogen sulfide and they do so in large amounts hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to humans as small as 200 parts per million will kill you you only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places some lakes and get down and you'll find that the water itself turns purple turns purple for the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide and we can detect their presence today we can see them but we can also detect their presence in the past and the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field I am almost extinct I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils but the new wave of paleontologists my graduate students collect biomarkers they take the set of it itself they extract the oil from it and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups is because lipids are so tough they can get preserved in sediment and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary and be extracted and tell us who was there and we know who was there at the end of the Permian at many of these mass extinction boundaries this is what we find I saw Ernie retain its very specific it can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide enough for instance to come out of solution this led Lee Kump and others from Penn State and my group to propose what I call the comp I pas thesis many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen by high co2 and the worst effect of global warming it turns out hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans well what's the source of this in this particular case the source over and over been flood basalts this is a view of the earth now if we extract a lot of it and each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb actually the effects are even worse this is one deep earth material comes to the surface spreads out over the surface of the planet well it's not the lava that kills anything it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it this isn't Volvos this is volcanoes but carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide so these are new data about burger dive from Yale put together and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record we can do this from a variety of means and put on the red lines here when these what I call greenhouse mass extinctions took place and there's two things they're really evident here to me is that these extinctions take place when co2 is going up but the second thing that's not shown on here the earth has never had any ice on it when we've had a thousand parts per million co2 we are a 380 in climbing we should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most but my friend David Bautista in Seattle says he thinks a hundred years so there goes the ice caps and there comes 240 feet of sea-level rise I live in a view house now I'm going to have waterfront alright what's the consequence the oceans probably turn purple and we think this is the reason the complexity took so long to take place on planet Earth we had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period they stopped complex life from existing we know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet and I throw this slide and this is B actually two months ago let's throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal chambered nautilus it's been on this planets this animals for started 500 million years this is a tracking experiment interview scuba divers you want to get involved one of the coolest projects ever this is off the Great Barrier Reef and as we speak now these Nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us but the thing about this is that every once in a while divers can run into trouble so I'm gonna do little thought experiment here this is a great white shark that ate some of my traps we pulled it up up it comes so it's out there with me at night so I'm swimming along and it takes off my leg I'm 80 miles from shore what's going to happen to me well now I died five years from now this is what I hope happens to me I've taken back to the boat I'm given a gas mask eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide I'm then throwing a nice pond I'm cooled fifteen degrees lower and I can be taken to a critical care hospital and the reason I could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events and our bodies have adapted and we can now use this is what I think will be a major medical breakthrough this is Mark Roth he was funded by DARPA trying to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries he believes out pigs he puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions and he turns a mammal into a reptile I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to h2s I got this email from him two years ago he said I think I got an answer to some of your questions so he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours sometimes six hours and these are brand new data he sent me on the way over here on the top now that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through the dotted line to temperature so the temperature starts 225 centigrade and down it goes down it goes six hours later up goes the temperature now the same mouse is given eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph and look what happens to his temperature its temperature drops it goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35 and comes out of this perfectly fine here is a way we can get people to critical care here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care now you're all thinking yeah what about the brain tissue and so this is one of the great challenges is going to happen you're in an accident you got two choices you're going to die or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and say 75% of you is safe mentally what are you going to do do we all have to have little buttons say let me die this is coming towards this I think this is going to be a revolution we're going to save lives but there's going to be a cost to it the new view of mass extinctions yes we were hit and yes we have to think about the long term because we will get hit again but there's a far worse danger confronting us we can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world give us a few millennia and we humans children ask those few millennia will it happen again if we continue it will happen again how many of us flew here how many of us have gone through our entire Kyoto quota just for flying this year how many of you have exceeded it yeah I've certainly exceeded it we have a huge problem facing us as a species we have to beat this I want to be able to go back to this reef thank you the one question to Peter so am i understanding you right that what you're saying here is that we have in our own bodies a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change yeah every single cell in us can produce my new quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises this is what Roth is found out so what we're looking at now does it leave a signal doesn't leave a signal in bone or in plant we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past it's simultaneously an incredible medical technique but also a terrifying blessing and curse you
