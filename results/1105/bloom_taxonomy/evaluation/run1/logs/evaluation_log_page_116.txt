To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,
is it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters 
were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 3: What is the significance of expanding the frame of the possible in civic life?**

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that this question doesn't exactly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that directly addresses the limitations of protest and the need for additional actions.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the closest match based on the overall content and intent, I would choose:

**Question 6: What is the significance of seeking and achieving an early win in civic life?**

This question doesn't directly address the limitations of protest, but it does touch on the idea that protests alone are not enough and that additional actions (in this case, achieving an early win) are necessary to create lasting change.

That being said, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to provide an index, I would say:

**Index: 6**

However, please note that this is not an exact match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the limitations of protest and the need for additional actions.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 2: What was the outcome of the Arab Spring protests in the Middle East?**

Although this question does not directly ask which of the following is not something that protest alone can achieve, one of its options (A. The establishment of democratic governments) implies that protests alone were not enough to achieve the desired outcome, which aligns with the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, if I had to choose the most similar one based on the content and intent, I would choose:

**Question 2**

But since it's not a perfect match, I'll provide an explanation. A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the limitations of protests alone, such as:

* What is a limitation of protests alone in achieving lasting change?
* Which of the following outcomes is less likely to be achieved by protests alone?

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this question. If I had to create a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

**New Question:** What is a limitation of protests alone in achieving lasting change?
Options: A. Forcing out tyrants from power, B. Effectively selecting new democratic leaders, C. Highlighting issues on a national or global scale, D. Inspiring other people to action
Correct Option: B

This new question aligns with the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ.

However, since I need to provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ from the existing options, I will choose:

**Index: 2**

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the limitations of protests alone.

**Transcript**:
We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,
is it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters 
were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 9: What is the significance of the long, slow slog in achieving lasting change in civic life?**

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that this question doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about specific historical movements that exemplify the long, slow slog of securing wins, whereas Question 9 is more about the significance of the long, slow slog in general.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the closest one, I would say that **Question 7: What is an example of an early win that contributed to the eventual toppling of Poland's communist government?** is the closest, as it mentions a specific historical event that is also mentioned in the correct answer of the ground truth MCQ (Czech self-determination is not mentioned, but Polish solidarity movement is).

However, I must emphasize that this is not an exact match, and a new question that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ should be generated.

If I had to provide an index, I would say **7**, but with the caveat that it's not an exact match.

a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**None of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, I would recommend Question 5 as the closest match.**

Although Question 5 does not directly ask about the fields where self-assembly can be observed, it does mention some potential applications of self-assembly in technology, which indirectly relates to the idea that self-assembly can be observed across various fields.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more similar in terms of intent, I would suggest creating a new question that is not present in the generated MCQs. A more suitable question would be:

Question: In which of the following fields can self-assembly be observed?
Options: A. Only in biology and chemistry, B. Only in robotics and social media, C. Across various fields, including biology, chemistry, magnets, and social networks, D. Only in construction and architecture

This new question more closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of intent and content.

If I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would select:

**Question 5: What are some potential applications of self assembly in technology?**

Please note that this is not an exact match, but rather a recommendation based on the available options.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.

Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate.

In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

However, Question 5 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it focuses on the key feature of competitive advantage rather than the importance of cognitive diversity in problem-solving.

A more suitable match would be Question 6, but it also does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 6, but with a note that it is not a perfect match.

A perfect match would be a generated MCQ with the following content:
Question: According to the speaker, why is cognitive diversity important in problem-solving?
Options: A. It leads to a decrease in total ideas generated, B. It results in a decrease in collective intelligence, C. It fosters an increase in total ideas generated, D. It doesn’t affect collective intelligence

Unfortunately, this MCQ is not present in the generated MCQs.

Therefore, I will choose Question 6 as the most similar generated MCQ, with the understanding that it is not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,
is it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters 
were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

**Transcript**:
We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,
is it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters 
were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.
