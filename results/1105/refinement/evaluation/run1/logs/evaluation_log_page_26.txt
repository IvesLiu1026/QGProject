**Transcript**:
What keeps you up at night? Pondering deep questions? Excitement about a big trip? Or is it stress about unfinished work, an upcoming test, or a dreaded family gathering? For many people, this stress is temporary,
as its cause is quickly resolved. But what if the very thing keeping 
you awake was stress about losing sleep? This seemingly unsolvable loop 
is at the heart of insomnia, the world’s most common
sleep disorder. Almost anything can cause 
the occasional restless night - a snoring partner, physical pain, or emotional distress. And extreme sleep deprivation like jetlag
can throw off your biological clock, wreaking havoc on your sleep schedule. But in most cases, sleep deprivation 
is short-term. Eventually, exhaustion catches up 
with all of us. However, some long-term conditions
like respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal problems, and many others can overpower fatigue. And as sleepless nights pile up, the bedroom can start to carry 
associations of restless nights wracked with anxiety. Come bedtime, insomniacs are stressed. So stressed their brains hijack 
the stress response system, flooding the body with 
fight-flight-or-freeze chemicals. Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormones 
course through the bloodstream, increasing heart rate and blood pressure, and jolting the body into hyperarousal. In this condition, the brain is hunting 
for potential threats, making it impossible to ignore
any slight discomfort or nighttime noise. And when insomniacs 
finally do fall asleep, the quality of their rest is compromised. Our brain’s primary source of energy 
is cerebral glucose, and in healthy sleep, our metabolism slows
to conserve this glucose for waking hours. But PET studies show the adrenaline 
that prevents sleep for insomniacs also speeds up their metabolisms. While they sleep, their bodies 
are working overtime, burning through the brain’s supply 
of energy-giving glucose. This symptom of poor sleep leaves 
insomniacs waking in a state of exhaustion,
confusion, and stress, which starts the
process all over again. When these cycles of stress 
and restlessness last several months, they’re diagnosed as chronic insomnia. And while insomnia rarely leads to death, its chemical mechanisms are similar 
to anxiety attacks found in those experiencing depression
and anxiety. So suffering from 
any one of these conditions increases your risk of
experiencing the other two. Fortunately, there are ways to break 
the cycle of sleeplessness. Managing the stress that leads 
to hyperarousal is one of our best-understood treatments 
for insomnia, and good sleep practices can help rebuild 
your relationship with bedtime. Make sure your bedroom is dark 
and comfortably cool to minimize “threats” during hyperarousal. Only use your bed for sleeping, and if you’re restless, leave the room and tire yourself out 
with relaxing activities like reading, meditating, or journaling. Regulate your metabolism by setting
consistent resting and waking times to help orient 
your body’s biological clock. This clock, or circadian rhythm, is also sensitive to light, so avoid bright lights at night to help tell your body
that it’s time for sleep. In addition to these practices, some doctors prescribe medication 
to aid sleep, but there aren’t reliable medications 
that help in all cases. And over-the-counter sleeping pills 
can be highly addictive, leading to withdrawal 
that worsens symptoms. But before seeking any treatment, make sure your sleeplessness 
is actually due to insomnia. Approximately 8% of patients diagnosed 
with chronic insomnia are actually suffering from a less common
genetic problem called delayed sleep phase disorder,
or DSPD. People with DSPD have a circadian rhythm 
significantly longer than 24 hours, putting their sleeping habits out 
of sync with traditional sleeping hours. So while they have difficulty 
falling asleep at a typical bedtime, it’s not due to increased stress. And given the opportunity, they can sleep comfortably 
on their own delayed schedule. Our sleeping and waking cycle 
is a delicate balance, and one that’s vital to maintain
for our physical and mental wellbeing. For all these reasons, it’s worth putting in some time 
and effort to sustain a stable bedtime routine, but try not to lose any sleep over it.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the vital resource that is not being adequately replenished when insomniacs sleep, which is cerebral glucose. However, none of the generated MCQs mention cerebral glucose or insomnia.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic, I would choose Question 5: "Which of the following activities will increase neurogenesis? Options: A. Learning, B. Stress, C. Sleep deprivation, D. All of the above Correct Option: A."

This question is related to sleep deprivation, which is a topic mentioned in the transcript. However, it is not directly related to the ground truth MCQ, and the options do not mention cerebral glucose.

Therefore, I would say that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

Index: None

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is related to sleep hygiene, while the generated MCQs are related to neurogenesis.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of sleep, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar. But if I had to choose one that is remotely related to sleep, I would say Question 5: "Which of the following activities will increase neurogenesis? Options: A. Learning, B. Stress, C. Sleep deprivation, D. All of the above" is the closest, but still not similar.

A more suitable approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the topic of sleep and sleep hygiene, and then try to match the ground truth MCQ with one of the newly generated MCQs.

In this case, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and a new set of MCQs should be generated to find a match.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
What keeps you up at night? Pondering deep questions? Excitement about a big trip? Or is it stress about unfinished work, an upcoming test, or a dreaded family gathering? For many people, this stress is temporary,
as its cause is quickly resolved. But what if the very thing keeping 
you awake was stress about losing sleep? This seemingly unsolvable loop 
is at the heart of insomnia, the world’s most common
sleep disorder. Almost anything can cause 
the occasional restless night - a snoring partner, physical pain, or emotional distress. And extreme sleep deprivation like jetlag
can throw off your biological clock, wreaking havoc on your sleep schedule. But in most cases, sleep deprivation 
is short-term. Eventually, exhaustion catches up 
with all of us. However, some long-term conditions
like respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal problems, and many others can overpower fatigue. And as sleepless nights pile up, the bedroom can start to carry 
associations of restless nights wracked with anxiety. Come bedtime, insomniacs are stressed. So stressed their brains hijack 
the stress response system, flooding the body with 
fight-flight-or-freeze chemicals. Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormones 
course through the bloodstream, increasing heart rate and blood pressure, and jolting the body into hyperarousal. In this condition, the brain is hunting 
for potential threats, making it impossible to ignore
any slight discomfort or nighttime noise. And when insomniacs 
finally do fall asleep, the quality of their rest is compromised. Our brain’s primary source of energy 
is cerebral glucose, and in healthy sleep, our metabolism slows
to conserve this glucose for waking hours. But PET studies show the adrenaline 
that prevents sleep for insomniacs also speeds up their metabolisms. While they sleep, their bodies 
are working overtime, burning through the brain’s supply 
of energy-giving glucose. This symptom of poor sleep leaves 
insomniacs waking in a state of exhaustion,
confusion, and stress, which starts the
process all over again. When these cycles of stress 
and restlessness last several months, they’re diagnosed as chronic insomnia. And while insomnia rarely leads to death, its chemical mechanisms are similar 
to anxiety attacks found in those experiencing depression
and anxiety. So suffering from 
any one of these conditions increases your risk of
experiencing the other two. Fortunately, there are ways to break 
the cycle of sleeplessness. Managing the stress that leads 
to hyperarousal is one of our best-understood treatments 
for insomnia, and good sleep practices can help rebuild 
your relationship with bedtime. Make sure your bedroom is dark 
and comfortably cool to minimize “threats” during hyperarousal. Only use your bed for sleeping, and if you’re restless, leave the room and tire yourself out 
with relaxing activities like reading, meditating, or journaling. Regulate your metabolism by setting
consistent resting and waking times to help orient 
your body’s biological clock. This clock, or circadian rhythm, is also sensitive to light, so avoid bright lights at night to help tell your body
that it’s time for sleep. In addition to these practices, some doctors prescribe medication 
to aid sleep, but there aren’t reliable medications 
that help in all cases. And over-the-counter sleeping pills 
can be highly addictive, leading to withdrawal 
that worsens symptoms. But before seeking any treatment, make sure your sleeplessness 
is actually due to insomnia. Approximately 8% of patients diagnosed 
with chronic insomnia are actually suffering from a less common
genetic problem called delayed sleep phase disorder,
or DSPD. People with DSPD have a circadian rhythm 
significantly longer than 24 hours, putting their sleeping habits out 
of sync with traditional sleeping hours. So while they have difficulty 
falling asleep at a typical bedtime, it’s not due to increased stress. And given the opportunity, they can sleep comfortably 
on their own delayed schedule. Our sleeping and waking cycle 
is a delicate balance, and one that’s vital to maintain
for our physical and mental wellbeing. For all these reasons, it’s worth putting in some time 
and effort to sustain a stable bedtime routine, but try not to lose any sleep over it.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks for the meaning of the acronym "DSPD", which is related to the topic of sleep disorders, specifically Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder. The generated MCQs, on the other hand, are related to the topic of neurogenesis and its relationship to various factors.

Since there is no match, I will not provide an index. However, I can suggest that a new set of generated MCQs that are relevant to the topic of sleep disorders and insomnia might be more likely to produce a match.

**Transcript**:
On the coast of Northern Ireland, a vast plateau of basalt slabs
and columns called the Giant’s Causeway stretches into the ocean. The scientific explanation for this is that it’s the result of
molten lava contracting and fracturing as it cooled in the wake 
of a volcanic eruption. But an ancient Irish myth 
has a different accounting. According to legend, the giant Finn MacCool lived happily 
on the North Antrim coast with his wife Oonagh. Their only disturbance came from
the taunts and threats of the giant Benandonner, or the red man, 
who lived across the sea in Scotland. The two roared insults 
and hurled rocks at each other in dramatic shows of strength. Once, Finn tore up a great clump of land 
and heaved it at his rival, but it fell short of reaching land. Instead, the clump became the Isle of Man, and the crater left from the disturbed
earth filled with water to become Lough Neagh. The giants’ tough talk continued, until one day Benandonner challenged 
Finn to a fight, face to face. And so the Irish giant tossed 
enough boulders into the sea to create a bridge of stepping 
stones to the Scottish coast. Finn marched across in a fit of rage. When Scotland loomed before him, he made out the figure 
of Benandonner from afar. Finn was a substantial size, but at the sight of his colossal
enemy thundering towards him, his courage faltered. With one look at Benandonner’s thick neck
and crushing fists, Finn turned and ran. Back home, with Benandonner 
fast approaching, Finn trembled as he described 
his enemy’s bulk to Oonagh. They knew that if he faced 
Benandonner head on, he’d be crushed. And so Oonagh hatched a cunning plan - they needed to create an illusion of size, to suggest Finn was a mountain 
of a man whilst keeping him out of sight. As Benandonner neared 
the end of the bridge, Oonagh stuffed her husband 
in a huge cradle. Disguised as an enormous baby, Finn lay quiet as Benandonnner 
pounded on the door. The house shook as he stepped inside. Oonagh told the enraged visitor 
that her husband wasn’t home, but welcomed him to sit
and eat while he waited. When Benandonner tore into the cakes 
placed before him, he cried out in pain for he’d shattered his teeth 
on the metal Oonagh had concealed inside. She told him that this 
was Finn’s favorite bread, sowing a seed of doubt 
in Benandonner’s mind that he was any match for his rival. When Finn let out a squawk, Benandonner’s attention was drawn 
to the gigantic baby in the corner. So hefty was the infant swaddled 
under piles of blankets, Benandonner shuddered at the thought 
of what the father would look like. He decided he’d rather not find out. As he fled, Benandonner tore up the rocks 
connecting the shores, breaking up the causeway. What remains are two identical 
rock formations: one on the North Antrim coast of Ireland and one at Fingal’s Cave in Scotland, 
right across the sea.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as the effects of noise and silence on the brain and body, music, and cognitive abilities.

However, I can suggest that the closest match would be Question 8, which states "What is not available in the transcript." This question is the only one that is somewhat related to the transcript provided, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 8, but with a note that it's not a good match.

Index: 8 (with a note that it's not a good match)

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the transcript and the topic of the Giant's Causeway.

However, the generated MCQs seem to be unrelated to the transcript and are discussing different topics such as noise pollution, music, and cognitive abilities.

Therefore, I couldn't find a generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
On the coast of Northern Ireland, a vast plateau of basalt slabs
and columns called the Giant’s Causeway stretches into the ocean. The scientific explanation for this is that it’s the result of
molten lava contracting and fracturing as it cooled in the wake 
of a volcanic eruption. But an ancient Irish myth 
has a different accounting. According to legend, the giant Finn MacCool lived happily 
on the North Antrim coast with his wife Oonagh. Their only disturbance came from
the taunts and threats of the giant Benandonner, or the red man, 
who lived across the sea in Scotland. The two roared insults 
and hurled rocks at each other in dramatic shows of strength. Once, Finn tore up a great clump of land 
and heaved it at his rival, but it fell short of reaching land. Instead, the clump became the Isle of Man, and the crater left from the disturbed
earth filled with water to become Lough Neagh. The giants’ tough talk continued, until one day Benandonner challenged 
Finn to a fight, face to face. And so the Irish giant tossed 
enough boulders into the sea to create a bridge of stepping 
stones to the Scottish coast. Finn marched across in a fit of rage. When Scotland loomed before him, he made out the figure 
of Benandonner from afar. Finn was a substantial size, but at the sight of his colossal
enemy thundering towards him, his courage faltered. With one look at Benandonner’s thick neck
and crushing fists, Finn turned and ran. Back home, with Benandonner 
fast approaching, Finn trembled as he described 
his enemy’s bulk to Oonagh. They knew that if he faced 
Benandonner head on, he’d be crushed. And so Oonagh hatched a cunning plan - they needed to create an illusion of size, to suggest Finn was a mountain 
of a man whilst keeping him out of sight. As Benandonner neared 
the end of the bridge, Oonagh stuffed her husband 
in a huge cradle. Disguised as an enormous baby, Finn lay quiet as Benandonnner 
pounded on the door. The house shook as he stepped inside. Oonagh told the enraged visitor 
that her husband wasn’t home, but welcomed him to sit
and eat while he waited. When Benandonner tore into the cakes 
placed before him, he cried out in pain for he’d shattered his teeth 
on the metal Oonagh had concealed inside. She told him that this 
was Finn’s favorite bread, sowing a seed of doubt 
in Benandonner’s mind that he was any match for his rival. When Finn let out a squawk, Benandonner’s attention was drawn 
to the gigantic baby in the corner. So hefty was the infant swaddled 
under piles of blankets, Benandonner shuddered at the thought 
of what the father would look like. He decided he’d rather not find out. As he fled, Benandonner tore up the rocks 
connecting the shores, breaking up the causeway. What remains are two identical 
rock formations: one on the North Antrim coast of Ireland and one at Fingal’s Cave in Scotland, 
right across the sea.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
As a writer, comedian, researcher, and DJ,
I have to have music to focus. But I have friends who need *complete silence*
to study, write, or be productive. So which one’s better for our brain and our body? Let’s start by finding out what noise, the
opposite of silence, does to our bodies. Studies were conducted by the World Health
Organization that linked noise pollution, like loud city sounds, with higher blood pressure
and a higher chance for a fatal heart attack. All right, don’t panic, that neighbor playing
Migos at 4 a.m. isn’t going to kill you, but prolonged exposure to a noisy environment
can lead to cognitive deficits as well. Studies have shown that students in schools
near airports and train stations have suffered negative effects on long-term memory and reading
comprehension, leading some cities to require soundproofing in schools. 
So, noise may not kill you, but it increases your stress levels, 
which is no bueno for your brain long-term. Are you hearing this, construction workers
who have to fix my sidewalk at 6 a.m.? Yeah, I'm comin' for y'all. Silence, on the other hand, has been correlated
with lower stress hormones. Also, studies done on mice in 2013 found that
those exposed to silence over white noise, or even Mozart, expressed higher rates of
neurogenesis, or the production of neurons, in the hippocampus, the part of the brain
that processes memory. Further studies found more evidence that the
brain is processing and evaluating new information faster in times of silence over sound. So, less stress, new neurons, new synaptic
connections and memory formation? Sounds good for productivity. I know what you’re thinking: “but I do
my best work when listening to Evanescence!” Me too. I love "Bring Me To Life." But be patient, we’re getting there! Music permeates all parts of the brain; not
just the temporal lobe or the auditory cortices. If the song slaps (or if it’s trash), it’ll
activate your amygdala and parts of your limbic system 
responsible for emotional response. What’s more, both music and language are
auditorily processed; both are forms of communication, and I don’t know about y’all, but I consider
music like a language. I mean, have you SEEN sheet music? 
That's from a different alien race. New research shows that there may be neurons
in the auditory cortex that activate specifically for music; 
not language, or other random sounds. So, if your brain is busy processing emotions,
lyrics, and now there’s these new other neurons firing, how much attention is left
to remember SOH CAH TOA? Remember that gem from seventh grade algebra? ...I'm old. Science says...it depends. A 2010 study found that music may impair cognitive
abilities if you’re trying to memorize a specific order; it could be thrown off by
a key change, a lyrical choice, or Drake getting you deep down in your feelings. Even if you’re not distracted, a 2006 study
measured the effects of tempo on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Slow, meditative music can get us to relax,
slowing both your heart rate and breathing but this study found that we’re the most
relaxed when there’s a wait for it... ...pause. See what I did there? So, silence wins? Well, if your goal is complete zen relaxation
while you write that final, then, yeah, try silence. But again, this all depends on a lot of variables:
lyrics, tempo, and genre have all been shown to have various effects on focus, mood, and
productivity. But if you have to listen to that Randy Newman
to get those reports in, more power to you. If you have a work or study playlist,
go for it! Verdict: do you! If you’ll excuse me, I have to go listen
to some Celine Dion, because I love Titanic. ♩ Near, far, where--- later, later. Yo, what's good -- thanks for watching Seeker. Be sure to subscribe. I'm watching you. Subscribe. And since we talked about how silence and music affects your brain, what about ASMR? If that really gives you the tingles, be sure to check out this episode right here for everything scientists know about it. If you've got two cents 
and you don't know where to put it, leave 'em in the comments below. And, as always, thank you for watching.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a completely different topic, involving secret agents and control panels, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the effects of noise pollution on the body.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar in terms of having multiple options that could potentially be correct, similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, please note that this is a very weak match and the question content is completely different.

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a completely different topic, involving secret agents and control panels, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the topic of silence and its effect on neurogenesis in mice.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose an index, I would say -1 or "None" as an answer, but since you want a numerical index, I will choose the smallest possible index:

**Transcript**:
As a writer, comedian, researcher, and DJ,
I have to have music to focus. But I have friends who need *complete silence*
to study, write, or be productive. So which one’s better for our brain and our body? Let’s start by finding out what noise, the
opposite of silence, does to our bodies. Studies were conducted by the World Health
Organization that linked noise pollution, like loud city sounds, with higher blood pressure
and a higher chance for a fatal heart attack. All right, don’t panic, that neighbor playing
Migos at 4 a.m. isn’t going to kill you, but prolonged exposure to a noisy environment
can lead to cognitive deficits as well. Studies have shown that students in schools
near airports and train stations have suffered negative effects on long-term memory and reading
comprehension, leading some cities to require soundproofing in schools. 
So, noise may not kill you, but it increases your stress levels, 
which is no bueno for your brain long-term. Are you hearing this, construction workers
who have to fix my sidewalk at 6 a.m.? Yeah, I'm comin' for y'all. Silence, on the other hand, has been correlated
with lower stress hormones. Also, studies done on mice in 2013 found that
those exposed to silence over white noise, or even Mozart, expressed higher rates of
neurogenesis, or the production of neurons, in the hippocampus, the part of the brain
that processes memory. Further studies found more evidence that the
brain is processing and evaluating new information faster in times of silence over sound. So, less stress, new neurons, new synaptic
connections and memory formation? Sounds good for productivity. I know what you’re thinking: “but I do
my best work when listening to Evanescence!” Me too. I love "Bring Me To Life." But be patient, we’re getting there! Music permeates all parts of the brain; not
just the temporal lobe or the auditory cortices. If the song slaps (or if it’s trash), it’ll
activate your amygdala and parts of your limbic system 
responsible for emotional response. What’s more, both music and language are
auditorily processed; both are forms of communication, and I don’t know about y’all, but I consider
music like a language. I mean, have you SEEN sheet music? 
That's from a different alien race. New research shows that there may be neurons
in the auditory cortex that activate specifically for music; 
not language, or other random sounds. So, if your brain is busy processing emotions,
lyrics, and now there’s these new other neurons firing, how much attention is left
to remember SOH CAH TOA? Remember that gem from seventh grade algebra? ...I'm old. Science says...it depends. A 2010 study found that music may impair cognitive
abilities if you’re trying to memorize a specific order; it could be thrown off by
a key change, a lyrical choice, or Drake getting you deep down in your feelings. Even if you’re not distracted, a 2006 study
measured the effects of tempo on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Slow, meditative music can get us to relax,
slowing both your heart rate and breathing but this study found that we’re the most
relaxed when there’s a wait for it... ...pause. See what I did there? So, silence wins? Well, if your goal is complete zen relaxation
while you write that final, then, yeah, try silence. But again, this all depends on a lot of variables:
lyrics, tempo, and genre have all been shown to have various effects on focus, mood, and
productivity. But if you have to listen to that Randy Newman
to get those reports in, more power to you. If you have a work or study playlist,
go for it! Verdict: do you! If you’ll excuse me, I have to go listen
to some Celine Dion, because I love Titanic. ♩ Near, far, where--- later, later. Yo, what's good -- thanks for watching Seeker. Be sure to subscribe. I'm watching you. Subscribe.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I will provide the index of the least dissimilar generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the effect of music on cognitive abilities, specifically memorization. None of the generated MCQs are related to this topic. However, if I had to choose the least dissimilar one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar.

But if I really had to choose, I would say that Question 4 is the least dissimilar, but only because it has a condition in the options, and the ground truth MCQ has a condition in the question. However, the topics and content are completely unrelated.

So, my answer would be: None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The villainous Dr. Schrödinger 
has developed a growth ray and intends to create 
an army of giant cats to terrorize the city. Your team of secret agents has tracked him 
to his underground lab. You burst in to find… that it’s a trap! Dr. Schrödinger has slipped 
into the next room to activate his device and disabled the control
panel on the way out. Fortunately, your teammates are 
masters of spy-craft. Agent Delta has hacked 
into the control panel and managed to reactivate 
some of its functionality. Meanwhile, Agent Epsilon has
searched through surveillance to find the code for the door: 2, 10, 14. All you have to do is enter those numbers 
and you’ll be free. But there’s a problem. The control panel has only three buttons: one which adds 5 to the display number, one which adds 7, and one which takes the square root. You need to make the display output
the numbers 2, 10, and 14, 
in that order. It’s okay if it outputs different 
numbers in between, but there’s no way to reset the display, so once you get to 2, you’ll have to continue 
on to 10 and 14 from there. Not only that, Agent Delta explains that there are other traps 
built into the panel. If it ever shows the same number 
more than once, a number greater than 60, or a non-whole number, the room will explode. Right now, the display reads zero, 
and time is running out. There’s only one way to solve the puzzle,
with a few small variations. How will you input the code to escape 
from Dr. Schrödinger’s lair and save the day? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 2 1. You look over your options. Adding 5 or 7 increases the number, and the square root button 
will make it smaller. But there are only a few options 
where you can use that button: 4 9 16 25, 36, and 49. You’d love to make 4 or 16. Then you could hit the square root button 
once or twice to get 2. But you can’t make either with 
just the 5 and 7 buttons. What will you do? You look at the other possible options for
numbers you could take the square root of. Nine you can’t reach. Twenty-five and 49 would take you back to 
5 or 7, and you can already get to each
of those. Thirty-six is your only option. You add 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, and then hit the square root button. Why that series of 5s and 7s? It’s somewhat arbitrary, but you know that you want 
to avoid 10, 14, and perfect squares, since you’ll need them later. This gets you to 6. Does that help? Looking at your options,
you see that 16 is now in your sights. You add 5 twice more to reach it. Then hit square root twice. That gets you to 2. You’re on your way! Now to 10. You can’t get straight 
there through addition alone, so you’re going to have 
to reach another square. Taking the square root of 9 or 25 would 
get you to a good place, but it turns out that 25 
is unreachable from 2. So you add 7 to get to 9, then take the square root again. That gets you to 3. Adding 7 again makes 10. Finally, you need to reach 14. Thinking backwards, you imagine where 
you could be before 14: 7 or 9. But 9 won’t work because 
you’ve already used 9. However, you could get to 7 
by reaching 49 first. You add your way towards it, being careful not to hit any 
of the numbers you’ve hit so far. You thread your way carefully, adding five 5s and two 7s. Then, square root to 7, and add 7 more. The door opens, 
and you’re out of the trap. Thanks to your problem-solving skills, your team gets Schrödinger’s cats out 
of the box in the nick of time. As for Schrödinger, 
you can be certain of one thing: he’ll be spending quite some
time in a box of his own.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
The villainous Dr. Schrödinger 
has developed a growth ray and intends to create 
an army of giant cats to terrorize the city. Your team of secret agents has tracked him 
to his underground lab. You burst in to find… that it’s a trap! Dr. Schrödinger has slipped 
into the next room to activate his device and disabled the control
panel on the way out. Fortunately, your teammates are 
masters of spy-craft. Agent Delta has hacked 
into the control panel and managed to reactivate 
some of its functionality. Meanwhile, Agent Epsilon has
searched through surveillance to find the code for the door: 2, 10, 14. All you have to do is enter those numbers 
and you’ll be free. But there’s a problem. The control panel has only three buttons: one which adds 5 to the display number, one which adds 7, and one which takes the square root. You need to make the display output
the numbers 2, 10, and 14, 
in that order. It’s okay if it outputs different 
numbers in between, but there’s no way to reset the display, so once you get to 2, you’ll have to continue 
on to 10 and 14 from there. Not only that, Agent Delta explains that there are other traps 
built into the panel. If it ever shows the same number 
more than once, a number greater than 60, or a non-whole number, the room will explode. Right now, the display reads zero, 
and time is running out. There’s only one way to solve the puzzle,
with a few small variations. How will you input the code to escape 
from Dr. Schrödinger’s lair and save the day? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 2 1. You look over your options. Adding 5 or 7 increases the number, and the square root button 
will make it smaller. But there are only a few options 
where you can use that button: 4 9 16 25, 36, and 49. You’d love to make 4 or 16. Then you could hit the square root button 
once or twice to get 2. But you can’t make either with 
just the 5 and 7 buttons. What will you do? You look at the other possible options for
numbers you could take the square root of. Nine you can’t reach. Twenty-five and 49 would take you back to 
5 or 7, and you can already get to each
of those. Thirty-six is your only option. You add 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, and then hit the square root button. Why that series of 5s and 7s? It’s somewhat arbitrary, but you know that you want 
to avoid 10, 14, and perfect squares, since you’ll need them later. This gets you to 6. Does that help? Looking at your options,
you see that 16 is now in your sights. You add 5 twice more to reach it. Then hit square root twice. That gets you to 2. You’re on your way! Now to 10. You can’t get straight 
there through addition alone, so you’re going to have 
to reach another square. Taking the square root of 9 or 25 would 
get you to a good place, but it turns out that 25 
is unreachable from 2. So you add 7 to get to 9, then take the square root again. That gets you to 3. Adding 7 again makes 10. Finally, you need to reach 14. Thinking backwards, you imagine where 
you could be before 14: 7 or 9. But 9 won’t work because 
you’ve already used 9. However, you could get to 7 
by reaching 49 first. You add your way towards it, being careful not to hit any 
of the numbers you’ve hit so far. You thread your way carefully, adding five 5s and two 7s. Then, square root to 7, and add 7 more. The door opens, 
and you’re out of the trap. Thanks to your problem-solving skills, your team gets Schrödinger’s cats out 
of the box in the nick of time. As for Schrödinger, 
you can be certain of one thing: he’ll be spending quite some
time in a box of his own.

is unreachable from 2. So you add 7 to get to 9, then take the square root again. That gets you to 3. Adding 7 again makes 10. Finally, you need to reach 14. Thinking backwards, you imagine where 
you could be before 14: 7 or 9. But 9 won’t work because 
you’ve already used 9. However, you could get to 7 
by reaching 49 first. You add your way towards it, being careful not to hit any 
of the numbers you’ve hit so far. You thread your way carefully, adding five 5s and two 7s. Then, square root to 7, and add 7 more. The door opens, 
and you’re out of the trap. Thanks to your problem-solving skills, your team gets Schrödinger’s cats out 
of the box in the nick of time. As for Schrödinger, 
you can be certain of one thing: he’ll be spending quite some
time in a box of his own.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Do you think you got the best start in life? Did you end-up in a school that might have
resembled a zoo more than it felt like an institution of higher learning? Perhaps in the past, getting by without a
lot of pieces of paper to defend your intelligence may have been harder, given that nowadays
we can learn so much online and that many of the world’s leading and richest entrepreneurs
dropped out of university. Had they have dropped out of high school,
that could have been a different matter, but many great minds have not been too keen on
school. One of those minds was Albert Einstein, who
famously said, “Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned
in school.” So does it matter where you go? That’s what we’ll find out today, in this
episode of the Infographics Show, Private School vs. Public School. Don’t forget to subscribe and click the
bell button so that you can be part of our Notification Squad. First of all, we should say that by “public
school” we mean schools that are run by the government. This could be confusing for Brits as when
they say public school, they are not thinking of schools run by the public sector, but selective
institutions that demand private payment. Basically, private school as Americans know
it, is public school in the UK. It’s another case of that “my tom-ate-o”
and your “tom-art-o”. We’ll base this show on the U.S. today,
as covering the globe’s schools would be impossible, and some of the things we will
discuss are relevant globally. You might be surprised to know that in the
USA, according to the Council for American Private Education, there are 33,619 private
schools in the United States. There are around 5.1 million students enrolled
in these schools. It’s said that private schools are home
to almost 10 percent of all school students in the U.S. The same source states that there are 441,496
teachers working full-time in private schools. As much as 79 percent of these schools have
a religious affiliation. The Washington Post reported in 2016 that
these schools are “virtually all-white”, with non-white students only making up around
10 percent of students across the country. As for public schools, according to the National
Center for Educational Statistics, 50.7 million public school students will be studying in
one of them from prekindergarten to grade 12 in fall 2017. Teaching all those kids will be 3.2 million
full-time teachers, which is a ratio of 16 students for every teacher. The ratio in private school is 12 students
for one teacher. One of the main differences of public school
is the mixed ethnicity of students. Public schools in America are made up of 24.4
million white kids, 13.6 million Hispanic students, 8.0 million black students, 2.8
million Asian/Pacific Islander students, 0.5 million American Indian/Alaska Native students,
and 1.5 million mixed race students. What about costs? Well, the government pays for public schools. In 2017-18 it’s projected that the budget
for public schools will be $623.5 billion. This means that each student will cost on
average $12,300. Taxes will pay for this. Private schools are a different matter, and
they are funded by tuition fees. Tuition costs will change depending on the
school. For the year 2017-18, the national average
for private school tuition is $9,975 per year, which is $8,918 per year for elementary schooling
and $13,524 per year for high school. The state of Vermont had the highest average,
with high school being $31,543 per year on average. If you are looking for cheap private schooling,
head to West Virginia where the average cost for high school is currently $5,262. We should add that a handful of private schools
cost around the $50,000 a year mark. So, what do you get for your money besides
pretty gardens and obviously top-notch facilities at a private school, and perhaps metal detectors
and patrolling policemen in some wayward public schools? Well, when it comes to the syllabi, public
schools have to adhere to state standards while private schools have much more flexibility. This is seen as getting a better and more
diverse education. The good news for not so wealthy people is
that high school graduation rates in public schools has gone up recently. It reached its highest during the Obama administration
in 2015 at 83.2 percent of students graduating. At the same time, 95 percent of private school
students graduate. According to the website College Admission,
just about all of those private school grads will attend a university, whereas only 49
percent of public school graduates will enter further education at college. If you want to get into an Ivy League University,
there’s no reason why you can’t get in after attending public school. Top Tier Admissions tells us that roughly
25 percent of successful applicants to those top universities came from private schools,
and 60-70 percent from public schools. The rest were homeschooled. Private school does work for a lot of people. The richest man in the world, Bill Gates,
went to a private prep school…but then he later dropped out of Harvard. On the other hand, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg
went to a public school. When researching for how private school graduates
out earn other kids in the future, most of the stories are about the UK and how private
(or public) school there seems to create most of the UK’s millionaires. The U.S. playing field might be a bit more
level, after all, Dr. Dre didn’t go to private school. It seems in the U.S. if you actually get to
university, it might not matter where you studied in high school in terms of “making
it”. At the same time, studies have found that
being born with a silver spoon usually means you’ll be passing that spoon on, and poorer
folks with degrees don’t usually jump up a class. Your background makes all the difference. A college degree, says one report, is no great
equalizer. Why is this? “There are a host of possibilities, from
family resources during childhood and the place where one grew up, to the colleges that
low-income students attend,” said the report. Then you have rich folks that dropped out
of high school, such as the billionaire Tumblr founder David Karp, who dropped out of high
school at 15 years old. Joining him as a high school dropout is Facebook’s
former product manager Mike Hudack and filmmaker Quentin Tarantino. In light of the last person, success in the
arts or sport probably is not related to if you went to public or private school, but
if you want “social mobility” then it’s probably better your parents paid the cash
for your education. It also seems that the filmmaker is the only
one of the three to have come from a humble background. You may have some unique skills, or be a natural
autodidact (learn by yourself), and so school doesn’t matter much even if you are poor. Nonetheless, we can’t ignore some statistics. The Bureau of Labor Statistics states that
people without a high school diploma will earn on average $25,636 per year if in full-time
employment. 8 percent of high school dropouts are currently
unemployed. If you have a high school diploma and nothing
else, the average wage is $35,256 per year with 5.4 percent of those people currently
unemployed. If you have a bachelor’s degree, you might
earn an average of $59,124 per year. Only 2.8 percent of Americans with a bachelor’s
degree are unemployed, much less than the 4.4 percent of Americans currently out of
a job. In conclusion, it’s odds on that if you
went to private school then you most certainly went to university, and with some family wealth
behind you, it’s also pretty much a certainty you fell into one of these higher wage brackets. Then again, if you are brilliant, or spend
more time reading than scrolling, then it is likely nothing will hold you back. So, what do you think...is private school
worth the extra dough, or is it all just a bunch of hoo-ey? Let us know in the comments! Also, be sure to check out our other video

**Transcript**:
Honey. You’ve met honey. It’s that sticky, sweet stuff. Basically just slightly liquidy sugar in a
plastic bear bottle, right? Wrong! Honey is a supercharged bacteria-killing powerhouse. And it’s all down to what those hardworking
bees put into it, from immune proteins to the sugar itself. Since ancient times, honey has been used to
prevent wounds from getting infected. And these days, we use purified and standardized
versions of honey to fight infections in hospitals. Honey has three main tricks for fighting bacteria. The first is all that sugar. Honey is only about 17% water. Most--but not all--of what remains is sugar. The two main types of sugar in honey are glucose
and fructose. Like all sugars, glucose and fructose are
sticky -- they attract water. Honey is technically a supersaturated solution,
meaning it contains more sugar than would normally dissolve at that temperature. That’s why it eventually gets all crystally
in the pantry -- over time, the sugar comes out of the solution. Chemically speaking, it’s desperate for
water. Water can travel across cell membranes from
where there’s a higher concentration of water to where there’s a lower concentration. And there’s a higher concentration of water
in a bacterium than in honey. Which means that honey will suck the juices
right out of any bacterium -- or mold, or fungus -- that tries to set up shop. Plus, there’s isn’t enough water in honey
for any microorganisms to live on. So they die, and the honey doesn’t spoil. The second thing, is that when bees make honey,
they throw in an enzyme called glucose oxidase. And bacteria hate glucose oxidase because
it produces two different compounds. It converts glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen
peroxide. Gluconic acid is, you guessed it, an acid. It gives honey a pH value of less than 4. That’s about a thousand times more acidic
than the neutral pH of 7 that most bacteria need to grow. And hydrogen peroxide is very good at killing
cells. It destroys the cell walls of bacteria, which
breaks them apart. Glucose oxidase isn’t active in ripe honey--there’s
not enough water for it to work properly. It seems to be there to keep the honey from
spoiling while the bees are drying it out. But if you dilute honey, the glucose oxidase
will switch back on and make gluconic acid again. The final thing bees do to make honey antibacterial? They put antibiotics in it. Some types of honey contain a protein called
bee defensin-1, which is exactly what it sounds like. Bee defensin-1 defends bees. It’s part of their immune system and protects
them from certain bacteria, including ones that could cause nasty diseases inside the
hive. It’s produced in a gland that bees use to
make honey, so it makes sense that some of it would make it into the finished product. And while scientists aren’t sure how much
of the protein is really in honey, it sort of makes sense that bees would use it to protect
their food. Another antibacterial compound sometimes found
in honey is methylglyoxal. Methylglyoxal is a small organic molecule
that forms in honey from a compound in the nectar of certain flowers. There’s an especially large amount of methylglyoxal
in manuka honey, a honey made from a New Zealand flower. This honey is so good at killing bacteria
that it’s actually used in hospitals. There’s one bacterium that has honey’s
number--but only sort of. It’s the type of bacteria that that causes
botulism. The bacteria start out as spores, which are
very hard to kill. They’re already dried out, so honey’s
water-sucking properties don’t kill them, and because the spores aren’t growing, they
aren’t affected by the acidity or the antibiotic compounds. The really dangerous part of the bacteria
is the botulinum toxin they produce when they grow into mature bacteria. Less than a hundred nanograms -- that’s
billionths of a gram -- is enough to kill an adult. About 10% of honeys have some botulinum spores
in them. But since the spores in honey aren’t growing
and making toxin, they’re harmless to healthy adults. Our immune systems intercept the spores before
they can start growing inside of us. But the immune systems of infants aren’t
always able to kill those spores before they start growing. So, in rare cases, the bacteria can germinate
and start producing toxin. That’s why it’s not safe to give honey
to infants under one year old, but the rest of us don’t need to worry about it. So the next time you’re looking for something
sweet, go ahead -- eat some of bacteria’s worst enemy. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about bee defensin-1, a protein found in honey, and its properties, while the generated MCQs are about naked mole rats and their unique adaptations.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match. This question asks about a specific type of hemoglobin found in naked mole rats, which is similar to the ground truth MCQ that asks about a specific protein found in honey.

But please note that the content and intent of the two questions are completely different, and Question 5 is not a good match for the ground truth MCQ in terms of similarity.

**Transcript**:
What mammal has 
the social life of an insect, the cold-bloodedness of a reptile, and the metabolism of a plant? Bald and buck-toothed, naked mole rats 
may not be pretty, but they’re extraordinary. With a lifespan of 30 years, their peculiar traits have evolved 
over millions of years to make them uniquely suited 
to survive harsh conditions, especially long periods without oxygen. In the deserts of East Africa, 
naked mole rats feed on root vegetables. They dig for the roots with teeth that
can move independently, like chopsticks. But even with these special teeth, a single naked mole rat doesn’t stand 
a chance of finding enough food; the roots are large and
nutritious, but scattered far and wide. A large workforce has 
a much better chance, so naked mole rats live in colonies. Similar to ants, bees, and termites, 
they build giant nests. Housing up to 300 mole rats, these colonies feature complex 
underground tunnel systems, nest chambers, and community bathrooms. Also like insects, naked mole rats 
have a rigid social structure. The dominant female, the queen, and two to three males 
that she chooses, are the only naked mole rats 
in the colony who have babies. All the other naked mole rats, male and female, are either soldiers, who defend 
the colony from possible invaders, or workers. Teams of workers are dispatched 
to hunt for roots, and their harvest feeds the whole colony. Living in a colony helps naked mole rats 
find enough food, but when so many animals live in 
the same underground space, oxygen quickly runs out. Mammals need a lot of oxygen; we use it to make the energy 
that fuels everything from maintaining our body temperatures to our heartbeats to voluntary movements. Without oxygen, we quickly die. In fact, no other mammal could survive 
the oxygen depletion experienced in a naked mole rat colony. Naked mole rats can thrive in low oxygen in part because they’ve abandoned 
one of the body functions that requires the most oxygen: thermoregulation. Most mammals are warm-blooded, meaning they have to keep 
their body temperature consistent. Naked mole rats don’t get enough 
oxygen to do this. Instead, they’re the only mammals whose body temperature fluctuates 
with their environment, making them cold-blooded, like reptiles. They also have a special 
type of hemoglobin, the molecule in the blood 
that transports oxygen. Their hemoglobin is much stickier 
for oxygen than ours and can pick oxygen up 
even when it’s scarce. In response to a real oxygen emergency, naked mole rats enter 
a state of suspended animation. They stop moving, slow their breathing, and dramatically lower their heart rate. This greatly reduces the amount of energy,
and therefore oxygen, they need. At the same time, they begin 
to metabolize fructose, like a plant. Fructose is a sugar that can be used 
to make energy without burning oxygen. Usually, mammals metabolize 
a different sugar called glucose that makes more energy than fructose, but glucose only works 
when oxygen’s available. Human brain and heart cells have 
some cellular machinery to use fructose, but not nearly as much as naked mole rats. Naked mole rats are, in fact, the only
mammals known to have this ability. While we can hope humans won’t ever need to exclusively live 
in underground tunnels, there are many situations where 
we would benefit from needing less oxygen. During heart attacks 
and other medical emergencies, people often die or sustain debilitating 
organ damage from oxygen deprivation. Could we replicate the naked mole rat’s 
use of the fructose pathway for human health? It took millions of years of evolution 
to bring the behavior of an insect, the temperature regulation of a reptile, and the energy production of a plant together in one little mammal, but maybe, with enough study, we can replicate just a few 
of their wild adaptations.

in underground tunnels, there are many situations where 
we would benefit from needing less oxygen. During heart attacks 
and other medical emergencies, people often die or sustain debilitating 
organ damage from oxygen deprivation. Could we replicate the naked mole rat’s

**Transcript**:
What mammal has 
the social life of an insect, the cold-bloodedness of a reptile, and the metabolism of a plant? Bald and buck-toothed, naked mole rats 
may not be pretty, but they’re extraordinary. With a lifespan of 30 years, their peculiar traits have evolved 
over millions of years to make them uniquely suited 
to survive harsh conditions, especially long periods without oxygen. In the deserts of East Africa, 
naked mole rats feed on root vegetables. They dig for the roots with teeth that
can move independently, like chopsticks. But even with these special teeth, a single naked mole rat doesn’t stand 
a chance of finding enough food; the roots are large and
nutritious, but scattered far and wide. A large workforce has 
a much better chance, so naked mole rats live in colonies. Similar to ants, bees, and termites, 
they build giant nests. Housing up to 300 mole rats, these colonies feature complex 
underground tunnel systems, nest chambers, and community bathrooms. Also like insects, naked mole rats 
have a rigid social structure. The dominant female, the queen, and two to three males 
that she chooses, are the only naked mole rats 
in the colony who have babies. All the other naked mole rats, male and female, are either soldiers, who defend 
the colony from possible invaders, or workers. Teams of workers are dispatched 
to hunt for roots, and their harvest feeds the whole colony. Living in a colony helps naked mole rats 
find enough food, but when so many animals live in 
the same underground space, oxygen quickly runs out. Mammals need a lot of oxygen; we use it to make the energy 
that fuels everything from maintaining our body temperatures to our heartbeats to voluntary movements. Without oxygen, we quickly die. In fact, no other mammal could survive 
the oxygen depletion experienced in a naked mole rat colony. Naked mole rats can thrive in low oxygen in part because they’ve abandoned 
one of the body functions that requires the most oxygen: thermoregulation. Most mammals are warm-blooded, meaning they have to keep 
their body temperature consistent. Naked mole rats don’t get enough 
oxygen to do this. Instead, they’re the only mammals whose body temperature fluctuates 
with their environment, making them cold-blooded, like reptiles. They also have a special 
type of hemoglobin, the molecule in the blood 
that transports oxygen. Their hemoglobin is much stickier 
for oxygen than ours and can pick oxygen up 
even when it’s scarce. In response to a real oxygen emergency, naked mole rats enter 
a state of suspended animation. They stop moving, slow their breathing, and dramatically lower their heart rate. This greatly reduces the amount of energy,
and therefore oxygen, they need. At the same time, they begin 
to metabolize fructose, like a plant. Fructose is a sugar that can be used 
to make energy without burning oxygen. Usually, mammals metabolize 
a different sugar called glucose that makes more energy than fructose, but glucose only works 
when oxygen’s available. Human brain and heart cells have 
some cellular machinery to use fructose, but not nearly as much as naked mole rats. Naked mole rats are, in fact, the only
mammals known to have this ability. While we can hope humans won’t ever need to exclusively live

**Transcript**:
Meet Dermatophagoides farinae. Crawling around on eight legs, this creature has no eyes to appreciate 
the kaleidoscope of colors around her. She relies on her extraordinary 
sense of smell to lead her to food 
and safe places to lay eggs. And she’s smaller than a pinhead. Dermatophagoides farinae is a dust mite. Less than a tenth the size of an ant, a dust mite’s whole world is contained 
in the dusty film under a bed or in a forgotten corner. This realm is right under our noses,
but from our perspective, the tiny specks of brilliant color 
blend together into a nondescript grey. What are these colorful 
microscopic particles? What distinguishes the dust in your
house from, say, sand on a beach is that it is a mixture 
of many different ingredients. It can contain grains of sand, dead skin cells, tiny hairs and threads, animal dander, pollen, manmade pollutants, minerals from outer space, and, of course, dust mites. Dust mites eat animal dander, human skin, and some fungi. We shed dead skin cells constantly, and wherever we live, 
they mix into the household dust. The same goes for our pets: their dander and hairs enter the mix, as do tiny pieces of thread and cotton
fibers from our clothes. These components make 
every household’s dust a unique blend of bits 
from its particular inhabitants. Household dust also contains substances 
that blow in from the wider world. Depending on the local geology, finely ground quartz, coal, 
or volcanic ash might enter the air as atmospheric dust, along with pollen and fungal spores. Industrial activities also contribute 
cement powder, particles from car tires, and other chemicals to the airborne mix. The combination of these elements 
can be as unique as a fingerprint. In Spain, where the land 
is rich in carbonate materials, dust contains 20 times as much calcium 
as dust in Nigeria, where the geology is quite different. After a particularly violent storm, scientists identified dust from 
the Sahara Desert thousands of miles away in London, based on its specific composition. In the future, we may be able to pinpoint the origins 
of dust samples even more specifically, down to a particular neighborhood 
or even house - something that may be 
of great help for forensic specialists. In addition to markers of humans, 
animals, and landscapes, dust also contains particles
from further afield. When a star explodes in a distant galaxy, super hot gases vaporize 
everything nearby. Then, the dust settles;
minerals condense out of the gas. Floating out there between planets 
and galaxies, this extraterrestrial dust contains 
tiny pieces of extinguished stars and the building blocks 
of future celestial bodies. Every year, tens of thousands 
of tons of cosmic dust lands on Earth and mingles 
with terrestrial minerals. This blend of chemicals, minerals, 
and intergalactic particles settles out of the air onto
surfaces in our homes, mixing with the detritus 
of each house’s occupants. Stars explode, mountains erode, and buildings, plants, and animals are all slowly but surely 
pulverized into fine grey powder. We’re all destined to become dust, but it’s also possible 
that we came from it. Interstellar dust has been found 
to carry organic compounds through space. It’s possible that 
billions of years ago, some of these cosmic particles 
were the seed of life on our little blue planet.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Meet Dermatophagoides farinae. Crawling around on eight legs, this creature has no eyes to appreciate 
the kaleidoscope of colors around her. She relies on her extraordinary 
sense of smell to lead her to food 
and safe places to lay eggs. And she’s smaller than a pinhead. Dermatophagoides farinae is a dust mite. Less than a tenth the size of an ant, a dust mite’s whole world is contained 
in the dusty film under a bed or in a forgotten corner. This realm is right under our noses,
but from our perspective, the tiny specks of brilliant color 
blend together into a nondescript grey. What are these colorful 
microscopic particles? What distinguishes the dust in your
house from, say, sand on a beach is that it is a mixture 
of many different ingredients. It can contain grains of sand, dead skin cells, tiny hairs and threads, animal dander, pollen, manmade pollutants, minerals from outer space, and, of course, dust mites. Dust mites eat animal dander, human skin, and some fungi. We shed dead skin cells constantly, and wherever we live, 
they mix into the household dust. The same goes for our pets: their dander and hairs enter the mix, as do tiny pieces of thread and cotton
fibers from our clothes. These components make 
every household’s dust a unique blend of bits 
from its particular inhabitants. Household dust also contains substances 
that blow in from the wider world. Depending on the local geology, finely ground quartz, coal, 
or volcanic ash might enter the air as atmospheric dust, along with pollen and fungal spores. Industrial activities also contribute 
cement powder, particles from car tires, and other chemicals to the airborne mix. The combination of these elements 
can be as unique as a fingerprint. In Spain, where the land 
is rich in carbonate materials, dust contains 20 times as much calcium 
as dust in Nigeria, where the geology is quite different. After a particularly violent storm, scientists identified dust from 
the Sahara Desert thousands of miles away in London, based on its specific composition. In the future, we may be able to pinpoint the origins 
of dust samples even more specifically, down to a particular neighborhood 
or even house - something that may be 
of great help for forensic specialists. In addition to markers of humans, 
animals, and landscapes, dust also contains particles
from further afield. When a star explodes in a distant galaxy, super hot gases vaporize 
everything nearby. Then, the dust settles;
minerals condense out of the gas. Floating out there between planets 
and galaxies, this extraterrestrial dust contains 
tiny pieces of extinguished stars and the building blocks 
of future celestial bodies. Every year, tens of thousands 
of tons of cosmic dust lands on Earth and mingles 
with terrestrial minerals. This blend of chemicals, minerals, 
and intergalactic particles settles out of the air onto
surfaces in our homes, mixing with the detritus 
of each house’s occupants. Stars explode, mountains erode, and buildings, plants, and animals are all slowly but surely 
pulverized into fine grey powder. We’re all destined to become dust, but it’s also possible 
that we came from it. Interstellar dust has been found 
to carry organic compounds through space. It’s possible that 
billions of years ago, some of these cosmic particles 
were the seed of life on our little blue planet.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Which of these statements is the most accurate?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After reviewing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about the amount of cosmic dust that lands on Earth annually, while the generated MCQs are about various topics such as speed records, athletes, and vehicles.

However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not contain a similar question to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ is related to the transcript provided, which discusses dust mites, household dust, and cosmic dust. The generated MCQs seem to be unrelated to the transcript.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ, and the index would be "None" or "Not Applicable". However, I can provide an answer in the required format:

**Transcript**:
Meet Dermatophagoides farinae. Crawling around on eight legs, this creature has no eyes to appreciate 
the kaleidoscope of colors around her. She relies on her extraordinary 
sense of smell to lead her to food 
and safe places to lay eggs. And she’s smaller than a pinhead. Dermatophagoides farinae is a dust mite. Less than a tenth the size of an ant, a dust mite’s whole world is contained 
in the dusty film under a bed or in a forgotten corner. This realm is right under our noses,
but from our perspective, the tiny specks of brilliant color 
blend together into a nondescript grey. What are these colorful 
microscopic particles? What distinguishes the dust in your
house from, say, sand on a beach is that it is a mixture 
of many different ingredients. It can contain grains of sand, dead skin cells, tiny hairs and threads, animal dander, pollen, manmade pollutants, minerals from outer space, and, of course, dust mites. Dust mites eat animal dander, human skin, and some fungi. We shed dead skin cells constantly, and wherever we live, 
they mix into the household dust. The same goes for our pets: their dander and hairs enter the mix, as do tiny pieces of thread and cotton
fibers from our clothes. These components make 
every household’s dust a unique blend of bits 
from its particular inhabitants. Household dust also contains substances 
that blow in from the wider world. Depending on the local geology, finely ground quartz, coal, 
or volcanic ash might enter the air as atmospheric dust, along with pollen and fungal spores. Industrial activities also contribute 
cement powder, particles from car tires, and other chemicals to the airborne mix. The combination of these elements 
can be as unique as a fingerprint. In Spain, where the land 
is rich in carbonate materials, dust contains 20 times as much calcium 
as dust in Nigeria, where the geology is quite different. After a particularly violent storm, scientists identified dust from 
the Sahara Desert thousands of miles away in London, based on its specific composition. In the future, we may be able to pinpoint the origins 
of dust samples even more specifically, down to a particular neighborhood 
or even house - something that may be 
of great help for forensic specialists. In addition to markers of humans, 
animals, and landscapes, dust also contains particles
from further afield. When a star explodes in a distant galaxy, super hot gases vaporize 
everything nearby. Then, the dust settles;
minerals condense out of the gas. Floating out there between planets 
and galaxies, this extraterrestrial dust contains 
tiny pieces of extinguished stars and the building blocks 
of future celestial bodies. Every year, tens of thousands 
of tons of cosmic dust lands on Earth and mingles 
with terrestrial minerals. This blend of chemicals, minerals, 
and intergalactic particles settles out of the air onto
surfaces in our homes, mixing with the detritus 
of each house’s occupants. Stars explode, mountains erode, and buildings, plants, and animals are all slowly but surely 
pulverized into fine grey powder. We’re all destined to become dust, but it’s also possible 
that we came from it. Interstellar dust has been found 
to carry organic compounds through space. It’s possible that 
billions of years ago, some of these cosmic particles 
were the seed of life on our little blue planet.

**Transcript**:
Two millennia before the likes of Usain Bolt
came onto the scene, humans were pitting their strength and speed against each other. It’s thought that the first Olympic games
were held in 776 BC in ancient Greece, and the tradition carried on under the Roman Empire. An Olympic Truce was even established by the
Greeks which was expected to be adhered to so people could spectate and compete in safety. The 4 year tradition, and in some ways the
truce, is upheld today, just with much stronger and faster people competing. The closest the ancients had to a vehicle
race was with chariots, and you could say that humanity has significantly improved when
it comes to speed on wheels. Today we are going to look at what speed humans
are capable of, in this episode of The Infographics Show, How Fast Can We Go? Don’t forget to subscribe and click the
bell button so that you can be part of our Notification Squad. We’ll start with our bodies. Maybe the best of the ancient runners was
Leonidas of Rhodes who won three stade, sprint races, (including the 200 yards and 400 yards)
in each of four consecutive Olympics from 164-152 BCE. The main event was the 200 yards (about 180
meters) which was the equivalent of the modern 100 meters. He was regarded as the Usain Bolt of today,
or the Michael Johnson of not so long ago, and was even winning races at the ripe old
age of 36. His medal tally was only beaten 2,168 years
later by swimmer Michael Phelps. No one knows of course how fast he ran, but
guesses range from 24-26 seconds for 180 meters. The fastest recorded 100 meters time is held
by Usain Bolt at 9.58 seconds, which means he was running at an average of 10.43 meters
per second or 23.34 mph (37.6 kph). It’s thought that at about 68 meters, he
hit his fastest speed, which was 12.34 meters per second or 27.61 mph (44.4 kph). This is about as fast as any human has ever
run, and it’s about the speed of a galloping horse. We can compare that to one of the earliest
recorded sprint records, that of American sprinter Tom Burke who won the 100 meters
at Athens in 1896 in a time of 12 seconds. While Bolt would be able to outrun a Velociraptor,
he would not be able to keep it up for long. The fastest recorded long distance time was
set by Kenyan Dennis Kimetto in 2014. His time for the marathon was 2 hours 2 minutes
and 57 seconds. This averaged at 4 minutes 41 seconds a mile. It’s thought a sub-2 hour marathon time
is on the way, which means running the entire 26.2 miles (42 kilometers) at 13.1 mph (21
kph). Try that at the gym on the treadmill for even
a few hundred meters and you’ll see just how incredible this man is. The average adult male jogs at about 8.3 mph
(13.3 kph), which is a 27 second 100 meters. Women jog at an average of 6.5 mph (10.4 kph)
or a 34 second 100 meters. It’s thought that even fit and healthy non-athlete
adults that can run very well will only average around 15.9 miles per hour (25.5 kph), which
would mean a 100 meter time of around 13-14 seconds. The average healthy human walks at around
3 miles per hour (4.8 kph). Let’s now have a look at swimming. It’s reported that almost half of the world’s
population can’t swim, including 44 percent of Americans according to the U.S. Red Cross. Although the report said some people believed
they could swim, but weren’t able to swim well enough to be adjudged safe in the water. The fastest person in the world, ever, is
Brazilian César Cielo. Much has been said about the great Michael
Phelps taking on a great white shark in a race, but in terms of raw speed he’s slower
than Cielo. His time of 46.91 seconds in the 100 meters
freestyle is the fastest a human has ever swum, giving him an average speed of about
5.3 mph (8.5 kph). That’s faster than the average jogging speed
of the average male. It’s thought Phelps’ average speed when
he won gold in the 100 meters freestyle relay was about 4.7 mph (7.5 mph). The two men are about the same speed as the
average cod, but both would get trounced in a race with a great white shark that can reach
speeds of 25 mph (40kph). The average human that can swim freestyle
is a speed of just 2 mph (3.2 kph). But how fast has a human ever travelled? That would be astronauts on NASA’s Apollo
10 mission when they reached a top speed of 24,791 mph (39,897 kph). Elon Musk’s SpaceX plans to colonize Mars,
and to get there they need a fair bit of power. The rocket which will be used is nicknamed
the BFS, and SpaceX says it will reach cruising speeds of 62,000 mph (99.77 thousand kph). British Royal Air Force fighter pilot Andy
Green holds the world land speed record, set in 1997. He got up to 763 mph (1,227 kph) in his Thrust
supersonic car in the Black Rock desert, USA. In 1898 a Frenchman broke the same land speed
record in his electric car, reaching a speed of 39.24 mph (63 kph). The fastest two wheels have ever gone is 394
mph (634 kph) with the TOP 1 Ack Attack ridden by Rocky Robinson at the Bonneville Speedway
in Utah. These machines are not built for the road,
however, but some road cars and bikes can reach impressive speeds. The Bugatti Veyron is listed as the world’s
fastest road car, able to reach speeds of 268 mph (431 kph) and the fastest thing on
two wheels on the road is the Kawasaki Ninja H2R. It can reach speeds of 249 mph (400 kph). The fastest person on a bicycle was Dutch
cyclist Fred Rompelberg, who travelled at a speed of 167 mph (268 kph) in 1995. As for rail, the winner for the fastest speed
is US air force colonel John Stapp, who reached 632 mph (1017 kph) on his rocket sled. Passenger trains don’t get anywhere near
that, but some are very fast. The French TVG has an average speed when taking
folks around France of about 200 mph (321 kph), but it also holds the record for the
fastest speed ever on a national rail system of 357 mph (574 kph). At that speed you could realistically commute
from Paris to offices in the UK, Germany, Spain, and other nations surrounding France. Japan’s magnetically levitated MLX01 maglev
has hit a speed of 361 mph (580 kph), but that was only in testing. Many countries are presently developing high-speed
trains as an alternative to air and road travel. You’d think the perfect country for such
a system would be the United States, given its size, population, and long distances its
citizens often travel. This is actually a matter of controversy,
as an article in Forbes points out in 2017. There are many reasons, and one is that the
U.S. as you’ll know from our other shows spends little on transportation compared to
its military. Andy Kunz, president of the U.S. High Speed Rail Association, once said in
an interview that lobbying efforts Spirit of Australiafrom oil, aviation and highway
companies were also blocking high-speed rail advancement. Perhaps Elon Musk’s Boring Company and its
underground Hyperloop project might happen before high-speed rail. On water the record was set by Australian
Ken Warby in his Spirit of Australia wooden speedboat, which reached 317.596 mph (511
kph) in 1978. It’s not a record many people try to break
as they often end up dead. Long-time British record holder Donald Campbell
was one of those people, and there were many more. Record holder Warby told Wired in an interview
after he retired, “When you look down that lake, you better have all your homework done,
because your chances are 50-50 – and you better be in the right 50 percent.” It might be safer to travel by ocean liner. The fastest was the SS United States, that
averaged a speed of 29 mph (62 kph). The Titanic was a good 8 mph slower. Finally, we take to the air. Surprisingly, the record set for a manned
aircraft was as far back as 1967. That was when a hypersonic rocket-powered
aircraft called the North American X-15 hit a speed of 4,520 mph (7,274 kph) with American
air force pilot William Knight at the controls. Passenger jets average a speed of 575 mph
(925 kph) but may reach up to about 745 mph (1198 kph). The fastest ever passenger plane was the British-French
made Concorde, which reached speeds of 1,354 mph (2,180 kph). A plane called the Baby Boom is set to beat
that speed in 2023, but it will be a much smaller machine. That’s the end of the show today. Why not tell us your fastest speed? Are you better than the average Joe? What’s the fastest you’ve ever travelled,
on land, in the water, in the air? Let us know in the comments! And if you liked this video, be sure to check

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic (nosebleeds) than the ground truth MCQ (Usain Bolt's running speed).

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar in terms of format, but not in terms of content or intent.

It would be best to generate new MCQs that are related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ (Usain Bolt's running speed) to get a more accurate match.

**Transcript**:
Hey there! Welcome to Life Noggin! If you’ve never had a nosebleed before,
the first one can be terrifying. Especially if you’re young when it happens and have
no idea what’s going on. All you know is that blood is leaking out of your face...for
no reason. But of course, now that you are older you
know that there is a reason your nose started to bleed...you were experiencing a condition
known as epistaxis. When this occurs, it can be one of two types: anterior or posterior.
More than likely, you’ll get an anterior nosebleed which is caused by irritation to
blood vessels in the nasal septum. That’s the part of your nose that separates
your two nostrils. And it’s also the part of your nose that can get deviated, which
can lead to difficulty breathing. And fun fact: it’s estimated that 80% of people
have some type of misalignment to their nasal septum. If I had a nose, I could attest to
that, but sadly my face is pretty featureless. As you can see. But a block can dream! Anyway, in the nasal septum is an area called
the Kiesselbach plexus, where four different arteries come together to form a network of
blood vessels. So, when this area is irritated by either a vigorous blow or a roaming finger,
some of the blood vessels may break. And then you get blood running down your face and possibly
down the back of your throat. But what about dry air? In the northern hemisphere,
winter is coming up and with it comes a lot of nosebleeds. The decreased humidity and
temperature prevent your nose from getting the moisture it needs. This then makes the
mucous membrane more susceptible to bleeding and...Voila! You’ve got blood leaking down
your nostril. The only thing more unappealing than that is saying the words “mucous membrane.” So how do you stop the blood? It’s recommended
that you pinch the soft part of your nose for ten minutes, making sure to keep the nostrils
closed. This pressure helps the blood to clot and stops the bleeding. Oh, and lean forward
during this because otherwise, as I previously mentioned, blood can leak down the back of
your throat. (Which you don't want.) However, if you are lucky enough to be near a doctor when you get a nosebleed,
if they can easily see the broken blood vessel, they may be able to cauterize, or seal, it
using silver nitrate. So do yourself a favor and keep all fingers
and foreign objects away from your nostrils. Your nose and future self will thank you. Have you ever had a nosebleed? Do you get them often?  If you're comfortable with sharing let us know in the comments or tell us what we should we talk about next. And if you want even more Life Noggin, check out this video we did on would happen if all cat suddenly died. Yeah! Oh and make sure you follow us on Facebook and Twitter As always my name is Blocko, this is been life noggin, don't forget to keep on thinking.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I will provide the index of the least dissimilar generated MCQ.

The least dissimilar generated MCQ is: None

However, if I had to choose, I would say that Question 8 is the least dissimilar, but only because it has a numerical value in one of its options, and it has 4 options like the ground truth MCQ. However, please note that this is a very weak match.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about percentages or statistics, like the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this criteria.

If you want a more accurate match, I would suggest generating new MCQs that are more similar in content and intent to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You’ve been chosen as a champion 
to represent your wizarding house in a deadly duel against
two rival magic schools. Your opponents are fearsome. From the Newt-niz school, a powerful sorcerer wields a wand
that can turn people into fish, but his spell only works 70% of the time. And from the Leib-ton school, an even more powerful enchantress wields 
a wand that turns people to statues, and it works 90% of the time. Lots are drawn, and you’re chosen 
to cast the first spell in the duel. The Newt-niz magician will go second, and the Leib-ton enchantress third, after which you’ll repeat casting in
that order until only one of you is left. The rules of magic duels are strict, and anyone who casts out of
order immediately forfeits the duel. Also, to prevent draws, the rules stipulate that 
if everyone’s still standing at the end of the first round, you’ll all be turned into cats. Now, you must choose a wand. Your wizarding house presents you 
with three options: the Bannekar, which binds 
one target with vines and casts effectively 60% of the time, the Gaussian, 
which turns one target into a tree and works 80% of the time, and the incredibly rare Noether 9000, which banishes one target 
to a distant mountaintop and casts perfectly 100% of the time. Your opponents are masters of strategy, 
as well as sorcery, and you know they’ll make the choices that
maximize their own chances of success. Which wand should you choose and what strategy should you employ to have the greatest chance 
of winning the duel? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You reach for the Noether 9000 first. After all, it makes sense to enter 
the duel with the most powerful wand. But before you pick it up, you consider 
what would happen. As the most dangerous wizard, you’d also be the target 
of the other two magicians, and you’d need to take 
care of the most dangerous of them first. But afterward, there’s a 70% chance you'd
be struck down by the remaining wizard. That’s trouble. Maybe it’s better to take the Gaussian. It works 80% of the time, which means you wouldn’t be a target
until the enchantress was incapacitated. But if you succeeded in transforming her, you’d probably be turned 
into a fish immediately after. If you transformed the sorcerer, the enchantress would almost 
certainly turn you to stone. It would really be better if you missed. And that’s when you have an idea: what if you took the Gaussian, 
then missed on purpose? Then, you would wait for the sorcerer 
to attack the enchantress, and you’d have an 80% chance 
of winning against the sorcerer. It’s a good idea, but there’s a problem; the sorcerer could also pass his turn and the enchantress, knowing that
she couldn’t pass without becoming a cat, would cast her spell on one of you. And since you’re the most dangerous 
between you and the sorcerer, you’d be the target. And that’s when you see 
what you really need to do: take the weakest wand, the Bannekar,
and miss on purpose. Now the sorcerer knows that 
he’ll be targeted by the enchantress and he’ll have to try to turn her into 
a fish to avoid being turned into stone. Seventy percent of the time he’d succeed and you’d have a 60% chance 
of winning the duel at the beginning of the next round. If he fails, chances are he’ll be 
turned to stone and you’d still have a 60% chance of
winning the duel against the enchantress. There’s a slim 3% chance 
you’ll all be turned into cats, but when everything’s accounted for, you have better than even odds 
of winning with this strategy. And that’s the best you can do. Here’s what the probability of winning 
for the different strategies looks like. Who would’ve thought 
that the best way to take your shot would be to throw away your shot?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Which of these statements is not the same as saying a wand works 80% of the time?
Options: A. It works 3 out of every 5 times, B. It works 16 out of every 20 times, C. It works 80 out of every 100 times, D. It works 8 out of every 10 times

**Transcript**:
You’ve been chosen as a champion 
to represent your wizarding house in a deadly duel against
two rival magic schools. Your opponents are fearsome. From the Newt-niz school, a powerful sorcerer wields a wand
that can turn people into fish, but his spell only works 70% of the time. And from the Leib-ton school, an even more powerful enchantress wields 
a wand that turns people to statues, and it works 90% of the time. Lots are drawn, and you’re chosen 
to cast the first spell in the duel. The Newt-niz magician will go second, and the Leib-ton enchantress third, after which you’ll repeat casting in
that order until only one of you is left. The rules of magic duels are strict, and anyone who casts out of
order immediately forfeits the duel. Also, to prevent draws, the rules stipulate that 
if everyone’s still standing at the end of the first round, you’ll all be turned into cats. Now, you must choose a wand. Your wizarding house presents you 
with three options: the Bannekar, which binds 
one target with vines and casts effectively 60% of the time, the Gaussian, 
which turns one target into a tree and works 80% of the time, and the incredibly rare Noether 9000, which banishes one target 
to a distant mountaintop and casts perfectly 100% of the time. Your opponents are masters of strategy, 
as well as sorcery, and you know they’ll make the choices that
maximize their own chances of success. Which wand should you choose and what strategy should you employ to have the greatest chance 
of winning the duel? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You reach for the Noether 9000 first. After all, it makes sense to enter 
the duel with the most powerful wand. But before you pick it up, you consider 
what would happen. As the most dangerous wizard, you’d also be the target 
of the other two magicians, and you’d need to take 
care of the most dangerous of them first. But afterward, there’s a 70% chance you'd
be struck down by the remaining wizard. That’s trouble. Maybe it’s better to take the Gaussian. It works 80% of the time, which means you wouldn’t be a target
until the enchantress was incapacitated. But if you succeeded in transforming her, you’d probably be turned 
into a fish immediately after. If you transformed the sorcerer, the enchantress would almost 
certainly turn you to stone. It would really be better if you missed. And that’s when you have an idea: what if you took the Gaussian, 
then missed on purpose? Then, you would wait for the sorcerer 
to attack the enchantress, and you’d have an 80% chance 
of winning against the sorcerer. It’s a good idea, but there’s a problem; the sorcerer could also pass his turn and the enchantress, knowing that
she couldn’t pass without becoming a cat, would cast her spell on one of you. And since you’re the most dangerous 
between you and the sorcerer, you’d be the target. And that’s when you see 
what you really need to do: take the weakest wand, the Bannekar,
and miss on purpose. Now the sorcerer knows that 
he’ll be targeted by the enchantress and he’ll have to try to turn her into 
a fish to avoid being turned into stone. Seventy percent of the time he’d succeed and you’d have a 60% chance 
of winning the duel at the beginning of the next round. If he fails, chances are he’ll be 
turned to stone and you’d still have a 60% chance of
winning the duel against the enchantress. There’s a slim 3% chance 
you’ll all be turned into cats, but when everything’s accounted for, you have better than even odds 
of winning with this strategy. And that’s the best you can do. Here’s what the probability of winning 
for the different strategies looks like. Who would’ve thought 
that the best way to take your shot would be to throw away your shot?

**Transcript**:
You probably know the drill: You’re handed
an exam, and you’re told you need to fill out the bubbles completely, and then reminded
that -- for reasons that no one ever explains -- you can only use a number 2 pencil! Now, unless you’re an artist, you’ve probably
never even seen a pencil that’s not number 2, also known as an HB pencil outside the
U.S. The thing is, if you used any other kind of
pencil when you took an automatically-scored test, you’d probably be fine. However there are reasons that test instructions
still tell you to stick to number 2. And they have a lot to do with how machines
score your tests -- or at least, how they used to. In 1931, a high school physics teacher named
Reynold Johnson was grading exams when he wondered if there might be a way to score
them without actually having to go through every single answer by hand. He knew that graphite, the writing material
in pencils, was electrically conductive. It’s made of flat sheets of carbon, and
its outer electrons are relatively free to move around within the material. So Johnson devised a machine with many small
electrical circuits that would pass over an answer sheet. If there was a pencil mark on the sheet, it
would conduct electricity through one of the circuits, and the machine could record it
as an answer. Eventually, he sold the idea to IBM, which
produced the first mark-sensing machines. But the number 2 thing didn’t become an
issue until the next generation of machines were introduced in the 1960s and 70s. Those machines had light-sensing devices called
phototubes, and if they did not detect light in a certain spot, they recorded it as an
answer. That made graphite especially useful, because
it’s better at blocking light than many inks. Graphite reflects most light -- that’s why
pencil marks are so shiny -- and absorbs the rest, which is why it’s black. But for a long time, these optical mark-sensing
machines were very picky. And that’s where the different grades of
pencil came in. The graphite in pencils is held together by
clay, so manufacturers can control how soft or hard it is, and also how dark it is. The softer the graphite, the darker the pencil’s
mark. Pencils are labeled accordingly. In the United States, those labels are numbers. International manufacturers use a different
system, with HB corresponding to number 2. Number 2 pencils make marks that are just
dark enough to be sensed by the machine, but also light enough to be erased without leaving
a readable mark. These days, scoring machines use much more
advanced sensors that can detect almost any sort of marks you make, as long as they’re
in the bubbles. So you could probably take your next exam
with any kind of pencil you wanted. But your SATs probably aren’t the time to
test that hypothesis. Maybe bring a couple of number 2’s just
to be safe. Thanks for asking, and thanks especially to

**Transcript**:
You probably know the drill: You’re handed
an exam, and you’re told you need to fill out the bubbles completely, and then reminded
that -- for reasons that no one ever explains -- you can only use a number 2 pencil! Now, unless you’re an artist, you’ve probably
never even seen a pencil that’s not number 2, also known as an HB pencil outside the
U.S. The thing is, if you used any other kind of
pencil when you took an automatically-scored test, you’d probably be fine. However there are reasons that test instructions
still tell you to stick to number 2. And they have a lot to do with how machines
score your tests -- or at least, how they used to. In 1931, a high school physics teacher named
Reynold Johnson was grading exams when he wondered if there might be a way to score
them without actually having to go through every single answer by hand. He knew that graphite, the writing material
in pencils, was electrically conductive. It’s made of flat sheets of carbon, and
its outer electrons are relatively free to move around within the material. So Johnson devised a machine with many small
electrical circuits that would pass over an answer sheet. If there was a pencil mark on the sheet, it
would conduct electricity through one of the circuits, and the machine could record it
as an answer. Eventually, he sold the idea to IBM, which
produced the first mark-sensing machines. But the number 2 thing didn’t become an
issue until the next generation of machines were introduced in the 1960s and 70s. Those machines had light-sensing devices called
phototubes, and if they did not detect light in a certain spot, they recorded it as an
answer. That made graphite especially useful, because
it’s better at blocking light than many inks. Graphite reflects most light -- that’s why
pencil marks are so shiny -- and absorbs the rest, which is why it’s black. But for a long time, these optical mark-sensing
machines were very picky. And that’s where the different grades of
pencil came in. The graphite in pencils is held together by
clay, so manufacturers can control how soft or hard it is, and also how dark it is. The softer the graphite, the darker the pencil’s

**Transcript**:
One of the greatest and cruelest joys in the
world is tickling. I mean, who doesn't enjoy making somebody
laugh? Especially when they can't help but laugh. But when you think about it, tickling -- that's
just a weird thing. What is that? Why does it exist? The word "tickling" is actually an umbrella
term for two different phenomena. The first we're going to talk about is knismesis. That's the kind of itchy feeling that you
get when somebody puts a feather on your sensitive skin and it's like gnaaaah. That sensation creates a desire to, like,
rub or scratch, but it doesn't cause you to laugh. That kind of tickling is called gargalesis,
which is caused by a harder touch or stroke that unleashes a confusing cocktail of pain
and pleasure into the brain. Now, knismesis makes sense. If an insect or spider crawls on your leg,
you feel a tickling sensation, and you, you get it off. Knismesis is widespread in mammals: a horse
whips its tail when a fly lands on its back, and a cat's ears twitch when you brush 'em. Gargalesis, on the other hand -- and I love
that word -- is only experienced by primates, which include humans. When you tickle a chimp, it lets out a noiseless
pant that is the evolutionary precursor to a human laugh. And all us primates are ticklish in the same
spots: The ribs, under the arms, under the chin, near the femoral artery in the leg...
these are all vulnerable areas of the body, leading some psychologists to theorize that
gargalesis is an evolutionary mechanism that young apes and humans use to teach each other
how to protect themselves if attacked, the equivalent of, like, puppies play-fighting. We instinctively curl away from a tickle. We kick and twist, but we also laugh and smile,
which is an encouraging facial expression which tells the tickler, "More! Please!" If tickling induced a negative facial expression,
the thinking goes, then people wouldn't do it to each other, and we wouldn't learn how
to defend ourselves. So the next time you attack your brother with
a storm of tickle-fingers, you can say, "Dude. I'm just teaching you life skills!" Thanks for asking this fascinating question. Who knew it would be so interesting? And thanks especially to our Subbable subscribers,

**Transcript**:
Thank you to brilliant dot org for supporting
PBS Digital Studios. Sherlock Holmes, the legendary detective,
had a theory that the brain is like an attic where a person can only store a limited amount
of memories. Dr. Watson once told him that the Earth travels
around the sun, duh, to which Holmes replied, “Now that I do know it I shall do my best
to forget it.” Holmes figured, clutter your attic with random
facts and trivia, and you won’t have room for the things that matter, like identifying
the tiny differences between lethal poisons. Was Holmes right? Is our memory limited, like the storage capacity
of a computer? Or is our memory unlimited? And if we did have perfect memory, what would
life be like if you never forgot anything? [OPEN] The animated film Inside Out depicted memories
as glowing spheres stacked in the brain, like books in a library. But the reality is a little more complicated. There is no one place in the brain that serves
as our memory bank. Instead, individual memories are scattered
all over the brain. Many brain cells, in several different regions,
work together to make one memory. For example, a memory of eating grandma’s
apple pie might involve some brain cells to help you remember what the pie looked like,
others to remember the smell of the cinnamon, and even cells to remember the delicious taste
– just to name a few. In reality, though, a memory isn’t a physical
thing that we can find in any given brain cell. It’s an action, not an object. Think of baseball fans doing “the wave”:
no single fan IS the wave, the magic only happens when all the fans are together, doing
their thing in a specific order. In the same way, a memory only happens when
many connected neurons fire in a specific pattern. And because the same cells can fire in many
unique patterns, one group of neurons can encode multiple memories. This increases the memory storage capacity
of the brain. Buried deep in the middle of the brain we
find a group of cells shaped like a seahorse, which is why 18th century scientists named
this bit the ‘hippocampus.’ Without your seahorse, you might never remember. We owe a lot of our understanding of memories
to one famous patient, known for years only by his initials, H.M. In 1953, H.M. underwent a surgery for epilepsy
which demolished most of his hippocampus, and for the rest of his life, he exhibited
a severe type of amnesia where he was unable to form new memories of facts or events, but,
he was still able to remember things he had learned before the surgery. This showed us that the hippocampus is a key
to making memories, but that it isn’t where memories are stored. So how do experiences become memories? If we look inside the brain of a mouse in
a maze, we could draw a kind of map, showing which brain cells
are active as the mouse experiences something [mouse in maze]. Later, we would see
the mouse's brain cells firing in the same patterns, replaying the experience in fast
forward, over and over, backwards and forwards, to make the connections
between cells stronger. This is called consolidation, and it’s how
animals - including humans - commit new memories to long-term storage. Days or weeks later, a smell might trigger
this same pattern of cells nerve firing in the mouse brain, a recall of the maze memories
- just like smelling cinnamon might trigger memories of grandma for you. But the brain’s way of creating memories
isn’t foolproof. Sometimes, our mental replay of something
we only imagined can feel as vivid as a real experience. If you picture all the sights, smells, and
sounds of a crime scene from someone’s description, you activate similar brain networks as if
you had really been there. The more you replay the scene in your mind,
the more it feels like a real memory. That’s why a detective who asks leading
questions can inadvertently plant a false memory in a witness. We’re able to remember a lot, but we forget
even more. Some forgetting just happens, but our brains
also forget on purpose. We have at least three different ways of forgetting. The first is what happens when a memory fades
over time, so-called “passive oblivescence” (a term you will probably forget). This may happen because the connections between
brain cells gradually weaken over time; or perhaps the memory is still there, but you
might lose the triggers–sights, sounds, smells–you need to retrieve it. Another idea says memories could theoretically
last forever, but when the same neurons get used in other memories, this “interference”
disrupts the original memory. This slow fade type of forgetting happens
to all of us, eventually. A second type of forgetting–targeted forgetting–happens
at night while we sleep. This is when we clear out random, useless
tidbits of information we’ve learned during the day and erase outdated memories. For example, if yesterday, you thought Earth
was, say, a flat disk supported by three elephants, and today you learned that the Earth is round,
your brain needs to purge one of these contradictory ideas - hopefully, the one about the elephants. In certain stages of sleep, we trim and prune
connections between cells and erase unneeded memory circuits. The third type of forgetting is motivated
forgetting, something we all wish we could do for one thing or another. This is when a person intentionally suppresses
unpleasant memories. Forgetting on purpose is a way to regulate
our emotions and to focus on what needs to be done in the present, instead of getting
lost in negative memories of the past. We may need motivated forgetting to maintain
our self-image, to maintain confidence, to stay optimistic about the future, or to be
able to maintain relationships with people who have hurt us. We don’t know exactly how motivated forgetting
happens, but part of our brain seems to step in and block the troubling memory from being
retrieved. So that even though it’s still somewhere
in our brain, eventually we can’t find it. Our brains have so many ways to forget because
forgetting is one of the most important things we do. Forgetting allows us to move past traumatic
life events. In fact, PTSD may be a problem where someone
simply remembers too much. Forgetting also allows us to clear out junk. Imagine every sight, sound, smell, and piece
of information your brain processes every day! If our brains didn’t sweep out the garbage
every night, we would soon overflow our neural networks with random useless trivia, just
like Sherlock Holmes predicted. We also wouldn’t be able to replace things
that are no longer true with better information and update our mental models of the world. Deep in the scientific literature we find
stories of a handful of people who NEVER forget anything. They are so rare that their unforgetfulness
has a medical name: hyperthymesia. The most famous case is Jill Price, an American
woman now in her fifties. Starting from age 14, Jill’s memory of her
life is nearly perfect. For any date in the past, she remembers what
she wore and had for lunch that day, key historical events that she paid attention to, and detailed
incidents from her life. She describes memories playing in her mind
in vivid detail like a video reel that has been enhanced with smells and emotions, whether
the events occurred yesterday or decades ago. This might sound like a blessing, especially
if you’re in school, but Jill has described being haunted by upsetting memories and by
regrets, because unlike the rest of us, she can clearly remember every choice she made
and how it turned out. There’s probably something you truly *want*
to forget, like that extremely embarrassing moment in high school that always seems to
pop up at the worst times. Can we erase those unwanted memories somehow? In an episode of House, MD, Dr. House treated
a patient suffering from painful memories by performing something called electroconvulsive
therapy: controlled electric shocks to the brain. People who undergo ECT do lose some memories
– only not necessarily the ones they hope. When it comes to erasing memories in humans,
our best tool still works like a hammer, not a scalpel. It’s no accident that our ability to forget,
like our ability to remember, is a complex and finely-tuned mechanism. If humans couldn’t remember and learn from
important events, our species probably wouldn’t have survived. But it seems that being able to forget is
just as critical, an elementary part of solving this great mystery we call life. Stay curious! So you probably can’t teach yourself to
have perfect memory, and never forget anything. Not without a massive brain injury or something. But is memorization really the best way to
learn something? Memorizing can definitely help you get started
with a new concept. However, truly understanding it requires much
more - seeing how concepts are related to each other, looking for different interpretations,
dealing with new information. These are the skills that will help you learn
anything, and if you’d like to sharpen your brain and develop these tools, then Brilliant
could be the place to go for that. Check out this Brilliant course on logic and

**Transcript**:
Consider the following statement: human beings only use 10 percent
of their brain capacity. Well, as a neuroscientist, I can tell you that while Morgan Freeman
delivered this line with the gravitas
that makes him a great actor, this statement is entirely false. (Laughter) The truth is, human beings use 100 percent
of their brain capacity. The brain is a highly efficient,
energy-demanding organ that gets fully utilized and even though it is
at full capacity being used, it suffers from a problem
of information overload. There's far too much in the environment
than it can fully process. So to solve this problem of overload, evolution devised a solution, which is the brain's attention system. Attention allows us to notice, select and direct
the brain's computational resources to a subset of all that's available. We can think of attention
as the leader of the brain. Wherever attention goes,
the rest of the brain follows. In some sense, it's your brain's boss. And over the last 15 years, I've been studying
the human brain's attention system. In all of our studies,
I've been very interested in one question. If it is indeed the case
that our attention is the brain's boss, is it a good boss? Does it actually guide us well? And to dig in on this big question,
I wanted to know three things. First, how does attention
control our perception? Second, why does it fail us, often leaving us feeling
foggy and distracted? And third, can we do anything
about this fogginess, can we train our brain
to pay better attention? To have more strong and stable attention
in the work that we do in our lives. So I wanted to give you a brief glimpse into how we're going to look at this. A very poignant example of how our attention
ends up getting utilized. And I want to do it using the example
of somebody that I know quite well. He ends up being part of a very large
group of people that we work with, for whom attention
is a matter of life and death. Think of medical professionals or firefighters or soldiers or marines. This is the story of a marine captain,
Captain Jeff Davis. And the scene that I'm going to share
with you, as you can see, is not about his time in the battlefield. He was actually on a bridge, in Florida. But instead of looking
at the scenery around him, seeing the beautiful vistas and noticing the cool ocean breezes, he was driving fast and contemplating
driving off that bridge. And he would later tell me that it took
all of everything he had not to do so. You see, he'd just returned from Iraq. And while his body was on that bridge, his mind, his attention,
was thousands of miles away. He was gripped with suffering. His mind was worried and preoccupied and had stressful memories
and, really, dread for his future. And I'm really glad
that he didn't take his life. Because he, as a leader,
knew that he wasn't the only one that was probably suffering; many of his fellow marines
probably were, too. And in the year 2008, he partnered with me
in the first-of-its-kind project that actually allowed us to test and offer
something called mindfulness training to active-duty military personnel. But before I tell you about
what mindfulness training is, or the results of that study, I think it's important to understand
how attention works in the brain. So what we do in the laboratory is that many of our studies of attention
involve brain-wave recordings. In these brain wave recordings,
people wear funny-looking caps that are sort of like swimming caps,
that have electrodes embedded in them. These electrodes pick up
the ongoing brain electrical activity. And they do it with millisecond
temporal precision. So we can see these small yet detectable
voltage fluctuations over time. And doing this, we can very precisely
plot the timing of the brain's activity. About 170 milliseconds after we show our research participants
a face on the screen, we see a very reliable,
detectable brain signature. It happens right at the back of the scalp, above the regions of the brain
that are involved in face processing. Now, this happens so reliably
and so on cue, as the brain's face detector, that we've even given
this brain-wave component a name. We call it the N170 component. And we use this component
in many of our studies. It allows us to see the impact
that attention may have on our perception. I'm going to give you a sense
of the kind of experiments that we actually do in the lab. We would show participants
images like this one. You should see a face and a scene
overlaid on each other. And what we do is we ask our participants as they're viewing a series
of these types of overlaid images, to do something with their attention. On some trials, we'll ask them
to pay attention to the face. And to make sure they're doing that, we ask them to tell us,
by pressing a button, if the face appeared to be male or female. On other trials, we ask them to tell what the scene was --
was it indoor or outdoor? And in this way,
we can manipulate attention and confirm that the participants
were actually doing what we said. Our hypotheses about attention
were as follows: if attention is indeed doing its job
and affecting perception, maybe it works like an amplifier. And what I mean by this is that when we direct
attention to the face, it becomes clearer and more salient, it's easier to see. But when we direct it to the scene,
the face becomes barely perceptible as we process the scene information. So what we wanted to do is look at this brain-wave component
of face detection, the N170, and see if it changed at all as a function of where our participants
were paying attention -- to the scene or the face. And here's what we found. We found that when they paid
attention to the face, the N170 was larger. And when they paid attention to the scene,
as you can see in red, it was smaller. And that gap you see
between the blue and red lines is pretty powerful. What it tells us is that attention, which is really the only
thing that changed, since the images they viewed
were identical in both cases -- attention changes perception. And it does so very fast. Within 170 milliseconds
of actually seeing a face. In our follow-up studies,
we wanted to see what would happen, how could we perturb
or diminish this effect. And our hunch was that if you put people
in a very stressful environment, if you distract them with disturbing,
negative images, images of suffering and violence -- sort of like what you might see
on the news, unfortunately -- that doing this might
actually affect their attention. And that's indeed what we found. If we present stressful images
while they're doing this experiment, this gap of attention shrinks,
its power diminishes. So in some of our other studies, we wanted to see, OK, great -- not great, actually, bad news
that stress does this to the brain -- but if it is the case that stress
has this powerful influence on attention through external distraction, what if we don't need
external distraction, what if we distract ourselves? And to do this, we had to basically come up
with an experiment in which we could have people
generate their own mind-wandering. This is having off-task thoughts while we're engaged
in an ongoing task of some sort. And the trick to mind-wandering
is that essentially, you bore people. So hopefully there's not a lot
of mind-wandering happening right now. When we bore people, people happily generate all kinds
of internal content to occupy themselves. So we devised what might be considered one of the world's
most boring experiments. All the participants saw
were a series of faces on the screen, one after another. They pressed the button
every time they saw the face. That was pretty much it. Well, one trick was that sometimes,
the face would be upside down, and it would happen very infrequently. On those trials they were told
just to withhold the response. Pretty soon, we could tell that
they were successfully mind-wandering, because they pressed the button
when that face was upside down. Even though it's quite plain to see
that it was upside down. So we wanted to know what happens
when people have mind-wandering. And what we found was that, very similar to external stress and external distraction
in the environment, internal distraction,
our own mind wandering, also shrinks the gap of attention. It diminishes attention's power. So what do all of these studies tell us? They tell us that attention
is very powerful in terms of affecting our perception. Even though it's so powerful,
it's also fragile and vulnerable. And things like stress
and mind-wandering diminish its power. But that's all in the context of these
very controlled laboratory settings. What about in the real world? What about in our actual day-to-day life? What about now? Where is your attention right now? To kind of bring it back, I'd like to make a prediction
about your attention for the remainder of my talk. Are you up for it? Here's the prediction. You will be unaware of what I'm saying
for four out of the next eight minutes. (Laughter) It's a challenge,
so pay attention, please. Now, why am I saying this? I'm surely going to assume
that you're going to remain seated and, you know, graciously keep
your eyes on me as I speak. But a growing body of literature suggests
that we mind-wander, we take our mind away
from the task at hand, about 50 percent of our waking moments. These might be small,
little trips that we take away, private thoughts that we have. And when this mind-wandering happens, it can be problematic. Now I don't think there will be
any dire consequences with you all sitting here today, but imagine a military leader missing
four minutes of a military briefing, or a judge missing
four minutes of testimony. Or a surgeon or firefighter
missing any time. The consequences
in those cases could be dire. So we might ask why do we do this? Why do we mind-wander so much? Well, part of the answer is that our mind
is an exquisite time-traveling master. It can actually time travel very easily. If we think of the mind as the metaphor
of the music player, we see this. We can rewind the mind to the past to reflect on events
that have already happened, right? Or we can go and fast-future, to plan
for the next thing that we want to do. And we land in this mental
time-travel mode of the past or the future very frequently. And we land there often
without our awareness, most times without our awareness, even if we want to be paying attention. Think of just the last time
you were trying to read a book, got to the bottom of the page
with no idea what the words were saying. This happens to us. And when this happens, when we mind-wander
without an awareness that we're doing it, there are consequences. We make errors. We miss critical information, sometimes. And we have difficulty making decisions. What's worse is when we experience stress. When we're in a moment of overwhelm. We don't just reflect
on the past when we rewind, we end up being in the past
ruminating, reliving or regretting events that have already happened. Or under stress, we fast-forward the mind. Not just to productively plan. But we end up catastrophizing or worrying about events that haven't happened yet and frankly may never happen. So at this point, you might be
thinking to yourself, OK, mind-wandering's happening a lot. Often, it happens without our awareness. And under stress, it's even worse -- we mind-wander more powerfully
and more often. Is there anything
we can possibly do about this? And I'm happy to say the answer is yes. From our work, we're learning that the opposite of a stressed
and wandering mind is a mindful one. Mindfulness has to do
with paying attention to our present-moment experience
with awareness. And without any kind of emotional
reactivity of what's happening. It's about keeping
that button right on play to experience the moment-to-moment
unfolding of our lives. And mindfulness is not just a concept. It's more like practice, you have to embody this mindful
mode of being to have any benefits. And a lot of the work that we're doing,
we're offering people programs that give our participants
a suite of exercises that they should do daily in order to cultivate more moments
of mindfulness in their life. And for many of the groups
that we work with, high-stress groups, like I said -- soldiers,
medical professionals -- for them, as we know,
mind-wandering can be really dire. So we want to make sure
we offer them very accessible, low time constraints
to optimize the training, so they can benefit from it. And when we do this, what we can do
is track to see what happens, not just in their regular lives but in the most demanding
circumstances that they may have. Why do we want to do this? Well, we want to, for example, give it
to students right around finals season. Or we want to give the training
to accountants during tax season. Or soldiers and marines
while they're deploying. Why is that? Because those are the moments in which their attention
is most likely to be vulnerable, because of stress and mind-wandering. And those are also the moments in which we want their attention
to be in peak shape so they can perform well. So what we do in our research is we have them take
a series of attention tests. We track their attention at the beginning
of some kind of high-stress interval, and then two months later,
we track them again, and we want to see
if there's a difference. Is there any benefit of offering them
mindfulness training? Can we protect against
the lapses in attention that might arise over high stress? So here's what we find. Over a high-stress interval, unfortunately, the reality is
if we don't do anything at all, attention declines, people are worse at the end
of this high-stress interval than before. But if we offer mindfulness training,
we can protect against this. They stay stable, even though
just like the other groups, they were experiencing high stress. And perhaps even more impressive is that if people
take our training programs over, let's say, eight weeks, and they fully commit
to doing the daily mindfulness exercises that allow them to learn
how to be in the present moment, well, they actually get better over time,
even though they're in high stress. And this last point
is actually important to realize, because of what it suggests to us is that mindfulness exercises
are very much like physical exercise: if you don't do it, you don't benefit. But if you do engage
in mindfulness practice, the more you do, the more you benefit. And I want to just bring it back
to Captain Jeff Davis. As I mentioned to you at the beginning, his marines were involved
in the very first project that we ever did,
offering mindfulness training. And they showed this exact pattern,
which was very heartening. We had offered them
the mindfulness training right before they were deployed to Iraq. And upon their return,
Captain Davis shared with us what he was feeling
was the benefit of this program. He said that unlike last time, after this deployment,
they were much more present. They were discerning. They were not as reactive. And in some cases,
they were really more compassionate with the people they were
engaging with and each other. He said in many ways, he felt that the mindfulness
training program we offered gave them a really important tool to protect against developing
post-traumatic stress disorder and even allowing it to turn
into post-traumatic growth. To us, this was very compelling. And it ended up
that Captain Davis and I -- you know, this was about
a decade ago, in 2008 -- we've kept in touch all these years. And he himself has gone on
to continue practicing mindfulness in a daily way. He was promoted to major, he actually then ended up retiring
from the Marine Corps. He went on to get a divorce,
to get remarried, to have a child, to get an MBA. And through all of these challenges
and transitions and joys of his life, he kept up with his mindfulness practice. And as fate would have it,
just a few months ago, Captain Davis suffered a massive
heart attack, at the age of 46. And he ended up calling me
a few weeks ago. And he said, "I want
to tell you something. I know that the doctors
who worked on me, they saved my heart, but mindfulness saved my life. The presence of mind I had
to stop the ambulance that ended up taking me
to the hospital," -- himself, the clarity of mind he had to notice
when there was fear and anxiety happening but not be gripped by it -- he said, "For me, these
were the gifts of mindfulness." And I was so relieved
to hear that he was OK. But really heartened to see
that he had transformed his own attention. He went from having a really bad boss -- an attention system
that nearly drove him off a bridge -- to one that was an exquisite
leader and guide, and saved his life. So I want to actually end by sharing
my call to action to all of you. And here it is. Pay attention to your attention. Alright? Pay attention to your attention and incorporate mindfulness training
as part of your daily wellness toolkit, in order to tame your own wandering mind and to allow your attention
to be a trusted guide in your own life. Thank you. (Applause)

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Consider the following statement: human beings only use 10 percent
of their brain capacity. Well, as a neuroscientist, I can tell you that while Morgan Freeman
delivered this line with the gravitas
that makes him a great actor, this statement is entirely false. (Laughter) The truth is, human beings use 100 percent
of their brain capacity. The brain is a highly efficient,
energy-demanding organ that gets fully utilized and even though it is
at full capacity being used, it suffers from a problem
of information overload. There's far too much in the environment
than it can fully process. So to solve this problem of overload, evolution devised a solution, which is the brain's attention system. Attention allows us to notice, select and direct
the brain's computational resources to a subset of all that's available. We can think of attention
as the leader of the brain. Wherever attention goes,
the rest of the brain follows. In some sense, it's your brain's boss. And over the last 15 years, I've been studying
the human brain's attention system. In all of our studies,
I've been very interested in one question. If it is indeed the case
that our attention is the brain's boss, is it a good boss? Does it actually guide us well? And to dig in on this big question,
I wanted to know three things. First, how does attention
control our perception? Second, why does it fail us, often leaving us feeling
foggy and distracted? And third, can we do anything
about this fogginess, can we train our brain
to pay better attention? To have more strong and stable attention
in the work that we do in our lives. So I wanted to give you a brief glimpse into how we're going to look at this. A very poignant example of how our attention
ends up getting utilized. And I want to do it using the example
of somebody that I know quite well. He ends up being part of a very large
group of people that we work with, for whom attention
is a matter of life and death. Think of medical professionals or firefighters or soldiers or marines. This is the story of a marine captain,
Captain Jeff Davis. And the scene that I'm going to share
with you, as you can see, is not about his time in the battlefield. He was actually on a bridge, in Florida. But instead of looking
at the scenery around him, seeing the beautiful vistas and noticing the cool ocean breezes, he was driving fast and contemplating
driving off that bridge. And he would later tell me that it took
all of everything he had not to do so. You see, he'd just returned from Iraq. And while his body was on that bridge, his mind, his attention,
was thousands of miles away. He was gripped with suffering. His mind was worried and preoccupied and had stressful memories
and, really, dread for his future. And I'm really glad
that he didn't take his life. Because he, as a leader,
knew that he wasn't the only one that was probably suffering; many of his fellow marines
probably were, too. And in the year 2008, he partnered with me
in the first-of-its-kind project that actually allowed us to test and offer
something called mindfulness training to active-duty military personnel. But before I tell you about
what mindfulness training is, or the results of that study, I think it's important to understand
how attention works in the brain. So what we do in the laboratory is that many of our studies of attention
involve brain-wave recordings. In these brain wave recordings,
people wear funny-looking caps that are sort of like swimming caps,
that have electrodes embedded in them. These electrodes pick up
the ongoing brain electrical activity. And they do it with millisecond
temporal precision. So we can see these small yet detectable
voltage fluctuations over time. And doing this, we can very precisely
plot the timing of the brain's activity. About 170 milliseconds after we show our research participants
a face on the screen, we see a very reliable,
detectable brain signature. It happens right at the back of the scalp, above the regions of the brain
that are involved in face processing. Now, this happens so reliably
and so on cue, as the brain's face detector, that we've even given
this brain-wave component a name. We call it the N170 component. And we use this component

engaging with and each other. He said in many ways, he felt that the mindfulness
training program we offered gave them a really important tool to protect against developing
post-traumatic stress disorder and even allowing it to turn
into post-traumatic growth. To us, this was very compelling. And it ended up
that Captain Davis and I -- you know, this was about
a decade ago, in 2008 -- we've kept in touch all these years. And he himself has gone on
to continue practicing mindfulness in a daily way. He was promoted to major, he actually then ended up retiring
from the Marine Corps. He went on to get a divorce,
to get remarried, to have a child, to get an MBA. And through all of these challenges
and transitions and joys of his life, he kept up with his mindfulness practice. And as fate would have it,
just a few months ago, Captain Davis suffered a massive
heart attack, at the age of 46. And he ended up calling me
a few weeks ago. And he said, "I want
to tell you something. I know that the doctors
who worked on me, they saved my heart, but mindfulness saved my life. The presence of mind I had
to stop the ambulance that ended up taking me
to the hospital," -- himself, the clarity of mind he had to notice
when there was fear and anxiety happening but not be gripped by it -- he said, "For me, these
were the gifts of mindfulness." And I was so relieved
to hear that he was OK. But really heartened to see
that he had transformed his own attention. He went from having a really bad boss -- an attention system
that nearly drove him off a bridge -- to one that was an exquisite
leader and guide, and saved his life. So I want to actually end by sharing
my call to action to all of you. And here it is. Pay attention to your attention. Alright? Pay attention to your attention and incorporate mindfulness training
as part of your daily wellness toolkit, in order to tame your own wandering mind and to allow your attention
to be a trusted guide in your own life. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
In the ocean’s depths,
two titans wage battle: the sperm whale and the colossal squid. Sperm whales use echolocation 
to hunt these squid for food, but even against this gigantic animal,
squid can put up an impressive fight. Scientists know this because on the bodies
of washed-up whales, they frequently find huge, 
round suction scars, emblazoned there by large, 
grasping tentacles. Ranging in size from 
this giant’s impressive 14 meters to the 2.5 centimeters 
of the southern pygmy squid, these creatures fall into the group 
of animals known as cephalopods. There are about 500 squid 
species worldwide, and they live in all the world’s oceans, making them a reliable food source
for whales, dolphins, sharks, seabirds, fish, and even other squid. Indeed, squid themselves 
are fearsome ocean predators. But their most extraordinary adaptations are those that have evolved 
to help them thwart their predators. Squid, which can be found mainly in estuarine, deep-sea, 
and open-water habitats, often swim together in shoals. Being out in the open without anywhere 
to hide makes them vulnerable, so as a first line of defense,
they rely on large, well-developed eyes. In the colossal squid, 
these are the size of dinner plates, the largest known eyes 
in the animal kingdom. When it’s dark or the water is murky, 
however, squid rely on a secondary sensory system, made from thousands of tiny hair cells 
that are only about twelve microns long and run along their heads and arms. Each of these hair cells is attached
to axons in the nervous system. Swimming animals create a wake, so when the hairs on 
the squid’s body detect this motion, they send a signal to the brain, which helps it determine 
the direction of the water’s flow. This way, a squid can sense an oncoming 
predator in even the dimmest waters. Aware of the threat, a squid 
can then mask itself from a predator. Squid skin contains thousands
of tiny organs called chromatophores, each made of black, brown, red 
or yellow pigments and ringed in muscle. Reflecting cells beneath 
the chromatophores mirror the squid’s surroundings,
enabling it to blend in. So, when the muscles contract, the color of the pigment is exposed, whereas when the muscles relax 
the colors are hidden. Each of these chromatophores is under the individual control 
of the squid’s nervous system, so while some expand, 
others remain contracted. That enables countershading, where the underside of the squid
is lighter than the top, to eliminate a silhouette 
that a predator might spy from below. Some predators, however, 
like the whales and dolphins, get around this ruse by using sound waves
to detect a squid’s camouflaged form. Not to be outfoxed, the squid still 
has two more tricks up its sleeve. The first involves ink, 
produced inside its mantle. Squid ink is made mostly of mucus
and melanin, which produces its dark coloring. When squid eject the ink, they either use it to make 
a large smokescreen that completely blocks the predator’s view or a blob that roughly mimics the size 
and shape of the squid. This creates a phantom form, 
called a pseudomorph, that tricks the predator 
into thinking it’s the real squid. As a final touch, 
squid rely on jet propulsion to rapidly shoot away from their hunters, reaching speeds of up to 25 miles per hour
and moving meters away in mere seconds. This makes them 
Earth’s fastest invertebrates. Some squid species have also developed 
unique adaptive behaviors. The deep-sea vampire squid,
when startled, uses its webbed arms to make 
a cape it hides behind. The tiny bobtail, on the other hand, 
tosses sand over its body as it burrows away from prying eyes. The Pacific flying squid 
uses jet propulsion for another purpose: to launch itself right out of the water. Squids’ inventive adaptations 
have allowed them to proliferate 
for over 500 million years. Even now, 
we’re still uncovering new species. And as we do, we’re bound to discover even more
about how these stealthy cephalopods have mastered survival 
in the deep and unforgiving sea.

that are only about twelve microns long and run along their heads and arms. Each of these hair cells is attached
to axons in the nervous system. Swimming animals create a wake, so when the hairs on 
the squid’s body detect this motion, they send a signal to the brain, which helps it determine 
the direction of the water’s flow. This way, a squid can sense an oncoming 
predator in even the dimmest waters. Aware of the threat, a squid 
can then mask itself from a predator. Squid skin contains thousands
of tiny organs called chromatophores, each made of black, brown, red 
or yellow pigments and ringed in muscle. Reflecting cells beneath 
the chromatophores mirror the squid’s surroundings,
enabling it to blend in. So, when the muscles contract, the color of the pigment is exposed, whereas when the muscles relax 
the colors are hidden. Each of these chromatophores is under the individual control 
of the squid’s nervous system, so while some expand, 
others remain contracted. That enables countershading, where the underside of the squid
is lighter than the top, to eliminate a silhouette 
that a predator might spy from below. Some predators, however, 
like the whales and dolphins, get around this ruse by using sound waves
to detect a squid’s camouflaged form. Not to be outfoxed, the squid still 
has two more tricks up its sleeve. The first involves ink, 
produced inside its mantle. Squid ink is made mostly of mucus
and melanin, which produces its dark coloring. When squid eject the ink, they either use it to make 
a large smokescreen that completely blocks the predator’s view or a blob that roughly mimics the size 
and shape of the squid. This creates a phantom form, 
called a pseudomorph, that tricks the predator 
into thinking it’s the real squid. As a final touch, 
squid rely on jet propulsion to rapidly shoot away from their hunters, reaching speeds of up to 25 miles per hour
and moving meters away in mere seconds. This makes them 
Earth’s fastest invertebrates. Some squid species have also developed 
unique adaptive behaviors. The deep-sea vampire squid,
when startled, uses its webbed arms to make 
a cape it hides behind. The tiny bobtail, on the other hand, 
tosses sand over its body as it burrows away from prying eyes. The Pacific flying squid 
uses jet propulsion for another purpose: to launch itself right out of the water. Squids’ inventive adaptations 
have allowed them to proliferate 
for over 500 million years. Even now, 
we’re still uncovering new species. And as we do, we’re bound to discover even more
about how these stealthy cephalopods have mastered survival 
in the deep and unforgiving sea.

**Transcript**:
In the ocean’s depths,
two titans wage battle: the sperm whale and the colossal squid. Sperm whales use echolocation 
to hunt these squid for food, but even against this gigantic animal,
squid can put up an impressive fight. Scientists know this because on the bodies
of washed-up whales, they frequently find huge, 
round suction scars, emblazoned there by large, 
grasping tentacles. Ranging in size from 
this giant’s impressive 14 meters to the 2.5 centimeters 
of the southern pygmy squid, these creatures fall into the group 
of animals known as cephalopods. There are about 500 squid 
species worldwide, and they live in all the world’s oceans, making them a reliable food source
for whales, dolphins, sharks, seabirds, fish, and even other squid. Indeed, squid themselves 
are fearsome ocean predators. But their most extraordinary adaptations are those that have evolved 
to help them thwart their predators. Squid, which can be found mainly in estuarine, deep-sea, 
and open-water habitats, often swim together in shoals. Being out in the open without anywhere 
to hide makes them vulnerable, so as a first line of defense,
they rely on large, well-developed eyes. In the colossal squid, 
these are the size of dinner plates, the largest known eyes 
in the animal kingdom. When it’s dark or the water is murky, 
however, squid rely on a secondary sensory system, made from thousands of tiny hair cells 
that are only about twelve microns long and run along their heads and arms. Each of these hair cells is attached
to axons in the nervous system. Swimming animals create a wake, so when the hairs on 
the squid’s body detect this motion, they send a signal to the brain, which helps it determine 
the direction of the water’s flow. This way, a squid can sense an oncoming 
predator in even the dimmest waters. Aware of the threat, a squid 
can then mask itself from a predator. Squid skin contains thousands

**Transcript**:
What keeps you up at night? Pondering deep questions? Excitement about a big trip? Or is it stress about unfinished work, an upcoming test, or a dreaded family gathering? For many people, this stress is temporary,
as its cause is quickly resolved. But what if the very thing keeping 
you awake was stress about losing sleep? This seemingly unsolvable loop 
is at the heart of insomnia, the world’s most common
sleep disorder. Almost anything can cause 
the occasional restless night - a snoring partner, physical pain, or emotional distress. And extreme sleep deprivation like jetlag
can throw off your biological clock, wreaking havoc on your sleep schedule. But in most cases, sleep deprivation 
is short-term. Eventually, exhaustion catches up 
with all of us. However, some long-term conditions
like respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal problems, and many others can overpower fatigue. And as sleepless nights pile up, the bedroom can start to carry 
associations of restless nights wracked with anxiety. Come bedtime, insomniacs are stressed. So stressed their brains hijack 
the stress response system, flooding the body with 
fight-flight-or-freeze chemicals. Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormones 
course through the bloodstream, increasing heart rate and blood pressure, and jolting the body into hyperarousal. In this condition, the brain is hunting 
for potential threats, making it impossible to ignore
any slight discomfort or nighttime noise. And when insomniacs 
finally do fall asleep, the quality of their rest is compromised. Our brain’s primary source of energy 
is cerebral glucose, and in healthy sleep, our metabolism slows
to conserve this glucose for waking hours. But PET studies show the adrenaline 
that prevents sleep for insomniacs also speeds up their metabolisms. While they sleep, their bodies 
are working overtime, burning through the brain’s supply 
of energy-giving glucose. This symptom of poor sleep leaves 
insomniacs waking in a state of exhaustion,
confusion, and stress, which starts the
process all over again. When these cycles of stress 
and restlessness last several months, they’re diagnosed as chronic insomnia. And while insomnia rarely leads to death, its chemical mechanisms are similar 
to anxiety attacks found in those experiencing depression
and anxiety. So suffering from 
any one of these conditions increases your risk of
experiencing the other two. Fortunately, there are ways to break 
the cycle of sleeplessness. Managing the stress that leads 
to hyperarousal is one of our best-understood treatments 
for insomnia, and good sleep practices can help rebuild 
your relationship with bedtime. Make sure your bedroom is dark 
and comfortably cool to minimize “threats” during hyperarousal. Only use your bed for sleeping, and if you’re restless, leave the room and tire yourself out 
with relaxing activities like reading, meditating, or journaling. Regulate your metabolism by setting
consistent resting and waking times to help orient 
your body’s biological clock. This clock, or circadian rhythm, is also sensitive to light, so avoid bright lights at night to help tell your body
that it’s time for sleep. In addition to these practices, some doctors prescribe medication 
to aid sleep, but there aren’t reliable medications 
that help in all cases. And over-the-counter sleeping pills 
can be highly addictive, leading to withdrawal 
that worsens symptoms. But before seeking any treatment, make sure your sleeplessness 
is actually due to insomnia. Approximately 8% of patients diagnosed 
with chronic insomnia are actually suffering from a less common
genetic problem called delayed sleep phase disorder,
or DSPD. People with DSPD have a circadian rhythm 
significantly longer than 24 hours, putting their sleeping habits out 
of sync with traditional sleeping hours. So while they have difficulty 
falling asleep at a typical bedtime, it’s not due to increased stress. And given the opportunity, they can sleep comfortably 
on their own delayed schedule. Our sleeping and waking cycle 
is a delicate balance, and one that’s vital to maintain
for our physical and mental wellbeing. For all these reasons, it’s worth putting in some time 
and effort to sustain a stable bedtime routine, but try not to lose any sleep over it.

**Transcript**:
On the coast of Northern Ireland, a vast plateau of basalt slabs
and columns called the Giant’s Causeway stretches into the ocean. The scientific explanation for this is that it’s the result of
molten lava contracting and fracturing as it cooled in the wake 
of a volcanic eruption. But an ancient Irish myth 
has a different accounting. According to legend, the giant Finn MacCool lived happily 
on the North Antrim coast with his wife Oonagh. Their only disturbance came from
the taunts and threats of the giant Benandonner, or the red man, 
who lived across the sea in Scotland. The two roared insults 
and hurled rocks at each other in dramatic shows of strength. Once, Finn tore up a great clump of land 
and heaved it at his rival, but it fell short of reaching land. Instead, the clump became the Isle of Man, and the crater left from the disturbed
earth filled with water to become Lough Neagh. The giants’ tough talk continued, until one day Benandonner challenged 
Finn to a fight, face to face. And so the Irish giant tossed 
enough boulders into the sea to create a bridge of stepping 
stones to the Scottish coast. Finn marched across in a fit of rage. When Scotland loomed before him, he made out the figure 
of Benandonner from afar. Finn was a substantial size, but at the sight of his colossal
enemy thundering towards him, his courage faltered. With one look at Benandonner’s thick neck
and crushing fists, Finn turned and ran. Back home, with Benandonner 
fast approaching, Finn trembled as he described 
his enemy’s bulk to Oonagh. They knew that if he faced 
Benandonner head on, he’d be crushed. And so Oonagh hatched a cunning plan - they needed to create an illusion of size, to suggest Finn was a mountain 
of a man whilst keeping him out of sight. As Benandonner neared 
the end of the bridge, Oonagh stuffed her husband 
in a huge cradle. Disguised as an enormous baby, Finn lay quiet as Benandonnner 
pounded on the door. The house shook as he stepped inside. Oonagh told the enraged visitor 
that her husband wasn’t home, but welcomed him to sit
and eat while he waited. When Benandonner tore into the cakes 
placed before him, he cried out in pain for he’d shattered his teeth 
on the metal Oonagh had concealed inside. She told him that this 
was Finn’s favorite bread, sowing a seed of doubt 
in Benandonner’s mind that he was any match for his rival. When Finn let out a squawk, Benandonner’s attention was drawn 
to the gigantic baby in the corner. So hefty was the infant swaddled

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
On the coast of Northern Ireland, a vast plateau of basalt slabs
and columns called the Giant’s Causeway stretches into the ocean. The scientific explanation for this is that it’s the result of
molten lava contracting and fracturing as it cooled in the wake 
of a volcanic eruption. But an ancient Irish myth 
has a different accounting. According to legend, the giant Finn MacCool lived happily 
on the North Antrim coast with his wife Oonagh. Their only disturbance came from
the taunts and threats of the giant Benandonner, or the red man, 
who lived across the sea in Scotland. The two roared insults 
and hurled rocks at each other in dramatic shows of strength. Once, Finn tore up a great clump of land 
and heaved it at his rival, but it fell short of reaching land. Instead, the clump became the Isle of Man, and the crater left from the disturbed
earth filled with water to become Lough Neagh. The giants’ tough talk continued, until one day Benandonner challenged 
Finn to a fight, face to face. And so the Irish giant tossed 
enough boulders into the sea to create a bridge of stepping 
stones to the Scottish coast. Finn marched across in a fit of rage. When Scotland loomed before him, he made out the figure 
of Benandonner from afar. Finn was a substantial size, but at the sight of his colossal
enemy thundering towards him, his courage faltered. With one look at Benandonner’s thick neck
and crushing fists, Finn turned and ran. Back home, with Benandonner 
fast approaching, Finn trembled as he described 
his enemy’s bulk to Oonagh. They knew that if he faced 
Benandonner head on, he’d be crushed. And so Oonagh hatched a cunning plan - they needed to create an illusion of size, to suggest Finn was a mountain 
of a man whilst keeping him out of sight. As Benandonner neared 
the end of the bridge, Oonagh stuffed her husband 
in a huge cradle. Disguised as an enormous baby, Finn lay quiet as Benandonnner 
pounded on the door. The house shook as he stepped inside. Oonagh told the enraged visitor 
that her husband wasn’t home, but welcomed him to sit
and eat while he waited. When Benandonner tore into the cakes 
placed before him, he cried out in pain for he’d shattered his teeth 
on the metal Oonagh had concealed inside. She told him that this 
was Finn’s favorite bread, sowing a seed of doubt 
in Benandonner’s mind that he was any match for his rival. When Finn let out a squawk, Benandonner’s attention was drawn 
to the gigantic baby in the corner. So hefty was the infant swaddled 
under piles of blankets, Benandonner shuddered at the thought 
of what the father would look like. He decided he’d rather not find out. As he fled, Benandonner tore up the rocks 
connecting the shores, breaking up the causeway. What remains are two identical

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
As a writer, comedian, researcher, and DJ,
I have to have music to focus. But I have friends who need *complete silence*
to study, write, or be productive. So which one’s better for our brain and our body? Let’s start by finding out what noise, the
opposite of silence, does to our bodies. Studies were conducted by the World Health
Organization that linked noise pollution, like loud city sounds, with higher blood pressure
and a higher chance for a fatal heart attack. All right, don’t panic, that neighbor playing
Migos at 4 a.m. isn’t going to kill you, but prolonged exposure to a noisy environment
can lead to cognitive deficits as well. Studies have shown that students in schools
near airports and train stations have suffered negative effects on long-term memory and reading
comprehension, leading some cities to require soundproofing in schools. 
So, noise may not kill you, but it increases your stress levels, 
which is no bueno for your brain long-term. Are you hearing this, construction workers
who have to fix my sidewalk at 6 a.m.? Yeah, I'm comin' for y'all. Silence, on the other hand, has been correlated
with lower stress hormones. Also, studies done on mice in 2013 found that
those exposed to silence over white noise, or even Mozart, expressed higher rates of
neurogenesis, or the production of neurons, in the hippocampus, the part of the brain
that processes memory. Further studies found more evidence that the
brain is processing and evaluating new information faster in times of silence over sound. So, less stress, new neurons, new synaptic
connections and memory formation? Sounds good for productivity. I know what you’re thinking: “but I do
my best work when listening to Evanescence!” Me too. I love "Bring Me To Life." But be patient, we’re getting there! Music permeates all parts of the brain; not
just the temporal lobe or the auditory cortices. If the song slaps (or if it’s trash), it’ll
activate your amygdala and parts of your limbic system 
responsible for emotional response. What’s more, both music and language are
auditorily processed; both are forms of communication, and I don’t know about y’all, but I consider
music like a language. I mean, have you SEEN sheet music? 
That's from a different alien race. New research shows that there may be neurons
in the auditory cortex that activate specifically for music; 
not language, or other random sounds. So, if your brain is busy processing emotions,
lyrics, and now there’s these new other neurons firing, how much attention is left
to remember SOH CAH TOA? Remember that gem from seventh grade algebra? ...I'm old. Science says...it depends. A 2010 study found that music may impair cognitive
abilities if you’re trying to memorize a specific order; it could be thrown off by
a key change, a lyrical choice, or Drake getting you deep down in your feelings. Even if you’re not distracted, a 2006 study
measured the effects of tempo on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Slow, meditative music can get us to relax,
slowing both your heart rate and breathing but this study found that we’re the most
relaxed when there’s a wait for it... ...pause. See what I did there? So, silence wins? Well, if your goal is complete zen relaxation
while you write that final, then, yeah, try silence. But again, this all depends on a lot of variables:
lyrics, tempo, and genre have all been shown to have various effects on focus, mood, and
productivity. But if you have to listen to that Randy Newman
to get those reports in, more power to you. If you have a work or study playlist,
go for it! Verdict: do you! If you’ll excuse me, I have to go listen
to some Celine Dion, because I love Titanic. ♩ Near, far, where--- later, later. Yo, what's good -- thanks for watching Seeker. Be sure to subscribe. I'm watching you. Subscribe. And since we talked about how silence and music affects your brain, what about ASMR? If that really gives you the tingles, be sure to check out this episode right here for everything scientists know about it. If you've got two cents 
and you don't know where to put it, leave 'em in the comments below. And, as always, thank you for watching.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 4, Ground Truth Question 4, Matched Generated Question 4
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
As a writer, comedian, researcher, and DJ,
I have to have music to focus. But I have friends who need *complete silence*
to study, write, or be productive. So which one’s better for our brain and our body? Let’s start by finding out what noise, the
opposite of silence, does to our bodies. Studies were conducted by the World Health
Organization that linked noise pollution, like loud city sounds, with higher blood pressure
and a higher chance for a fatal heart attack. All right, don’t panic, that neighbor playing
Migos at 4 a.m. isn’t going to kill you, but prolonged exposure to a noisy environment
can lead to cognitive deficits as well. Studies have shown that students in schools
near airports and train stations have suffered negative effects on long-term memory and reading
comprehension, leading some cities to require soundproofing in schools. 
So, noise may not kill you, but it increases your stress levels, 
which is no bueno for your brain long-term. Are you hearing this, construction workers
who have to fix my sidewalk at 6 a.m.? Yeah, I'm comin' for y'all. Silence, on the other hand, has been correlated
with lower stress hormones. Also, studies done on mice in 2013 found that
those exposed to silence over white noise, or even Mozart, expressed higher rates of
neurogenesis, or the production of neurons, in the hippocampus, the part of the brain
that processes memory. Further studies found more evidence that the
brain is processing and evaluating new information faster in times of silence over sound. So, less stress, new neurons, new synaptic
connections and memory formation? Sounds good for productivity. I know what you’re thinking: “but I do
my best work when listening to Evanescence!” Me too. I love "Bring Me To Life." But be patient, we’re getting there! Music permeates all parts of the brain; not
just the temporal lobe or the auditory cortices. If the song slaps (or if it’s trash), it’ll
activate your amygdala and parts of your limbic system 
responsible for emotional response. What’s more, both music and language are
auditorily processed; both are forms of communication, and I don’t know about y’all, but I consider
music like a language. I mean, have you SEEN sheet music? 
That's from a different alien race. New research shows that there may be neurons
in the auditory cortex that activate specifically for music; 
not language, or other random sounds. So, if your brain is busy processing emotions,
lyrics, and now there’s these new other neurons firing, how much attention is left
to remember SOH CAH TOA? Remember that gem from seventh grade algebra? ...I'm old. Science says...it depends. A 2010 study found that music may impair cognitive

**Transcript**:
The villainous Dr. Schrödinger 
has developed a growth ray and intends to create 
an army of giant cats to terrorize the city. Your team of secret agents has tracked him 
to his underground lab. You burst in to find… that it’s a trap! Dr. Schrödinger has slipped 
into the next room to activate his device and disabled the control
panel on the way out. Fortunately, your teammates are 
masters of spy-craft. Agent Delta has hacked 
into the control panel and managed to reactivate 
some of its functionality. Meanwhile, Agent Epsilon has
searched through surveillance to find the code for the door: 2, 10, 14. All you have to do is enter those numbers 
and you’ll be free. But there’s a problem. The control panel has only three buttons: one which adds 5 to the display number, one which adds 7, and one which takes the square root. You need to make the display output
the numbers 2, 10, and 14, 
in that order. It’s okay if it outputs different 
numbers in between, but there’s no way to reset the display, so once you get to 2, you’ll have to continue 
on to 10 and 14 from there. Not only that, Agent Delta explains that there are other traps 
built into the panel. If it ever shows the same number 
more than once, a number greater than 60, or a non-whole number, the room will explode. Right now, the display reads zero, 
and time is running out. There’s only one way to solve the puzzle,
with a few small variations. How will you input the code to escape 
from Dr. Schrödinger’s lair and save the day? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 2 1. You look over your options. Adding 5 or 7 increases the number, and the square root button 
will make it smaller. But there are only a few options 
where you can use that button: 4 9 16 25, 36, and 49. You’d love to make 4 or 16. Then you could hit the square root button 
once or twice to get 2. But you can’t make either with 
just the 5 and 7 buttons. What will you do? You look at the other possible options for
numbers you could take the square root of. Nine you can’t reach. Twenty-five and 49 would take you back to 
5 or 7, and you can already get to each
of those. Thirty-six is your only option. You add 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, and then hit the square root button. Why that series of 5s and 7s? It’s somewhat arbitrary, but you know that you want 
to avoid 10, 14, and perfect squares, since you’ll need them later. This gets you to 6. Does that help? Looking at your options,
you see that 16 is now in your sights. You add 5 twice more to reach it. Then hit square root twice. That gets you to 2. You’re on your way! Now to 10. You can’t get straight 
there through addition alone, so you’re going to have 
to reach another square. Taking the square root of 9 or 25 would 
get you to a good place, but it turns out that 25 
is unreachable from 2. So you add 7 to get to 9, then take the square root again. That gets you to 3. Adding 7 again makes 10. Finally, you need to reach 14. Thinking backwards, you imagine where 
you could be before 14: 7 or 9. But 9 won’t work because 
you’ve already used 9. However, you could get to 7 
by reaching 49 first. You add your way towards it, being careful not to hit any 
of the numbers you’ve hit so far. You thread your way carefully, adding five 5s and two 7s. Then, square root to 7, and add 7 more. The door opens, 
and you’re out of the trap. Thanks to your problem-solving skills, your team gets Schrödinger’s cats out 
of the box in the nick of time. As for Schrödinger, 
you can be certain of one thing: he’ll be spending quite some
time in a box of his own.

of those. Thirty-six is your only option. You add 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, and then hit the square root button. Why that series of 5s and 7s? It’s somewhat arbitrary, but you know that you want 
to avoid 10, 14, and perfect squares, since you’ll need them later. This gets you to 6. Does that help? Looking at your options,
you see that 16 is now in your sights. You add 5 twice more to reach it. Then hit square root twice. That gets you to 2. You’re on your way! Now to 10. You can’t get straight 
there through addition alone, so you’re going to have 
to reach another square. Taking the square root of 9 or 25 would 
get you to a good place, but it turns out that 25 
is unreachable from 2. So you add 7 to get to 9, then take the square root again. That gets you to 3. Adding 7 again makes 10. Finally, you need to reach 14. Thinking backwards, you imagine where 
you could be before 14: 7 or 9. But 9 won’t work because 
you’ve already used 9. However, you could get to 7 
by reaching 49 first. You add your way towards it, being careful not to hit any 
of the numbers you’ve hit so far. You thread your way carefully, adding five 5s and two 7s. Then, square root to 7, and add 7 more. The door opens,

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The villainous Dr. Schrödinger 
has developed a growth ray and intends to create 
an army of giant cats to terrorize the city. Your team of secret agents has tracked him 
to his underground lab. You burst in to find… that it’s a trap! Dr. Schrödinger has slipped 
into the next room to activate his device and disabled the control
panel on the way out. Fortunately, your teammates are 
masters of spy-craft. Agent Delta has hacked 
into the control panel and managed to reactivate 
some of its functionality. Meanwhile, Agent Epsilon has
searched through surveillance to find the code for the door: 2, 10, 14. All you have to do is enter those numbers 
and you’ll be free. But there’s a problem. The control panel has only three buttons: one which adds 5 to the display number, one which adds 7, and one which takes the square root. You need to make the display output
the numbers 2, 10, and 14, 
in that order. It’s okay if it outputs different 
numbers in between, but there’s no way to reset the display, so once you get to 2, you’ll have to continue 
on to 10 and 14 from there. Not only that, Agent Delta explains that there are other traps 
built into the panel. If it ever shows the same number 
more than once, a number greater than 60, or a non-whole number, the room will explode. Right now, the display reads zero, 
and time is running out. There’s only one way to solve the puzzle,
with a few small variations. How will you input the code to escape 
from Dr. Schrödinger’s lair and save the day? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 2 1. You look over your options. Adding 5 or 7 increases the number, and the square root button 
will make it smaller. But there are only a few options 
where you can use that button: 4 9 16 25, 36, and 49. You’d love to make 4 or 16. Then you could hit the square root button 
once or twice to get 2. But you can’t make either with 
just the 5 and 7 buttons. What will you do? You look at the other possible options for
numbers you could take the square root of. Nine you can’t reach. Twenty-five and 49 would take you back to 
5 or 7, and you can already get to each
of those. Thirty-six is your only option. You add 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, and then hit the square root button. Why that series of 5s and 7s? It’s somewhat arbitrary, but you know that you want

**Transcript**:
Do you think you got the best start in life? Did you end-up in a school that might have
resembled a zoo more than it felt like an institution of higher learning? Perhaps in the past, getting by without a
lot of pieces of paper to defend your intelligence may have been harder, given that nowadays
we can learn so much online and that many of the world’s leading and richest entrepreneurs
dropped out of university. Had they have dropped out of high school,
that could have been a different matter, but many great minds have not been too keen on
school. One of those minds was Albert Einstein, who
famously said, “Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned
in school.” So does it matter where you go? That’s what we’ll find out today, in this
episode of the Infographics Show, Private School vs. Public School. Don’t forget to subscribe and click the
bell button so that you can be part of our Notification Squad. First of all, we should say that by “public
school” we mean schools that are run by the government. This could be confusing for Brits as when
they say public school, they are not thinking of schools run by the public sector, but selective
institutions that demand private payment. Basically, private school as Americans know
it, is public school in the UK. It’s another case of that “my tom-ate-o”
and your “tom-art-o”. We’ll base this show on the U.S. today,
as covering the globe’s schools would be impossible, and some of the things we will
discuss are relevant globally. You might be surprised to know that in the
USA, according to the Council for American Private Education, there are 33,619 private
schools in the United States. There are around 5.1 million students enrolled
in these schools. It’s said that private schools are home
to almost 10 percent of all school students in the U.S. The same source states that there are 441,496
teachers working full-time in private schools. As much as 79 percent of these schools have
a religious affiliation. The Washington Post reported in 2016 that
these schools are “virtually all-white”, with non-white students only making up around
10 percent of students across the country. As for public schools, according to the National
Center for Educational Statistics, 50.7 million public school students will be studying in
one of them from prekindergarten to grade 12 in fall 2017. Teaching all those kids will be 3.2 million
full-time teachers, which is a ratio of 16 students for every teacher. The ratio in private school is 12 students
for one teacher. One of the main differences of public school
is the mixed ethnicity of students. Public schools in America are made up of 24.4
million white kids, 13.6 million Hispanic students, 8.0 million black students, 2.8
million Asian/Pacific Islander students, 0.5 million American Indian/Alaska Native students,
and 1.5 million mixed race students. What about costs? Well, the government pays for public schools. In 2017-18 it’s projected that the budget
for public schools will be $623.5 billion. This means that each student will cost on
average $12,300. Taxes will pay for this. Private schools are a different matter, and
they are funded by tuition fees. Tuition costs will change depending on the
school. For the year 2017-18, the national average
for private school tuition is $9,975 per year, which is $8,918 per year for elementary schooling
and $13,524 per year for high school. The state of Vermont had the highest average,
with high school being $31,543 per year on average. If you are looking for cheap private schooling,
head to West Virginia where the average cost for high school is currently $5,262. We should add that a handful of private schools
cost around the $50,000 a year mark. So, what do you get for your money besides
pretty gardens and obviously top-notch facilities at a private school, and perhaps metal detectors
and patrolling policemen in some wayward public schools? Well, when it comes to the syllabi, public
schools have to adhere to state standards while private schools have much more flexibility. This is seen as getting a better and more
diverse education. The good news for not so wealthy people is
that high school graduation rates in public schools has gone up recently. It reached its highest during the Obama administration
in 2015 at 83.2 percent of students graduating. At the same time, 95 percent of private school
students graduate. According to the website College Admission,
just about all of those private school grads will attend a university, whereas only 49
percent of public school graduates will enter further education at college. If you want to get into an Ivy League University,
there’s no reason why you can’t get in after attending public school. Top Tier Admissions tells us that roughly
25 percent of successful applicants to those top universities came from private schools,
and 60-70 percent from public schools. The rest were homeschooled. Private school does work for a lot of people. The richest man in the world, Bill Gates,
went to a private prep school…but then he later dropped out of Harvard. On the other hand, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg
went to a public school. When researching for how private school graduates
out earn other kids in the future, most of the stories are about the UK and how private
(or public) school there seems to create most of the UK’s millionaires. The U.S. playing field might be a bit more
level, after all, Dr. Dre didn’t go to private school. It seems in the U.S. if you actually get to
university, it might not matter where you studied in high school in terms of “making
it”. At the same time, studies have found that
being born with a silver spoon usually means you’ll be passing that spoon on, and poorer
folks with degrees don’t usually jump up a class. Your background makes all the difference. A college degree, says one report, is no great
equalizer. Why is this? “There are a host of possibilities, from
family resources during childhood and the place where one grew up, to the colleges that
low-income students attend,” said the report. Then you have rich folks that dropped out
of high school, such as the billionaire Tumblr founder David Karp, who dropped out of high
school at 15 years old. Joining him as a high school dropout is Facebook’s
former product manager Mike Hudack and filmmaker Quentin Tarantino. In light of the last person, success in the
arts or sport probably is not related to if you went to public or private school, but
if you want “social mobility” then it’s probably better your parents paid the cash
for your education. It also seems that the filmmaker is the only
one of the three to have come from a humble background. You may have some unique skills, or be a natural
autodidact (learn by yourself), and so school doesn’t matter much even if you are poor. Nonetheless, we can’t ignore some statistics. The Bureau of Labor Statistics states that
people without a high school diploma will earn on average $25,636 per year if in full-time
employment. 8 percent of high school dropouts are currently
unemployed. If you have a high school diploma and nothing
else, the average wage is $35,256 per year with 5.4 percent of those people currently
unemployed. If you have a bachelor’s degree, you might
earn an average of $59,124 per year. Only 2.8 percent of Americans with a bachelor’s
degree are unemployed, much less than the 4.4 percent of Americans currently out of
a job. In conclusion, it’s odds on that if you
went to private school then you most certainly went to university, and with some family wealth
behind you, it’s also pretty much a certainty you fell into one of these higher wage brackets. Then again, if you are brilliant, or spend
more time reading than scrolling, then it is likely nothing will hold you back. So, what do you think...is private school
worth the extra dough, or is it all just a bunch of hoo-ey? Let us know in the comments! Also, be sure to check out our other video

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Honey. You’ve met honey. It’s that sticky, sweet stuff. Basically just slightly liquidy sugar in a
plastic bear bottle, right? Wrong! Honey is a supercharged bacteria-killing powerhouse. And it’s all down to what those hardworking
bees put into it, from immune proteins to the sugar itself. Since ancient times, honey has been used to
prevent wounds from getting infected. And these days, we use purified and standardized
versions of honey to fight infections in hospitals. Honey has three main tricks for fighting bacteria. The first is all that sugar. Honey is only about 17% water. Most--but not all--of what remains is sugar. The two main types of sugar in honey are glucose
and fructose. Like all sugars, glucose and fructose are
sticky -- they attract water. Honey is technically a supersaturated solution,
meaning it contains more sugar than would normally dissolve at that temperature. That’s why it eventually gets all crystally
in the pantry -- over time, the sugar comes out of the solution. Chemically speaking, it’s desperate for
water. Water can travel across cell membranes from
where there’s a higher concentration of water to where there’s a lower concentration. And there’s a higher concentration of water
in a bacterium than in honey. Which means that honey will suck the juices
right out of any bacterium -- or mold, or fungus -- that tries to set up shop. Plus, there’s isn’t enough water in honey
for any microorganisms to live on. So they die, and the honey doesn’t spoil. The second thing, is that when bees make honey,
they throw in an enzyme called glucose oxidase. And bacteria hate glucose oxidase because
it produces two different compounds. It converts glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen
peroxide. Gluconic acid is, you guessed it, an acid. It gives honey a pH value of less than 4. That’s about a thousand times more acidic
than the neutral pH of 7 that most bacteria need to grow. And hydrogen peroxide is very good at killing
cells. It destroys the cell walls of bacteria, which
breaks them apart. Glucose oxidase isn’t active in ripe honey--there’s
not enough water for it to work properly. It seems to be there to keep the honey from
spoiling while the bees are drying it out. But if you dilute honey, the glucose oxidase
will switch back on and make gluconic acid again. The final thing bees do to make honey antibacterial? They put antibiotics in it. Some types of honey contain a protein called
bee defensin-1, which is exactly what it sounds like. Bee defensin-1 defends bees. It’s part of their immune system and protects
them from certain bacteria, including ones that could cause nasty diseases inside the
hive. It’s produced in a gland that bees use to
make honey, so it makes sense that some of it would make it into the finished product. And while scientists aren’t sure how much
of the protein is really in honey, it sort of makes sense that bees would use it to protect
their food. Another antibacterial compound sometimes found
in honey is methylglyoxal. Methylglyoxal is a small organic molecule
that forms in honey from a compound in the nectar of certain flowers. There’s an especially large amount of methylglyoxal
in manuka honey, a honey made from a New Zealand flower. This honey is so good at killing bacteria
that it’s actually used in hospitals. There’s one bacterium that has honey’s
number--but only sort of. It’s the type of bacteria that that causes
botulism. The bacteria start out as spores, which are
very hard to kill. They’re already dried out, so honey’s
water-sucking properties don’t kill them, and because the spores aren’t growing, they
aren’t affected by the acidity or the antibiotic compounds. The really dangerous part of the bacteria
is the botulinum toxin they produce when they grow into mature bacteria. Less than a hundred nanograms -- that’s
billionths of a gram -- is enough to kill an adult. About 10% of honeys have some botulinum spores
in them. But since the spores in honey aren’t growing
and making toxin, they’re harmless to healthy adults. Our immune systems intercept the spores before
they can start growing inside of us. But the immune systems of infants aren’t
always able to kill those spores before they start growing. So, in rare cases, the bacteria can germinate
and start producing toxin. That’s why it’s not safe to give honey
to infants under one year old, but the rest of us don’t need to worry about it. So the next time you’re looking for something
sweet, go ahead -- eat some of bacteria’s worst enemy. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

**Transcript**:
What mammal has 
the social life of an insect, the cold-bloodedness of a reptile, and the metabolism of a plant? Bald and buck-toothed, naked mole rats 
may not be pretty, but they’re extraordinary. With a lifespan of 30 years, their peculiar traits have evolved 
over millions of years to make them uniquely suited 
to survive harsh conditions, especially long periods without oxygen. In the deserts of East Africa, 
naked mole rats feed on root vegetables. They dig for the roots with teeth that
can move independently, like chopsticks. But even with these special teeth, a single naked mole rat doesn’t stand 
a chance of finding enough food; the roots are large and
nutritious, but scattered far and wide. A large workforce has 
a much better chance, so naked mole rats live in colonies. Similar to ants, bees, and termites, 
they build giant nests. Housing up to 300 mole rats, these colonies feature complex 
underground tunnel systems, nest chambers, and community bathrooms. Also like insects, naked mole rats 
have a rigid social structure. The dominant female, the queen, and two to three males 
that she chooses, are the only naked mole rats 
in the colony who have babies. All the other naked mole rats, male and female, are either soldiers, who defend 
the colony from possible invaders, or workers. Teams of workers are dispatched 
to hunt for roots, and their harvest feeds the whole colony. Living in a colony helps naked mole rats 
find enough food, but when so many animals live in 
the same underground space, oxygen quickly runs out. Mammals need a lot of oxygen; we use it to make the energy 
that fuels everything from maintaining our body temperatures to our heartbeats to voluntary movements. Without oxygen, we quickly die. In fact, no other mammal could survive 
the oxygen depletion experienced in a naked mole rat colony. Naked mole rats can thrive in low oxygen in part because they’ve abandoned 
one of the body functions that requires the most oxygen: thermoregulation. Most mammals are warm-blooded, meaning they have to keep 
their body temperature consistent. Naked mole rats don’t get enough 
oxygen to do this. Instead, they’re the only mammals whose body temperature fluctuates 
with their environment, making them cold-blooded, like reptiles. They also have a special 
type of hemoglobin, the molecule in the blood 
that transports oxygen. Their hemoglobin is much stickier 
for oxygen than ours and can pick oxygen up 
even when it’s scarce. In response to a real oxygen emergency, naked mole rats enter 
a state of suspended animation. They stop moving, slow their breathing, and dramatically lower their heart rate. This greatly reduces the amount of energy,
and therefore oxygen, they need. At the same time, they begin 
to metabolize fructose, like a plant. Fructose is a sugar that can be used 
to make energy without burning oxygen. Usually, mammals metabolize 
a different sugar called glucose that makes more energy than fructose, but glucose only works 
when oxygen’s available. Human brain and heart cells have 
some cellular machinery to use fructose, but not nearly as much as naked mole rats. Naked mole rats are, in fact, the only
mammals known to have this ability. While we can hope humans won’t ever need to exclusively live 
in underground tunnels, there are many situations where 
we would benefit from needing less oxygen. During heart attacks 
and other medical emergencies, people often die or sustain debilitating 
organ damage from oxygen deprivation. Could we replicate the naked mole rat’s 
use of the fructose pathway for human health? It took millions of years of evolution 
to bring the behavior of an insect, the temperature regulation of a reptile, and the energy production of a plant together in one little mammal, but maybe, with enough study, we can replicate just a few 
of their wild adaptations.

**Transcript**:
What mammal has 
the social life of an insect, the cold-bloodedness of a reptile, and the metabolism of a plant? Bald and buck-toothed, naked mole rats 
may not be pretty, but they’re extraordinary. With a lifespan of 30 years, their peculiar traits have evolved 
over millions of years to make them uniquely suited 
to survive harsh conditions, especially long periods without oxygen. In the deserts of East Africa, 
naked mole rats feed on root vegetables. They dig for the roots with teeth that
can move independently, like chopsticks. But even with these special teeth, a single naked mole rat doesn’t stand 
a chance of finding enough food; the roots are large and
nutritious, but scattered far and wide. A large workforce has 
a much better chance, so naked mole rats live in colonies. Similar to ants, bees, and termites, 
they build giant nests. Housing up to 300 mole rats, these colonies feature complex 
underground tunnel systems, nest chambers, and community bathrooms. Also like insects, naked mole rats 
have a rigid social structure. The dominant female, the queen, and two to three males 
that she chooses, are the only naked mole rats 
in the colony who have babies. All the other naked mole rats, male and female, are either soldiers, who defend 
the colony from possible invaders, or workers. Teams of workers are dispatched 
to hunt for roots, and their harvest feeds the whole colony. Living in a colony helps naked mole rats 
find enough food, but when so many animals live in 
the same underground space, oxygen quickly runs out. Mammals need a lot of oxygen; we use it to make the energy 
that fuels everything from maintaining our body temperatures to our heartbeats to voluntary movements. Without oxygen, we quickly die. In fact, no other mammal could survive 
the oxygen depletion experienced in a naked mole rat colony. Naked mole rats can thrive in low oxygen in part because they’ve abandoned 
one of the body functions that requires the most oxygen: thermoregulation. Most mammals are warm-blooded, meaning they have to keep 
their body temperature consistent. Naked mole rats don’t get enough 
oxygen to do this. Instead, they’re the only mammals whose body temperature fluctuates 
with their environment, making them cold-blooded, like reptiles. They also have a special 
type of hemoglobin, the molecule in the blood 
that transports oxygen. Their hemoglobin is much stickier 
for oxygen than ours and can pick oxygen up 
even when it’s scarce. In response to a real oxygen emergency, naked mole rats enter 
a state of suspended animation. They stop moving, slow their breathing, and dramatically lower their heart rate. This greatly reduces the amount of energy,
and therefore oxygen, they need. At the same time, they begin 
to metabolize fructose, like a plant. Fructose is a sugar that can be used 
to make energy without burning oxygen. Usually, mammals metabolize 
a different sugar called glucose that makes more energy than fructose, but glucose only works 
when oxygen’s available. Human brain and heart cells have 
some cellular machinery to use fructose, but not nearly as much as naked mole rats. Naked mole rats are, in fact, the only
mammals known to have this ability. While we can hope humans won’t ever need to exclusively live 
in underground tunnels, there are many situations where 
we would benefit from needing less oxygen. During heart attacks 
and other medical emergencies, people often die or sustain debilitating 
organ damage from oxygen deprivation. Could we replicate the naked mole rat’s 
use of the fructose pathway for human health? It took millions of years of evolution 
to bring the behavior of an insect, the temperature regulation of a reptile, and the energy production of a plant together in one little mammal, but maybe, with enough study, we can replicate just a few 
of their wild adaptations.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: During an oxygen deprivation emergency, what do naked mole rats do?
Options: A. Enter a state of suspended animation, B. Increase their heart rate, C. Run around looking for more oxygen, D. Breathe as fast as they can
Correct Option: A

**Transcript**:
Meet Dermatophagoides farinae. Crawling around on eight legs, this creature has no eyes to appreciate 
the kaleidoscope of colors around her. She relies on her extraordinary 
sense of smell to lead her to food 
and safe places to lay eggs. And she’s smaller than a pinhead. Dermatophagoides farinae is a dust mite. Less than a tenth the size of an ant, a dust mite’s whole world is contained 
in the dusty film under a bed or in a forgotten corner. This realm is right under our noses,
but from our perspective, the tiny specks of brilliant color 
blend together into a nondescript grey. What are these colorful 
microscopic particles? What distinguishes the dust in your
house from, say, sand on a beach is that it is a mixture 
of many different ingredients. It can contain grains of sand, dead skin cells, tiny hairs and threads, animal dander, pollen, manmade pollutants, minerals from outer space, and, of course, dust mites. Dust mites eat animal dander, human skin, and some fungi. We shed dead skin cells constantly, and wherever we live, 
they mix into the household dust. The same goes for our pets: their dander and hairs enter the mix, as do tiny pieces of thread and cotton
fibers from our clothes. These components make 
every household’s dust a unique blend of bits 
from its particular inhabitants. Household dust also contains substances 
that blow in from the wider world. Depending on the local geology, finely ground quartz, coal, 
or volcanic ash might enter the air as atmospheric dust, along with pollen and fungal spores. Industrial activities also contribute 
cement powder, particles from car tires, and other chemicals to the airborne mix. The combination of these elements 
can be as unique as a fingerprint. In Spain, where the land 
is rich in carbonate materials, dust contains 20 times as much calcium 
as dust in Nigeria, where the geology is quite different. After a particularly violent storm, scientists identified dust from 
the Sahara Desert thousands of miles away in London, based on its specific composition. In the future, we may be able to pinpoint the origins 
of dust samples even more specifically, down to a particular neighborhood 
or even house - something that may be 
of great help for forensic specialists. In addition to markers of humans, 
animals, and landscapes, dust also contains particles
from further afield. When a star explodes in a distant galaxy, super hot gases vaporize 
everything nearby. Then, the dust settles;
minerals condense out of the gas. Floating out there between planets 
and galaxies, this extraterrestrial dust contains 
tiny pieces of extinguished stars and the building blocks 
of future celestial bodies. Every year, tens of thousands 
of tons of cosmic dust lands on Earth and mingles 
with terrestrial minerals. This blend of chemicals, minerals, 
and intergalactic particles settles out of the air onto
surfaces in our homes, mixing with the detritus 
of each house’s occupants. Stars explode, mountains erode, and buildings, plants, and animals are all slowly but surely 
pulverized into fine grey powder. We’re all destined to become dust, but it’s also possible 
that we came from it. Interstellar dust has been found 
to carry organic compounds through space. It’s possible that 
billions of years ago, some of these cosmic particles 
were the seed of life on our little blue planet.

that we came from it. Interstellar dust has been found 
to carry organic compounds through space. It’s possible that 
billions of years ago, some of these cosmic particles

**Transcript**:
Meet Dermatophagoides farinae. Crawling around on eight legs, this creature has no eyes to appreciate 
the kaleidoscope of colors around her. She relies on her extraordinary 
sense of smell to lead her to food 
and safe places to lay eggs. And she’s smaller than a pinhead. Dermatophagoides farinae is a dust mite. Less than a tenth the size of an ant, a dust mite’s whole world is contained 
in the dusty film under a bed or in a forgotten corner. This realm is right under our noses,
but from our perspective, the tiny specks of brilliant color 
blend together into a nondescript grey. What are these colorful 
microscopic particles? What distinguishes the dust in your
house from, say, sand on a beach is that it is a mixture 
of many different ingredients. It can contain grains of sand, dead skin cells, tiny hairs and threads, animal dander, pollen, manmade pollutants, minerals from outer space, and, of course, dust mites. Dust mites eat animal dander, human skin, and some fungi. We shed dead skin cells constantly, and wherever we live, 
they mix into the household dust. The same goes for our pets: their dander and hairs enter the mix, as do tiny pieces of thread and cotton
fibers from our clothes. These components make 
every household’s dust a unique blend of bits 
from its particular inhabitants. Household dust also contains substances 
that blow in from the wider world. Depending on the local geology, finely ground quartz, coal, 
or volcanic ash might enter the air as atmospheric dust, along with pollen and fungal spores. Industrial activities also contribute 
cement powder, particles from car tires, and other chemicals to the airborne mix. The combination of these elements 
can be as unique as a fingerprint. In Spain, where the land 
is rich in carbonate materials, dust contains 20 times as much calcium 
as dust in Nigeria, where the geology is quite different. After a particularly violent storm, scientists identified dust from 
the Sahara Desert thousands of miles away in London, based on its specific composition. In the future, we may be able to pinpoint the origins 
of dust samples even more specifically, down to a particular neighborhood 
or even house - something that may be 
of great help for forensic specialists. In addition to markers of humans, 
animals, and landscapes, dust also contains particles
from further afield. When a star explodes in a distant galaxy, super hot gases vaporize 
everything nearby. Then, the dust settles;

**Transcript**:
Two millennia before the likes of Usain Bolt
came onto the scene, humans were pitting their strength and speed against each other. It’s thought that the first Olympic games
were held in 776 BC in ancient Greece, and the tradition carried on under the Roman Empire. An Olympic Truce was even established by the
Greeks which was expected to be adhered to so people could spectate and compete in safety. The 4 year tradition, and in some ways the
truce, is upheld today, just with much stronger and faster people competing. The closest the ancients had to a vehicle
race was with chariots, and you could say that humanity has significantly improved when
it comes to speed on wheels. Today we are going to look at what speed humans
are capable of, in this episode of The Infographics Show, How Fast Can We Go? Don’t forget to subscribe and click the
bell button so that you can be part of our Notification Squad. We’ll start with our bodies. Maybe the best of the ancient runners was
Leonidas of Rhodes who won three stade, sprint races, (including the 200 yards and 400 yards)
in each of four consecutive Olympics from 164-152 BCE. The main event was the 200 yards (about 180
meters) which was the equivalent of the modern 100 meters. He was regarded as the Usain Bolt of today,
or the Michael Johnson of not so long ago, and was even winning races at the ripe old
age of 36. His medal tally was only beaten 2,168 years
later by swimmer Michael Phelps. No one knows of course how fast he ran, but
guesses range from 24-26 seconds for 180 meters. The fastest recorded 100 meters time is held
by Usain Bolt at 9.58 seconds, which means he was running at an average of 10.43 meters
per second or 23.34 mph (37.6 kph). It’s thought that at about 68 meters, he
hit his fastest speed, which was 12.34 meters per second or 27.61 mph (44.4 kph). This is about as fast as any human has ever
run, and it’s about the speed of a galloping horse. We can compare that to one of the earliest
recorded sprint records, that of American sprinter Tom Burke who won the 100 meters
at Athens in 1896 in a time of 12 seconds. While Bolt would be able to outrun a Velociraptor,
he would not be able to keep it up for long. The fastest recorded long distance time was
set by Kenyan Dennis Kimetto in 2014. His time for the marathon was 2 hours 2 minutes
and 57 seconds. This averaged at 4 minutes 41 seconds a mile. It’s thought a sub-2 hour marathon time
is on the way, which means running the entire 26.2 miles (42 kilometers) at 13.1 mph (21
kph). Try that at the gym on the treadmill for even
a few hundred meters and you’ll see just how incredible this man is. The average adult male jogs at about 8.3 mph
(13.3 kph), which is a 27 second 100 meters. Women jog at an average of 6.5 mph (10.4 kph)
or a 34 second 100 meters. It’s thought that even fit and healthy non-athlete
adults that can run very well will only average around 15.9 miles per hour (25.5 kph), which
would mean a 100 meter time of around 13-14 seconds. The average healthy human walks at around
3 miles per hour (4.8 kph). Let’s now have a look at swimming. It’s reported that almost half of the world’s
population can’t swim, including 44 percent of Americans according to the U.S. Red Cross. Although the report said some people believed
they could swim, but weren’t able to swim well enough to be adjudged safe in the water. The fastest person in the world, ever, is
Brazilian César Cielo. Much has been said about the great Michael
Phelps taking on a great white shark in a race, but in terms of raw speed he’s slower
than Cielo. His time of 46.91 seconds in the 100 meters
freestyle is the fastest a human has ever swum, giving him an average speed of about
5.3 mph (8.5 kph). That’s faster than the average jogging speed
of the average male. It’s thought Phelps’ average speed when
he won gold in the 100 meters freestyle relay was about 4.7 mph (7.5 mph). The two men are about the same speed as the
average cod, but both would get trounced in a race with a great white shark that can reach
speeds of 25 mph (40kph). The average human that can swim freestyle
is a speed of just 2 mph (3.2 kph). But how fast has a human ever travelled? That would be astronauts on NASA’s Apollo
10 mission when they reached a top speed of 24,791 mph (39,897 kph). Elon Musk’s SpaceX plans to colonize Mars,
and to get there they need a fair bit of power. The rocket which will be used is nicknamed
the BFS, and SpaceX says it will reach cruising speeds of 62,000 mph (99.77 thousand kph). British Royal Air Force fighter pilot Andy
Green holds the world land speed record, set in 1997. He got up to 763 mph (1,227 kph) in his Thrust
supersonic car in the Black Rock desert, USA. In 1898 a Frenchman broke the same land speed
record in his electric car, reaching a speed of 39.24 mph (63 kph). The fastest two wheels have ever gone is 394
mph (634 kph) with the TOP 1 Ack Attack ridden by Rocky Robinson at the Bonneville Speedway
in Utah. These machines are not built for the road,
however, but some road cars and bikes can reach impressive speeds. The Bugatti Veyron is listed as the world’s
fastest road car, able to reach speeds of 268 mph (431 kph) and the fastest thing on
two wheels on the road is the Kawasaki Ninja H2R. It can reach speeds of 249 mph (400 kph). The fastest person on a bicycle was Dutch
cyclist Fred Rompelberg, who travelled at a speed of 167 mph (268 kph) in 1995. As for rail, the winner for the fastest speed
is US air force colonel John Stapp, who reached 632 mph (1017 kph) on his rocket sled. Passenger trains don’t get anywhere near
that, but some are very fast. The French TVG has an average speed when taking
folks around France of about 200 mph (321 kph), but it also holds the record for the
fastest speed ever on a national rail system of 357 mph (574 kph). At that speed you could realistically commute
from Paris to offices in the UK, Germany, Spain, and other nations surrounding France. Japan’s magnetically levitated MLX01 maglev
has hit a speed of 361 mph (580 kph), but that was only in testing. Many countries are presently developing high-speed
trains as an alternative to air and road travel. You’d think the perfect country for such
a system would be the United States, given its size, population, and long distances its
citizens often travel. This is actually a matter of controversy,
as an article in Forbes points out in 2017. There are many reasons, and one is that the
U.S. as you’ll know from our other shows spends little on transportation compared to
its military. Andy Kunz, president of the U.S. High Speed Rail Association, once said in
an interview that lobbying efforts Spirit of Australiafrom oil, aviation and highway
companies were also blocking high-speed rail advancement. Perhaps Elon Musk’s Boring Company and its
underground Hyperloop project might happen before high-speed rail. On water the record was set by Australian
Ken Warby in his Spirit of Australia wooden speedboat, which reached 317.596 mph (511
kph) in 1978. It’s not a record many people try to break
as they often end up dead. Long-time British record holder Donald Campbell
was one of those people, and there were many more. Record holder Warby told Wired in an interview
after he retired, “When you look down that lake, you better have all your homework done,
because your chances are 50-50 – and you better be in the right 50 percent.” It might be safer to travel by ocean liner. The fastest was the SS United States, that
averaged a speed of 29 mph (62 kph). The Titanic was a good 8 mph slower. Finally, we take to the air. Surprisingly, the record set for a manned
aircraft was as far back as 1967. That was when a hypersonic rocket-powered
aircraft called the North American X-15 hit a speed of 4,520 mph (7,274 kph) with American
air force pilot William Knight at the controls. Passenger jets average a speed of 575 mph
(925 kph) but may reach up to about 745 mph (1198 kph). The fastest ever passenger plane was the British-French
made Concorde, which reached speeds of 1,354 mph (2,180 kph). A plane called the Baby Boom is set to beat
that speed in 2023, but it will be a much smaller machine. That’s the end of the show today. Why not tell us your fastest speed? Are you better than the average Joe? What’s the fastest you’ve ever travelled,
on land, in the water, in the air? Let us know in the comments! And if you liked this video, be sure to check

has hit a speed of 361 mph (580 kph), but that was only in testing. Many countries are presently developing high-speed
trains as an alternative to air and road travel. You’d think the perfect country for such
a system would be the United States, given its size, population, and long distances its
citizens often travel. This is actually a matter of controversy,
as an article in Forbes points out in 2017. There are many reasons, and one is that the
U.S. as you’ll know from our other shows spends little on transportation compared to
its military. Andy Kunz, president of the U.S. High Speed Rail Association, once said in
an interview that lobbying efforts Spirit of Australiafrom oil, aviation and highway
companies were also blocking high-speed rail advancement. Perhaps Elon Musk’s Boring Company and its
underground Hyperloop project might happen before high-speed rail. On water the record was set by Australian
Ken Warby in his Spirit of Australia wooden speedboat, which reached 317.596 mph (511
kph) in 1978. It’s not a record many people try to break
as they often end up dead. Long-time British record holder Donald Campbell
was one of those people, and there were many more. Record holder Warby told Wired in an interview
after he retired, “When you look down that lake, you better have all your homework done,
because your chances are 50-50 – and you better be in the right 50 percent.” It might be safer to travel by ocean liner. The fastest was the SS United States, that
averaged a speed of 29 mph (62 kph). The Titanic was a good 8 mph slower. Finally, we take to the air. Surprisingly, the record set for a manned
aircraft was as far back as 1967. That was when a hypersonic rocket-powered
aircraft called the North American X-15 hit a speed of 4,520 mph (7,274 kph) with American
air force pilot William Knight at the controls. Passenger jets average a speed of 575 mph
(925 kph) but may reach up to about 745 mph (1198 kph). The fastest ever passenger plane was the British-French
made Concorde, which reached speeds of 1,354 mph (2,180 kph). A plane called the Baby Boom is set to beat
that speed in 2023, but it will be a much smaller machine. That’s the end of the show today. Why not tell us your fastest speed? Are you better than the average Joe? What’s the fastest you’ve ever travelled,
on land, in the water, in the air? Let us know in the comments! And if you liked this video, be sure to check

**Transcript**:
Hey there! Welcome to Life Noggin! If you’ve never had a nosebleed before,
the first one can be terrifying. Especially if you’re young when it happens and have
no idea what’s going on. All you know is that blood is leaking out of your face...for
no reason. But of course, now that you are older you
know that there is a reason your nose started to bleed...you were experiencing a condition
known as epistaxis. When this occurs, it can be one of two types: anterior or posterior.
More than likely, you’ll get an anterior nosebleed which is caused by irritation to
blood vessels in the nasal septum. That’s the part of your nose that separates
your two nostrils. And it’s also the part of your nose that can get deviated, which
can lead to difficulty breathing. And fun fact: it’s estimated that 80% of people
have some type of misalignment to their nasal septum. If I had a nose, I could attest to
that, but sadly my face is pretty featureless. As you can see. But a block can dream! Anyway, in the nasal septum is an area called
the Kiesselbach plexus, where four different arteries come together to form a network of
blood vessels. So, when this area is irritated by either a vigorous blow or a roaming finger,
some of the blood vessels may break. And then you get blood running down your face and possibly
down the back of your throat. But what about dry air? In the northern hemisphere,
winter is coming up and with it comes a lot of nosebleeds. The decreased humidity and
temperature prevent your nose from getting the moisture it needs. This then makes the
mucous membrane more susceptible to bleeding and...Voila! You’ve got blood leaking down
your nostril. The only thing more unappealing than that is saying the words “mucous membrane.” So how do you stop the blood? It’s recommended
that you pinch the soft part of your nose for ten minutes, making sure to keep the nostrils
closed. This pressure helps the blood to clot and stops the bleeding. Oh, and lean forward
during this because otherwise, as I previously mentioned, blood can leak down the back of
your throat. (Which you don't want.) However, if you are lucky enough to be near a doctor when you get a nosebleed,
if they can easily see the broken blood vessel, they may be able to cauterize, or seal, it
using silver nitrate. So do yourself a favor and keep all fingers
and foreign objects away from your nostrils. Your nose and future self will thank you. Have you ever had a nosebleed? Do you get them often?  If you're comfortable with sharing let us know in the comments or tell us what we should we talk about next. And if you want even more Life Noggin, check out this video we did on would happen if all cat suddenly died. Yeah!

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You’ve been chosen as a champion 
to represent your wizarding house in a deadly duel against
two rival magic schools. Your opponents are fearsome. From the Newt-niz school, a powerful sorcerer wields a wand
that can turn people into fish, but his spell only works 70% of the time. And from the Leib-ton school, an even more powerful enchantress wields 
a wand that turns people to statues, and it works 90% of the time. Lots are drawn, and you’re chosen 
to cast the first spell in the duel. The Newt-niz magician will go second, and the Leib-ton enchantress third, after which you’ll repeat casting in
that order until only one of you is left. The rules of magic duels are strict, and anyone who casts out of
order immediately forfeits the duel. Also, to prevent draws, the rules stipulate that 
if everyone’s still standing at the end of the first round, you’ll all be turned into cats. Now, you must choose a wand. Your wizarding house presents you 
with three options: the Bannekar, which binds 
one target with vines and casts effectively 60% of the time, the Gaussian, 
which turns one target into a tree and works 80% of the time, and the incredibly rare Noether 9000, which banishes one target 
to a distant mountaintop and casts perfectly 100% of the time. Your opponents are masters of strategy, 
as well as sorcery, and you know they’ll make the choices that
maximize their own chances of success. Which wand should you choose and what strategy should you employ to have the greatest chance 
of winning the duel? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You reach for the Noether 9000 first. After all, it makes sense to enter 
the duel with the most powerful wand. But before you pick it up, you consider 
what would happen. As the most dangerous wizard, you’d also be the target 
of the other two magicians, and you’d need to take 
care of the most dangerous of them first. But afterward, there’s a 70% chance you'd
be struck down by the remaining wizard. That’s trouble. Maybe it’s better to take the Gaussian. It works 80% of the time, which means you wouldn’t be a target
until the enchantress was incapacitated. But if you succeeded in transforming her, you’d probably be turned 
into a fish immediately after. If you transformed the sorcerer, the enchantress would almost 
certainly turn you to stone. It would really be better if you missed. And that’s when you have an idea: what if you took the Gaussian, 
then missed on purpose? Then, you would wait for the sorcerer 
to attack the enchantress, and you’d have an 80% chance 
of winning against the sorcerer. It’s a good idea, but there’s a problem; the sorcerer could also pass his turn and the enchantress, knowing that
she couldn’t pass without becoming a cat, would cast her spell on one of you. And since you’re the most dangerous 
between you and the sorcerer, you’d be the target. And that’s when you see 
what you really need to do: take the weakest wand, the Bannekar,
and miss on purpose. Now the sorcerer knows that 
he’ll be targeted by the enchantress and he’ll have to try to turn her into 
a fish to avoid being turned into stone. Seventy percent of the time he’d succeed and you’d have a 60% chance 
of winning the duel at the beginning of the next round. If he fails, chances are he’ll be 
turned to stone and you’d still have a 60% chance of
winning the duel against the enchantress. There’s a slim 3% chance 
you’ll all be turned into cats, but when everything’s accounted for, you have better than even odds 
of winning with this strategy. And that’s the best you can do. Here’s what the probability of winning 
for the different strategies looks like. Who would’ve thought 
that the best way to take your shot would be to throw away your shot?

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 16, Ground Truth Question 4, Matched Generated Question 5
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You’ve been chosen as a champion 
to represent your wizarding house in a deadly duel against
two rival magic schools. Your opponents are fearsome. From the Newt-niz school, a powerful sorcerer wields a wand
that can turn people into fish, but his spell only works 70% of the time. And from the Leib-ton school, an even more powerful enchantress wields 
a wand that turns people to statues, and it works 90% of the time. Lots are drawn, and you’re chosen 
to cast the first spell in the duel. The Newt-niz magician will go second, and the Leib-ton enchantress third, after which you’ll repeat casting in
that order until only one of you is left. The rules of magic duels are strict, and anyone who casts out of
order immediately forfeits the duel. Also, to prevent draws, the rules stipulate that 
if everyone’s still standing at the end of the first round, you’ll all be turned into cats. Now, you must choose a wand. Your wizarding house presents you 
with three options: the Bannekar, which binds 
one target with vines and casts effectively 60% of the time, the Gaussian, 
which turns one target into a tree and works 80% of the time, and the incredibly rare Noether 9000, which banishes one target 
to a distant mountaintop and casts perfectly 100% of the time. Your opponents are masters of strategy, 
as well as sorcery, and you know they’ll make the choices that
maximize their own chances of success. Which wand should you choose and what strategy should you employ to have the greatest chance 
of winning the duel? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You reach for the Noether 9000 first. After all, it makes sense to enter 
the duel with the most powerful wand. But before you pick it up, you consider 
what would happen. As the most dangerous wizard, you’d also be the target 
of the other two magicians, and you’d need to take 
care of the most dangerous of them first. But afterward, there’s a 70% chance you'd
be struck down by the remaining wizard. That’s trouble. Maybe it’s better to take the Gaussian. It works 80% of the time, which means you wouldn’t be a target
until the enchantress was incapacitated. But if you succeeded in transforming her, you’d probably be turned 
into a fish immediately after. If you transformed the sorcerer, the enchantress would almost 
certainly turn you to stone. It would really be better if you missed. And that’s when you have an idea: what if you took the Gaussian, 
then missed on purpose? Then, you would wait for the sorcerer 
to attack the enchantress, and you’d have an 80% chance 
of winning against the sorcerer. It’s a good idea, but there’s a problem; the sorcerer could also pass his turn and the enchantress, knowing that
she couldn’t pass without becoming a cat, would cast her spell on one of you. And since you’re the most dangerous 
between you and the sorcerer, you’d be the target. And that’s when you see 
what you really need to do: take the weakest wand, the Bannekar,
and miss on purpose. Now the sorcerer knows that 
he’ll be targeted by the enchantress and he’ll have to try to turn her into 
a fish to avoid being turned into stone. Seventy percent of the time he’d succeed and you’d have a 60% chance 
of winning the duel at the beginning of the next round. If he fails, chances are he’ll be 
turned to stone and you’d still have a 60% chance of
winning the duel against the enchantress. There’s a slim 3% chance 
you’ll all be turned into cats, but when everything’s accounted for, you have better than even odds 
of winning with this strategy. And that’s the best you can do. Here’s what the probability of winning 
for the different strategies looks like. Who would’ve thought 
that the best way to take your shot would be to throw away your shot?

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You probably know the drill: You’re handed
an exam, and you’re told you need to fill out the bubbles completely, and then reminded
that -- for reasons that no one ever explains -- you can only use a number 2 pencil! Now, unless you’re an artist, you’ve probably
never even seen a pencil that’s not number 2, also known as an HB pencil outside the
U.S. The thing is, if you used any other kind of
pencil when you took an automatically-scored test, you’d probably be fine. However there are reasons that test instructions
still tell you to stick to number 2. And they have a lot to do with how machines
score your tests -- or at least, how they used to. In 1931, a high school physics teacher named
Reynold Johnson was grading exams when he wondered if there might be a way to score
them without actually having to go through every single answer by hand. He knew that graphite, the writing material
in pencils, was electrically conductive. It’s made of flat sheets of carbon, and
its outer electrons are relatively free to move around within the material. So Johnson devised a machine with many small
electrical circuits that would pass over an answer sheet. If there was a pencil mark on the sheet, it
would conduct electricity through one of the circuits, and the machine could record it
as an answer. Eventually, he sold the idea to IBM, which
produced the first mark-sensing machines. But the number 2 thing didn’t become an
issue until the next generation of machines were introduced in the 1960s and 70s. Those machines had light-sensing devices called
phototubes, and if they did not detect light in a certain spot, they recorded it as an
answer. That made graphite especially useful, because
it’s better at blocking light than many inks. Graphite reflects most light -- that’s why
pencil marks are so shiny -- and absorbs the rest, which is why it’s black. But for a long time, these optical mark-sensing
machines were very picky. And that’s where the different grades of
pencil came in. The graphite in pencils is held together by
clay, so manufacturers can control how soft or hard it is, and also how dark it is. The softer the graphite, the darker the pencil’s
mark. Pencils are labeled accordingly. In the United States, those labels are numbers. International manufacturers use a different
system, with HB corresponding to number 2. Number 2 pencils make marks that are just
dark enough to be sensed by the machine, but also light enough to be erased without leaving
a readable mark. These days, scoring machines use much more
advanced sensors that can detect almost any sort of marks you make, as long as they’re
in the bubbles. So you could probably take your next exam
with any kind of pencil you wanted. But your SATs probably aren’t the time to
test that hypothesis. Maybe bring a couple of number 2’s just
to be safe. Thanks for asking, and thanks especially to

One of the greatest and cruelest joys in the
world is tickling. I mean, who doesn't enjoy making somebody
laugh? Especially when they can't help but laugh. But when you think about it, tickling -- that's
just a weird thing. What is that? Why does it exist? The word "tickling" is actually an umbrella
term for two different phenomena. The first we're going to talk about is knismesis. That's the kind of itchy feeling that you
get when somebody puts a feather on your sensitive skin and it's like gnaaaah. That sensation creates a desire to, like,
rub or scratch, but it doesn't cause you to laugh. That kind of tickling is called gargalesis,
which is caused by a harder touch or stroke that unleashes a confusing cocktail of pain
and pleasure into the brain. Now, knismesis makes sense. If an insect or spider crawls on your leg,
you feel a tickling sensation, and you, you get it off. Knismesis is widespread in mammals: a horse
whips its tail when a fly lands on its back, and a cat's ears twitch when you brush 'em. Gargalesis, on the other hand -- and I love
that word -- is only experienced by primates, which include humans. When you tickle a chimp, it lets out a noiseless
pant that is the evolutionary precursor to a human laugh. And all us primates are ticklish in the same
spots: The ribs, under the arms, under the chin, near the femoral artery in the leg...
these are all vulnerable areas of the body, leading some psychologists to theorize that
gargalesis is an evolutionary mechanism that young apes and humans use to teach each other
how to protect themselves if attacked, the equivalent of, like, puppies play-fighting. We instinctively curl away from a tickle. We kick and twist, but we also laugh and smile,
which is an encouraging facial expression which tells the tickler, "More! Please!" If tickling induced a negative facial expression,
the thinking goes, then people wouldn't do it to each other, and we wouldn't learn how
to defend ourselves. So the next time you attack your brother with
a storm of tickle-fingers, you can say, "Dude. I'm just teaching you life skills!" Thanks for asking this fascinating question. Who knew it would be so interesting? And thanks especially to our Subbable subscribers,

how to protect themselves if attacked, the equivalent of, like, puppies play-fighting. We instinctively curl away from a tickle. We kick and twist, but we also laugh and smile,
which is an encouraging facial expression which tells the tickler, "More! Please!" If tickling induced a negative facial expression,
the thinking goes, then people wouldn't do it to each other, and we wouldn't learn how
to defend ourselves. So the next time you attack your brother with
a storm of tickle-fingers, you can say, "Dude. I'm just teaching you life skills!" Thanks for asking this fascinating question. Who knew it would be so interesting? And thanks especially to our Subbable subscribers,

**Transcript**:
Thank you to brilliant dot org for supporting
PBS Digital Studios. Sherlock Holmes, the legendary detective,
had a theory that the brain is like an attic where a person can only store a limited amount
of memories. Dr. Watson once told him that the Earth travels
around the sun, duh, to which Holmes replied, “Now that I do know it I shall do my best
to forget it.” Holmes figured, clutter your attic with random
facts and trivia, and you won’t have room for the things that matter, like identifying
the tiny differences between lethal poisons. Was Holmes right? Is our memory limited, like the storage capacity
of a computer? Or is our memory unlimited? And if we did have perfect memory, what would
life be like if you never forgot anything? [OPEN] The animated film Inside Out depicted memories
as glowing spheres stacked in the brain, like books in a library. But the reality is a little more complicated. There is no one place in the brain that serves
as our memory bank. Instead, individual memories are scattered
all over the brain. Many brain cells, in several different regions,
work together to make one memory. For example, a memory of eating grandma’s
apple pie might involve some brain cells to help you remember what the pie looked like,
others to remember the smell of the cinnamon, and even cells to remember the delicious taste
– just to name a few. In reality, though, a memory isn’t a physical
thing that we can find in any given brain cell. It’s an action, not an object. Think of baseball fans doing “the wave”:
no single fan IS the wave, the magic only happens when all the fans are together, doing
their thing in a specific order. In the same way, a memory only happens when
many connected neurons fire in a specific pattern. And because the same cells can fire in many
unique patterns, one group of neurons can encode multiple memories. This increases the memory storage capacity
of the brain. Buried deep in the middle of the brain we
find a group of cells shaped like a seahorse, which is why 18th century scientists named
this bit the ‘hippocampus.’ Without your seahorse, you might never remember. We owe a lot of our understanding of memories
to one famous patient, known for years only by his initials, H.M. In 1953, H.M. underwent a surgery for epilepsy
which demolished most of his hippocampus, and for the rest of his life, he exhibited
a severe type of amnesia where he was unable to form new memories of facts or events, but,
he was still able to remember things he had learned before the surgery. This showed us that the hippocampus is a key
to making memories, but that it isn’t where memories are stored. So how do experiences become memories? If we look inside the brain of a mouse in
a maze, we could draw a kind of map, showing which brain cells
are active as the mouse experiences something [mouse in maze]. Later, we would see
the mouse's brain cells firing in the same patterns, replaying the experience in fast
forward, over and over, backwards and forwards, to make the connections
between cells stronger. This is called consolidation, and it’s how
animals - including humans - commit new memories to long-term storage. Days or weeks later, a smell might trigger
this same pattern of cells nerve firing in the mouse brain, a recall of the maze memories
- just like smelling cinnamon might trigger memories of grandma for you. But the brain’s way of creating memories
isn’t foolproof. Sometimes, our mental replay of something
we only imagined can feel as vivid as a real experience. If you picture all the sights, smells, and
sounds of a crime scene from someone’s description, you activate similar brain networks as if
you had really been there. The more you replay the scene in your mind,
the more it feels like a real memory. That’s why a detective who asks leading
questions can inadvertently plant a false memory in a witness. We’re able to remember a lot, but we forget
even more. Some forgetting just happens, but our brains
also forget on purpose. We have at least three different ways of forgetting. The first is what happens when a memory fades
over time, so-called “passive oblivescence” (a term you will probably forget). This may happen because the connections between
brain cells gradually weaken over time; or perhaps the memory is still there, but you
might lose the triggers–sights, sounds, smells–you need to retrieve it. Another idea says memories could theoretically
last forever, but when the same neurons get used in other memories, this “interference”
disrupts the original memory. This slow fade type of forgetting happens
to all of us, eventually. A second type of forgetting–targeted forgetting–happens
at night while we sleep. This is when we clear out random, useless
tidbits of information we’ve learned during the day and erase outdated memories. For example, if yesterday, you thought Earth
was, say, a flat disk supported by three elephants, and today you learned that the Earth is round,
your brain needs to purge one of these contradictory ideas - hopefully, the one about the elephants. In certain stages of sleep, we trim and prune
connections between cells and erase unneeded memory circuits. The third type of forgetting is motivated
forgetting, something we all wish we could do for one thing or another. This is when a person intentionally suppresses
unpleasant memories. Forgetting on purpose is a way to regulate
our emotions and to focus on what needs to be done in the present, instead of getting
lost in negative memories of the past. We may need motivated forgetting to maintain
our self-image, to maintain confidence, to stay optimistic about the future, or to be
able to maintain relationships with people who have hurt us. We don’t know exactly how motivated forgetting
happens, but part of our brain seems to step in and block the troubling memory from being
retrieved. So that even though it’s still somewhere
in our brain, eventually we can’t find it. Our brains have so many ways to forget because
forgetting is one of the most important things we do. Forgetting allows us to move past traumatic
life events. In fact, PTSD may be a problem where someone
simply remembers too much. Forgetting also allows us to clear out junk. Imagine every sight, sound, smell, and piece
of information your brain processes every day! If our brains didn’t sweep out the garbage
every night, we would soon overflow our neural networks with random useless trivia, just
like Sherlock Holmes predicted. We also wouldn’t be able to replace things
that are no longer true with better information and update our mental models of the world. Deep in the scientific literature we find
stories of a handful of people who NEVER forget anything. They are so rare that their unforgetfulness
has a medical name: hyperthymesia. The most famous case is Jill Price, an American
woman now in her fifties. Starting from age 14, Jill’s memory of her
life is nearly perfect. For any date in the past, she remembers what
she wore and had for lunch that day, key historical events that she paid attention to, and detailed
incidents from her life. She describes memories playing in her mind
in vivid detail like a video reel that has been enhanced with smells and emotions, whether
the events occurred yesterday or decades ago. This might sound like a blessing, especially
if you’re in school, but Jill has described being haunted by upsetting memories and by
regrets, because unlike the rest of us, she can clearly remember every choice she made
and how it turned out. There’s probably something you truly *want*
to forget, like that extremely embarrassing moment in high school that always seems to
pop up at the worst times. Can we erase those unwanted memories somehow? In an episode of House, MD, Dr. House treated
a patient suffering from painful memories by performing something called electroconvulsive
therapy: controlled electric shocks to the brain. People who undergo ECT do lose some memories
– only not necessarily the ones they hope. When it comes to erasing memories in humans,
our best tool still works like a hammer, not a scalpel. It’s no accident that our ability to forget,
like our ability to remember, is a complex and finely-tuned mechanism. If humans couldn’t remember and learn from
important events, our species probably wouldn’t have survived. But it seems that being able to forget is
just as critical, an elementary part of solving this great mystery we call life. Stay curious! So you probably can’t teach yourself to
have perfect memory, and never forget anything. Not without a massive brain injury or something. But is memorization really the best way to
learn something? Memorizing can definitely help you get started
with a new concept. However, truly understanding it requires much
more - seeing how concepts are related to each other, looking for different interpretations,
dealing with new information. These are the skills that will help you learn
anything, and if you’d like to sharpen your brain and develop these tools, then Brilliant
could be the place to go for that. Check out this Brilliant course on logic and

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Consider the following statement: human beings only use 10 percent
of their brain capacity. Well, as a neuroscientist, I can tell you that while Morgan Freeman
delivered this line with the gravitas
that makes him a great actor, this statement is entirely false. (Laughter) The truth is, human beings use 100 percent
of their brain capacity. The brain is a highly efficient,
energy-demanding organ that gets fully utilized and even though it is
at full capacity being used, it suffers from a problem
of information overload. There's far too much in the environment
than it can fully process. So to solve this problem of overload, evolution devised a solution, which is the brain's attention system. Attention allows us to notice, select and direct
the brain's computational resources to a subset of all that's available. We can think of attention
as the leader of the brain. Wherever attention goes,
the rest of the brain follows. In some sense, it's your brain's boss. And over the last 15 years, I've been studying
the human brain's attention system. In all of our studies,
I've been very interested in one question. If it is indeed the case
that our attention is the brain's boss, is it a good boss? Does it actually guide us well? And to dig in on this big question,
I wanted to know three things. First, how does attention
control our perception? Second, why does it fail us, often leaving us feeling
foggy and distracted? And third, can we do anything
about this fogginess, can we train our brain
to pay better attention? To have more strong and stable attention
in the work that we do in our lives. So I wanted to give you a brief glimpse into how we're going to look at this. A very poignant example of how our attention
ends up getting utilized. And I want to do it using the example
of somebody that I know quite well. He ends up being part of a very large
group of people that we work with, for whom attention
is a matter of life and death. Think of medical professionals or firefighters or soldiers or marines. This is the story of a marine captain,
Captain Jeff Davis. And the scene that I'm going to share
with you, as you can see, is not about his time in the battlefield. He was actually on a bridge, in Florida. But instead of looking
at the scenery around him, seeing the beautiful vistas and noticing the cool ocean breezes, he was driving fast and contemplating
driving off that bridge. And he would later tell me that it took
all of everything he had not to do so. You see, he'd just returned from Iraq. And while his body was on that bridge, his mind, his attention,
was thousands of miles away. He was gripped with suffering. His mind was worried and preoccupied and had stressful memories
and, really, dread for his future. And I'm really glad
that he didn't take his life. Because he, as a leader,
knew that he wasn't the only one that was probably suffering; many of his fellow marines
probably were, too. And in the year 2008, he partnered with me
in the first-of-its-kind project that actually allowed us to test and offer
something called mindfulness training to active-duty military personnel. But before I tell you about
what mindfulness training is, or the results of that study, I think it's important to understand
how attention works in the brain. So what we do in the laboratory is that many of our studies of attention
involve brain-wave recordings. In these brain wave recordings,
people wear funny-looking caps that are sort of like swimming caps,
that have electrodes embedded in them. These electrodes pick up
the ongoing brain electrical activity. And they do it with millisecond
temporal precision. So we can see these small yet detectable
voltage fluctuations over time. And doing this, we can very precisely
plot the timing of the brain's activity. About 170 milliseconds after we show our research participants
a face on the screen, we see a very reliable,
detectable brain signature. It happens right at the back of the scalp, above the regions of the brain
that are involved in face processing. Now, this happens so reliably
and so on cue, as the brain's face detector, that we've even given
this brain-wave component a name. We call it the N170 component. And we use this component
in many of our studies. It allows us to see the impact
that attention may have on our perception. I'm going to give you a sense
of the kind of experiments that we actually do in the lab. We would show participants
images like this one. You should see a face and a scene
overlaid on each other. And what we do is we ask our participants as they're viewing a series
of these types of overlaid images, to do something with their attention. On some trials, we'll ask them
to pay attention to the face. And to make sure they're doing that, we ask them to tell us,
by pressing a button, if the face appeared to be male or female. On other trials, we ask them to tell what the scene was --
was it indoor or outdoor? And in this way,
we can manipulate attention and confirm that the participants
were actually doing what we said. Our hypotheses about attention
were as follows: if attention is indeed doing its job
and affecting perception, maybe it works like an amplifier. And what I mean by this is that when we direct
attention to the face, it becomes clearer and more salient, it's easier to see. But when we direct it to the scene,
the face becomes barely perceptible as we process the scene information. So what we wanted to do is look at this brain-wave component
of face detection, the N170, and see if it changed at all as a function of where our participants
were paying attention -- to the scene or the face. And here's what we found. We found that when they paid
attention to the face, the N170 was larger. And when they paid attention to the scene,
as you can see in red, it was smaller. And that gap you see
between the blue and red lines is pretty powerful. What it tells us is that attention, which is really the only
thing that changed, since the images they viewed
were identical in both cases -- attention changes perception. And it does so very fast. Within 170 milliseconds
of actually seeing a face. In our follow-up studies,
we wanted to see what would happen, how could we perturb
or diminish this effect. And our hunch was that if you put people
in a very stressful environment, if you distract them with disturbing,
negative images, images of suffering and violence -- sort of like what you might see
on the news, unfortunately -- that doing this might
actually affect their attention. And that's indeed what we found. If we present stressful images
while they're doing this experiment, this gap of attention shrinks,
its power diminishes. So in some of our other studies, we wanted to see, OK, great -- not great, actually, bad news
that stress does this to the brain -- but if it is the case that stress
has this powerful influence on attention through external distraction, what if we don't need
external distraction, what if we distract ourselves? And to do this, we had to basically come up
with an experiment in which we could have people
generate their own mind-wandering. This is having off-task thoughts while we're engaged
in an ongoing task of some sort. And the trick to mind-wandering
is that essentially, you bore people. So hopefully there's not a lot
of mind-wandering happening right now. When we bore people, people happily generate all kinds
of internal content to occupy themselves. So we devised what might be considered one of the world's
most boring experiments. All the participants saw
were a series of faces on the screen, one after another. They pressed the button
every time they saw the face. That was pretty much it. Well, one trick was that sometimes,
the face would be upside down, and it would happen very infrequently. On those trials they were told
just to withhold the response. Pretty soon, we could tell that
they were successfully mind-wandering, because they pressed the button
when that face was upside down. Even though it's quite plain to see
that it was upside down. So we wanted to know what happens
when people have mind-wandering. And what we found was that, very similar to external stress and external distraction
in the environment, internal distraction,
our own mind wandering, also shrinks the gap of attention. It diminishes attention's power. So what do all of these studies tell us? They tell us that attention
is very powerful in terms of affecting our perception. Even though it's so powerful,
it's also fragile and vulnerable. And things like stress
and mind-wandering diminish its power. But that's all in the context of these
very controlled laboratory settings. What about in the real world? What about in our actual day-to-day life? What about now? Where is your attention right now? To kind of bring it back, I'd like to make a prediction
about your attention for the remainder of my talk. Are you up for it? Here's the prediction. You will be unaware of what I'm saying
for four out of the next eight minutes. (Laughter) It's a challenge,
so pay attention, please. Now, why am I saying this? I'm surely going to assume
that you're going to remain seated and, you know, graciously keep
your eyes on me as I speak. But a growing body of literature suggests
that we mind-wander, we take our mind away
from the task at hand, about 50 percent of our waking moments. These might be small,
little trips that we take away, private thoughts that we have. And when this mind-wandering happens, it can be problematic. Now I don't think there will be
any dire consequences with you all sitting here today, but imagine a military leader missing
four minutes of a military briefing, or a judge missing
four minutes of testimony. Or a surgeon or firefighter
missing any time. The consequences
in those cases could be dire. So we might ask why do we do this? Why do we mind-wander so much? Well, part of the answer is that our mind
is an exquisite time-traveling master. It can actually time travel very easily. If we think of the mind as the metaphor
of the music player, we see this. We can rewind the mind to the past to reflect on events
that have already happened, right? Or we can go and fast-future, to plan
for the next thing that we want to do. And we land in this mental
time-travel mode of the past or the future very frequently. And we land there often
without our awareness, most times without our awareness, even if we want to be paying attention. Think of just the last time
you were trying to read a book, got to the bottom of the page
with no idea what the words were saying. This happens to us. And when this happens, when we mind-wander
without an awareness that we're doing it, there are consequences. We make errors. We miss critical information, sometimes. And we have difficulty making decisions. What's worse is when we experience stress. When we're in a moment of overwhelm. We don't just reflect
on the past when we rewind, we end up being in the past
ruminating, reliving or regretting events that have already happened. Or under stress, we fast-forward the mind. Not just to productively plan. But we end up catastrophizing or worrying about events that haven't happened yet and frankly may never happen. So at this point, you might be
thinking to yourself, OK, mind-wandering's happening a lot. Often, it happens without our awareness. And under stress, it's even worse -- we mind-wander more powerfully
and more often. Is there anything
we can possibly do about this? And I'm happy to say the answer is yes. From our work, we're learning that the opposite of a stressed
and wandering mind is a mindful one. Mindfulness has to do
with paying attention to our present-moment experience
with awareness. And without any kind of emotional
reactivity of what's happening. It's about keeping
that button right on play to experience the moment-to-moment
unfolding of our lives. And mindfulness is not just a concept. It's more like practice, you have to embody this mindful
mode of being to have any benefits. And a lot of the work that we're doing,
we're offering people programs that give our participants
a suite of exercises that they should do daily in order to cultivate more moments
of mindfulness in their life. And for many of the groups
that we work with, high-stress groups, like I said -- soldiers,
medical professionals -- for them, as we know,
mind-wandering can be really dire. So we want to make sure
we offer them very accessible, low time constraints
to optimize the training, so they can benefit from it. And when we do this, what we can do
is track to see what happens, not just in their regular lives but in the most demanding
circumstances that they may have. Why do we want to do this? Well, we want to, for example, give it
to students right around finals season. Or we want to give the training
to accountants during tax season. Or soldiers and marines
while they're deploying. Why is that? Because those are the moments in which their attention
is most likely to be vulnerable, because of stress and mind-wandering. And those are also the moments in which we want their attention
to be in peak shape so they can perform well. So what we do in our research is we have them take
a series of attention tests. We track their attention at the beginning
of some kind of high-stress interval, and then two months later,
we track them again, and we want to see
if there's a difference. Is there any benefit of offering them
mindfulness training? Can we protect against
the lapses in attention that might arise over high stress? So here's what we find. Over a high-stress interval, unfortunately, the reality is
if we don't do anything at all, attention declines, people are worse at the end
of this high-stress interval than before. But if we offer mindfulness training,
we can protect against this. They stay stable, even though
just like the other groups, they were experiencing high stress. And perhaps even more impressive is that if people
take our training programs over, let's say, eight weeks, and they fully commit
to doing the daily mindfulness exercises that allow them to learn
how to be in the present moment, well, they actually get better over time,
even though they're in high stress. And this last point
is actually important to realize, because of what it suggests to us is that mindfulness exercises
are very much like physical exercise: if you don't do it, you don't benefit. But if you do engage
in mindfulness practice, the more you do, the more you benefit. And I want to just bring it back
to Captain Jeff Davis. As I mentioned to you at the beginning, his marines were involved
in the very first project that we ever did,
offering mindfulness training. And they showed this exact pattern,
which was very heartening. We had offered them
the mindfulness training right before they were deployed to Iraq. And upon their return,
Captain Davis shared with us what he was feeling
was the benefit of this program. He said that unlike last time, after this deployment,
they were much more present. They were discerning. They were not as reactive. And in some cases,
they were really more compassionate with the people they were
engaging with and each other. He said in many ways, he felt that the mindfulness
training program we offered gave them a really important tool to protect against developing
post-traumatic stress disorder and even allowing it to turn
into post-traumatic growth. To us, this was very compelling. And it ended up
that Captain Davis and I -- you know, this was about
a decade ago, in 2008 -- we've kept in touch all these years. And he himself has gone on
to continue practicing mindfulness in a daily way. He was promoted to major, he actually then ended up retiring
from the Marine Corps. He went on to get a divorce,
to get remarried, to have a child, to get an MBA. And through all of these challenges
and transitions and joys of his life, he kept up with his mindfulness practice. And as fate would have it,
just a few months ago, Captain Davis suffered a massive
heart attack, at the age of 46. And he ended up calling me
a few weeks ago. And he said, "I want
to tell you something. I know that the doctors
who worked on me, they saved my heart, but mindfulness saved my life. The presence of mind I had
to stop the ambulance that ended up taking me
to the hospital," -- himself, the clarity of mind he had to notice
when there was fear and anxiety happening but not be gripped by it -- he said, "For me, these
were the gifts of mindfulness." And I was so relieved
to hear that he was OK. But really heartened to see
that he had transformed his own attention. He went from having a really bad boss -- an attention system
that nearly drove him off a bridge -- to one that was an exquisite
leader and guide, and saved his life. So I want to actually end by sharing
my call to action to all of you. And here it is. Pay attention to your attention. Alright? Pay attention to your attention and incorporate mindfulness training
as part of your daily wellness toolkit, in order to tame your own wandering mind and to allow your attention
to be a trusted guide in your own life. Thank you. (Applause)

ruminating, reliving or regretting events that have already happened. Or under stress, we fast-forward the mind. Not just to productively plan. But we end up catastrophizing or worrying about events that haven't happened yet and frankly may never happen. So at this point, you might be
thinking to yourself, OK, mind-wandering's happening a lot. Often, it happens without our awareness. And under stress, it's even worse -- we mind-wander more powerfully
and more often. Is there anything
we can possibly do about this? And I'm happy to say the answer is yes. From our work, we're learning that the opposite of a stressed
and wandering mind is a mindful one. Mindfulness has to do
with paying attention to our present-moment experience
with awareness. And without any kind of emotional
reactivity of what's happening. It's about keeping
that button right on play to experience the moment-to-moment
unfolding of our lives. And mindfulness is not just a concept. It's more like practice, you have to embody this mindful
mode of being to have any benefits. And a lot of the work that we're doing,
we're offering people programs that give our participants
a suite of exercises that they should do daily in order to cultivate more moments
of mindfulness in their life. And for many of the groups
that we work with, high-stress groups, like I said -- soldiers,
medical professionals -- for them, as we know,
mind-wandering can be really dire. So we want to make sure
we offer them very accessible, low time constraints
to optimize the training, so they can benefit from it. And when we do this, what we can do
is track to see what happens, not just in their regular lives but in the most demanding
circumstances that they may have. Why do we want to do this? Well, we want to, for example, give it
to students right around finals season. Or we want to give the training
to accountants during tax season. Or soldiers and marines
while they're deploying. Why is that? Because those are the moments in which their attention
is most likely to be vulnerable, because of stress and mind-wandering. And those are also the moments in which we want their attention
to be in peak shape so they can perform well. So what we do in our research is we have them take
a series of attention tests. We track their attention at the beginning
of some kind of high-stress interval, and then two months later,
we track them again, and we want to see
if there's a difference. Is there any benefit of offering them
mindfulness training? Can we protect against
the lapses in attention that might arise over high stress? So here's what we find. Over a high-stress interval, unfortunately, the reality is
if we don't do anything at all, attention declines, people are worse at the end
of this high-stress interval than before. But if we offer mindfulness training,
we can protect against this. They stay stable, even though
just like the other groups, they were experiencing high stress. And perhaps even more impressive is that if people
take our training programs over, let's say, eight weeks, and they fully commit
to doing the daily mindfulness exercises that allow them to learn
how to be in the present moment, well, they actually get better over time,
even though they're in high stress. And this last point
is actually important to realize, because of what it suggests to us is that mindfulness exercises
are very much like physical exercise: if you don't do it, you don't benefit. But if you do engage
in mindfulness practice, the more you do, the more you benefit. And I want to just bring it back
to Captain Jeff Davis. As I mentioned to you at the beginning, his marines were involved
in the very first project that we ever did,
offering mindfulness training. And they showed this exact pattern,
which was very heartening. We had offered them
the mindfulness training right before they were deployed to Iraq. And upon their return,
Captain Davis shared with us what he was feeling
was the benefit of this program. He said that unlike last time, after this deployment,
they were much more present. They were discerning. They were not as reactive. And in some cases,
they were really more compassionate with the people they were
engaging with and each other. He said in many ways, he felt that the mindfulness
training program we offered gave them a really important tool to protect against developing
post-traumatic stress disorder and even allowing it to turn
into post-traumatic growth. To us, this was very compelling. And it ended up
that Captain Davis and I -- you know, this was about
a decade ago, in 2008 -- we've kept in touch all these years. And he himself has gone on
to continue practicing mindfulness in a daily way. He was promoted to major, he actually then ended up retiring
from the Marine Corps. He went on to get a divorce,
to get remarried, to have a child, to get an MBA. And through all of these challenges
and transitions and joys of his life, he kept up with his mindfulness practice. And as fate would have it,
just a few months ago, Captain Davis suffered a massive
heart attack, at the age of 46. And he ended up calling me
a few weeks ago. And he said, "I want
to tell you something. I know that the doctors
who worked on me, they saved my heart, but mindfulness saved my life. The presence of mind I had
to stop the ambulance that ended up taking me
to the hospital," -- himself, the clarity of mind he had to notice
when there was fear and anxiety happening but not be gripped by it -- he said, "For me, these
were the gifts of mindfulness." And I was so relieved
to hear that he was OK. But really heartened to see
that he had transformed his own attention. He went from having a really bad boss -- an attention system
that nearly drove him off a bridge -- to one that was an exquisite
leader and guide, and saved his life. So I want to actually end by sharing
my call to action to all of you. And here it is. Pay attention to your attention. Alright? Pay attention to your attention and incorporate mindfulness training
as part of your daily wellness toolkit, in order to tame your own wandering mind and to allow your attention
to be a trusted guide in your own life. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
In the ocean’s depths,
two titans wage battle: the sperm whale and the colossal squid. Sperm whales use echolocation 
to hunt these squid for food, but even against this gigantic animal,
squid can put up an impressive fight. Scientists know this because on the bodies
of washed-up whales, they frequently find huge, 
round suction scars, emblazoned there by large, 
grasping tentacles. Ranging in size from 
this giant’s impressive 14 meters to the 2.5 centimeters 
of the southern pygmy squid, these creatures fall into the group 
of animals known as cephalopods. There are about 500 squid 
species worldwide, and they live in all the world’s oceans, making them a reliable food source
for whales, dolphins, sharks, seabirds, fish, and even other squid. Indeed, squid themselves 
are fearsome ocean predators. But their most extraordinary adaptations are those that have evolved 
to help them thwart their predators. Squid, which can be found mainly in estuarine, deep-sea, 
and open-water habitats, often swim together in shoals. Being out in the open without anywhere 
to hide makes them vulnerable, so as a first line of defense,
they rely on large, well-developed eyes. In the colossal squid, 
these are the size of dinner plates, the largest known eyes 
in the animal kingdom. When it’s dark or the water is murky, 
however, squid rely on a secondary sensory system, made from thousands of tiny hair cells 
that are only about twelve microns long and run along their heads and arms. Each of these hair cells is attached
to axons in the nervous system. Swimming animals create a wake, so when the hairs on 
the squid’s body detect this motion, they send a signal to the brain, which helps it determine 
the direction of the water’s flow. This way, a squid can sense an oncoming 
predator in even the dimmest waters. Aware of the threat, a squid 
can then mask itself from a predator. Squid skin contains thousands
of tiny organs called chromatophores, each made of black, brown, red 
or yellow pigments and ringed in muscle. Reflecting cells beneath 
the chromatophores mirror the squid’s surroundings,
enabling it to blend in. So, when the muscles contract, the color of the pigment is exposed, whereas when the muscles relax 
the colors are hidden. Each of these chromatophores is under the individual control 
of the squid’s nervous system, so while some expand, 
others remain contracted. That enables countershading, where the underside of the squid
is lighter than the top, to eliminate a silhouette 
that a predator might spy from below. Some predators, however, 
like the whales and dolphins, get around this ruse by using sound waves
to detect a squid’s camouflaged form. Not to be outfoxed, the squid still 
has two more tricks up its sleeve. The first involves ink, 
produced inside its mantle. Squid ink is made mostly of mucus
and melanin, which produces its dark coloring. When squid eject the ink, they either use it to make 
a large smokescreen that completely blocks the predator’s view or a blob that roughly mimics the size 
and shape of the squid. This creates a phantom form, 
called a pseudomorph, that tricks the predator 
into thinking it’s the real squid. As a final touch, 
squid rely on jet propulsion to rapidly shoot away from their hunters, reaching speeds of up to 25 miles per hour
and moving meters away in mere seconds. This makes them 
Earth’s fastest invertebrates. Some squid species have also developed 
unique adaptive behaviors. The deep-sea vampire squid,
when startled, uses its webbed arms to make 
a cape it hides behind. The tiny bobtail, on the other hand, 
tosses sand over its body as it burrows away from prying eyes. The Pacific flying squid 
uses jet propulsion for another purpose: to launch itself right out of the water. Squids’ inventive adaptations 
have allowed them to proliferate 
for over 500 million years. Even now, 
we’re still uncovering new species. And as we do, we’re bound to discover even more
about how these stealthy cephalopods have mastered survival 
in the deep and unforgiving sea.
