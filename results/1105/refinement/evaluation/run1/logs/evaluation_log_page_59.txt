**Transcript**:
What would you say is the most important discovery made in the past few centuries? Is it the computer? The car? Electricity? Or maybe the discovery of the atom? I would argue that it is this chemical reaction: a nitrogen gas molecule plus three hydrogen gas molecules gets you two ammonia gas molecules. This is the Haber process of binding nitrogen molecules in the air to hydrogen molecules, or turning air into fertilizer. Without this reaction, farmers would be capable of producing enough food for only 4 billion people; our current population is just over 7 billion people. So, without the Haber process, over 3 billion people would be without food. You see, nitrogen in the form of nitrate, NO3, is an essential nutrient for plants to survive. As crops grow, they consume the nitrogen, removing it from the soil. The nitrogen can be replenished through long, natural fertilization processes like decaying animals, but humans want to grow food much faster than that. Now, here's the frustrating part: 78% of the air is composed of nitrogen, but crops can't just take nitrogen from the air because it contains very strong triple bonds, which crops cannot break. What Haber did basically was figure out a way to take this nitrogen in the air and put it into the ground. In 1908, the German chemist Fritz Haber developed a chemical method for utilizing the vast supply of nitrogen in the air. Haber found a method which took the nitrogen in the air and bonded it to hydrogen to form ammonia. Ammonia can then be injected into the soil, where it is quickly converted into nitrate. But if Haber's process was going to be used to feed the world, he would need to find a way to create a lot of this ammonia quickly and easily. In order to understand how Haber accomplished this feat, we need to know something about chemical equilibrium. Chemical equilibrium can be achieved when you have a reaction in a closed container. For example, let's say you put hydrogen and nitrogen into a closed container and allow them to react. In the beginning of the experiment, we have a lot of nitrogen and hydrogen, so the formation of ammonia proceeds at a high speed. But as the hydrogen and nitrogen react and get used up, the reaction slows down because there is less nitrogen and hydrogen in the container. Eventually, the ammonia molecules reach a point where they start to decompose back into the nitrogen and hydrogen. After a while, the two reactions, creating and breaking down ammonia, will reach the same speed. When these speeds are equal, we say the reaction has reached equilibrium. This might sound good, but it's not when what you want is to just create a ton of ammonia. Haber doesn't want the ammonia to break down at all, but if you simply leave the reaction in a closed container, that's what will happen. Here's where Henry Le Chatelier, a French chemist, can help. What he found was that if you take a system in equilibrium and you add something to it, like, say, nitrogen, the system will work to get back to equilibrium again. Le Chatelier also found that if you increase the amount of pressure on a system, the system tries to work to return to the pressure it had. It's like being in a crowded room. The more molecules there are, the more pressure there is. If we look back at our equation, we see that on the left-hand side, there are four molecules on the left and just two on the right. So, if we want the room to be less crowded, and therefore have less pressure, the system will start combining nitrogen and hydrogen to make the more compact ammonia molecules. Haber realized that in order to make large amounts of ammonia, he would have to create a machine that would continually add nitrogen and hydrogen while also increasing the pressure on the equilibrium system, which is exactly what he did. Today, ammonia is one of the most produced chemical compounds in the world. Roughly 131 million metric tons are produced a year, which is about 290 billion pounds of ammonia. That's about the mass of 30 million African elephants, weighing roughly 10,000 pounds each. 80% of this ammonia is used in fertilizer production, while the rest is used in industrial and household cleaners and to produce other nitrogen compounds, such as nitric acid. Recent studies have found that half of the nitrogen from these fertilizers is not assimilated by plants. Consequently, the nitrogen is found as a volatile chemical compound in the Earth's water supplies and atmosphere, severely damaging our environment. Of course, Haber did not foresee this problem when he introduced his invention. Following his pioneering vision, scientists today are looking for a new Haber process of the 21st century, which will reach the same level of aid without the dangerous consequences.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking about the most important element for growing crops. The correct answer is nitrogen. 

Among the generated MCQs, none directly ask about the most important element for growing crops. However, Question 3 mentions the primary function of ammonia in the Haber process, which is to replenish nitrogen in the soil. This question is related to the importance of nitrogen for crops, but it's not a direct match.

Since there isn't a direct match, I will look for a question that is related to the importance of nitrogen. Question 11 asks about the primary reason why Haber developed the Haber process, which is to feed the world's growing population. This question is related to the importance of nitrogen, as the Haber process is used to produce ammonia, which is used as a fertilizer to replenish nitrogen in the soil.

However, the most similar question is not among the generated MCQs. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, as it mentions the importance of nitrogen for crops.

Eventually, the ammonia molecules reach a point where they start to decompose back into the nitrogen and hydrogen. After a while, the two reactions, creating and breaking down ammonia, will reach the same speed. When these speeds are equal, we say the reaction has reached equilibrium. This might sound good, but it's not when what you want is to just create a ton of ammonia. Haber doesn't want the ammonia to break down at all, but if you simply leave the reaction in a closed container, that's what will happen. Here's where Henry Le Chatelier, a French chemist, can help. What he found was that if you take a system in equilibrium and you add something to it, like, say, nitrogen, the system will work to get back to equilibrium again. Le Chatelier also found that if you increase the amount of pressure on a system, the system tries to work to return to the pressure it had. It's like being in a crowded room. The more molecules there are, the more pressure there is. If we look back at our equation, we see that on the left-hand side, there are four molecules on the left and just two on the right. So, if we want the room to be less crowded, and therefore have less pressure, the system will start combining nitrogen and hydrogen to make the more compact ammonia molecules. Haber realized that in order to make large amounts of ammonia, he would have to create a machine that would continually add nitrogen and hydrogen while also increasing the pressure on the equilibrium system, which is exactly what he did. Today, ammonia is one of the most produced chemical compounds in the world. Roughly 131 million metric tons are produced a year, which is about 290 billion pounds of ammonia. That's about the mass of 30 million African elephants, weighing roughly 10,000 pounds each. 80% of this ammonia is used in fertilizer production, while the rest is used in industrial and household cleaners and to produce other nitrogen compounds, such as nitric acid. Recent studies have found that half of the nitrogen from these fertilizers is not assimilated by plants. Consequently, the nitrogen is found as a volatile chemical compound in the Earth's water supplies and atmosphere, severely damaging our environment. Of course, Haber did not foresee this problem when he introduced his invention. Following his pioneering vision, scientists today are looking for a new Haber process of the 21st century, which will reach the same level of aid without the dangerous consequences.

**Transcript**:
two years ago here at Ted I reported that we had discovered at Saturn with the Cassini spacecraft an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small Saturnian moon Enceladus seen here this region seen here for the first time in a Cassini image taken in 2005 this is the south polar region with the famous tiger stripe fractures crossing the South Pole and seen just recently in late 2008 here is that region again now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere is experiencing the onset of August and eventually winter and I also reported that we'd made this mind-blowing discovery this once-in-a-lifetime discovery of towering Jets erupting from those fractures at the South Pole consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane and at that time two years ago I mentioned that we were speculating that these Jets might in fact be geysers and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface but we weren't really sure however the implications of those results of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry and perhaps life itself we're so exciting that in the intervening two years we have focused more on Enceladus we've flown the Cassini spacecraft by this moon now several times flying closer and deeper into these Jets into the denser regions of these Jets so that now we have come away with some very precise compositional measurements and we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex and we previously reported while they're not amino acids we're now finding things like propane and benzene hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde and the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the Jets come from it's of liquid water but that that liquid water is in contact with rock and that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life so we are very encouraged by these results and we're much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon under the South Pole an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms whether or not there are living organisms there of course is an entirely different matter and that will have to await the arrival back at Enceladus of a spacecraft hopefully sometime in the near future specifically equipped to address that particular question but in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the Saturnian system and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park just because we can thank you

Oh, excuse me! Have you ever yawned
because somebody else yawned? You aren't especially tired, yet suddenly your mouth opens wide and a big yawn comes out. This phenomenon is known
as contagious yawning. And while scientists still
don't fully understand why it happens, there are many hypotheses
currently being researched. Let's take a look at a few
of the most prevalent ones, beginning with two
physiological hypotheses before moving to a psychological one. Our first physiological hypothesis states that contagious yawning
is triggered by a specific stimulus, an initial yawn. This is called fixed action pattern. Think of fixed action pattern
like a reflex. Your yawn makes me yawn. Similar to a domino effect,
one person's yawn triggers a yawn in a person nearby
that has observed the act. Once this reflex is triggered,
it must run its course. Have you ever tried to stop
a yawn once it has begun? Basically impossible! Another physiological hypothesis is known as non-conscious mimicry, or the chameleon effect. This occurs when you
imitate someone's behavior without knowing it, a subtle and unintentional
copycat maneuver. People tend to mimic
each other's postures. If you are seated across from someone
that has their legs crossed, you might cross your own legs. This hypothesis suggests that we yawn when we see someone else yawn because we are unconsciously copying
his or her behavior. Scientists believe that this chameleon
effect is possible because of a special set of neurons
known as mirror neurons. Mirror neurons are a type of brain cell that responds equally
when we perform an action as when we see someone else
perform the same action. These neurons are important
for learning and self-awareness. For example, watching someone
do something physical, like knitting or putting on lipstick, can help you do those same
actions more accurately. Neuroimaging studies using fMRI,
functional magnetic resonance imaging, show us that when we seem someone yawn
or even hear their yawn, a specific area of the brain
housing these mirror neurons tends to light up, which, in turn, causes us to respond
with the same action: a yawn! Our psychological hypothesis also involves
the work of these mirror neurons. We will call it the empathy yawn. Empathy is the ability to understand
what someone else is feeling and partake in their emotion, a crucial ability
for social animals like us. Recently, neuroscientists have found
that a subset of mirror neurons allows us to empathize
with others' feelings at a deeper level. (Yawn) Scientists discovered
this empathetic response to yawning while testing the first
hypothesis we mentioned, fixed action pattern. This study was set up to show
that dogs would enact a yawn reflex at the mere sound of a human yawn. While their study showed this to be true,
they found something else interesting. Dogs yawned more frequently
at familiar yawns, such as from their owners, than at unfamiliar yawns from strangers. Following this research,
other studies on humans and primates have also shown that contagious yawning occurs more frequently
among friends than strangers. In fact, contagious
yawning starts occurring when we are about four or five years old, at the point when children develop the ability to identify
others' emotions properly. Still, while newer scientific studies aim
to prove that contagious yawning is based on this capacity for empathy, more research is needed to shed light
on what exactly is going on. It's possible that the answer lies
in another hypothesis altogether. The next time you get caught in a yawn, take a second to think
about what just happened. Were you thinking about a yawn? Did someone near you yawn? Was that person a stranger
or someone close? And are you yawning right now? (Yawn) (Lip smacking)

**Transcript**:
Oh, excuse me! Have you ever yawned
because somebody else yawned? You aren't especially tired, yet suddenly your mouth opens wide and a big yawn comes out. This phenomenon is known
as contagious yawning. And while scientists still
don't fully understand why it happens, there are many hypotheses
currently being researched. Let's take a look at a few
of the most prevalent ones, beginning with two
physiological hypotheses before moving to a psychological one. Our first physiological hypothesis states that contagious yawning
is triggered by a specific stimulus, an initial yawn. This is called fixed action pattern. Think of fixed action pattern
like a reflex. Your yawn makes me yawn. Similar to a domino effect,
one person's yawn triggers a yawn in a person nearby
that has observed the act. Once this reflex is triggered,
it must run its course. Have you ever tried to stop
a yawn once it has begun? Basically impossible! Another physiological hypothesis is known as non-conscious mimicry, or the chameleon effect. This occurs when you
imitate someone's behavior without knowing it, a subtle and unintentional
copycat maneuver. People tend to mimic
each other's postures. If you are seated across from someone
that has their legs crossed, you might cross your own legs. This hypothesis suggests that we yawn when we see someone else yawn because we are unconsciously copying
his or her behavior. Scientists believe that this chameleon
effect is possible because of a special set of neurons
known as mirror neurons. Mirror neurons are a type of brain cell that responds equally
when we perform an action as when we see someone else
perform the same action. These neurons are important
for learning and self-awareness. For example, watching someone
do something physical, like knitting or putting on lipstick, can help you do those same
actions more accurately. Neuroimaging studies using fMRI,
functional magnetic resonance imaging, show us that when we seem someone yawn
or even hear their yawn, a specific area of the brain
housing these mirror neurons tends to light up, which, in turn, causes us to respond
with the same action: a yawn! Our psychological hypothesis also involves
the work of these mirror neurons. We will call it the empathy yawn. Empathy is the ability to understand
what someone else is feeling and partake in their emotion, a crucial ability
for social animals like us. Recently, neuroscientists have found
that a subset of mirror neurons allows us to empathize
with others' feelings at a deeper level. (Yawn) Scientists discovered
this empathetic response to yawning while testing the first
hypothesis we mentioned, fixed action pattern. This study was set up to show
that dogs would enact a yawn reflex at the mere sound of a human yawn. While their study showed this to be true,
they found something else interesting. Dogs yawned more frequently
at familiar yawns, such as from their owners, than at unfamiliar yawns from strangers. Following this research,
other studies on humans and primates have also shown that contagious yawning occurs more frequently
among friends than strangers. In fact, contagious
yawning starts occurring when we are about four or five years old, at the point when children develop the ability to identify
others' emotions properly. Still, while newer scientific studies aim
to prove that contagious yawning is based on this capacity for empathy, more research is needed to shed light
on what exactly is going on. It's possible that the answer lies
in another hypothesis altogether. The next time you get caught in a yawn, take a second to think
about what just happened. Were you thinking about a yawn? Did someone near you yawn? Was that person a stranger
or someone close? And are you yawning right now? (Yawn) (Lip smacking)

**Transcript**:
Everybody loves fireworks -- the lights, the colors, and, of course, the big boom. But the history of fireworks isn't all hugs and celebrations. Long before epic fireworks displays, chemists in China invented the key ingredient that propels those bright lights into the sky. That invention was what we now call gunpowder. Our story begins back in ancient China in the mid-ninth century where early Chinese alchemists were trying to create a potion for immortality. Instead, what they created was a flammable powder that burned down many of their homes. They quickly realized that this black powder, which they called fire medicine, was precisely the opposite of something that would make you live forever. In these early days, the Chinese hadn't yet figured out how to make the powder explode; it was simply very flammable, and their armies used it to make flaming arrows and even a flamethrower. But once they figured out the right proportions of ingredients to create a blast, they began using the powder even more, creating fireworks to keep evil spirits away and bombs to defend themselves against Mongol invaders. It was these Mongols, most likely, who spread the invention of gunpowder across the world. After fielding Chinese attacks, they learned how to produce the powder themselves and brought it with them on their conquests in Persia and India. William of Rubruck, a European ambassador to the Mongols, was likely responsible for bringing gunpowder back to Europe around 1254. From there, engineers and military inventors created all kinds of destructive weapons. From bombs to guns to cannons, gunpowder left its mark on the world in some pretty terrible ways, in contrast to the beautiful marks it can leave in the air. So, how does black powder propel fireworks into the sky? You might have seen old Westerns or cartoons where a trail of gunpowder is lit and it leads to a large and obviously explosive barrel. Once the fire gets to the barrel, a large boom occurs. But why doesn't the trail itself explode? The reason is that burning the powder releases energy and gases. While the trail is burning, these are easily released into the surrounding air. But when the gunpowder is contained within the barrel, the energy and gases cannot easily escape and build up until BOOM! Firework canisters provide a single, upward-facing outlet to channel this explosive energy. The wick ignites the gunpowder and the energy takes the easiest exit from the canister, launching the firework high into the sky. The flame then makes its way through the firework's encasing and the same reaction occurs high above our heads. So, while the Chinese alchemists never found the compound for eternal life, they did find something that would go on to shape all of civilization, something that has caused many tragic moments in human history, and yet still gives us hope when we look up in celebration at the colorful night sky.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the combustion of gunpowder and its oxygen source, specifically inquiring about the proportions of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs address this specific topic.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would suggest Question 8: **Comprehension**: What is the primary reason why gunpowder propels fireworks into the sky? Options: A. Because of the pressure built up by the gunpowder, B. Because of the energy released by the burning gunpowder, C. Because of the shape of the firework canister, D. Because of the speed of the gunpowder Correct Option: B.

Although this question does not directly address the combustion of gunpowder and its oxygen source, it does relate to the topic of gunpowder and its role in propelling fireworks. Nevertheless, please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically addresses the combustion of gunpowder and its oxygen source.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 8

[Music] [Applause] believe it or not I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem with the requisite focus on climate and the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the Earth by humankind and the resulting decline of the biosphere that culprit is business and industry which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956 as an Industrial Engineer come aspiring and then successful entrepreneur after founding my company interface from scratch in 1973 36 years go to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets and shepherding it through startup and survival to prosperity and Global dominance in its field I read Paul Hawkins book The Ecology of Commerce the sum of 1994 in his book Paul charges business and industry as one the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere and two the only institution that is large enough and pervasive enough and powerful enough to really lead humankind out of this mess and by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth and I then challenged the people of interface my company to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability which we defined as eventually operating a petroleum intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the Earth naturally and rapidly not another fresh of oil and to do no harm to the biosphere take nothing Do no harm I simply said if hawan is right in business and industry must lead who will lead business and industry unless somebody leads nobody will it's axiomatic why not us and thanks to the people of inace I have become a recovering plunderer [Applause] I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail and that became the headline of a fortune article that went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO from plunderer to recovering plunderer to America's greenest CEO in five years that frankly was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999 asked later in the Canadian documentary of the corporation what I meant by the go go to jail remark I offered that theft is a crime and theft of our children's Future Would someday be a crime but I realized for that to be true for theft of our children's future to be a crime there must be a clear demonstrable alternative to the take make waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization and is the major culprit stealing our children's future by digging up the Earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerate in short digging up the Earth and converting it to pollution according to Paul and an erck and their well-known environmental impact equation impact a bad thing is the product of population affluence and technology that is impact is generated by people what they consume in their affluence and how it is produced I know the equation is largely subjective you can perhaps quantify people and perhaps quantify affluence but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify so the equation is conceptual still it works to help us understand the problem so we set out at interface in 1994 to create an example to transform the way we made carpet a petroleum intensive product for materials as well as energy and to transform our our Technologies so they diminished environmental impact rather than multiplied it Paul andan ER environmental impact equation I is equal to P * a * T population affluence and Technology I wanted interface to rewrite that equation so that it read i = p * a ided by T now the mathematically minded will see immediately that t in the numerator increases impact a bad thing but T in the denominator decreases impact so I ask what would move T technology from the numerator call it T1 where it increases impact to the denominator call it T2 where it reduces impact I thought about the characteristics of first Industrial Revolution T1 as we practiced it ENT aace and it had the following characteristics extractive taking raw materials from the earth linear take make waste powered by fossil fuel derived energy wasteful abusive and focused on labor productivity More carpet per man hour thinking it through I realize that all those attributes must be changed to move t to the denominator in the new Industrial Revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable Linear by cyclical fossil fuel energy by renewable energy sunlight waste wasteful by waste free and abusive by benign and labor productivity by resource productivity and I reason that if we could make that those transformative changes and get rid of T1 all together we could reduce our impact to zero including our impact on the climate and that became the interface plan in 1995 and has been the plan ever since we have measured our progress very rigorously so I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years net greenhouse gas emissions down 82% in absolute tonnage over the same span of time sales have increased by 2/3 and profits have doubled so an 82% absolute reduction translates into a 90 % reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales this is the magnitude of the reduction the entire Global technosphere must Realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate climate

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] believe it or not I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem with the requisite focus on climate and the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the Earth by humankind and the resulting decline of the biosphere that culprit is business and industry which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956 as an Industrial Engineer come aspiring and then successful entrepreneur after founding my company interface from scratch in 1973 36 years go to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets and shepherding it through startup and survival to prosperity and Global dominance in its field I read Paul Hawkins book The Ecology of Commerce the sum of 1994 in his book Paul charges business and industry as one the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere and two the only institution that is large enough and pervasive enough and powerful enough to really lead humankind out of this mess and by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth and I then challenged the people of interface my company to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability which we defined as eventually operating a petroleum intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the Earth naturally and rapidly not another fresh of oil and to do no harm to the biosphere take nothing Do no harm I simply said if hawan is right in business and industry must lead who will lead business and industry unless somebody leads nobody will it's axiomatic why not us and thanks to the people of inace I have become a recovering plunderer [Applause] I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail and that became the headline of a fortune article that went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO from plunderer to recovering plunderer to America's greenest CEO in five years that frankly was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999 asked later in the Canadian documentary of the corporation what I meant by the go go to jail remark I offered that theft is a crime and theft of our children's Future Would someday be a crime but I realized for that to be true for theft of our children's future to be a crime there must be a clear demonstrable alternative to the take make waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization and is the major culprit stealing our children's future by digging up the Earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerate in short digging up the Earth and converting it to pollution according to Paul and an erck and their well-known environmental impact equation impact a bad thing is the product of population affluence and technology that is impact is generated by people what they consume in their affluence and how it is produced I know the equation is largely subjective you can perhaps quantify people and perhaps quantify affluence but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify so the equation is conceptual still it works to help us understand the problem so we set out at interface in 1994 to create an example to transform the way we made carpet a petroleum intensive product for materials as well as energy and to transform our our Technologies so they diminished environmental impact rather than multiplied it Paul andan ER environmental impact equation I is equal to P * a * T population affluence and Technology I wanted interface to rewrite that equation so that it read i = p * a ided by T now the mathematically minded will see immediately that t in the numerator increases impact a bad thing but T in the denominator decreases impact so I ask what would move T technology from the numerator call it T1 where it increases impact to the denominator call it T2 where it reduces impact I thought about the characteristics of first Industrial Revolution T1 as we practiced it ENT aace and it had the following characteristics extractive taking raw materials from the earth linear take make waste powered by fossil fuel derived energy wasteful abusive and focused on labor productivity More carpet per man hour thinking it through I realize that all those attributes must be changed to move t to the denominator in the new Industrial Revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable Linear by cyclical fossil fuel energy by renewable energy sunlight waste wasteful by waste free and abusive by benign and labor productivity by resource productivity and I reason that if we could make that those transformative changes and get rid of T1 all together we could reduce our impact to zero including our impact on the climate and that became the interface plan in 1995 and has been the plan ever since we have measured our progress very rigorously so I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years net greenhouse gas emissions down 82% in absolute tonnage over the same span of time sales have increased by 2/3 and profits have doubled so an 82% absolute reduction translates into a 90 % reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales this is the magnitude of the reduction the entire Global technosphere must Realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate climate disruption so the scientists are telling us fossil fuel usage is down 60% per unit of production due to efficiencies in Renewables the cheapest most secure barrel of all there is is the one not used for through efficiencies water usage is down 75% in our worldwide carpet tile business down 40% in our broadland carpet business which we acquired in 1993 right here in California City of Industry where water is so precious renewable of recycled materials in add 25% of the total and growing rapidly renewable energy is 27% of our total going for 100% we have diverted 148 million pounds that's 74,000 tons of used carpet from landfills closing the loop on material flows through reverse Logistics and postc consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago those new cyclical technologies have contribut mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate neutral carpet since 2004 meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain from mind and Wellhead clear to end of life Reclamation independent third party certified we call it cool carpet and it has been a powerful Marketplace differentiated increasing sales and profits 3 years ago we launched carpet tile for the home under the brand Flo misspelled f l r you can point and click today at fl.com and have cool carpet delivered to your front door in 5 days it is practical and pretty too we reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our Goal Zero impact zero footprint we've set 2020 as our Target year for zero for reaching the top the summit of Mount sustainability we call this Mission zero and this is perhaps the most important fact that we have found Mission zero to be incredibly good for business a better business model a better way to bigger profits here's the business case for sustainability from real life experience cost are down not up reflecting some $400 million of avoided cost in pursuit of zero waste the first face of Mount sustainability this has paid all the cost for the transformation of interace and this dispels a myth to this false choice between the environment and the economy our products are the best they've ever been inspired by design for sustainability and unexpected Wellspring of innovation our people are galvanized around the share higher purpose you cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together and the Goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing no amount of advertising no clever marketing campaign at any price could have produced or created as much Goodwill costs products people Marketplace what else is there it is a better business model and here's our 14-year record of sales and profits there's a dip there from 2001 to 2003 a dip when our sales over a threeyear period were down 177% but the marketplace was down 36% we literally gained market chain we might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability now if every business were pursuing the interface plan would that solve all our problems I don't think so I remain troubled by the revised early equation I equal p * a / T2 that a is a capital A suggesting that affluence is an end in itself but what if we reframed ear further and what if we made a a lowercase a suggesting that it a a means to an end and that end is happiness more happiness with less stuff you know that would reframe civilization itself and our whole system of economics if not for our species then perhaps for the one that SU exceeds us the sustainable species living on a finite Earth ethically happily and ecologically inbalance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand Generations or 10,000 Generations that is to say into the indefinite future but does the Earth have to wait for our Extinction as a species well maybe so but I don't think so iten a face we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable zero footprint an industrial company fully into existence by 2020 we can see our way now clear to the top of that mountain and now the challenge is in execution and as my good friend and advisor Amry lovens says if something exists it must be possible if we if we can actually do it it must be possible if we a Petro intensive company can do it anybody can and if anybody can it follows that everybody can hawen fulfilled business and industry leading humankind away from the abyss because with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere a d a very dear person is at risk here frankly at unacceptable risk who is that person not you not I but let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here and I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain CL climb on a Tuesday Morning in March of 1996 I was talking to our people as I did at every opportunity back then bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting but about 5 days later back in Atlanta I received an email from Glenn Thomas one of my people in the California meeting he was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday Morning together and when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life because it told me by God one person got it here's what Glenn wrote and here's that person most at risk please meet Tomorrow's Child without a name and unseen face and knowing not your time or place Tomorrow's Child though yet unborn I met you first last Tuesday Morning a wise friend introduced us to and through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see a day for you but not for me knowing you has changed my thinking for I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday somehow threaten you Tomorrow's Child my daughter son I'm afraid I've just begun to think of you and our you are good though always having known I should begin I will to weigh the cost of what I squander what is lost If Ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too well every day of my life since tomorrow's child has spoken to me with one simple but profound message which I presume to share with you we are each and everyone a part of the Web of Life the Continuum of humanity is sure but in the largest sense the web of life itself and we have a choice to make during our brief brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet to hurt it or to help it for you it's your call thank you

**Transcript**:
Mysteries of vernacular: Robot, a machine capable of carrying out a programmable series of actions. The origin of the word robot dates back more than a thousand years to the era of serfdom in central Europe when servitude was the currency for rent. In those days, the Old Church Slavonic word rabota described the forced labor of the people. A slight adjustment of spelling, and rabota became the Czech robota, which, in addition to defining the toil of the serfs, was also used figuratively to describe any kind of hard work or drudgery. In 1920, Czech writer Karel Capek published a science fiction play called "R.U.R.", short for "Rossum's Universal Robots." The story featured automated machines with distinctly human features that, until they revolt, catered to the whims of the people of Earth. Capek originally considered calling these hard-working machines labori from the Latin word for labor, but he worried it sounded a bit too scholarly. He opted, instead, to emphasize their enslaved state by naming them roboti, or robot in English. "R.U.R." was wildly successful, and when it was translated into English in 1923, the word robot was enthusiastically embraced. Though most of today's robots look quite different than Capek imagined, they've become just as popular as he predicted. Unlike in "R.U.R.", though, our robots haven't risen up against us, and here's hoping it stays that way!

Good evening! What's the matter? Are you afraid of vampires? He he, no need to worry, I'm not staying for dinner. (Laughter) I'm here to guide you
through a brief history of vampires, illustrating how our image has changed from a shambling corpse to the dapper gentleman
you see before you. Vampires are nearly as old as you humans. Stories about us, revenants, appear in cultures extending
as far back as prehistoric times. But we weren't called vampires back then and most of us did not look the way
we imagine vampires today. Ha, far from it! For example, the Mesopotamian Lamashtu was a creature with the head of a lion
and the body of the donkey, and the ancient Greek striges were simply described
as bloodthirsty birds. Others were even stranger. The Philippine manananggal
would sever her upper torso and sprout huge, bat-like wings to fly. The Malaysian penanggalan
was a flying female head with dangling entrails. (Laughter) And the Australian Yara-ma-yha-who was a little red guy with a big head, a large mouth, and bloodsuckers on his hands and feet. Oh, and let's not forget
the Caribbean's soucouyant, the West African obayifo, and the Mexican Tlahuelpuchi. (Laughter) Charming, aren't they? Though they may look vastly different, all of these beings have
one common characteristic: They sustain themselves by consuming
the life force of a living creature. This shared trait
is what defines a vampire -- all the other attributes
change with the tides. So, how do we arrive at the reanimated fellow
you see before you? Our modern ideal emerges
in 18th-century Eastern Europe. With the dramatic increase
of vampire superstitions, stories of bloodsucking, shadowy creatures become nightly bedside terrors. And popular folklore, like the moroi among the Romani people and the lugat in Albania, provide the most common
vampire traits known today, such as vampires being undead and nocturnal and shape-shifting. You see, Eastern Europe
in the 18th century was a pretty grim place with many deaths occurring
from unknown diseases and plagues. Without medical explanations,
people searched for supernatural causes and found what looked like evidence
in the corpses of the victims. When villagers dug up bodies to discern the cause
of the mysterious deaths, they would often find the cadavers looking very much alive -- longer hair and fingernails, bloated bellies, and blood at the corners of mouths. (Laughter) Clearly, these people
were not really dead. Heh, they were vampires! And they had been leaving their graves to feast on the living. (Grunt) The terrified villagers
would quickly enact a ritual to kill the undead. The practices varied across the region, but usually included beheadings, burnings, and staking
the body to the coffin to prevent it from getting up. (Laughter) Grizzly stuff! But what the villagers interpreted
as unholy reanimation were actually normal symptoms of death. When a body decomposes,
the skin dehydrates, causing the hair
and fingernails to extend. Bacteria in the stomach creates gases that fill the belly, which force out blood
and matter through the mouth. Unfortunately, this science
was not yet known, so the villagers kept digging. In fact, so many bodies were dug up that the Empress of Austria sent her physician around
to disprove the vampire stories, and she even established a law
prohibiting grave tampering. Still, even after the vampire
hunts had died down, the stories of legends survived
in local superstition. This led to works of literature,
such as Polidori's "The Vampyre," the Gothic novel "Carmilla," and, most famously,
Bram Stoker's "Dracula." Although Stoker incorporated
historical material, like Elizabeth Báthory's
virgin blood baths and the brutal executions of Vlad Dracul, it was these local myths that inspired the main
elements of his story: the Transylvanian setting, using garlic to defend oneself, and the staking of the heart. While these attributes
are certainly familiar to us, elements he invented himself
have also lasted over the years: fear of crucifixes, weakness in sunlight, and the vampire's inability
to see their reflection. By inventing new traits, Stoker perfectly enacted
the age-old tradition of elaborating upon and expanding
the myth of vampires. As we saw, maybe you met my relatives, a huge of variety of creatures
stalked the night before Dracula, and many more will continue

**Transcript**:
Good evening! What's the matter? Are you afraid of vampires? He he, no need to worry, I'm not staying for dinner. (Laughter) I'm here to guide you
through a brief history of vampires, illustrating how our image has changed from a shambling corpse to the dapper gentleman
you see before you. Vampires are nearly as old as you humans. Stories about us, revenants, appear in cultures extending
as far back as prehistoric times. But we weren't called vampires back then and most of us did not look the way
we imagine vampires today. Ha, far from it! For example, the Mesopotamian Lamashtu was a creature with the head of a lion
and the body of the donkey, and the ancient Greek striges were simply described
as bloodthirsty birds. Others were even stranger. The Philippine manananggal
would sever her upper torso and sprout huge, bat-like wings to fly. The Malaysian penanggalan
was a flying female head with dangling entrails. (Laughter) And the Australian Yara-ma-yha-who was a little red guy with a big head, a large mouth, and bloodsuckers on his hands and feet. Oh, and let's not forget
the Caribbean's soucouyant, the West African obayifo, and the Mexican Tlahuelpuchi. (Laughter) Charming, aren't they? Though they may look vastly different, all of these beings have
one common characteristic: They sustain themselves by consuming
the life force of a living creature. This shared trait
is what defines a vampire -- all the other attributes
change with the tides. So, how do we arrive at the reanimated fellow
you see before you? Our modern ideal emerges
in 18th-century Eastern Europe. With the dramatic increase
of vampire superstitions, stories of bloodsucking, shadowy creatures become nightly bedside terrors. And popular folklore, like the moroi among the Romani people and the lugat in Albania, provide the most common
vampire traits known today, such as vampires being undead and nocturnal and shape-shifting. You see, Eastern Europe
in the 18th century was a pretty grim place with many deaths occurring
from unknown diseases and plagues. Without medical explanations,
people searched for supernatural causes and found what looked like evidence
in the corpses of the victims. When villagers dug up bodies to discern the cause
of the mysterious deaths, they would often find the cadavers looking very much alive -- longer hair and fingernails, bloated bellies, and blood at the corners of mouths. (Laughter) Clearly, these people
were not really dead. Heh, they were vampires! And they had been leaving their graves to feast on the living. (Grunt) The terrified villagers
would quickly enact a ritual to kill the undead. The practices varied across the region, but usually included beheadings, burnings, and staking
the body to the coffin to prevent it from getting up. (Laughter) Grizzly stuff! But what the villagers interpreted
as unholy reanimation were actually normal symptoms of death. When a body decomposes,
the skin dehydrates, causing the hair
and fingernails to extend. Bacteria in the stomach creates gases that fill the belly, which force out blood
and matter through the mouth. Unfortunately, this science
was not yet known, so the villagers kept digging. In fact, so many bodies were dug up that the Empress of Austria sent her physician around
to disprove the vampire stories, and she even established a law
prohibiting grave tampering. Still, even after the vampire
hunts had died down, the stories of legends survived
in local superstition. This led to works of literature,
such as Polidori's "The Vampyre," the Gothic novel "Carmilla," and, most famously,
Bram Stoker's "Dracula." Although Stoker incorporated
historical material, like Elizabeth Báthory's
virgin blood baths and the brutal executions of Vlad Dracul, it was these local myths that inspired the main
elements of his story: the Transylvanian setting, using garlic to defend oneself, and the staking of the heart. While these attributes
are certainly familiar to us, elements he invented himself
have also lasted over the years: fear of crucifixes, weakness in sunlight, and the vampire's inability
to see their reflection. By inventing new traits, Stoker perfectly enacted
the age-old tradition of elaborating upon and expanding
the myth of vampires. As we saw, maybe you met my relatives, a huge of variety of creatures
stalked the night before Dracula, and many more will continue
to creep through our nightmares. Yet, so long as they subsist
off a living being's life force, they are part of my tribe. Even sparkling vampires can be included. After all, it's the continued storytelling
and reimagining of the vampire legend that allows us to truly live forever. (Ominous laughter)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

However, Question 5's options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ's options. A more accurate match would be a question with the same intent as Question 5 but with options that include "death" as the correct answer.

Since there isn't an exact match, I will choose Question 5 as the closest match, but I will also provide an explanation of how it could be improved to match the ground truth MCQ.

A more accurate match would be:
Question: What frightened villagers interpreted as unholy reanimation were actually normal symptoms of what?
Options: A. Zombism, B. Bad Cholesterol, C. Gout, D. Death

But since this is not among the options, I choose Question 5, but I would rephrase it to match the ground truth MCQ.

However, re-reading the generated MCQs, I noticed that Question 9 has a similar intent to the ground truth MCQ. 

The correct answer is that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 9, but it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, another generated MCQ, Question 5, has a similar intent but does not have "death" as an option.

But if I had to choose the closest match from the provided options, I would say that Question 5 and Question 9 have similar intents, but Question 5 has options that are closer to the topic of "death" than Question 9.

However, if I had to choose one index, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match.

of vampire superstitions, stories of bloodsucking, shadowy creatures become nightly bedside terrors. And popular folklore, like the moroi among the Romani people and the lugat in Albania, provide the most common
vampire traits known today, such as vampires being undead and nocturnal and shape-shifting. You see, Eastern Europe
in the 18th century was a pretty grim place with many deaths occurring
from unknown diseases and plagues. Without medical explanations,
people searched for supernatural causes and found what looked like evidence
in the corpses of the victims. When villagers dug up bodies to discern the cause
of the mysterious deaths, they would often find the cadavers looking very much alive -- longer hair and fingernails, bloated bellies, and blood at the corners of mouths. (Laughter) Clearly, these people
were not really dead. Heh, they were vampires! And they had been leaving their graves to feast on the living. (Grunt) The terrified villagers
would quickly enact a ritual to kill the undead. The practices varied across the region, but usually included beheadings, burnings, and staking
the body to the coffin to prevent it from getting up. (Laughter) Grizzly stuff! But what the villagers interpreted
as unholy reanimation were actually normal symptoms of death. When a body decomposes,
the skin dehydrates, causing the hair
and fingernails to extend. Bacteria in the stomach creates gases that fill the belly, which force out blood
and matter through the mouth. Unfortunately, this science
was not yet known, so the villagers kept digging. In fact, so many bodies were dug up that the Empress of Austria sent her physician around
to disprove the vampire stories, and she even established a law
prohibiting grave tampering. Still, even after the vampire
hunts had died down, the stories of legends survived
in local superstition. This led to works of literature,
such as Polidori's "The Vampyre," the Gothic novel "Carmilla," and, most famously,
Bram Stoker's "Dracula." Although Stoker incorporated
historical material, like Elizabeth Báthory's
virgin blood baths and the brutal executions of Vlad Dracul, it was these local myths that inspired the main
elements of his story: the Transylvanian setting, using garlic to defend oneself, and the staking of the heart. While these attributes
are certainly familiar to us, elements he invented himself
have also lasted over the years: fear of crucifixes, weakness in sunlight, and the vampire's inability
to see their reflection. By inventing new traits, Stoker perfectly enacted
the age-old tradition of elaborating upon and expanding
the myth of vampires. As we saw, maybe you met my relatives, a huge of variety of creatures
stalked the night before Dracula, and many more will continue
to creep through our nightmares. Yet, so long as they subsist
off a living being's life force, they are part of my tribe. Even sparkling vampires can be included. After all, it's the continued storytelling
and reimagining of the vampire legend that allows us to truly live forever. (Ominous laughter)

**Transcript**:
10,000 years ago, a deadly virus arose in northeastern Africa. The virus spread through the air, attacking the skin cells, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes of its victims. The unlucky infected developed fevers, vomiting, and rashes. 30% of infected people died during the second week of infection. Survivors bore scars and scabs for the rest of their lives. Smallpox had arrived. In 1350 B.C., the first smallpox epidemics hit during the Egypt-Hittite war. Egyptian prisoners spread smallpox to the Hittites, which killed their king and devastated his civilization. Insidiously, smallpox made its way around the world via Egyptian merchants, then through the Arab world with the Crusades, and all the way to the Americas with the Spanish and Portuguese conquests. Since then, it has killed billions of people with an estimated 300 to 500 million people killed in the 20th century alone. But smallpox is not unbeatable. In fact, the fall of smallpox started long before modern medicine. It began all the way back in 1022 A.D. According to a small book, called "The Correct Treatment of Small Pox," a Buddhist nun living in a famous mountain named O Mei Shan in the southern providence of Sichuan would grind up smallpox scabs and blow the powder into nostrils of healthy people. She did this after noticing that those who managed to survive smallpox never got it again, and her odd treatment worked. The procedure, called variolation, slowly evolved and by the 1700's, doctors were taking material from sores and putting them into healthy people through four or five scratches on the arm. This worked pretty well as inoculated people would not get reinfected, but it wasn't foolproof. Up to three percent of people would still die after being exposed to the puss. It wasn't until English physician Edward Jenner noticed something interesting about dairy maids that we got our modern solution. At age 13, while Jenner was apprentice to a country surgeon and apothecary in Sodbury, near Bristol, he heard a dairy maid say, "I shall never have smallpox, for I have had cowpox. I shall never have an ugly, pockmarked face." Cowpox is a skin disease that resembles smallpox and infects cows. Later on, as a physician, he realized that she was right, women who got cowpox didn't develop the deadly smallpox. Smallpox and cowpox viruses are from the same family. But when a virus infects an unfamiliar host, in this case cowpox infecting a human, it is less virulent, so Jenner decided to test whether the cowpox virus could be used to protect against smallpox. In May 1796, Jenner found a young dairy maid, Sarah Nelmes, who had fresh cowpox lesions on her hand and arm caught from the utters of a cow named Blossom. Using matter from her pustules, he inoculated James Phipps, the eight-year-old son of his gardener. After a few days of fever and discomfort, the boy seemed to recover. Two months later, Jenner inoculated the boy again, this time with matter from a fresh smallpox lesion. No disease developed, and Jenner concluded that protection was complete. His plan had worked. Jenner later used the cowpox virus in several other people and challenged them repeatedly with smallpox, proving that they were immune to the disease. With this procedure, Jenner invented the smallpox vaccination. Unlike variolation, which used actual smallpox virus to try to protect people, vaccination used the far less dangerous cowpox virus. The medical establishment, cautious then as now, deliberated at length over his findings before accepting them. But eventually vaccination was gradually accepted and variolation became prohibited
in England in 1840. After large vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the World Health Organization certified smallpox's eradication in 1979. Jenner is forever remembered as the father of immunology, but let's not forget the Buddhist nun, dairy maid Sarah Nelmes, 
and James Phipps, all heroes in this great adventure of vaccination who helped eradicate smallpox.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: **Analysis**. 

This question is about the effects of the smallpox virus on the human body, which is related to how the virus spreads and infects people. Although it does not directly ask about the mode of transmission, it provides information about the virus's behavior and impact on the body, which is relevant to understanding how it spreads.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ specifically asks about the mode of transmission of the smallpox virus, which is not explicitly addressed in any of the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar one, I would say Question 4 is the closest, but I would recommend creating a new MCQ that directly addresses the mode of transmission to better match the ground truth MCQ.

Insidiously, smallpox made its way around the world via Egyptian merchants, then through the Arab world with the Crusades, and all the way to the Americas with the Spanish and Portuguese conquests. Since then, it has killed billions of people with an estimated 300 to 500 million people killed in the 20th century alone. But smallpox is not unbeatable. In fact, the fall of smallpox started long before modern medicine. It began all the way back in 1022 A.D. According to a small book, called "The Correct Treatment of Small Pox," a Buddhist nun living in a famous mountain named O Mei Shan in the southern providence of Sichuan would grind up smallpox scabs and blow the powder into nostrils of healthy people. She did this after noticing that those who managed to survive smallpox never got it again, and her odd treatment worked. The procedure, called variolation, slowly evolved and by the 1700's, doctors were taking material from sores and putting them into healthy people through four or five scratches on the arm. This worked pretty well as inoculated people would not get reinfected, but it wasn't foolproof. Up to three percent of people would still die after being exposed to the puss. It wasn't until English physician Edward Jenner noticed something interesting about dairy maids that we got our modern solution. At age 13, while Jenner was apprentice to a country surgeon and apothecary in Sodbury, near Bristol, he heard a dairy maid say, "I shall never have smallpox, for I have had cowpox. I shall never have an ugly, pockmarked face." Cowpox is a skin disease that resembles smallpox and infects cows. Later on, as a physician, he realized that she was right, women who got cowpox didn't develop the deadly smallpox. Smallpox and cowpox viruses are from the same family. But when a virus infects an unfamiliar host, in this case cowpox infecting a human, it is less virulent, so Jenner decided to test whether the cowpox virus could be used to protect against smallpox. In May 1796, Jenner found a young dairy maid, Sarah Nelmes, who had fresh cowpox lesions on her hand and arm caught from the utters of a cow named Blossom. Using matter from her pustules, he inoculated James Phipps, the eight-year-old son of his gardener. After a few days of fever and discomfort, the boy seemed to recover. Two months later, Jenner inoculated the boy again, this time with matter from a fresh smallpox lesion. No disease developed, and Jenner concluded that protection was complete. His plan had worked. Jenner later used the cowpox virus in several other people and challenged them repeatedly with smallpox, proving that they were immune to the disease. With this procedure, Jenner invented the smallpox vaccination. Unlike variolation, which used actual smallpox virus to try to protect people, vaccination used the far less dangerous cowpox virus. The medical establishment, cautious then as now, deliberated at length over his findings before accepting them. But eventually vaccination was gradually accepted and variolation became prohibited
in England in 1840. After large vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the World Health Organization certified smallpox's eradication in 1979. Jenner is forever remembered as the father of immunology, but let's not forget the Buddhist nun, dairy maid Sarah Nelmes, 
and James Phipps, all heroes in this great adventure of vaccination who helped eradicate smallpox.

**Transcript**:
10,000 years ago, a deadly virus arose in northeastern Africa. The virus spread through the air, attacking the skin cells, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes of its victims. The unlucky infected developed fevers, vomiting, and rashes. 30% of infected people died during the second week of infection. Survivors bore scars and scabs for the rest of their lives. Smallpox had arrived. In 1350 B.C., the first smallpox epidemics hit during the Egypt-Hittite war. Egyptian prisoners spread smallpox to the Hittites, which killed their king and devastated his civilization.

**Transcript**:
Acids and bases are everywhere. They're used to make foods, soaps and detergents, fertilizers, explosives, dyes, plastics, pesticides, even paper. Our stomachs are very acidic. Our blood is slightly basic. Our proteins are made up of amino acids, and the letters in our genetic code, those As, Ts, Cs, and Gs, are all bases. You were probably taught how acids and bases behave on the molecular level. You were probably never taught that a long time ago, like ancient Greek ago, before anyone knew about atoms or molecules, acids and bases were defined by how they behaved. Acids tasted sour and corroded metal. Bases felt slippery and could somehow counteract acids. When molecules dissolved in water interact, they are exchanging two main currencies with their surroundings: protons, also known as hydrogen ions, and electrons. Depending on how a molecule is composed or shaped, it may be willing to donate or accept either protons or electrons with some other community member. And some molecules are far more aggressive than others when it comes to donating or accepting either currency. Remember that protons are positively charged and electrons are negatively charged. So, if a molecule is willing to give up a proton, that's not too different from it being willing to accept an electron -- either way it's becoming more negatively charged. Other molecules are willing to accept a proton or give up an electron. These are becoming more positively charged. Some substances are so aggressive about donating their protons that when they get a chance, all of the molecules in a sample will dump a proton, sometimes more than one, to the surrounding water molecules. We call these strong acids. Meanwhile, some compounds are so ready to accept a proton that they won't wait around, they'll just rip one off water, which usually has two protons but is generous enough to hang out with just one. We call these strong bases. Other acids and bases are not so strong. They may donate just a few of their protons to water or accept just a few protons from water, but most of their molecules stay exactly the same. If left alone in water, they'll reach some equilibrium point where maybe only one out of a hundred or one out of ten thousand of their molecules has exchanged currency with water. As you might guess, we label these acids and bases weak, but in the common sense of the word, they're not weak. The vinegar in your salad dressing that you can smell from across the room, that is a weak acid. The ammonia you spray on glass for a streak-free shine, that is a weak base. So, it doesn't take much to be an active player in the chemical economy. Most acid-base chemistry takes place in water, which can act as either an acid or a base, accepting deposits and enabling withdrawals like a 24-hour molecular ATM. And when a proton-deposit customer, that's an acid, and a proton-withdrawal customer, the base, shop at the same time, their net effect on water's account may cancel out, and we call this neutralization. Now, certain molecules can behave as acids or bases without water, but that's another story. Let's end by saluting water as the resilient and fair banker for acids and bases. It's always open for business, doesn't charge interest, and will never foreclose on your molecules, which is more than I can say for [bleep]. Waah-waah.

Our blood is slightly basic. Our proteins are made up of amino acids, and the letters in our genetic code, those As, Ts, Cs, and Gs, are all bases. You were probably taught how acids and bases behave on the molecular level. You were probably never taught that a long time ago, like ancient Greek ago, before anyone knew about atoms or molecules, acids and bases were defined by how they behaved. Acids tasted sour and corroded metal. Bases felt slippery and could somehow counteract acids. When molecules dissolved in water interact, they are exchanging two main currencies with their surroundings: protons, also known as hydrogen ions, and electrons. Depending on how a molecule is composed or shaped, it may be willing to donate or accept either protons or electrons with some other community member. And some molecules are far more aggressive than others when it comes to donating or accepting either currency. Remember that protons are positively charged and electrons are negatively charged. So, if a molecule is willing to give up a proton, that's not too different from it being willing to accept an electron -- either way it's becoming more negatively charged. Other molecules are willing to accept a proton or give up an electron. These are becoming more positively charged. Some substances are so aggressive about donating their protons that when they get a chance, all of the molecules in a sample will dump a proton, sometimes more than one, to the surrounding water molecules. We call these strong acids. Meanwhile, some compounds are so ready to accept a proton that they won't wait around, they'll just rip one off water, which usually has two protons but is generous enough to hang out with just one. We call these strong bases. Other acids and bases are not so strong. They may donate just a few of their protons to water or accept just a few protons from water, but most of their molecules stay exactly the same. If left alone in water, they'll reach some equilibrium point where maybe only one out of a hundred or one out of ten thousand of their molecules has exchanged currency with water. As you might guess, we label these acids and bases weak, but in the common sense of the word, they're not weak. The vinegar in your salad dressing that you can smell from across the room, that is a weak acid. The ammonia you spray on glass for a streak-free shine, that is a weak base. So, it doesn't take much to be an active player in the chemical economy. Most acid-base chemistry takes place in water, which can act as either an acid or a base, accepting deposits and enabling withdrawals like a 24-hour molecular ATM. And when a proton-deposit customer, that's an acid, and a proton-withdrawal customer, the base, shop at the same time, their net effect on water's account may cancel out, and we call this neutralization. Now, certain molecules can behave as acids or bases without water, but that's another story. Let's end by saluting water as the resilient and fair banker for acids and bases. It's always open for business, doesn't charge interest, and will never foreclose on your molecules, which is more than I can say for [bleep]. Waah-waah.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking about the similarity between a proton deposit customer (an acid) and another entity. The correct option is an electron withdrawal customer.

Among the generated MCQs, the one that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 13: What is the term for a molecule that is willing to donate a proton? However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

A closer match is not found, but we can consider Question 14, which is the opposite of Question 13, and Question 5, which discusses the aggressiveness of acids in donating protons.

However, if we analyze the options of the generated MCQs, we can see that Question 14 has an option that says "A. Acid" which is the opposite of what the ground truth MCQ is asking, but Question 13 does not have an option that says "electron withdrawal customer".

Considering all these factors, the most similar generated MCQ is not a perfect match, but if we had to choose one, it would be Question 13.

However, another generated MCQ that can be considered as a match is Question 5, as it discusses the concept of donating protons, which is related to the concept of a proton deposit customer.

But if we look at the options of the ground truth MCQ, we see that it is asking about the similarity between a proton deposit customer and an electron withdrawal customer. In this case, the most similar generated MCQ would be Question 15, which discusses the process of a molecule donating an electron, but it's not asking about the similarity between a proton deposit customer and an electron withdrawal customer.

Considering the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, the most similar generated MCQ is not a perfect match, but if we had to choose one, it would be Question 13.

However, I noticed that Question 13 is asking about the term for a molecule that is willing to donate a proton, which is related to the concept of a proton deposit customer, but it's not asking about the similarity between a proton deposit customer and an electron withdrawal customer.

In this case, I would say that there is no perfect match between the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 13, but with a caveat that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever daydreamed
about traveling through time, perhaps fast forward in the centuries
and seeing the distant future? Well, time travel is possible, and what's more, it's already been done. Meet Sergei Krikalev, the greatest time traveler
in human history. This Russian cosmonaut holds the record for the most amount of time
spent orbiting our planet, a total of 803 days,
9 hours, and 39 minutes. During his stay in space, he time traveled into his own future by 0.02 seconds. Traveling at 17,500 miles an hour, he experienced an effect
known as time dilation, and one day the same effect might make significant time travel
to the future commonplace. To see why moving faster through space
affects passage of time, we need to go back to the 1880s, when two American scientists, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley, were trying to measure the effect
of the Earth's movement around the Sun on the speed of light. When a beam of light was moving
in the same direction as the Earth, they expected the light to travel faster. And when the Earth was moving
in the opposite direction, they expected it to go slower. But they found something very curious. The speed of light remained the same
no matter what the Earth was doing. Two decades later,
Albert Einstein was thinking about the consequences
of that never-changing speed of light. And it was his conclusions, formulated in the theory
of special relativity, that opened the door
into the world of time travel. Imagine a man named Jack, standing in the middle
of a train carriage, traveling at a steady speed. Jack's bored and starts bouncing
a ball up and down. What would Jill, standing on the platform,
see through the window as the train whistles through? Well, between Jack dropping the ball
and catching it again, Jill would have seen him move
slightly further down the track, resulting in her seeing the ball
follow a triangular path. This means Jill sees the ball
travel further than Jack does in the same time period. And because speed
is distance divided by time, Jill actually sees the ball move faster. But what if Jack's bouncing ball
is replaced with two mirrors which bounce a beam of light between them? Jack still sees the beam dropping down and Jill still sees the light beam
travel a longer distance, except this time Jack and Jill
cannot disagree on the speed because the speed of light
remains the same no matter what. And if the speed is the same
while the distance is different, this means the time taken
will be different as well. Thus, time must tick at different rates
for people moving relative to each other. Imagine that Jack and Jill
have highly accurate watches that they synchronize
before Jack boards the train. During the experiment,
Jack and Jill would each see their own watch ticking normally. But if they meet up again later
to compare watches, less time would have
elapsed on Jack's watch, balancing the fact that Jill saw
the light move further. This idea may sound crazy, but like any good scientific theory, it can be tested. In the 1970s, scientists boarded a plane with some super-accurate atomic clocks that were synchronized
with some others left on the ground. After the plane had
flown around the world, the clocks on board
showed a different time from those left behind. Of course, at the speed
of trains and planes, the effect is minuscule. But the faster you go,
the more time dilates. For astronauts orbiting
the Earth for 800 days, it starts to add up. But what affects humans
also affects machines. Satellites of the global
positioning system are also hurdling around the Earth at thousands of miles an hour. So, time dilation kicks in here, too. In fact, their speed causes
the atomic clocks on board to disagree with clocks on the ground by seven millionths of a second daily. Left uncorrected, this would cause GPS to lose accuracy by a few kilometers each day. So, what does all this have
to do with time travel to the far, distant future? Well, the faster you go,
the greater the effect of time dilation. If you could travel really close to the speed of light, say 99.9999%, on a round-trip through space for what seemed to you like ten years, you'd actually return to Earth around the year 9000. Who knows what you'd see
when you returned?! Humanity merged with machines, extinct due to climate change
or asteroid impact, or inhabiting a permanent colony on Mars. But the trouble is, getting heavy things like people,
not to mention space ships, up to such speeds requires
unimaginable amounts of energy. It already takes enormous
particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider to accelerate tiny subatomic particles
to close to light speed. But one day, if we can develop the tools
to accelerate ourselves to similar speeds, then we may regularly send time travelers into the future, bringing with them tales
of a long, forgotten past.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the specific time Sergei Krikalev time-traveled into his own future. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask about this specific detail.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 1: "Who holds the record for the most amount of time spent orbiting the Earth?" This question is related to Sergei Krikalev, but it does not ask about the specific time he time-traveled.

If I had to choose another generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the concept of time dilation and time travel, I would suggest Question 8: "What is the relationship between speed and time?" This question is related to the concept of time dilation, but it does not ask about the specific time Sergei Krikalev time-traveled.

In conclusion, I couldn't find a generated MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 1 or Question 8.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever daydreamed
about traveling through time, perhaps fast forward in the centuries
and seeing the distant future? Well, time travel is possible, and what's more, it's already been done. Meet Sergei Krikalev, the greatest time traveler
in human history. This Russian cosmonaut holds the record for the most amount of time
spent orbiting our planet, a total of 803 days,
9 hours, and 39 minutes. During his stay in space, he time traveled into his own future by 0.02 seconds. Traveling at 17,500 miles an hour, he experienced an effect
known as time dilation, and one day the same effect might make significant time travel
to the future commonplace. To see why moving faster through space
affects passage of time, we need to go back to the 1880s, when two American scientists, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley, were trying to measure the effect
of the Earth's movement around the Sun on the speed of light. When a beam of light was moving
in the same direction as the Earth, they expected the light to travel faster. And when the Earth was moving
in the opposite direction, they expected it to go slower. But they found something very curious. The speed of light remained the same
no matter what the Earth was doing. Two decades later,
Albert Einstein was thinking about the consequences
of that never-changing speed of light. And it was his conclusions, formulated in the theory
of special relativity, that opened the door
into the world of time travel. Imagine a man named Jack, standing in the middle
of a train carriage, traveling at a steady speed. Jack's bored and starts bouncing
a ball up and down. What would Jill, standing on the platform,
see through the window as the train whistles through? Well, between Jack dropping the ball
and catching it again, Jill would have seen him move
slightly further down the track, resulting in her seeing the ball
follow a triangular path. This means Jill sees the ball
travel further than Jack does in the same time period. And because speed
is distance divided by time, Jill actually sees the ball move faster. But what if Jack's bouncing ball
is replaced with two mirrors which bounce a beam of light between them? Jack still sees the beam dropping down and Jill still sees the light beam
travel a longer distance, except this time Jack and Jill
cannot disagree on the speed because the speed of light
remains the same no matter what. And if the speed is the same
while the distance is different, this means the time taken
will be different as well. Thus, time must tick at different rates
for people moving relative to each other. Imagine that Jack and Jill
have highly accurate watches that they synchronize
before Jack boards the train. During the experiment,
Jack and Jill would each see their own watch ticking normally. But if they meet up again later
to compare watches, less time would have
elapsed on Jack's watch, balancing the fact that Jill saw
the light move further. This idea may sound crazy, but like any good scientific theory, it can be tested. In the 1970s, scientists boarded a plane with some super-accurate atomic clocks that were synchronized
with some others left on the ground. After the plane had
flown around the world, the clocks on board
showed a different time from those left behind. Of course, at the speed
of trains and planes, the effect is minuscule. But the faster you go,
the more time dilates. For astronauts orbiting
the Earth for 800 days, it starts to add up. But what affects humans
also affects machines. Satellites of the global
positioning system are also hurdling around the Earth at thousands of miles an hour. So, time dilation kicks in here, too. In fact, their speed causes
the atomic clocks on board to disagree with clocks on the ground by seven millionths of a second daily. Left uncorrected, this would cause GPS to lose accuracy by a few kilometers each day. So, what does all this have
to do with time travel to the far, distant future? Well, the faster you go,
the greater the effect of time dilation. If you could travel really close to the speed of light, say 99.9999%, on a round-trip through space for what seemed to you like ten years, you'd actually return to Earth around the year 9000. Who knows what you'd see
when you returned?! Humanity merged with machines, extinct due to climate change
or asteroid impact, or inhabiting a permanent colony on Mars. But the trouble is, getting heavy things like people,
not to mention space ships, up to such speeds requires
unimaginable amounts of energy. It already takes enormous
particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider to accelerate tiny subatomic particles
to close to light speed. But one day, if we can develop the tools
to accelerate ourselves to similar speeds, then we may regularly send time travelers into the future, bringing with them tales
of a long, forgotten past.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the options in Question 2 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question is needed.

Upon closer inspection, Question 7 and Question 8 relate to time dilation but do not match the ground truth MCQ. 

However, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if we had to choose one, it would be Question 2, as it is the only question that mentions "time dilation" as an effect.

But there is another question that is more similar to the ground truth MCQ than Question 2.

The correct answer is actually Question 8's content is not as similar as Question 4's content to the ground truth MCQ content.

**Question 7: What is the main idea behind the concept of time dilation? Options: A. Time is an absolute concept, B. Time is relative, C. Time is a human construct, D. Time is a physical phenomenon Correct Option: B**

Although this question does not directly mention Albert Einstein or his theory, it captures the essence of the concept of time dilation, which is a fundamental aspect of Einstein's theory of special relativity. The correct option, "Time is relative," aligns with the core idea of special relativity.

However, if I had to choose a question that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, I would select:

**None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.**

But if I had to choose one that is somewhat related, I would select:

**Question 1: Who holds the record for the most amount of time spent orbiting the Earth? Options: A. Sergei Krikalev, B. Albert Michelson, C. Edward Morley, D. Albert Einstein Correct Option: A**

This question is not directly related to the ground truth MCQ, but it does mention Albert Einstein, who is the key figure in the ground truth MCQ.

To better match the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest generating a new question that directly asks about Albert Einstein's theory, such as:

**Question: What is the name of Albert Einstein's theory that explains the nature of time? Options: A. Special relativity, B. General relativity, C. Clock relativity, D. Space relativity Correct Option: A**

This new question would more closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever daydreamed
about traveling through time, perhaps fast forward in the centuries
and seeing the distant future? Well, time travel is possible, and what's more, it's already been done. Meet Sergei Krikalev, the greatest time traveler
in human history. This Russian cosmonaut holds the record for the most amount of time
spent orbiting our planet, a total of 803 days,
9 hours, and 39 minutes. During his stay in space, he time traveled into his own future by 0.02 seconds. Traveling at 17,500 miles an hour, he experienced an effect
known as time dilation, and one day the same effect might make significant time travel
to the future commonplace. To see why moving faster through space
affects passage of time, we need to go back to the 1880s, when two American scientists, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley, were trying to measure the effect
of the Earth's movement around the Sun on the speed of light. When a beam of light was moving
in the same direction as the Earth, they expected the light to travel faster. And when the Earth was moving
in the opposite direction, they expected it to go slower. But they found something very curious. The speed of light remained the same
no matter what the Earth was doing. Two decades later,
Albert Einstein was thinking about the consequences
of that never-changing speed of light. And it was his conclusions, formulated in the theory
of special relativity, that opened the door
into the world of time travel. Imagine a man named Jack, standing in the middle
of a train carriage, traveling at a steady speed. Jack's bored and starts bouncing
a ball up and down. What would Jill, standing on the platform,
see through the window as the train whistles through? Well, between Jack dropping the ball
and catching it again, Jill would have seen him move
slightly further down the track, resulting in her seeing the ball
follow a triangular path. This means Jill sees the ball
travel further than Jack does in the same time period. And because speed
is distance divided by time, Jill actually sees the ball move faster. But what if Jack's bouncing ball
is replaced with two mirrors which bounce a beam of light between them? Jack still sees the beam dropping down and Jill still sees the light beam
travel a longer distance, except this time Jack and Jill
cannot disagree on the speed because the speed of light
remains the same no matter what. And if the speed is the same
while the distance is different, this means the time taken
will be different as well. Thus, time must tick at different rates
for people moving relative to each other. Imagine that Jack and Jill
have highly accurate watches that they synchronize
before Jack boards the train. During the experiment,
Jack and Jill would each see their own watch ticking normally. But if they meet up again later
to compare watches, less time would have
elapsed on Jack's watch, balancing the fact that Jill saw
the light move further. This idea may sound crazy, but like any good scientific theory, it can be tested. In the 1970s, scientists boarded a plane with some super-accurate atomic clocks that were synchronized
with some others left on the ground. After the plane had
flown around the world, the clocks on board
showed a different time from those left behind. Of course, at the speed
of trains and planes, the effect is minuscule. But the faster you go,
the more time dilates. For astronauts orbiting
the Earth for 800 days, it starts to add up. But what affects humans
also affects machines. Satellites of the global
positioning system are also hurdling around the Earth at thousands of miles an hour. So, time dilation kicks in here, too. In fact, their speed causes
the atomic clocks on board to disagree with clocks on the ground by seven millionths of a second daily. Left uncorrected, this would cause GPS to lose accuracy by a few kilometers each day. So, what does all this have
to do with time travel to the far, distant future? Well, the faster you go,
the greater the effect of time dilation. If you could travel really close to the speed of light, say 99.9999%, on a round-trip through space for what seemed to you like ten years, you'd actually return to Earth around the year 9000. Who knows what you'd see
when you returned?! Humanity merged with machines, extinct due to climate change
or asteroid impact, or inhabiting a permanent colony on Mars. But the trouble is, getting heavy things like people,
not to mention space ships, up to such speeds requires
unimaginable amounts of energy. It already takes enormous
particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider to accelerate tiny subatomic particles
to close to light speed. But one day, if we can develop the tools
to accelerate ourselves to similar speeds, then we may regularly send time travelers into the future, bringing with them tales
of a long, forgotten past.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4: What happens to time when an object travels close to the speed of light? Options: A. Time speeds up, B. Time slows down, C. Time remains the same, D. Time becomes irrelevant Correct Option: B**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and options. But among the given options, it is the closest match.

A more suitable match would be a question that specifically asks about the time elapsed on Earth when traveling close to the speed of light for a certain period. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

But if I had to choose the closest match, I would say it is **Question 4**.

However, I must note that **Question 8: What is the relationship between speed and time? Options: A. Speed increases time, B. Speed decreases time, C. Speed has no effect on time, D. Speed is inversely proportional to time Correct Option: B** also addresses the concept of time dilation and its relationship with speed, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

But again, it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and options.

If I really had to choose the closest match, I would say it is **Question 4**, but with the caveat that it is not an exact match.

However, I can try to provide a more suitable match by analyzing the content of the generated MCQs again.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that **Question 6: What might be observed when returning to Earth after traveling to the future at high speeds? Options: A. A world that has not changed, B. A world that has merged with machines, C. A world that has been destroyed, D. A world with unforeseen consequences Correct Option: D** mentions traveling to the future at high speeds and returning to Earth, which is similar to the scenario described in the ground truth MCQ.

However, the options provided in Question 6 do not match the options in the ground truth MCQ.

But in terms of content and intent, **Question 6** is a closer match than **Question 4**.

So, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is **Question 6**, but with the caveat that the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

In conclusion, while there is no exact match among the generated MCQs, I would say that **Question 6** is the closest match in terms of content and intent.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers uh that work together on a remarkable film project for the last four years um and along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization so I want to show you clip of the film now hopefully it won't stutter um and uh if we did our jobs well you won't know that we uh were even involved I don't know how it's possible but you seem to have more higher what if I told you that I wasn't getting older but I was getting younger everybody [Music] else I was born with some form of disease what kind of disease I was born old I'm sorry no need to be there's nothing wrong with old [Music] age are you sick I heard mama and tizzy whisper and they said I was going to die soon but maybe not you're different than anybody I've ever met there were many changes some you could see some you couldn't hair has started growing in all sorts of places along with other things I felt pretty good considering that was a clip from The Curious Case of Benjamin Button many you maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story um but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film The main character Benjamin Button who's played by Brad Pit is completely computer generated from the neck up now there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimposed over over another actor's body we've created a completely digital human head so I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project this is based on an F Scott Fitzgerald short story um it's about a man who's born old and lives his life In Reverse um now this movie's floated around Hollywood for well over half a century uh we first got involved with the project in the early 90s with Ron Howard as the Director we took a lot of meetings and uh we seriously considered it and at the time we had to throw in the towel uh it was deemed impossible it was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man Aging in back backwards the the human form and particularly the human head has been considered the Holy Grail of our industry um the project came back to us about a decade later and this time with a director named David Fincher now Fincher is is an interesting guy um David is fearless of technology and he is absolutely tenacious and David won't take no and David believed like we do uh in the visual effects industry that anything is possible as long as you have enough time resources and of course money um and so David had an interesting take on the film and he threw a challenge at us he wanted the film to be or the main character of the film to be played from the Cradle to the Grave by one actor it happened to be this guy we went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery uh with Dave and we ruled out of course swapping actors that was one idea that we would have different actors we would hand off from actor to actor and we even ruled out the idea of using makeup we we realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up um particularly in closeup and makeup is an additive process you have to build the face up and David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's face to bring the Aging to this character uh he needed to be very sympathetic character um so we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of Benjamin at different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a computer generated version of Brad's head aged to appear as Benjamin and attach that to the body of the real actor sounded great of course this was the Holy Grail of our our industry and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help uh either because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store you know we see his face constantly so there really was no tolerable margin of error there were two Studios involved uh Warner Brothers and paramont and they both believed this would make an amazing film of course but it was a very high-risk proposition there was lots of money and reputations at stake and um we believed that we had a very solid methodology that might work uh but despite our verbal assurances they wanted some proof um and so in 2004 they commissioned us to do a a screen test of Benjamin and uh we did it in about five weeks uh but we used lots of cheats and shortcuts we basically put something together to get through the meeting and I'll roll that for you now this was the first test for Benjamin Button and in here you can see it's a that's a computer generated head it's pretty good attached to the body of another actor um and it worked and it gave the studio great relief after many years of starts and stops on this project and and making that tough decision uh they finally decided to Greenlight the movie and I can remember actually when I got the phone call to congratulate us that the the movie was a go I I actually threw up uh um you know this is this is some tough stuff um so we we started to have early team meetings and and we got everybody together and um it was really more like therapy in the beginning uh convincing other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this we had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character and it's not a special effects film it has to be a man um we we really felt like we were a in a kind of like a 12-step program and of course you know the first step is admit you've got a problem so um we had a big problem we didn't know how we were going to do this um and uh but we did know one thing being from the visual effects industry we with David believed that we now had enough time enough resource ources and God we hoped we had enough money um and we had enough passion to will the process season technology into existence so when you're faced with something like that of course you got to break it down you take the big problem you break it down into smaller pieces and you can start to attack that so we had three main areas that we had to focus on we needed to make Brad look a lot older we needed to age him 45 years or so um and we also needed to make sure that um we could take Brad's uh idiosyncrasies his little ticks the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that trans through our process so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen and we also needed to create um a character that could hold up under really all conditions uh he needed to be able to walk in broad daylight at night time under candl light he had to hold an extreme closeup he had to deliver dialogue he had to be able to run he had to be able to sweat he had to be able to take a bath to cry he even had to throw up not all at the same time but he had to you know do all of those those things and the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie we did about 325 shots so we needed A system that would allow Benjamin to be able to do everything a human being can do and we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state-of-the-art of technology in about 2004 and where we needed it to be so we focused on motion capture now I'm sure many of you have seen motion capture um and and the state-of-the-art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture I'll show you an example here it's basically the idea of you wear a leotard and they put some reflective markers on your body and instead of using cameras there's infrared sensors around of volume and those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional position of those markers in real time and then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers and apply them to a computer generated character so you can see the uh computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the uh as the dancers so we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process and as you can see it gives you a a pretty crappy performance um that's not terribly compelling and what we realized was that what we needed was the information what was going on between the markers we needed the the subtleties of the skin we needed to see skin moving over muscle over bone needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things so our first big Revelation was to completely abort and walk away from the technology of the day the status quo the state-of-the-art and so we aborted using motion capture and we were now well out of our comfort zone and un Uncharted Territory so we were left with this idea that we ended up kind of calling uh technology stew we started to look out in other fields and the idea was that we were going to find nuggets or gems of technology that perhaps come from other Industries like Medical Imaging or the the video game space and and reappropriate them and we had to create kind of a a sauce and the sauce was a code in software that we written to allow these disperate pieces of Technologies to come together and work as one and so initially we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named Dr Paul mman in the early '70s and he believed uh that he could in fact catalog the human face and he came up with his idea of facial action coding system he believed that there are basically 70 basic poses or shapes of the human face and that um from those basic poses or shapes of the face they can be combined to create infinite possibilities of everything the human face is capable of doing and of course um these transcend age race culture gender and so this was uh became kind of the foundation of our research as we went forward and then we came across some remarkable technology called contour and here you can see a subject having phosphorescent makeup stippled on her face and now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture as opposed to a marker capture the subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras and those cameras can frame by frame reconstruct geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment right so effectively you get uh 3D data in real time of the subject and if you look in a comparison on the left uh we we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us so clearly we were in a substantially better place for this but these were the early days of this technology and it wasn't really proven yet but you know we measure uh complexity and and Fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count and so um on the left we were seeing 100,000 polygons we could go up into the millions of polygons it seemed to be infinite this is when we had our our aha this was the Breakthrough this is when like okay we're going to be okay this is actually going to work and um the AHA was what if we could take Brad Pit and we could put Brad uh in this device um and use this Contour process and we could stipple on the phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights and we could in fact scan him in real time performing eckman's fax poses right so effectively we ended up with a 3D database of Everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing so from there we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of of his face so we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes a complete database of all possibilities that his face is capable of of uh of doing now that's great except we had him at age 44 we need to put another 40 years on him at this point we brought in Rick Baker and Rick's one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry and uh and we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu suji and Kazu suuji is one of the great photo real sculptors of our time and we commissioned them to make a uh a maette or a bust of of Benjamin and so in the spirit of the great unveiling I had to do this I had to I had to unveil something so this is Ben 80 right now with uh um we created three of these there's Ben 80 there's Ben 70 there's Ben 60 and this really became the uh the template of moving forward now this was made from a life cast of Brad so in fact um anatomically it is correct the eyes the jaw the teeth everything is imperfect alignment with what the real guy has we have these mettes scanned into the computer at at very high RIS resolution an enormous polygonal count um and so now we had uh three age increments of Benjamin in the computer but we needed to get um a database of him doing more than that so we went through this process then called retargeting so this is Brad doing one of the emman fact poses and here's the resulting data that comes from that or the model that comes from that and retargeting is the process of transposing that data onto another model and because the Life cast or the bust the maette of Benjamin was made from Brad we could transpose the data of Brad at 44 onto Brad at 87 so now we had a 3D database of Everything Brad Pitt's face can do at age ' 87 in his 70s and then in his 60s next we had to go into the shooting process so while that's going on we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world and we shot our body actors and we shot them wearing blue hoods so these are the gentlemen who played Benjamin and the blue hoods helped us for two things one we could easily erase their heads and we also put tracking markers on their heads so so in fact we could recreate the camera motion and the lens Optics from the set but now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin and so we edited the footage that was shot on the location with the the rest of the cast and the uh uh the body actors and um about 6 months later we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles and he watched on the screen and uh his job then was to become Benjamin and so we looped the scenes he watched again and again we encouraged him to improvise and he took Benjamin and interesting unusual places that we didn't think he was going to go we shot him with four HD cameras so we get multiple views of him and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast and from there we went into a process called image analysis and so here you can see again the chosen take and we are seeing now that data being transposed onto Ben 877 and so what's interesting about this is we use something called image analysis which is taking timings from different components of benjam 's face so we could choose say his left eyebrow and the software would tell us that well in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here it concludes moving in frame 32 and so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from and then the sauce I talked about with our technology stew that secret sauce um was effectively software that allowed us to match the performance footage of Brad in liveaction uh with our our database of aged Benjamin the the fact shapes that we had and on a frame by frame basis we could actually reconstruct a 3D head that exactly matched the performance of Brad so this was how the finish shot appeared in the film and here you can see the body actor and then this is what we called the dead head no reference to Jerry Garcia and uh then here's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance and then again the final shot it was a long process um so thank you um next next section here I'm going to just blast through this because we could do a whole Ted Talk on the next you know several slides um we had to create a lighting system so really a big part of our proc say we're creating a lighting environment for every single location that Benjamin had to appear so that um we could put Ben's head into any scene and would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors in the real world we also had to create an eye system we found the old adage you know the eyes of the window to the soul is absolutely true so the goal here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes and if you could feel the warmth and feel the humanity and feel his intent coming through the eyes then we would succeed so we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years we also had to create a mouth system we worked from Dental molds of Brad we had to age the teeth over time we also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words so there's a whole system in software written to articulate the tongue we had one person voted of the tongue for about 9 months he was uh he was very popular skin displacement another big deal the skin had to be absolutely accurate and he's also in an old age home he's in a nursing home around other old people so he had to look exactly the same as the others so lots of work on skin deformation you can see in some of these cases it works in some cases it looks bad this is a very very very early test in our process so effectively we created a digital puppet that Brad Pit could operate with his own face there were no animators necessary to come in and interpret beh behavior um or uh enhance his performance there was something we encountered though that we end up kind of calling uh the digital Botox effect so as things kind of went through this process it did kind of um uh Fincher would always say it sand blasts the edges off of the performance and one thing that our our our process and the technology uh couldn't do is it couldn't understand intent the intent of the actor so it sees A Smile as a smile it doesn't recognize an ironic smile or a a happy smile or frustrated smile so it did take humans to kind of push it one way or the other um but we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology emotion capture as opposed to just motion capture so take take another look well I heard mama and tizzy whisper and they said I was going to die soon but maybe not well I heard mama and tizzy Whispering they said I was going to die soon but maybe not well I heard mama and tizzy whis and they said I was going to die soon but maybe not that's how to create a digital human in 18 minutes U thank [Music] you just a couple of uh just quick factoids it it really took uh 155 people over two years um and we didn't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all digital haircut but uh that is Benjamin thank you [Applause] incredible

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 5: What was the name of the process used to transpose the data of Brad Pitt's face at 44 onto his face at 87? Options: A. Retargeting, B. Image analysis, C. Motion capture, D. Facial marker tracking Correct Option: A**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about "step two in Ulbrich's process" which is not explicitly mentioned in the generated MCQs. But, based on the content of the transcript, we can infer that "breaking the problem down" is a key step in the process, which is mentioned in the transcript as:

"...when you're faced with something like that of course you got to break it down you take the big problem you break it down into smaller pieces and you can start to attack that..."

A generated MCQ that closely matches this intent is not available. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 3** or **Question 11** might be related to the process, but they do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that **Question 5** is the most similar, but please note that it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index: 5 (with the caveat that it's not an exact match)

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers uh that work together on a remarkable film project for the last four years um and along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization so I want to show you clip of the film now hopefully it won't stutter um and uh if we did our jobs well you won't know that we uh were even involved I don't know how it's possible but you seem to have more higher what if I told you that I wasn't getting older but I was getting younger everybody [Music] else I was born with some form of disease what kind of disease I was born old I'm sorry no need to be there's nothing wrong with old [Music] age are you sick I heard mama and tizzy whisper and they said I was going to die soon but maybe not you're different than anybody I've ever met there were many changes some you could see some you couldn't hair has started growing in all sorts of places along with other things I felt pretty good considering that was a clip from The Curious Case of Benjamin Button many you maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story um but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film The main character Benjamin Button who's played by Brad Pit is completely computer generated from the neck up now there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimposed over over another actor's body we've created a completely digital human head so I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project this is based on an F Scott Fitzgerald short story um it's about a man who's born old and lives his life In Reverse um now this movie's floated around Hollywood for well over half a century uh we first got involved with the project in the early 90s with Ron Howard as the Director we took a lot of meetings and uh we seriously considered it and at the time we had to throw in the towel uh it was deemed impossible it was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man Aging in back backwards the the human form and particularly the human head has been considered the Holy Grail of our industry um the project came back to us about a decade later and this time with a director named David Fincher now Fincher is is an interesting guy um David is fearless of technology and he is absolutely tenacious and David won't take no and David believed like we do uh in the visual effects industry that anything is possible as long as you have enough time resources and of course money um and so David had an interesting take on the film and he threw a challenge at us he wanted the film to be or the main character of the film to be played from the Cradle to the Grave by one actor it happened to be this guy we went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery uh with Dave and we ruled out of course swapping actors that was one idea that we would have different actors we would hand off from actor to actor and we even ruled out the idea of using makeup we we realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up um particularly in closeup and makeup is an additive process you have to build the face up and David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's face to bring the Aging to this character uh he needed to be very sympathetic character um so we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of Benjamin at different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a computer generated version of Brad's head aged to appear as Benjamin and attach that to the body of the real actor sounded great of course this was the Holy Grail of our our industry and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help uh either because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store you know we see his face constantly so there really was no tolerable margin of error there were two Studios involved uh Warner Brothers and paramont and they both believed this would make an amazing film of course but it was a very high-risk proposition there was lots of money and reputations at stake and um we believed that we had a very solid methodology that might work uh but despite our verbal assurances they wanted some proof um and so in 2004 they commissioned us to do a a screen test of Benjamin and uh we did it in about five weeks uh but we used lots of cheats and shortcuts we basically put something together to get through the meeting and I'll roll that for you now this was the first test for Benjamin Button and in here you can see it's a that's a computer generated head it's pretty good attached to the body of another actor um and it worked and it gave the studio great relief after many years of starts and stops on this project and and making that tough decision uh they finally decided to Greenlight the movie and I can remember actually when I got the phone call to congratulate us that the the movie was a go I I actually threw up uh um you know this is this is some tough stuff um so we we started to have early team meetings and and we got everybody together and um it was really more like therapy in the beginning uh convincing other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this we had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character and it's not a special effects film it has to be a man um we we really felt like we were a in a kind of like a 12-step program and of course you know the first step is admit you've got a problem so um we had a big problem we didn't know how we were going to do this um and uh but we did know one thing being from the visual effects industry we with David believed that we now had enough time enough resource ources and God we hoped we had enough money um and we had enough passion to will the process season technology into existence so when you're faced with something like that of course you got to break it down you take the big problem you break it down into smaller pieces and you can start to attack that so we had three main areas that we had to focus on we needed to make Brad look a lot older we needed to age him 45 years or so um and we also needed to make sure that um we could take Brad's uh idiosyncrasies his little ticks the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that trans through our process so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen and we also needed to create um a character that could hold up under really all conditions uh he needed to be able to walk in broad daylight at night time under candl light he had to hold an extreme closeup he had to deliver dialogue he had to be able to run he had to be able to sweat he had to be able to take a bath to cry he even had to throw up not all at the same time but he had to you know do all of those those things and the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie we did about 325 shots so we needed A system that would allow Benjamin to be able to do everything a human being can do and we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state-of-the-art of technology in about 2004 and where we needed it to be so we focused on motion capture now I'm sure many of you have seen motion capture um and and the state-of-the-art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture I'll show you an example here it's basically the idea of you wear a leotard and they put some reflective markers on your body and instead of using cameras there's infrared sensors around of volume and those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional position of those markers in real time and then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers and apply them to a computer generated character so you can see the uh computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the uh as the dancers so we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process and as you can see it gives you a a pretty crappy performance um that's not terribly compelling and what we realized was that what we needed was the information what was going on between the markers we needed the the subtleties of the skin we needed to see skin moving over muscle over bone needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things so our first big Revelation was to completely abort and walk away from the technology of the day the status quo the state-of-the-art and so we aborted using motion capture and we were now well out of our comfort zone and un Uncharted Territory so we were left with this idea that we ended up kind of calling uh technology stew we started to look out in other fields and the idea was that we were going to find nuggets or gems of technology that perhaps come from other Industries like Medical Imaging or the the video game space and and reappropriate them and we had to create kind of a a sauce and the sauce was a code in software that we written to allow these disperate pieces of Technologies to come together and work as one and so initially we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named Dr Paul mman in the early '70s and he believed uh that he could in fact catalog the human face and he came up with his idea of facial action coding system he believed that there are basically 70 basic poses or shapes of the human face and that um from those basic poses or shapes of the face they can be combined to create infinite possibilities of everything the human face is capable of doing and of course um these transcend age race culture gender and so this was uh became kind of the foundation of our research as we went forward and then we came across some remarkable technology called contour and here you can see a subject having phosphorescent makeup stippled on her face and now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture as opposed to a marker capture the subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras and those cameras can frame by frame reconstruct geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment right so effectively you get uh 3D data in real time of the subject and if you look in a comparison on the left uh we we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us so clearly we were in a substantially better place for this but these were the early days of this technology and it wasn't really proven yet but you know we measure uh complexity and and Fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count and so um on the left we were seeing 100,000 polygons we could go up into the millions of polygons it seemed to be infinite this is when we had our our aha this was the Breakthrough this is when like okay we're going to be okay this is actually going to work and um the AHA was what if we could take Brad Pit and we could put Brad uh in this device um and use this Contour process and we could stipple on the phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights and we could in fact scan him in real time performing eckman's fax poses right so effectively we ended up with a 3D database of Everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing so from there we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of of his face so we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes a complete database of all possibilities that his face is capable of of uh of doing now that's great except we had him at age 44 we need to put another 40 years on him at this point we brought in Rick Baker and Rick's one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry and uh and we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu suji and Kazu suuji is one of the great photo real sculptors of our time and we commissioned them to make a uh a maette or a bust of of Benjamin and so in the spirit of the great unveiling I had to do this I had to I had to unveil something so this is Ben 80 right now with uh um we created three of these there's Ben 80 there's Ben 70 there's Ben 60 and this really became the uh the template of moving forward now this was made from a life cast of Brad so in fact um anatomically it is correct the eyes the jaw the teeth everything is imperfect alignment with what the real guy has we have these mettes scanned into the computer at at very high RIS resolution an enormous polygonal count um and so now we had uh three age increments of Benjamin in the computer but we needed to get um a database of him doing more than that so we went through this process then called retargeting so this is Brad doing one of the emman fact poses and here's the resulting data that comes from that or the model that comes from that and retargeting is the process of transposing that data onto another model and because the Life cast or the bust the maette of Benjamin was made from Brad we could transpose the data of Brad at 44 onto Brad at 87 so now we had a 3D database of Everything Brad Pitt's face can do at age ' 87 in his 70s and then in his 60s next we had to go into the shooting process so while that's going on we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world and we shot our body actors and we shot them wearing blue hoods so these are the gentlemen who played Benjamin and the blue hoods helped us for two things one we could easily erase their heads and we also put tracking markers on their heads so so in fact we could recreate the camera motion and the lens Optics from the set but now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin and so we edited the footage that was shot on the location with the the rest of the cast and the uh uh the body actors and um about 6 months later we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles and he watched on the screen and uh his job then was to become Benjamin and so we looped the scenes he watched again and again we encouraged him to improvise and he took Benjamin and interesting unusual places that we didn't think he was going to go we shot him with four HD cameras so we get multiple views of him and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast and from there we went into a process called image analysis and so here you can see again the chosen take and we are seeing now that data being transposed onto Ben 877 and so what's interesting about this is we use something called image analysis which is taking timings from different components of benjam 's face so we could choose say his left eyebrow and the software would tell us that well in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here it concludes moving in frame 32 and so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from and then the sauce I talked about with our technology stew that secret sauce um was effectively software that allowed us to match the performance footage of Brad in liveaction uh with our our database of aged Benjamin the the fact shapes that we had and on a frame by frame basis we could actually reconstruct a 3D head that exactly matched the performance of Brad so this was how the finish shot appeared in the film and here you can see the body actor and then this is what we called the dead head no reference to Jerry Garcia and uh then here's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance and then again the final shot it was a long process um so thank you um next next section here I'm going to just blast through this because we could do a whole Ted Talk on the next you know several slides um we had to create a lighting system so really a big part of our proc say we're creating a lighting environment for every single location that Benjamin had to appear so that um we could put Ben's head into any scene and would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors in the real world we also had to create an eye system we found the old adage you know the eyes of the window to the soul is absolutely true so the goal here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes and if you could feel the warmth and feel the humanity and feel his intent coming through the eyes then we would succeed so we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years we also had to create a mouth system we worked from Dental molds of Brad we had to age the teeth over time we also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words so there's a whole system in software written to articulate the tongue we had one person voted of the tongue for about 9 months he was uh he was very popular skin displacement another big deal the skin had to be absolutely accurate and he's also in an old age home he's in a nursing home around other old people so he had to look exactly the same as the others so lots of work on skin deformation you can see in some of these cases it works in some cases it looks bad this is a very very very early test in our process so effectively we created a digital puppet that Brad Pit could operate with his own face there were no animators necessary to come in and interpret beh behavior um or uh enhance his performance there was something we encountered though that we end up kind of calling uh the digital Botox effect so as things kind of went through this process it did kind of um uh Fincher would always say it sand blasts the edges off of the performance and one thing that our our our process and the technology uh couldn't do is it couldn't understand intent the intent of the actor so it sees A Smile as a smile it doesn't recognize an ironic smile or a a happy smile or frustrated smile so it did take humans to kind of push it one way or the other um but we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology emotion capture as opposed to just motion capture so take take another look well I heard mama and tizzy whisper and they said I was going to die soon but maybe not well I heard mama and tizzy Whispering they said I was going to die soon but maybe not well I heard mama and tizzy whis and they said I was going to die soon but maybe not that's how to create a digital human in 18 minutes U thank [Music] you just a couple of uh just quick factoids it it really took uh 155 people over two years um and we didn't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all digital haircut but uh that is Benjamin thank you [Applause] incredible

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about a quote from Jose Antonio Abreu, while the generated MCQs are about ballet. 

However, since I must provide an answer, I will choose the one that is the least dissimilar. 

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: None 

If I really had to choose: 9 

This is because both the ground truth MCQ and generated MCQ 9 have a philosophical tone and discuss the relationship between two concepts (singing/playing and perfection/excellence, and ballet and music, respectively). However, this is a very weak connection, and the two questions are still quite dissimilar.

I want to start by asking you to think back to when you were a kid playing with blocks as you figured out how to reach out and grasp pick them up and move them around you're actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us so as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects along with my adviser Patty and my collaborator Jeevan kallana thei I started to wonder what if when we use a computer instead of having this one mouse cursor that it was like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically arranging it the way we wanted this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer by building SIF tables in a nutshell acceptable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie they're able to be moved around by hand they can sense each other they can sense their motion and they have a screen and a wireless radio most importantly their physical select the blocks you can move them just by reaching out and grasping and the septa bowls are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information and as these tools become more physical more aware of their motion aware of each other and aware of the nuance of how we move them we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles so I'm going to start with some simple examples this system was configured to show video and if I tilt it in one direction he'll roll the video this way if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards and these interactive portraits are aware of each other so if I put them next to each other they get interested if they get surrounded they notice that - you might get a little flustered and they can also sense their motion and tilt so one of the interesting implications on interaction we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid so in this case we've got three septa bowls configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one where they get mixed if we overshoot we can pour a little bit back there are also some neat possibilities for education like language math and logic games so you want to give people the ability to try things quickly and view the results immediately so here I'm this is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and boggle basically in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each sip table and as you try to make words it checks against the dictionary then after about 30 seconds it reshuffles and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try thank you so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab and I managed to get them to try it out and shoot a video they really loved it and one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions all I have to say is make words and they know exactly what to do so here's another few people trying it out that's our youngest beta tester down there on the right turns out all he wanted to do was to stack the SIF tables up so to him there were just blocks now this is an interactive cartoon application and we wanted to build a learning tool for for language learners and this is Felix actually and he can bring new characters into the scene just by lifting the SIP tools off the table that have that character shown on them here he's bringing the Sun out the Sun is rising now he's brought a tractor into the scene the orange tractor so by shaking the SIP Sable's and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact inventing his own narrative it's an open-ended story and he gets to decide how it unfolds so the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we've built recently in which sift Able's act as sounds like lead bass and drums each of these has four different variations you get to choose which one you want to use and you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want and you inject it by just bumping up the sound Cybil against a sequence if table there are effects that you can control live like reverb and filter you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it and then overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence so let's have a look start by putting a lead into two sequence if tables arrange them into a series extend it add a little more lead now I put a bassline in now I'll put some percussion in and now I'll attach the filter to the drum so I can control the effect live I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo to 1 one way or the other and now I'll attach the filter to the base for some more expression I can rearrange the sequence while it plays I don't have to plan it out in advance but I can improvise changing it making it longer or shorter as I go and now finally I can fade the whole sequence out using the volume shift of all tilted to the left thank you so as you can see my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work and today I had time to show you one point in this new design space and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory so the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms thank you very much I look forward to talking with all of you

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the speaker's childhood experience of playing with building blocks and what they were actually doing during that time. The correct option is "Learning how to think and solve problems."

Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content. Although it does not ask about the speaker's childhood experience, it asks about the inspiration behind creating a new human-computer interface, which is related to the idea of learning and problem-solving.

However, a closer look at the options reveals that Question 1 is not a perfect match. A better match would be a question that asks about the speaker's childhood experience or the benefits of playing with blocks.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask about the speaker's childhood experience or the benefits of playing with blocks. Therefore, I must conclude that there is no perfect match among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 1, but with a caveat that it is not a perfect match.

Mysteries of vernacular: Ukulele, a small, four-stringed guitar. Oddly enough, the word ukulele, in its native Hawaiian, literally translates to jumping flea. Even more surprising, the instrument itself did not originate in Hawaii. So, how did a Hawaiian word come to describe a non-Hawaiian instrument? Back in the late 1800s, King Kalākaua was the last reigning king of the kingdom of Hawaii. He was nicknamed "The Merry Monarch" because of his joy for life and, in particular, his love of music. In the King's court, there was a former British army officer named Edward Purvis. Though a small man, he was quite lively, and his nickname was "Jumping Flea," "Ukulele" in Hawaiian. Like the King, he was a great lover of music. In 1879, a group of Portuguese immigrants arrived on the islands of Hawaii, bringing with them a small, four-stringed guitar known as a braguinha. Purvis was immediately taken with the instrument and helped spread its popularity throughout the King's court. As the story goes, it was not long before his nickname, Ukulele, jumped from the man to his favorite instrument. As demand grew, several Portuguese families began to manufacture the minuscule guitar on the islands, making small modifications until it became the same ukulele we recognize today.

What is the shape of a molecule? Well, a molecule is mostly empty space. Almost all of its mass is concentrated in the extremely dense nuclei of its atoms. And its electrons, which determine how the atoms are bonded to each other, are more like clouds of negative charge than individual, discrete particles. So, a molecule doesn't have a shape in the same way that, for example, a statue has a shape. But for every molecule, there's at least one way to arrange the nuclei and electrons so as to maximize the attraction of opposite charges and minimize the repulsion of like charges. Now, let's assume that the only electrons that matter to a molecule's shape are the outermost ones from each participating atom. And let's also assume that the electron clouds in between atoms, in other words, a molecule's bonds, are shaped kind of like sausages. Remember that nuclei are positively charged and electrons are negatively charged, and if all of a molecule's nuclei were bunched up together or all of its electrons were bunched up together, they would just repel each other and fly apart, and that doesn't help anyone. In 1776, Alessandro Volta, decades before he would eventually invent batteries, discovered methane. Now, the chemical formula of methane is CH4. And this formula tells us that every molecule of methane is made up of one carbon and four hydrogen atoms, but it doesn't tell us what's bonded to what or how they atoms are arranged in 3D space. From their electron configurations, we know that carbon can bond with up to four other atoms and that each hydrogen can only bond with one other atom. So, we can guess that the carbon should be the central atom bonded to all the hydrogens. Now, each bond represents the sharing of two electrons and we draw each shared pair of electrons as a line. So, now we have a flat representation of this molecule, but how would it look in three dimensions? We can reasonably say that because each of these bonds is a region of negative electric charge and like charges repel each other, the most favorable configuration of atoms would maximize the distance between bonds. And to get all the bonds as far away from each other as possible, the optimal shape is this. This is called a tetrahedron. Now, depending on the different atoms involved, you can actually get lots of different shapes. Ammonia, or NH3, is shaped like a pyramid. Carbon dioxide, or CO2, is a straight line. Water, H2O, is bent like your elbow would be bent. And chlorine trifluoride, or ClF3, is shaped like the letter T. Remember that what we've been doing here is expanding on our model of atoms and electrons to build up to 3D shapes. We'd have to do experiments to figure out if these molecules actually do have the shapes we predict. Spoiler alert: most of the do, but some of them don't. Now, shapes get more complicated as you increase the number of atoms. All the examples we just talked about had one obviously central atom, but most molecules, from relatively small pharmaceuticals all the way up to long polymers like DNA or proteins, don't. The key thing to remember is that bonded atoms will arrange themselves to maximize the attraction between opposite charges and minimize the repulsion between like charges. Some molecules even have two or more stable arrangements of atoms, and we can actually get really cool chemistry from the switches between those configurations, even when the composition of that molecule, that's to say the number and identity of its atoms, has not changed at all.

**Transcript**:
What is the shape of a molecule? Well, a molecule is mostly empty space. Almost all of its mass is concentrated in the extremely dense nuclei of its atoms. And its electrons, which determine how the atoms are bonded to each other, are more like clouds of negative charge than individual, discrete particles. So, a molecule doesn't have a shape in the same way that, for example, a statue has a shape. But for every molecule, there's at least one way to arrange the nuclei and electrons so as to maximize the attraction of opposite charges and minimize the repulsion of like charges. Now, let's assume that the only electrons that matter to a molecule's shape are the outermost ones from each participating atom. And let's also assume that the electron clouds in between atoms, in other words, a molecule's bonds, are shaped kind of like sausages. Remember that nuclei are positively charged and electrons are negatively charged, and if all of a molecule's nuclei were bunched up together or all of its electrons were bunched up together, they would just repel each other and fly apart, and that doesn't help anyone. In 1776, Alessandro Volta, decades before he would eventually invent batteries, discovered methane. Now, the chemical formula of methane is CH4. And this formula tells us that every molecule of methane is made up of one carbon and four hydrogen atoms, but it doesn't tell us what's bonded to what or how they atoms are arranged in 3D space. From their electron configurations, we know that carbon can bond with up to four other atoms and that each hydrogen can only bond with one other atom. So, we can guess that the carbon should be the central atom bonded to all the hydrogens. Now, each bond represents the sharing of two electrons and we draw each shared pair of electrons as a line. So, now we have a flat representation of this molecule, but how would it look in three dimensions? We can reasonably say that because each of these bonds is a region of negative electric charge and like charges repel each other, the most favorable configuration of atoms would maximize the distance between bonds. And to get all the bonds as far away from each other as possible, the optimal shape is this. This is called a tetrahedron. Now, depending on the different atoms involved, you can actually get lots of different shapes. Ammonia, or NH3, is shaped like a pyramid. Carbon dioxide, or CO2, is a straight line. Water, H2O, is bent like your elbow would be bent. And chlorine trifluoride, or ClF3, is shaped like the letter T. Remember that what we've been doing here is expanding on our model of atoms and electrons to build up to 3D shapes. We'd have to do experiments to figure out if these molecules actually do have the shapes we predict. Spoiler alert: most of the do, but some of them don't. Now, shapes get more complicated as you increase the number of atoms. All the examples we just talked about had one obviously central atom, but most molecules, from relatively small pharmaceuticals all the way up to long polymers like DNA or proteins, don't. The key thing to remember is that bonded atoms will arrange themselves to maximize the attraction between opposite charges and minimize the repulsion between like charges. Some molecules even have two or more stable arrangements of atoms, and we can actually get really cool chemistry from the switches between those configurations, even when the composition of that molecule, that's to say the number and identity of its atoms, has not changed at all.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. However, it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about a different molecule (carbon dioxide) being shaped like a straight line, and one of the options (D) is the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ.

A more similar generated MCQ would be one that specifically asks about the shape of chlorine trifluoride (ClF3). Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say Question 7 is the closest, but with a caveat that it's not an exact match.

**Transcript**:
You probably know that all stuff
is made up of atoms and that an atom is a really, really, really,
really tiny particle. Every atom has a core, which is made up of at least one positively charged particle called a proton, and in most cases, some number of neutral
particles called neutrons. That core is surrounded by negatively charged
particles called electrons. The identity of an atom is determined only by the number
of protons in its nucleus. Hydrogen is hydrogen because it
has just one proton, carbon is carbon because it has six, gold is gold because it has 79, and so on. Indulge me in a momentary tangent. How do we know about atomic structure? We can't see protons,
neutrons, or electrons. So, we do a bunch of experiments and develop a model
for what we think is there. Then we do some more experiments and see if they agree with the model. If they do, great. If they don't, it might
be time for a new model. We've had lots of very
different models for atoms since Democritus in 400 BC, and there will almost certainly be many more to come. Okay, tangent over. The cores of atoms tend to stick together, but electrons are free to move, and this is why chemists love electrons. If we could marry them, we probably would. But electrons are weird. They appear to behave either as particles, like little baseballs, or as waves, like water waves, depending on the experiment
that we perform. One of the weirdest things about electrons is that we can't exactly
say where they are. It's not that we don't have the equipment, it's that this uncertainty is part of our model of the electron. So, we can't pinpoint them, fine. But we can say
there's a certain probability of finding an electron in a given space around the nucleus. And that means that we can
ask the following question: If we drew a shape around the nucleus such that we would be 95% sure of finding a given electron
within that shape, what would it look like? Here are a few of these shapes. Chemists call them orbitals, and what each one looks like depends on, among other things, how much energy it has. The more energy an orbital has, the farther most of its density is from the nucleus. By they way, why did we pick 95% and not 100%? Well, that's another quirk of our model of the electron. Past a certain distance from the nucleus, the probability of finding an electron starts to decrease more or less exponentially, which means that while it
will approach zero, it'll never actually hit zero. So, in every atom, there is some small,
but non-zero, probability that for a very, very
short period of time, one of its electrons is at the other end of the known universe. But mostly electrons stay
close to their nucleus as clouds of negative charged density that shift and move with time. How electrons from one atom interact with electrons from another determines almost everything. Atoms can give up their electrons, surrendering them to other atoms, or they can share electrons. And the dynamics of this social network are what make chemistry interesting. From plain old rocks to the beautiful complexity of life, the nature of everything we see, hear, smell, taste, touch, and even feel is determined at the atomic level.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although Question 3 does not directly ask about an element with no neutrons in its nucleus, it does ask about what determines the identity of an atom, which is related to the concept of atomic structure and the presence of protons, neutrons, and electrons. However, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about elements with no neutrons or specific atomic structures. Since this is not available, Question 3 is the closest match based on the general topic of atomic structure and identity.

However, if we were to create a new question based on the information in the transcript that is similar to the ground truth MCQ, it would be something like:

Question: What is an example of an element that can have no neutrons in its nucleus?
Options: A. Hydrogen, B. Helium, C. Gold, D. Carbon

This new question is more similar to the ground truth MCQ than any of the generated MCQs.

But based on the provided options, I would choose Question 3 as the closest match.

will approach zero, it'll never actually hit zero. So, in every atom, there is some small,
but non-zero, probability that for a very, very
short period of time, one of its electrons is at the other end of the known universe. But mostly electrons stay
close to their nucleus as clouds of negative charged density that shift and move with time. How electrons from one atom interact with electrons from another determines almost everything. Atoms can give up their electrons, surrendering them to other atoms, or they can share electrons. And the dynamics of this social network are what make chemistry interesting. From plain old rocks to the beautiful complexity of life, the nature of everything we see, hear, smell, taste, touch, and even feel is determined at the atomic level.

**Transcript**:
You probably know that all stuff
is made up of atoms and that an atom is a really, really, really,
really tiny particle. Every atom has a core, which is made up of at least one positively charged particle called a proton, and in most cases, some number of neutral
particles called neutrons. That core is surrounded by negatively charged
particles called electrons. The identity of an atom is determined only by the number
of protons in its nucleus. Hydrogen is hydrogen because it
has just one proton, carbon is carbon because it has six, gold is gold because it has 79, and so on. Indulge me in a momentary tangent. How do we know about atomic structure? We can't see protons,
neutrons, or electrons. So, we do a bunch of experiments and develop a model
for what we think is there. Then we do some more experiments and see if they agree with the model. If they do, great. If they don't, it might
be time for a new model. We've had lots of very
different models for atoms since Democritus in 400 BC, and there will almost certainly be many more to come. Okay, tangent over. The cores of atoms tend to stick together, but electrons are free to move, and this is why chemists love electrons. If we could marry them, we probably would. But electrons are weird. They appear to behave either as particles, like little baseballs, or as waves, like water waves, depending on the experiment
that we perform. One of the weirdest things about electrons is that we can't exactly
say where they are. It's not that we don't have the equipment, it's that this uncertainty is part of our model of the electron. So, we can't pinpoint them, fine. But we can say
there's a certain probability of finding an electron in a given space around the nucleus. And that means that we can
ask the following question: If we drew a shape around the nucleus such that we would be 95% sure of finding a given electron
within that shape, what would it look like? Here are a few of these shapes. Chemists call them orbitals, and what each one looks like depends on, among other things, how much energy it has. The more energy an orbital has, the farther most of its density is from the nucleus. By they way, why did we pick 95% and not 100%? Well, that's another quirk of our model of the electron.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the content of the transcript, the closest match would be a question that asks about the behavior of electrons.

A potential generated MCQ could be: 
Question: Electrons behave as _______ depending on the experiment that is performed.
Options: A. Only particles, B. Only waves, C. Either particles or waves, D. Neither particles nor waves

However, since this question is not among the generated MCQs, the closest match in terms of content would be:

Question 6: As an electron moves away from the nucleus, what happens to the probability of finding it?

But this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of intent.

If I had to choose from the provided generated MCQs, I would say that none of them match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to pick one based on the topic of electrons, I would say:

 Question 5: What are the shapes chemists call that describe the probability of finding an electron in a given space around the nucleus?

But this is still not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate a new set of MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ. 

However, I will provide the index of the least dissimilar generated MCQ, which is:

 Question 8 or Question 9 or Question 5 (but with a low confidence)

Please note that this is not a good match and a new set of generated MCQs would be needed to find a better match.

After re-reading the transcript, I found a sentence that could be used to create a MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ:

"They appear to behave either as particles, like little baseballs, or as waves, like water waves, depending on the experiment that we perform."

Using this sentence, a new generated MCQ could be created that matches the ground truth MCQ.

Since this new MCQ is not among the provided generated MCQs, I will not provide an index.

**Transcript**:
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation sharing some of the problems and Warren Buffett had recommended I do that being honest about what was going well what wasn't and making it kind of an annual thing a goal I had There was to draw more people in to work on those problems because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally that is the market does not drive the scientists the communicators the thinkers the government's to do the right things and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw their people in can we make as much progress as we need to so this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand but before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist any top problem I think it it can be solved and part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past over the last century average lifespan has more than doubled another statistic perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths as recently as nineteen sixty 110 million children were born and 20 million of those died before the age of five five years ago a hundred and thirty five million children were born so more and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five so that's a factor of two reduction in the child to death rate it's a phenomenal things I mean each one of those lives matters a lot and the key reason we were able to do it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs vaccines that were used more widely for example measles was 4 million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000 so we really can make changes the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 mm in half again and I think that's doable in well under 20 years why well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths diarrhea pneumonia and malaria and so that brings us to the the first problem that all all raised this morning which is how do we stop a disease a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitoes what's the history of this disease it's been a severe disease for thousands of years in fact we look at the genetic code it's the only disease we can see the people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths that's actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s so it was absolutely gigantic and the disease was all over the world terrible disease it was in the United States it was in Europe people didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitoes so it was everywhere and two tools helped bring the death breakdown one was killing the mosquitoes with DDT and the other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivatives and so that's why the death rate did come down now ironically what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones which is where all the rich countries are so we can see 1900s everywhere 1945 still most places 1970 the US and most of Europe have gotten rid of it 1990 you've gotten more Stu northern areas and then more recently you can see it's just around the equator and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poor countries it doesn't get much investment for example there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria now baldness is it's terrible and rich men are afflicted and so that's why that priority has been set but malaria they even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because there's just it holds things back so much now malaria of course transmitted by mosquitoes I brought some here so you could experience this we'll let let those roam around the auditorium a little bit there there's no reason only poor people should have have the experience not those mosquitoes are not not infected but so we've come up with a few new things we've got bed nets and bed nets are a great tool what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night and so the mosquitoes that bite late at night I can't get at them and when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50% and that's happened now in a number of countries it's great to see but we have to be careful because malaria the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves so every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective and so you end up with two choices if you go into a country with the right tools in the right way and you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication and that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking or if you go in kind of half-heartedly for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again and the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention now we're on the upswing bed net funding is up there's new drug discovery going on our foundation is back to vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months and that should save over two-thirds of lives if it's effective and so we're going to have these new tools but that alone doesn't give us the roadmap because the roadmap to get rid of this disease involves many things it involves communicators to keep the funding high to keep the visibility high to tell the success stories it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just 70% of people to use the bed nets but 90% we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to monte-carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise we need rich world governments to be very generous in in providing aid for these things and so as these elements come together I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria well now let me turn to a second question a fairly different question but I'd say equally important and this is how do you make a teacher great now seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on and that we'd understand very well and the answer is really that we don't let's start with why this is important well all of us here all bat had some great teachers we all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today part of the reason we're successful I can say that even though I'm a college dropout I had great teachers and in fact in the United States the teaching system has worked fairly well there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places so the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education and those top 20 percent have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top twenty percent and they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u.s. at the forefront now the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting not only is that been weak it's getting weaker and if you look at the economy it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education and so we have to change this we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays in the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education like Science and Mathematics when I first learned the statistics I was pretty how bad things are over 30% of kids never finish high school and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate is the number who started in senior year and and then compared it to the number of the finished senior year because they were tracking where the kids were before that but most of the dropouts had taken place before that so they had to raise the state of dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over 30 percent for minority kids it's over 50 percent and even if you graduate from high school if you're low income you have less than a 25% chance of ever completing a college degree if you're low income in the United States you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree and that you know doesn't seem entirely fair so how do you make education better our foundation for the last nine years is invested in this there's many people working on it we've worked on small schools we funded scholarships we've done things in libraries a lot of these things had a good effect but the more we looked at it the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing and so we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between say the top quartile the very best and the bottom quartile how much variation is there within a school or between schools and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable a top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over 10% in a single year what does that mean well that means that the entire us for two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between US and Asia would go away and within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away so it's simple all you need is those top quartile teachers and so you'd say well wow that's good we should reward those people we should retain those people we should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people but I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today what are the characteristics of this top quartile what do they they look like you might think well these must be very senior teachers and the answer is no once somebody is taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter the variation is very very small you might think well these are people with master's degrees they've gone back and they've gotten their masters education this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality that bottom thing which says there's no effect at all is a master's degree now the way the P system works is there's two things are rewarded one is seniority because your pay goes up and you vest in your pension and the second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree but in no ways associated with being a better teacher Teach for America slight effect for math teachers majoring in math is a measurable effect but overwhelmingly it's your past performance there are some people who are very good at this and we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in to to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system you might say we'll do the good teachers stay in the bad teachers leave the answer is on average the slightly better teachers leave the system and it's a system with very high turnover now there are a few places very few where great teachers are being made a good example of one is a set of charter schools called Kip Kip means knowledge is power it's an unbelievable thing they have 66 schools mostly middle schools seven high schools and what goes on is great teaching they take the poorest kids and over 96% of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public school they're team-teaching they're constantly improving their teachers they're taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher hey you caused this amount of increase and so they're deeply engaged in making teaching better when you actually go in and sit in one of these classrooms at first it's very bizarre i sat down and I thought what is going on the teacher was running around and the entered light energy levels high I thought well I'm in the prep the the sports rally or something what's going on and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention which kids were bored and calling on kids rapidly putting things up on the board it was a very dynamic environment because particularly in those middle school years two through eighth grade keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets make fun of it or have the position of you know the kid who who doesn't want to be there everybody needs to be involved and so Kipp is doing it how does that compare to a normal school within a normal school teachers aren't told how good they are the data isn't gathered in the teachers contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom sometimes two once per year and they need advance notice to do that so imagine running a factory we've got these workers some of them just making crap and the management is told hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually do fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment even a teacher wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it they don't have the test scores and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data for example New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure to say for the teachers and so that's sort of working in the opposite directions but I'm optimistic about this I think there's some clear things we can do first of all there's a lot more testing going on and that's given us the picture of where we are and that allows us to understand who's doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques are of course digital video is cheap now putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are are being recorded on an ongoing basis it is very practical in all public schools and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say okay here's a little clip of something I thought I did well here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly advise me when this kid acted up how should I have dealt with that and they can all sit and work together on those problems you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best teaching the stuff you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course learn from that if you have a kid who's behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept and in fact these three courses could not only be available just on the internet but you could make it so that DVDs were always available and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers and so by thinking of this is a a personnel system we can do it much better there's a book actually about hip the place that this is going on the Jay Matthews a news reporter wrote called work hard be nice and I thought it was so fantastic give you a sense of what a good teacher does I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book now we put a lot of money into education and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a futurist should have fact we have in the stimulus bill it's interesting the House version actually had money in it for these data systems and was taken out in the Senate because they're there people are threatened by these things but I am optimistic I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it right well I only had time to pray those two problems there's a lot more problems like that aids pneumonia and just see you're getting excited just at the very name of these things and the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad you know the system doesn't naturally make it happen governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way the private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things so it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things get other people involved and you're helping to come up with solutions and with that I think there's some great things will come out of it thank you you

**Transcript**:
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation sharing some of the problems and Warren Buffett had recommended I do that being honest about what was going well what wasn't and making it kind of an annual thing a goal I had There was to draw more people in to work on those problems because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally that is the market does not drive the scientists the communicators the thinkers the government's to do the right things and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw their people in can we make as much progress as we need to so this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand but before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist any top problem I think it it can be solved and part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past over the last century average lifespan has more than doubled another statistic perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths as recently as nineteen sixty 110 million children were born and 20 million of those died before the age of five five years ago a hundred and thirty five million children were born so more and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five so that's a factor of two reduction in the child to death rate it's a phenomenal things I mean each one of those lives matters a lot and the key reason we were able to do it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs vaccines that were used more widely for example measles was 4 million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000 so we really can make changes the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 mm in half again and I think that's doable in well under 20 years why well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths diarrhea pneumonia and malaria and so that brings us to the the first problem that all all raised this morning which is how do we stop a disease a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitoes what's the history of this disease it's been a severe disease for thousands of years in fact we look at the genetic code it's the only disease we can see the people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths that's actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s so it was absolutely gigantic and the disease was all over the world terrible disease it was in the United States it was in Europe people didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitoes so it was everywhere and two tools helped bring the death breakdown one was killing the mosquitoes with DDT and the other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivatives and so that's why the death rate did come down now ironically what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones which is where all the rich countries are so we can see 1900s everywhere 1945 still most places 1970 the US and most of Europe have gotten rid of it 1990 you've gotten more Stu northern areas and then more recently you can see it's just around the equator and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poor countries it doesn't get much investment for example there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria now baldness is it's terrible and rich men are afflicted and so that's why that priority has been set but malaria they even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because there's just it holds things back so much now malaria of course transmitted by mosquitoes I brought some here so you could experience this we'll let let those roam around the auditorium a little bit there there's no reason only poor people should have have the experience not those mosquitoes are not not infected but so we've come up with a few new things we've got bed nets and bed nets are a great tool what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night and so the mosquitoes that bite late at night I can't get at them and when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50% and that's happened now in a number of countries it's great to see but we have to be careful because malaria the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves so every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective and so you end up with two choices if you go into a country with the right tools in the right way and you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication and that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking or if you go in kind of half-heartedly for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again and the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention now we're on the upswing bed net funding is up there's new drug discovery going on our foundation is back to vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months and that should save over two-thirds of lives if it's effective and so we're going to have these new tools but that alone doesn't give us the roadmap because the roadmap to get rid of this disease involves many things it involves communicators to keep the funding high to keep the visibility high to tell the success stories it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just 70% of people to use the bed nets but 90% we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to monte-carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise we need rich world governments to be very generous in in providing aid for these things and so as these elements come together I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria well now let me turn to a second question a fairly different question but I'd say equally important and this is how do you make a teacher great now seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on and that we'd understand very well and the answer is really that we don't let's start with why this is important well all of us here all bat had some great teachers we all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today part of the reason we're successful I can say that even though I'm a college dropout I had great teachers and in fact in the United States the teaching system has worked fairly well there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places so the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education and those top 20 percent have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top twenty percent and they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u.s. at the forefront now the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting not only is that been weak it's getting weaker and if you look at the economy it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education and so we have to change this we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays in the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education like Science and Mathematics when I first learned the statistics I was pretty how bad things are over 30% of kids never finish high school and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate is the number who started in senior year and and then compared it to the number of the

**Transcript**:
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation sharing some of the problems and Warren Buffett had recommended I do that being honest about what was going well what wasn't and making it kind of an annual thing a goal I had There was to draw more people in to work on those problems because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally that is the market does not drive the scientists the communicators the thinkers the government's to do the right things and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw their people in can we make as much progress as we need to so this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand but before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist any top problem I think it it can be solved and part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past over the last century average lifespan has more than doubled another statistic perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths as recently as nineteen sixty 110 million children were born and 20 million of those died before the age of five five years ago a hundred and thirty five million children were born so more and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five so that's a factor of two reduction in the child to death rate it's a phenomenal things I mean each one of those lives matters a lot and the key reason we were able to do it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs vaccines that were used more widely for example measles was 4 million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000 so we really can make changes the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 mm in half again and I think that's doable in well under 20 years why well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths diarrhea pneumonia and malaria and so that brings us to the the first problem that all all raised this morning which is how do we stop a disease a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitoes what's the history of this disease it's been a severe disease for thousands of years in fact we look at the genetic code it's the only disease we can see the people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths that's actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s so it was absolutely gigantic and the disease was all over the world terrible disease it was in the United States it was in Europe people didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitoes so it was everywhere and two tools helped bring the death breakdown one was killing the mosquitoes with DDT and the other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivatives and so that's why the death rate did come down now ironically what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones which is where all the rich countries are so we can see 1900s everywhere 1945 still most places 1970 the US and most of Europe have gotten rid of it 1990 you've gotten more Stu northern areas and then more recently you can see it's just around the equator and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poor countries it doesn't get much investment for example there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria now baldness is it's terrible and rich men are afflicted and so that's why that priority has been set but malaria they even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because there's just it holds things back so much now malaria of course transmitted by mosquitoes I brought some here so you could experience this we'll let let those roam around the auditorium a little bit there there's no reason only poor people should have have the experience not those mosquitoes are not not infected but so we've come up with a few new things we've got bed nets and bed nets are a great tool what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night and so the mosquitoes that bite late at night I can't get at them and when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50% and that's happened now in a number of countries it's great to see but we have to be careful because malaria the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves so every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective and so you end up with two choices if you go into a country with the right tools in the right way and you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication and that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking or if you go in kind of half-heartedly for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again and the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention now we're on the upswing bed net funding is up there's new drug discovery going on our foundation is back to vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months and that should save over two-thirds of lives if it's effective and so we're going to have these new tools but that alone doesn't give us the roadmap because the roadmap to get rid of this disease involves many things it involves communicators to keep the funding high to keep the visibility high to tell the success stories it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just 70% of people to use the bed nets but 90% we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to monte-carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise we need rich world governments to be very generous in in providing aid for these things and so as these elements come together I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria well now let me turn to a second question a fairly different question but I'd say equally important and this is how do you make a teacher great now seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on and that we'd understand very well and the answer is really that we don't let's start with why this is important well all of us here all bat had some great teachers we all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today part of the reason we're successful I can say that even though I'm a college dropout I had great teachers and in fact in the United States the teaching system has worked fairly well there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places so the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education and those top 20 percent have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top twenty percent and they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u.s. at the forefront now the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting not only is that been weak it's getting weaker and if you look at the economy it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education and so we have to change this we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays in the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education like Science and Mathematics when I first learned the statistics I was pretty how bad things are over 30% of kids never finish high school and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate is the number who started in senior year and and then compared it to the number of the finished senior year because they were tracking where the kids were before that but most of the dropouts had taken place before that so they had to raise the state of dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over 30 percent for minority kids it's over 50 percent and even if you graduate from high school if you're low income you have less than a 25% chance of ever completing a college degree if you're low income in the United States you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree and that you know doesn't seem entirely fair so how do you make education better our foundation for the last nine years is invested in this there's many people working on it we've worked on small schools we funded scholarships we've done things in libraries a lot of these things had a good effect but the more we looked at it the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing and so we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between say the top quartile the very best and the bottom quartile how much variation is there within a school or between schools and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable a top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over 10% in a single year what does that mean well that means that the entire us for two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between US and Asia would go away and within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away so it's simple all you need is those top quartile teachers and so you'd say well wow that's good we should reward those people we should retain those people we should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people but I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today what are the characteristics of this top quartile what do they they look like you might think well these must be very senior teachers and the answer is no once somebody is taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter the variation is very very small you might think well these are people with master's degrees they've gone back and they've gotten their masters education this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality that bottom thing which says there's no effect at all is a master's degree now the way the P system works is there's two things are rewarded one is seniority because your pay goes up and you vest in your pension and the second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree but in no ways associated with being a better teacher Teach for America slight effect for math teachers majoring in math is a measurable effect but overwhelmingly it's your past performance there are some people who are very good at this and we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in to to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system you might say we'll do the good teachers stay in the bad teachers leave the answer is on average the slightly better teachers leave the system and it's a system with very high turnover now there are a few places very few where great teachers are being made a good example of one is a set of charter schools called Kip Kip means knowledge is power it's an unbelievable thing they have 66 schools mostly middle schools seven high schools and what goes on is great teaching they take the poorest kids and over 96% of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public school they're team-teaching they're constantly improving their teachers they're taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher hey you caused this amount of increase and so they're deeply engaged in making teaching better when you actually go in and sit in one of these classrooms at first it's very bizarre i sat down and I thought what is going on the teacher was running around and the entered light energy levels high I thought well I'm in the prep the the sports rally or something what's going on and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention which kids were bored and calling on kids rapidly putting things up on the board it was a very dynamic environment because particularly in those middle school years two through eighth grade keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets make fun of it or have the position of you know the kid who who doesn't want to be there everybody needs to be involved and so Kipp is doing it how does that compare to a normal school within a normal school teachers aren't told how good they are the data isn't gathered in the teachers contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom sometimes two once per year and they need advance notice to do that so imagine running a factory we've got these workers some of them just making crap and the management is told hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually do fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment even a teacher wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it they don't have the test scores and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data for example New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure to say for the teachers and so that's sort of working in the opposite directions but I'm optimistic about this I think there's some clear things we can do first of all there's a lot more testing going on and that's given us the picture of where we are and that allows us to understand who's doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques are of course digital video is cheap now putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are are being recorded on an ongoing basis it is very practical in all public schools and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say okay here's a little clip of something I thought I did well here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly advise me when this kid acted up how should I have dealt with that and they can all sit and work together on those problems you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best teaching the stuff you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course learn from that if you have a kid who's behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept and in fact these three courses could not only be available just on the internet but you could make it so that DVDs were always available and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers and so by thinking of this is a a personnel system we can do it much better there's a book actually about hip the place that this is going on the Jay Matthews a news reporter wrote called work hard be nice and I thought it was so fantastic give you a sense of what a good teacher does I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book now we put a lot of money into education and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a futurist should have fact we have in the stimulus bill it's interesting the House version actually had money in it for these data systems and was taken out in the Senate because they're there people are threatened by these things but I am optimistic I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it right well I only had time to pray those two problems there's a lot more problems like that aids pneumonia and just see you're getting excited just at the very name of these things and the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad you know the system doesn't naturally make it happen governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way the private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things so it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things get other people involved and you're helping to come up with solutions and with that I think there's some great things will come out of it thank you you

is there between teachers between say the top quartile the very best and the bottom quartile how much variation is there within a school or between schools and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable a top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over 10% in a single year what does that mean well that means that the entire us for two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between US and Asia would go away and within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away so it's simple all you need is those top quartile teachers and so you'd say well wow that's good we should reward those people we should retain those people we should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people but I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today what are the characteristics of this top quartile what do they they look like you might think well these must be very senior teachers and the answer is no once somebody is taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter the variation is very very small you might think well these are people with master's degrees they've gone back and they've gotten their masters education this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality that bottom thing which says there's no effect at all is a master's degree now the way the P system works is there's two things are rewarded one is seniority because your pay goes up and you vest in your pension and the second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree but in no ways associated with being a better teacher Teach for America slight effect for math teachers majoring in math is a measurable effect but overwhelmingly it's your past performance there are some people who are very good at this and we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in to to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system you might say we'll do the good teachers stay in the bad teachers leave the answer is on average the slightly better teachers leave the system and it's a system with very high turnover now there are a few places very few where great teachers are being made a good example of one is a set of charter schools called Kip Kip means knowledge is power it's an unbelievable thing they have 66 schools mostly middle schools seven high schools and what goes on is great teaching they take the poorest kids and over 96% of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public school they're team-teaching they're constantly improving their teachers they're taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher hey you caused this amount of increase and so they're deeply engaged in making teaching better when you actually go in and sit in one of these classrooms at first it's very bizarre i sat down and I thought what is going on the teacher was running around and the entered light energy levels high I thought well I'm in the prep the the sports rally or something what's going on and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention which kids were bored and calling on kids rapidly putting things up on the board it was a very dynamic environment because particularly in those middle school years two through eighth grade keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets make fun of it or have the position of you know the kid who who doesn't want to be there everybody needs to be involved and so Kipp is doing it how does that compare to a normal school within a normal school teachers aren't told how good they are the data isn't gathered in the teachers contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom sometimes two once per year and they need advance notice to do that so imagine running a factory we've got these workers some of them just making crap and the management is told hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually do fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment even a teacher wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it they don't have the test scores and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data for example New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure to say for the teachers and so that's sort of working in the opposite directions but I'm optimistic about this I think there's some clear things we can do first of all there's a lot more testing going on and that's given us the picture of where we are and that allows us to understand who's doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques are of course digital video is cheap now putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are are being recorded on an ongoing basis it is very practical in all public schools and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say okay here's a little clip of something I thought I did well here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly advise me when this kid acted up how should I have dealt with that and they can all sit and work together on those problems you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best teaching the stuff you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course learn from that if you have a kid who's behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept and in fact these three courses could not only be available just on the internet but you could make it so that DVDs were always available and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers and so by thinking of this is a a personnel system we can do it much better there's a book actually about hip the place that this is going on the Jay Matthews a news reporter wrote called work hard be nice and I thought it was so fantastic give you a sense of what a good teacher does I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book now we put a lot of money into education and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a futurist should have fact we have in the stimulus bill it's interesting the House version actually had money in it for these data systems and was taken out in the Senate because they're there people are threatened by these things but I am optimistic I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it right well I only had time to pray those two problems there's a lot more problems like that aids pneumonia and just see you're getting excited just at the very name of these things and the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad you know the system doesn't naturally make it happen governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way the private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things so it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things get other people involved and you're helping to come up with solutions and with that I think there's some great things will come out of it thank you you

**Transcript**:
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation sharing some of the problems and Warren Buffett had recommended I do that being honest about what was going well what wasn't and making it kind of an annual thing a goal I had There was to draw more people in to work on those problems because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally that is the market does not drive the scientists the communicators the thinkers the government's to do the right things and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw their people in can we make as much progress as we need to so this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand but before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist any top problem I think it it can be solved and part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past over the last century average lifespan has more than doubled another statistic perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths as recently as nineteen sixty 110 million children were born and 20 million of those died before the age of five five years ago a hundred and thirty five million children were born so more and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five so that's a factor of two reduction in the child to death rate it's a phenomenal things I mean each one of those lives matters a lot and the key reason we were able to do it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs vaccines that were used more widely for example measles was 4 million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000 so we really can make changes the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 mm in half again and I think that's doable in well under 20 years why well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths diarrhea pneumonia and malaria and so that brings us to the the first problem that all all raised this morning which is how do we stop a disease a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitoes what's the history of this disease it's been a severe disease for thousands of years in fact we look at the genetic code it's the only disease we can see the people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths that's actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s so it was absolutely gigantic and the disease was all over the world terrible disease it was in the United States it was in Europe people didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitoes so it was everywhere and two tools helped bring the death breakdown one was killing the mosquitoes with DDT and the other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivatives and so that's why the death rate did come down now ironically what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones which is where all the rich countries are so we can see 1900s everywhere 1945 still most places 1970 the US and most of Europe have gotten rid of it 1990 you've gotten more Stu northern areas and then more recently you can see it's just around the equator and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poor countries it doesn't get much investment for example there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria now baldness is it's terrible and rich men are afflicted and so that's why that priority has been set but malaria they even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because there's just it holds things back so much now malaria of course transmitted by mosquitoes I brought some here so you could experience this we'll let let those roam around the auditorium a little bit there there's no reason only poor people should have have the experience not those mosquitoes are not not infected but so we've come up with a few new things we've got bed nets and bed nets are a great tool what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night and so the mosquitoes that bite late at night I can't get at them and when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50% and that's happened now in a number of countries it's great to see but we have to be careful because malaria the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves so every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective and so you end up with two choices if you go into a country with the right tools in the right way and you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication and that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking or if you go in kind of half-heartedly for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again and the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention now we're on the upswing bed net funding is up there's new drug discovery going on our foundation is back to vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months and that should save over two-thirds of lives if it's effective and so we're going to have these new tools but that alone doesn't give us the roadmap because the roadmap to get rid of this disease involves many things it involves communicators to keep the funding high to keep the visibility high to tell the success stories it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just 70% of people to use the bed nets but 90% we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to monte-carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise we need rich world governments to be very generous in in providing aid for these things and so as these elements come together I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria well now let me turn to a second question a fairly different question but I'd say equally important and this is how do you make a teacher great now seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on and that we'd understand very well and the answer is really that we don't let's start with why this is important well all of us here all bat had some great teachers we all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today part of the reason we're successful I can say that even though I'm a college dropout I had great teachers and in fact in the United States the teaching system has worked fairly well there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places so the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education and those top 20 percent have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top twenty percent and they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u.s. at the forefront now the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting not only is that been weak it's getting weaker and if you look at the economy it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education and so we have to change this we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays in the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education like Science and Mathematics when I first learned the statistics I was pretty how bad things are over 30% of kids never finish high school and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate is the number who started in senior year and and then compared it to the number of the finished senior year because they were tracking where the kids were before that but most of the dropouts had taken place before that so they had to raise the state of dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over 30 percent for minority kids it's over 50 percent and even if you graduate from high school if you're low income you have less than a 25% chance of ever completing a college degree if you're low income in the United States you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree and that you know doesn't seem entirely fair so how do you make education better our foundation for the last nine years is invested in this there's many people working on it we've worked on small schools we funded scholarships we've done things in libraries a lot of these things had a good effect but the more we looked at it the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing and so we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between say the top quartile the very best and the bottom quartile how much variation is there within a school or between schools and the answer is that these variations are

two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between US and Asia would go away and within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away so it's simple all you need is those top quartile teachers and so you'd say well wow that's good we should reward those people we should retain those people we should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people

money to people who get their master's degree but in no ways associated with being a better teacher Teach for America slight effect for math teachers majoring in math is a measurable effect but

**Transcript**:
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation sharing some of the problems and Warren Buffett had recommended I do that being honest about what was going well what wasn't and making it kind of an annual thing a goal I had There was to draw more people in to work on those problems because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally that is the market does not drive the scientists the communicators the thinkers the government's to do the right things and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw their people in can we make as much progress as we need to so this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand but before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist any top problem I think it it can be solved and part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past over the last century average lifespan has more than doubled another statistic perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths as recently as nineteen sixty 110 million children were born and 20 million of those died before the age of five five years ago a hundred and thirty five million children were born so more and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five so that's a factor of two reduction in the child to death rate it's a phenomenal things I mean each one of those lives matters a lot and the key reason we were able to do it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs vaccines that were used more widely for example measles was 4 million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000 so we really can make changes the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 mm in half again and I think that's doable in well under 20 years why well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths diarrhea pneumonia and malaria and so that brings us to the the first problem that all all raised this morning which is how do we stop a disease a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitoes what's the history of this disease it's been a severe disease for thousands of years in fact we look at the genetic code it's the only disease we can see the people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths that's actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s so it was absolutely gigantic and the disease was all over the world terrible disease it was in the United States it was in Europe people didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitoes so it was everywhere and two tools helped bring the death breakdown one was killing the mosquitoes with DDT and the other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivatives and so that's why the death rate did come down now ironically what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones which is where all the rich countries are so we can see 1900s everywhere 1945 still most places 1970 the US and most of Europe have gotten rid of it 1990 you've gotten more Stu northern areas and then more recently you can see it's just around the equator and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poor countries it doesn't get much investment for example there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria now baldness is it's terrible and rich men are afflicted and so that's why that priority has been set but malaria they even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because there's just it holds things back so much now malaria of course transmitted by mosquitoes I brought some here so you could experience this we'll let let those roam around the auditorium a little bit there there's no reason only poor people should have have the experience not those mosquitoes are not not infected but so we've come up with a few new things we've got bed nets and bed nets are a great tool what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night and so the mosquitoes that bite late at night I can't get at them and when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50% and that's happened now in a number of countries it's great to see but we have to be careful because malaria the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves so every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective and so you end up with two choices if you go into a country with the right tools in the right way and you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication and that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking or if you go in kind of half-heartedly for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again and the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention now we're on the upswing bed net funding is up there's new drug discovery going on our foundation is back to vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months and that should save over two-thirds of lives if it's effective and so we're going to have these new tools but that alone doesn't give us the roadmap because the roadmap to get rid of this disease involves many things it involves communicators to keep the funding high to keep the visibility high to tell the success stories it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just 70% of people to use the bed nets but 90% we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to monte-carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise we need rich world governments to be very generous in in providing aid for these things and so as these elements come together I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria well now let me turn to a second question a fairly different question but I'd say equally important and this is how do you make a teacher great now seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on and that we'd understand very well and the answer is really that we don't let's start with why this is important well all of us here all bat had some great teachers we all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today part of the reason we're successful I can say that even though I'm a college dropout I had great teachers and in fact in the United States the teaching system has worked fairly well there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places so the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education and those top 20 percent have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top twenty percent and they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u.s. at the forefront now the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting not only is that been weak it's getting weaker and if you look at the economy it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education and so we have to change this we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays in the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education like Science and Mathematics when I first learned the statistics I was pretty how bad things are over 30% of kids never finish high school and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate is the number who started in senior year and and then compared it to the number of the finished senior year because they were tracking where the kids were before that but most of the dropouts had taken place before that so they had to raise the state of dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over 30 percent for minority kids it's over 50 percent and even if you graduate from high school if you're low income you have less than a 25% chance of ever completing a college degree if you're low income in the United States you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree and that you know doesn't seem entirely fair so how do you make education better our foundation for the last nine years is invested in this there's many people working on it we've worked on small schools we funded scholarships we've done things in libraries a lot of these things had a good effect but the more we looked at it the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing and so we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between say the top quartile the very best and the bottom quartile how much variation is there within a school or between schools and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable a top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over 10% in a single year what does that mean well that means that the entire us for two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between US and Asia would go away and within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away so it's simple all you need is those top quartile teachers and so you'd say well wow that's good we should reward those people we should retain those people we should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people but I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today what are the characteristics of this top quartile what do they they look like you might think well these must be very senior teachers and the answer is no once somebody is taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter the variation is very very small you might think well these are people with master's degrees they've gone back and they've gotten their masters education this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality that bottom thing which says there's no effect at all is a master's degree now the way the P system works is there's two things are rewarded one is seniority because your pay goes up and you vest in your pension and the second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree but in no ways associated with being a better teacher Teach for America slight effect for math teachers majoring in math is a measurable effect but overwhelmingly it's your past performance there are some people who are very good at this and we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in to to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system you might say we'll do the good teachers stay in the bad teachers leave the answer is on average the slightly better teachers leave the system and it's a system with very high turnover now there are a few places very few where great teachers are being made a good example of one is a set of charter schools called Kip Kip means knowledge is power it's an unbelievable thing they have 66 schools mostly middle schools seven high schools and what goes on is great teaching they take the poorest kids and over 96% of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public school they're team-teaching they're constantly improving their teachers they're taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher hey you caused this amount of increase and so they're deeply engaged in making teaching better when you actually go in and sit in one of these classrooms at first it's very bizarre i sat down and I thought what is going on the teacher was running around and the entered light energy levels high I thought well I'm in the prep the the sports rally or something what's going on and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention which kids were bored and calling on kids rapidly putting things up on the board it was a very dynamic environment because particularly in those middle school years two through eighth grade keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets make fun of it or have the position of you know the kid who who doesn't want to be there everybody needs to be involved and so Kipp is doing it how does that compare to a normal school within a normal school teachers aren't told how good they are the data isn't gathered in the teachers contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom sometimes two once per year and they need advance notice to do that so imagine running a factory we've got these workers some of them just making crap and the management is told hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually do fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment even a teacher wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it they don't have the test scores and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data for example New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure to say for the teachers and so that's sort of working in the opposite directions but I'm optimistic about this I think there's some clear things we can do first of all there's a lot more testing going on and that's given us the picture of where we are and that allows us to understand who's doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques are of course digital video is cheap now putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are are being recorded on an ongoing basis it is very practical in all public schools and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say okay here's a little clip of something I thought I did well here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly advise me when this kid acted up how should I have dealt with that and they can all sit and work together on those problems you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best teaching the stuff you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course learn from that if you have a kid who's behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept and in fact these three courses could not only be available just on the internet but you could make it so that DVDs were always available and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers and so by thinking of this is a a personnel system we can do it much better there's a book actually about hip the place that this is going on the Jay Matthews a news reporter wrote called work hard be nice and I thought it was so fantastic give you a sense of what a good teacher does I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book now we put a lot of money into education and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a futurist should have fact we have in the stimulus bill it's interesting the House version actually had money in it for these data systems and was taken out in the Senate because they're there people are threatened by these things but I am optimistic I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it right well I only had time to pray those two problems there's a lot more problems like that aids pneumonia and just see you're getting excited just at the very name of these things and the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad you know the system doesn't naturally make it happen governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way the private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things so it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things get other people involved and you're helping to come up with solutions and with that I think there's some great things will come out of it thank you you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar.

The ground truth MCQ is about the number of animals raised every year in factory farm conditions for consumption. The closest generated MCQ is not directly related to this topic, but Question 5 mentions the environmental damage and health impact of certain types of meat.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of animal consumption, I would suggest Question 11, which talks about the Weekday Veg diet plan and its rules for consuming meat.

But since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide an answer based on the closest possible match in terms of topic and intent.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be: 
Question: We raise ________ animals every year in factory farm conditions for the purpose of consumption.
Options: A. 100 million, B. 1 billion, C. 10 billion, D. None of the above

However, since this MCQ is not present in the provided options, I will not provide an index.

If I had to choose an index from the provided options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 1: What was the speaker's initial concern about their diet? Options: A. The high cost of meat, B. The environmental impact of meat production, C. The risk of dying from eating a hamburger a day, D. The cruelty of factory farm conditions Correct Option: C

This question is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ because it addresses the same topic (the risk of dying from eating a hamburger a day) and has a similar question structure. However, the options in Question 1 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ.

A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that has the same question and options as the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, I noticed that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the emissions caused by factory farmed meat production, while the generated MCQs do not address this specific topic.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 5 is not the best match, but Question 7 and Question 10 mention environmental impact. However, the best match is not available.

But if we are looking for something that can be related to the environmental damage, I will choose Question 5, but I want to mention that is not the best match.

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that directly compares meat consumption between two time periods.

A more similar question is not present in the generated MCQs, but Question 8 and Question 2 contain information related to the speaker's past intentions and the reason they were not a vegetarian. 

However, one question contains a statement similar to the ground truth MCQ:

Question 8 does not match, but it contains the following statement: "the speaker also mentions that 'we as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s'".

Since there isn't a direct match, I will provide the index of the question that is most similar in intent, or contains the most similar information.

In this case, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ that has the closest information.

Why does salt dissolve in water but oil doesn't? Well, in a word, chemistry, but that's not very satisfying, is it? Well, the reason salt dissolves and oil does not comes down to the two big reasons why anything happens at all: energetics and entropy. Energetics deals primarily with the attractive forces between things. When we look at oil or salt in water, we focus on the forces between particles on a very, very, very small scale, the molecular level. To give you a sense of this scale, in one glass of water, there are more molecules than known stars in the universe. Now, all of these molecules are in constant motion, moving, vibrating, and rotating. What prevents almost all of those molecules from just flying out of the glass are the attractive interactions between molecules. The strength of the interactions between water, itself, and other substances is what we mean when we say energetics. You can think of the water molecules engaging in a constant dance, sort of like a square dance where they constantly and randomly exchange partners. Put simply, the ability for substances to interact with water, balanced with how they disrupt how water interacts with itself, plays an important role in explaining why certain things mix well into water and others don't. Entropy basically describes the way things and energy can be arranged based on random motion. For example, think of the air in a room. Imagine all the different possible arrangements in space for the trillions of particles that make up the air. Some of those arrangments might have all the oxygen molecules over here and all the nitrogen molecules over there, separated. But far more of the possible arrangements have those molecules mixed up with one another. So, entropy favors mixing. Energetics deals with attractive forces. And so, if attractive forces are present, the probability of some arrangements can be enhanced, the ones where things are attracted to each other. So, it is always the balance of these two things that determines what happens. On the molecular level, water is comprised of water molecules, made up of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom. As liquid water, these molecules are engaged in a constant and random square dance that is called the hydrogen bonding network. Entropy favors keeping the square dance going at all times. There are always more ways that all the water molecules can arrange in a square dance, as compared to if the water molecules did a line dance. So, the square dance constantly goes on. So, what happens when you put salt in the water? Well, on the molecular level, salt is actually made up of two different ions, chlorine and sodium, that are organized like a brick wall. They show up to the dance as a big group in formation and sit on the side at first, shy and a bit reluctant to break apart into individual ions to join the dance. But secretly, those shy dancers just want someone to ask them to join. So, when a water randomly bumps into one of them and pulls them into the dance away from their group, they go. And once they go into the dance, they don't come back out. And in fact, the addition of the salt ions adds more possible dance positions in the square dance, so it is favored for them to stay dancing with water. Now, let's take oil. With oil, the molecules are sort of interested in dancing with water, so entropy favors them joining the dance. The problem is that oil molecules are wearing gigantic ballgowns, and they're way bigger than water molecules. So, when an oil molecule gets pulled in, their size is really disruptive to the dance and the random exchange of partners that the waters engage in, a very important part of the dance. In addition, they are not great dancers. The water molecules try to engage the oil molecules in the dance, but they just keep bumping into their dresses and taking up all the room on the dance floor. There are way more ways the waters can dance when the oil gets off the floor, so the waters squeeze out the oil, pushing it back to the bench with the others. Pretty soon, when a large number of oils have been squeezed over to the side, they band together to commiserate about how unfair the waters are being and stick together as a group. So, it is this combination of the interactions between molecules and the configurations available to them when they're moving randomly that dictates whether they mix. In other words, water and oil don't mix because they just don't make great dance partners.

Why does salt dissolve in water but oil doesn't? Well, in a word, chemistry, but that's not very satisfying, is it? Well, the reason salt dissolves and oil does not comes down to the two big reasons why anything happens at all: energetics and entropy. Energetics deals primarily with the attractive forces between things. When we look at oil or salt in water, we focus on the forces between particles on a very, very, very small scale, the molecular level. To give you a sense of this scale, in one glass of water, there are more molecules than known stars in the universe. Now, all of these molecules are in constant motion, moving, vibrating, and rotating. What prevents almost all of those molecules from just flying out of the glass are the attractive interactions between molecules. The strength of the interactions between water, itself, and other substances is what we mean when we say energetics. You can think of the water molecules engaging in a constant dance, sort of like a square dance where they constantly and randomly exchange partners. Put simply, the ability for substances to interact with water, balanced with how they disrupt how water interacts with itself, plays an important role in explaining why certain things mix well into water and others don't. Entropy basically describes the way things and energy can be arranged based on random motion. For example, think of the air in a room. Imagine all the different possible arrangements in space for the trillions of particles that make up the air. Some of those arrangments might have all the oxygen molecules over here and all the nitrogen molecules over there, separated. But far more of the possible arrangements have those molecules mixed up with one another. So, entropy favors mixing. Energetics deals with attractive forces. And so, if attractive forces are present, the probability of some arrangements can be enhanced, the ones where things are attracted to each other. So, it is always the balance of these two things that determines what happens. On the molecular level, water is comprised of water molecules, made up of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom. As liquid water, these molecules are engaged in a constant and random square dance that is called the hydrogen bonding network. Entropy favors keeping the square dance going at all times. There are always more ways that all the water molecules can arrange in a square dance, as compared to if the water molecules did a line dance. So, the square dance constantly goes on. So, what happens when you put salt in the water? Well, on the molecular level, salt is actually made up of two different ions, chlorine and sodium, that are organized like a brick wall. They show up to the dance as a big group in formation and sit on the side at first, shy and a bit reluctant to break apart into individual ions to join the dance. But secretly, those shy dancers just want someone to ask them to join. So, when a water randomly bumps into one of them and pulls them into the dance away from their group, they go. And once they go into the dance, they don't come back out. And in fact, the addition of the salt ions adds more possible dance positions in the square dance, so it is favored for them to stay dancing with water. Now, let's take oil. With oil, the molecules are sort of interested in dancing with water, so entropy favors them joining the dance. The problem is that oil molecules are wearing gigantic ballgowns, and they're way bigger than water molecules. So, when an oil molecule gets pulled in, their size is really disruptive to the dance and the random exchange of partners that the waters engage in, a very important part of the dance. In addition, they are not great dancers. The water molecules try to engage the oil molecules in the dance, but they just keep bumping into their dresses and taking up all the room on the dance floor. There are way more ways the waters can dance when the oil gets off the floor, so the waters squeeze out the oil, pushing it back to the bench with the others. Pretty soon, when a large number of oils have been squeezed over to the side, they band together to commiserate about how unfair the waters are being and stick together as a group. So, it is this combination of the interactions between molecules and the configurations available to them when they're moving randomly that dictates whether they mix. In other words, water and oil don't mix because they just don't make great dance partners.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: When oil molecules are put into water, they _______.
Options: A. Are more attracted to themselves than the water so they show no interest in “dancing” with the water molecules, B. Are attracted to the water molecules but disrupt the hydrogen bonding network so are pushed out. This is analogous to the oil molecules being poor dancers and being kicked off the dance floor by the water molecules, C. Are attracted to the water molecules but are too small to enter the dance so stay on the side, D. Are really good at doing the “hydrogen bonding network dance”. So good in fact that they waters become jealous and kick them off the dance floor

**Transcript**:
Palms sweaty, heart racing, stomach in knots. You can't cry for help. Not only is your throat
too tight to breathe, but it'd be so embarrassing. No, you aren't being stalked by a monster, you're speaking in public, a fate some deem worse than death. See, when you're dead, you feel nothing; at a podium, you feel stage fright. But at some point
we've all had to communicate in front of people, so you have to try and overcome it. To start, understand what stage fright is. Humans, social animals that we are, are wired to worry about reputation. Public speaking can threaten it. Before a speech, you fret, "What if people think I'm
awful and I'm an idiot?" That fear of being seen as an awful idiot is a threat reaction from a primitive part of your brain that's very hard to control. It's the fight or flight response, a self-protective process
seen in a range of animals, most of which don't give speeches. But we have a wise partner in the study of freaking out. Charles Darwin tested fight or flight at the London Zoo snake exhibit. He wrote in his diary, "My will and reason were powerless
against the imagination of a danger which had never been experienced." He concluded that his response was an ancient reaction unaffected by the nuances of modern civilization. So, to your conscious modern mind, it's a speech. To the rest of your brain, built up to code
with the law of the jungle, when you perceive
the possible consequences of blowing a speech, it's time to run for your life or fight to the death. Your hypothalamus, common
to all vertebrates, triggers your pituitary gland to secrete the hormone ACTH, making your adrenal gland shoot adrenaline into your blood. Your neck and back tense up, you slouch. Your legs and hand shake as your muscles prepare for attack. You sweat. Your blood pressure jumps. Your digestion shuts down to maximize the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to muscles and vital organs, so you get dry mouth, butterflies. Your pupils dilate, it's hard to read anything up close, like your notes, but long range is easy. That's how stage fright works. How do we fight it? First, perspective. This isn't all in your head. It's a natural, hormonal,
full body reaction by an autonomic nervous

is natural and inevitable, focus on what you can control. Practice a lot, starting long before in an environment similar

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to astrobiology, while the ground truth MCQ is related to stage fright and the fight-or-flight response.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar in terms of format, but it's still not related to the content of the ground truth MCQ.

Index: 9 (Please note that this is a very weak match and not a good representation of the ground truth MCQ)

**Transcript**:
Palms sweaty, heart racing, stomach in knots. You can't cry for help. Not only is your throat
too tight to breathe, but it'd be so embarrassing. No, you aren't being stalked by a monster, you're speaking in public, a fate some deem worse than death. See, when you're dead, you feel nothing; at a podium, you feel stage fright. But at some point
we've all had to communicate in front of people, so you have to try and overcome it. To start, understand what stage fright is. Humans, social animals that we are, are wired to worry about reputation. Public speaking can threaten it. Before a speech, you fret, "What if people think I'm
awful and I'm an idiot?" That fear of being seen as an awful idiot is a threat reaction from a primitive part of your brain that's very hard to control. It's the fight or flight response, a self-protective process
seen in a range of animals, most of which don't give speeches. But we have a wise partner in the study of freaking out. Charles Darwin tested fight or flight at the London Zoo snake exhibit. He wrote in his diary, "My will and reason were powerless
against the imagination of a danger which had never been experienced." He concluded that his response was an ancient reaction unaffected by the nuances of modern civilization. So, to your conscious modern mind, it's a speech. To the rest of your brain, built up to code
with the law of the jungle, when you perceive
the possible consequences of blowing a speech, it's time to run for your life or fight to the death. Your hypothalamus, common
to all vertebrates, triggers your pituitary gland to secrete the hormone ACTH, making your adrenal gland shoot adrenaline into your blood. Your neck and back tense up, you slouch. Your legs and hand shake as your muscles prepare for attack. You sweat. Your blood pressure jumps. Your digestion shuts down to maximize the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to muscles and vital organs, so you get dry mouth, butterflies. Your pupils dilate, it's hard to read anything up close, like your notes, but long range is easy. That's how stage fright works. How do we fight it? First, perspective. This isn't all in your head. It's a natural, hormonal,
full body reaction by an autonomic nervous
system on autopilot. And genetics play a huge
role in social anxiety. John Lennon played live

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to astrobiology, while the ground truth MCQ is related to stage fright and public speaking.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that the generated MCQs are not relevant to the ground truth MCQ, and it's not possible to provide a meaningful index.

If you could provide more relevant generated MCQs, I would be happy to help you identify the most similar one.

**Transcript**:
We've all seen movies about terrible insects from outer space or stories of abduction by little green men, but the study of life in the universe, including the possibility of extraterrestrial life, is also a serious, scientific pursuit. Astrobiology draws on diverse fields, such as physics, biology, astronomy, and geology, to study how life was formed on Earth, how it could form elsewhere, and how we might detect it. Many ancient religions described other worlds inhabited by known human beings, but these are more like mythical realms or parallel universes than other planets existing in the same physical world. It is only within the last century that scientists have been able to seriously undertake the search for extraterrestrial life. We know that at the most basic level organisms on Earth need three things: liquid water, a source of energy, and organic, carbon-based material. We also know that the Earth is just the right distance from the Sun, so as not to be either frozen or molten. So, planets within such a habitable range from their own stars may be able to support life. But while we used to think that life could only exist in such Earth-like environments, one of the most amazing discoveries of astrobiology has been just how versatile life is. We now know that life can thrive in some of the most extreme environments that'd be fatal for most known organisms. Life is found everywhere, from black smoke of hydrothermal vents in the dark depths of Earth's oceans, to bubbling, hot, acidic springs on the flanks of volcanoes, to high up in the atmosphere. Organisms that live in these challenging environments are called extremophiles, and they can survive at extremes of temperature, pressure, and radiation, as well as salinity, acidity, and limited availability of sunlight, water, or oxygen. What is most remarkable about these extremophiles is that they are found thriving in environments that mimic those on alien worlds. One of the most important of these worlds is our red and dusty neighbor, Mars. Today, astrobiologists are exploring places where life might once have existed on Mars using NASA's Curiosity rover. One of these is Gale Crater, an impact crater created when a meteor hit the surface of Mars nearly 3.8 billions years ago. Evidence from orbit suggest past traces of water, which means the crater might once have supported life. Planets are not the only places astrobiologists are looking at. For example, Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter, and Enceladus and Titan, two of Saturn's moons, are all exciting possibilities. Although these moons are extremely cold and two are covered in thick ice, there is evidence of liquid oceans beneath the shell. Could life be floating around in these oceans, or could it be living around black smoker vents at the bottom? Titan is particularly promising as it has an atmosphere and Earth-like lakes, seas, and rivers flowing across the surface. It is very cold, however, too cold for liquid water, so these rivers may instead be flowing with liquid hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane. These are composed of hydrogen, and, more importantly, carbon, which is the basic building block of all life as we know it. So, could life be found in these lakes? Although instruments are being designed to study these distant worlds, it takes many years to build them and even longer to get them where they need to be. In the meantime, astrobiologists work in our own natural laboratory, the Earth, to learn about all the weird and wonderful forms of life that can exist and to help us one day answer one of humanity's oldest questions: Are we alone?

**Transcript**:
We've all seen movies about terrible insects from outer space or stories of abduction by little green men, but the study of life in the universe, including the possibility of extraterrestrial life, is also a serious, scientific pursuit. Astrobiology draws on diverse fields, such as physics, biology, astronomy, and geology, to study how life was formed on Earth, how it could form elsewhere, and how we might detect it. Many ancient religions described other worlds inhabited by known human beings, but these are more like mythical realms or parallel universes than other planets existing in the same physical world. It is only within the last century that scientists have been able to seriously undertake the search for extraterrestrial life. We know that at the most basic level organisms on Earth need three things: liquid water, a source of energy, and organic, carbon-based material. We also know that the Earth is just the right distance from the Sun, so as not to be either frozen or molten. So, planets within such a habitable range from their own stars may be able to support life. But while we used to think that life could only exist in such Earth-like environments, one of the most amazing discoveries of astrobiology has been just how versatile life is. We now know that life can thrive in some of the most extreme environments that'd be fatal for most known organisms. Life is found everywhere, from black smoke of hydrothermal vents in the dark depths of Earth's oceans, to bubbling, hot, acidic springs on the flanks of volcanoes, to high up in the atmosphere. Organisms that live in these challenging environments are called extremophiles, and they can survive at extremes of temperature, pressure, and radiation, as well as salinity, acidity, and limited availability of sunlight, water, or oxygen. What is most remarkable about these extremophiles is that they are found thriving in environments that mimic those on alien worlds. One of the most important of these worlds is our red and dusty neighbor, Mars. Today, astrobiologists are exploring places where life might once have existed on Mars using NASA's Curiosity rover. One of these is Gale Crater, an impact crater created when a meteor hit the surface of Mars nearly 3.8 billions years ago. Evidence from orbit suggest past traces of water, which means the crater might once have supported life. Planets are not the only places astrobiologists are looking at. For example, Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter, and Enceladus and Titan, two of Saturn's moons, are all exciting possibilities. Although these moons are extremely cold and two are covered in thick ice, there is evidence of liquid oceans beneath the shell. Could life be floating around in these oceans, or could it be living around black smoker vents at the bottom? Titan is particularly promising as it has an atmosphere and Earth-like lakes, seas, and rivers flowing across the surface. It is very cold, however, too cold for liquid water, so these rivers may instead be flowing with liquid hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane. These are composed of hydrogen, and, more importantly, carbon, which is the basic building block of all life as we know it. So, could life be found in these lakes? Although instruments are being designed to study these distant worlds, it takes many years to build them and even longer to get them where they need to be. In the meantime, astrobiologists work in our own natural laboratory, the Earth, to learn about all the weird and wonderful forms of life that can exist and to help us one day answer one of humanity's oldest questions: Are we alone?

**Transcript**:
good afternoon there's a medical revolution happening all around us and it's one that's going to help us conquer some of society's most dreaded conditions including cancer and the revolution is called angiogenesis and it's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels so why should we care about blood vessels well the human body is literally packed with them 60,000 miles worth in a typical adult and the end that would form a line that would circle the Earth twice the smallest blood vessels are called capillaries we've got 19 billion of them in our bodies and these are the vessels of life and as I'll show you they can also be the vessels of death now the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they're growing in for example in the liver they form channels to detoxify the blood in the lung they line air sacs for gas exchange in muscle they corkscrew so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation and in nerves they course along like power lines keeping those nerves alive and we get most of these blood vessels when we're actually still in the womb and what that means is that as adults blood vessels don't normally grow except in a few special circumstances in women blood vessels grow every month to build the lining of the uterus during pregnancy they form the placenta which connects mom and baby and after injury blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab in order to heal a wound and this is actually what it looks like hundreds of blood vessels all growing towards the center of the wound so the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time and it does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis such that when we need a brief burst of blood vessels the body can do this by releasing stimulators proteins called angiogenic factors that act as natural fertilizer and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout and when those excess vessels are no longer needed the body prunes them back to baseline using naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis now there are other situations where we start beneath the baseline and we need to grow more blood vessels just to get back to normal levels for example after an injury and a body can do that too but only to that normal level that's setpoint but what we now know is that for a number of diseases there are defects in the system where the body can't prune back extra blood vessels or can't grow enough new ones in a right place at the right time and in these situations angiogenesis is out of balance and when angiogenesis is out of balance a myriad of diseases result for example insufficient angiogenesis not enough blood vessels leads to wounds that don't heal heart attacks legs without circulation death from stroke nerve damage and on the other hand excessive angiogenesis too many blood vessels drives disease and we see this in cancer blindness arthritis obesity Alzheimer's disease in total there are more than 70 major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide that all look on the surface to be different from one another but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator in this realization is allowing us to reconceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases by controlling and your genesis now I'm going to focus on cancer because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer every type of cancer so here we go this is a tumor dark grey ominous mass growing inside a brain and under the microscope you can see hundreds of these brown staining blood vessels capillaries that are feeding cancer cells bringing oxygen and nutrients but cancers don't start out like this and if that cancers don't start out with a blood supply they start out as small microscopic nests of cells that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size that's the tip of a ballpoint pen then they can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply so they don't have enough oxygen or nutrients and in fact we're probably forming these microscopic cancers all the time in our body autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents have shown that about 40% of women between the ages of 40 and 50 actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts about 50% of men in their 50s and 60s have microscopic prostate cancers and all virtually a hundred percent of us by the time we reach our 70s will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid yet without a blood supply most of these cancers will never become dangerous dr. Judah Folkman who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field once called this cancer without disease so the body's ability to balance angiogenesis when it's working properly prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers and this turns out to be one of our most important defense mechanisms against cancer in fact if you actually block angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells tumors simply can't grow up but once angiogenesis occurs cancers can grow exponentially and this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to deadly cancer cells mutate and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors natural fertilizer that tipped the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer and once those vessels invade the cancer it can expand it can invade local tissues in the same vessels that are feeding tumors allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases and unfortunately this late stage of cancer is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed when angiogenesis has already turned on and cancer cells are growing like wild so Evandro Genesis is a tipping point between a harmless cancer and a harmful one then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution is a new approach to treating cancer by cutting off the blood supply we call this anti-angiogenic therapy and it's completely different from chemotherapy because it's selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers and we can do this because tomber blood vessels are unlike normal healthy vessels we see in other places of the body they're abnormal they are very poorly constructed and because of that they're highly vulnerable to treatments that target them in fact when we give cancer patients anti-angiogenic therapy here an experimental drug for a glioma which is a type of a brain tumor you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being starved here's a woman with a breast cancer being treated with the anti-angiogenic drug called Avastin which is fda-approved and you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment now I've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to anti-angiogenic therapy so a few years ago I asked myself can we take this one step further and treat other cancers even in other species so here is a nine-year-old boxer named Milo who had a very aggressive tumor called a malignant neurofibroma growing in his shoulder and invaded to his lungs his veterinarian only gave him three months to live so we created a cocktail of anti-angiogenic drugs that could be mixed into his dog food as well as an anti-angiogenic cream that could be applied on the surface of the tumor and within a few weeks of treatment we were able to slow down that cancers growth such that we were ultimately able to extend Milo's survival to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted all with the very good quality of life and we've subsequently treated more than 600 dogs we have about a 60% response rate and improved survival for these pets that were about to be euthanized so let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples this is a 20 year old dolphin living in Florida and she had these lesions in her mouth that over the course of three years developed into invasive squamous cell cancers so we created an anti-angiogenic paste we had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week and over the course of seven months the cancer has completely disappeared and the biopsies came back as normal here's a cancer growing on the lip of a quarter horse named it's a very very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma had already spread to his lymph nodes so we used an anti-angiogenic skin cream for the lip and the oral cocktail so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside and over the course of six months he experienced a complete remission and here he is six years later guinness with his very happy owner now obviously antigenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers in fact the first pioneered treatments for people as well as dogs already becoming available there's 12 different drugs 11 different cancer types but the real question is how well do these work in practice so here is actually the patient survival data from 8 different types of cancer and the bars represent survival time taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy or surgery or radiation available but starting in 2004 when anti-angiogenic therapies first became available you can see that there has been a 70 to 100 percent improvement in survival for people with kidney cancer multiple myeloma colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors that's impressive but for other tumors and cancer types the improvements have only been modest so I started asking myself why haven't we been able to do better and the answer to me is obvious we're treating cancer too late in the game when it's already established and oftentimes it's already spread or metastasize and as a doctor I know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage achieving a cure can be difficult if not impossible so I went back to the biology of angiogenesis and started thinking could the answer to cancer be preventing Andrew Genesis beating cancer its own game so the cancers could never become dangerous this could help healthy people as well as people who have already beaten cancer once or twice and want to find a way to keep it from coming back so to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer I went back to look at cancerous causes and what really intrigued me was when I saw that diet accounts for 30 to 35 percent of environmentally caused cancers now the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet what to strip out take away but I actually took a completely opposite approach it began asking what could we be adding to our diet that's naturally anti-angiogenic that could boost the body's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers in other words can we eat to starve cancer well the answer is yes and I'm going to show you how and our search for this has taken us to the market the farm and to the spice cabinet because what we've discovered is that Mother Nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis so here's a test system we developed at the center as a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion and we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are attainable by eating so let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes the active ingredient resveratrol it's also found in red wine this inhibits abnormal angiogenesis by 60 percent here's what happens when we add an extract from strawberries it potently inhibits angiogenesis an extract from soybeans and here is a growing list of our anti-angiogenic foods and beverages that we're interested in studying and for each food type we believe that there's different potencies within different strains and varietals and we want to measure this because well while you're eating a strawberry or drinking tea why not select the one that's most potent for preventing cancer so here are four different teas that we've tested they're all common ones Chinese Jasmine Japanese Sencha Earl Grey and a special blend that we prepared and you can see clearly that the tea's vary in their potency from less potent to more potent but what's very cool is when we actually combine the two less potent teas together the combination the blend is more potent than either one alone this means there's food synergy here's some more data from our testing now in the lab we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar and using the system we can test a potency of cancer drugs so the shorter the bar less angiogenesis that's good and here are some common drugs that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people statins non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a few others they inhibit angiogenesis - and here are the dietary factors going head-to-head against these drugs you can see they clearly hold their own and in some cases they're more potent than the actual drugs soy parsley garlic grapes berries I could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients so imagine if we could create the world's first rating system in which we could score foods according to their anti-angiogenic cancer preventative properties and that's what we're doing right now now I've shown you a bunch of lab data and so the real question is what is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer well the best example I know is the study of 79 thousand men followed over 20 years in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week at up to a 50% reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer now we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene and lycopene is anti-angiogenic but what's even more interesting from this study is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer those who ate more servings of tomato sauce actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer so this human study is a prime example of how anti-angiogenic substances present food and consumed impractical levels can impact on cancer and we're now studying the role of a healthy diet with Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University on the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis that we can find in the bloodstream now obviously what I've shared with you has some far ranging implications even beyond cancer research because if we're right it could impact on consumer education food services public health and even the insurance industry and in fact some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines check out this ad from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota and for many people around the world dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution because not everybody can afford expensive end-stage cancer treatments but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local sustainable anti-angiogenic crops now finally I've talked to you about food and I've talked to you about cancer so there's just one more disease that I have to tell you about and that's obesity because turns out that adipose tissue fat is highly angiogenesis dependent and like a tumor fat grows when blood vessels grow so the question is can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply so the top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese Mouse that eats non-stop until it turns fat like this furry tennis ball and the bottom curve is the weight of a normal Mouse if you take the obese Mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor it loses weight stop the treatment gains the weight back restart the treatment loses the weight again stop the treatment gains away back in fact you can cycle the weight up and down simply by inhibiting Andra Genesis so this approach that we're taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity the really truly interesting thing about this is that we can't take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal Mouse is weight is supposed to be in other words we can't create supermodel mice and this speaks to the role of angiogenesis in regulating healthy setpoints albertson Georgie once said that discovery consists of seeing what everybody is seen and thinking what nobody is thought I hope I've convinced you that for diseases like cancer obesity and other conditions that there may be a great power in attacking their common denominator angiogenesis and that's what I think the world needs now thank so these drugs aren't exactly they're not exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now for anyone out here who has cancer what would you recommend do you recommend pursuing these treatments now for most cancer patients so there are anti energetic treatments that are you should ask there are many clinical trials the in geneticist foundation respond almost 300 companies consider the approved ones look for clinical trials but then between what the doctor can do for you we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves and this is one of the themes that I'm talking about is we can empower ourselves to do the things that doctors can't do for us which is a use knowledge of take action and if Mother Nature has given us some clues we think that there might be some new future in the value of how we eat and what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day right and along those lines for people who might have risk factors for cancer would you recommend pursuing any treatment sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce well you know there's a abundant epidemiological evidence and I think an Information Age it doesn't take long to go to a credible source like PubMed the National Library of Medicine to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and based on common medications and that's certainly something that anybody can look into okay well thank you so much you

**Transcript**:
good afternoon there's a medical revolution happening all around us and it's one that's going to help us conquer some of society's most dreaded conditions including cancer and the revolution is called angiogenesis and it's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels so why should we care about blood vessels well the human body is literally packed with them 60,000 miles worth in a typical adult and the end that would form a line that would circle the Earth twice the smallest blood vessels are called capillaries we've got 19 billion of them in our bodies and these are the vessels of life and as I'll show you they can also be the vessels of death now the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they're growing in for example in the liver they form channels to detoxify the blood in the lung they line air sacs for gas exchange in muscle they corkscrew so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation and in nerves they course along like power lines keeping those nerves alive and we get most of these blood vessels when we're actually still in the womb and what that means is that as adults blood vessels don't normally grow except in a few special circumstances in women blood vessels grow every month to build the lining of the uterus during pregnancy they form the placenta which connects mom and baby and after injury blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab in order to heal a wound and this is actually what it looks like hundreds of blood vessels all growing towards the center of the wound so the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time and it does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis such that when we need a brief burst of blood vessels the body can do this by releasing stimulators proteins called angiogenic factors that act as natural fertilizer and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout and when those excess vessels are no longer needed the body prunes them back to baseline using naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis now there are other situations where we start beneath the baseline and we need to grow more blood vessels just to get back to normal levels for example after an injury and a body can do that too but only to that normal level that's setpoint but what we now know is that for a number of diseases there are defects in the system where the body can't prune back extra blood vessels or can't grow enough new ones in a right place at the right time and in these situations angiogenesis is out of balance and when angiogenesis is out of balance a myriad of diseases result for example insufficient angiogenesis not enough blood vessels leads to wounds that don't heal heart attacks legs without circulation death from stroke nerve damage and on the other hand excessive angiogenesis too many blood vessels drives disease and we see this in cancer blindness arthritis obesity Alzheimer's disease in total there are more than 70 major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide that all look on the surface to be different from one another but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator in this realization is allowing us to reconceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases by controlling and your genesis now I'm going to focus on cancer because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer every type of cancer so here we go this is a tumor dark grey ominous mass growing inside a brain and under the microscope you can see hundreds of these brown staining blood vessels capillaries that are feeding cancer cells bringing oxygen and nutrients but cancers don't start out like this and if that cancers don't start out with a blood supply they start out as small microscopic nests of cells that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size that's the tip of a ballpoint pen then they can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply so they don't have enough oxygen or nutrients and in fact we're probably forming these microscopic cancers all the time in our body autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents have shown that about 40% of women between the ages of 40 and 50 actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts about 50% of men in their 50s and 60s have microscopic prostate cancers and all virtually a hundred percent of us by the time we reach our 70s will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid yet without a blood supply most of these cancers will never become dangerous dr. Judah Folkman who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field once called this cancer without disease so the body's ability to balance angiogenesis when it's working properly prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers and this turns out to be one of our most important defense mechanisms against cancer in fact if you actually block angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells tumors simply can't grow up but once angiogenesis occurs cancers can grow exponentially and this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to deadly cancer cells mutate and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors natural fertilizer that tipped the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer and once those vessels invade the cancer it can expand it can invade local tissues in the same vessels that are feeding tumors allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases and unfortunately this late stage of cancer is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed when angiogenesis has already turned on and cancer cells are growing like wild so Evandro Genesis is a tipping point between a harmless

**Transcript**:
good afternoon there's a medical revolution happening all around us and it's one that's going to help us conquer some of society's most dreaded conditions including cancer and the revolution is called angiogenesis and it's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels so why should we care about blood vessels well the human body is literally packed with them 60,000 miles worth in a typical adult and the end that would form a line that would circle the Earth twice the smallest blood vessels are called capillaries we've got 19 billion of them in our bodies and these are the vessels of life and as I'll show you they can also be the vessels of death now the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they're growing in for example in the liver they form channels to detoxify the blood in the lung they line air sacs for gas exchange in muscle they corkscrew so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation and in nerves they course along like power lines keeping those nerves alive and we get most of these blood vessels when we're actually still in the womb and what that means is that as adults blood vessels don't normally grow except in a few special circumstances in women blood vessels grow every month to build the lining of the uterus during pregnancy they form the placenta which connects mom and baby and after injury blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab in order to heal a wound and this is actually what it looks like hundreds of blood vessels all growing towards the center of the wound so the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time and it does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis such that when we need a brief burst of blood vessels the body can do this by releasing stimulators proteins called angiogenic factors that act as natural fertilizer and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout and when those excess vessels are no longer needed the body prunes them back to baseline using naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis now there are other situations where we start beneath the baseline and we need to grow more blood vessels just to get back to normal levels for example after an injury and a body can do that too but only to that normal level that's setpoint but what we now know is that for a number of diseases there are defects in the system where the body can't prune back extra blood vessels or can't grow enough new ones in a right place at the right time and in these situations angiogenesis is out of balance and when angiogenesis is out of balance a myriad of diseases result for example insufficient angiogenesis not enough blood vessels leads to wounds that don't heal heart attacks legs without circulation death from stroke nerve damage and on the other hand excessive angiogenesis too many blood vessels drives disease and we see this in cancer blindness arthritis obesity Alzheimer's disease in total there are more than 70 major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide that all look on the surface to be different from one another but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator in this realization is allowing us to reconceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases by controlling and your genesis now I'm going to focus on cancer because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer every type of cancer so here we go this is a tumor dark grey ominous mass growing inside a brain and under the microscope you can see hundreds of these brown staining blood vessels capillaries that are feeding cancer cells bringing oxygen and nutrients but cancers don't start out like this and if that cancers don't start out with a blood supply they start out as small microscopic nests of cells that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size that's the tip of a ballpoint pen then they can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply so they don't have enough oxygen or nutrients and in fact we're probably forming these microscopic cancers all the time in our body autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents have shown that about 40% of women between the ages of 40 and 50 actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts about 50% of men in their 50s and 60s have microscopic prostate cancers and all virtually a hundred percent of us by the time we reach our 70s will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid yet without a blood supply most of these cancers will never become dangerous dr. Judah Folkman who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field once called this cancer without disease so the body's ability to balance angiogenesis when it's working properly prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers and this turns out to be one of our most important defense mechanisms against cancer in fact if you actually block angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells tumors simply can't grow up but once angiogenesis occurs cancers can grow exponentially and this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to deadly cancer cells mutate and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors natural fertilizer that tipped the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer and once those vessels invade the cancer it can expand it can invade local tissues in the same vessels that are feeding tumors allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases and unfortunately this late stage of cancer is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed when angiogenesis has already turned on and cancer cells are growing like wild so Evandro Genesis is a tipping point between a harmless cancer and a harmful one then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution is a new approach to treating cancer by cutting off the blood supply we call this anti-angiogenic therapy and it's completely different from chemotherapy because it's selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers and we can do this because tomber blood vessels are unlike normal healthy vessels we see in other places of the body they're abnormal they are very poorly constructed and because of that they're highly vulnerable to treatments that target them in fact when we give cancer patients anti-angiogenic therapy here an experimental drug for a glioma which is a type of a brain tumor you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being starved here's a woman with a breast cancer being treated with the anti-angiogenic drug called Avastin which is fda-approved and you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment now I've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to anti-angiogenic therapy so a few years ago I asked myself can we take this one step further and treat other cancers even in other species so here is a nine-year-old boxer named Milo who had a very aggressive tumor called a malignant neurofibroma growing in his shoulder and invaded to his lungs his veterinarian only gave him three months to live so we created a cocktail of anti-angiogenic drugs that could be mixed into his dog food as well as an anti-angiogenic cream that could be applied on the surface of the tumor and within a few weeks of treatment we were able to slow down that cancers growth such that we were ultimately able to extend Milo's survival to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted all with the very good quality of life and we've subsequently treated more than 600 dogs we have about a 60% response rate and improved survival for these pets that were about to be euthanized so let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples this is a 20 year old dolphin living in Florida and she had these lesions in her mouth that over the course of three years developed into invasive squamous cell cancers so we created an anti-angiogenic paste we had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week and over the course of seven months the cancer has completely disappeared and the biopsies came back as normal here's a cancer growing on the lip of a quarter horse named it's a very very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma had already spread to his lymph nodes so we used an anti-angiogenic skin cream for the lip and the oral cocktail so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside and over the course of six months he experienced a complete remission and here he is six years later guinness with his very happy owner now obviously antigenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers in fact the first pioneered treatments for people as well as dogs already becoming available there's 12 different drugs 11 different cancer types but the real question is how well do these work in practice so here is actually the patient survival data from 8 different types of cancer and the bars represent survival time taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy or surgery or radiation available but starting in 2004 when anti-angiogenic therapies first became available you can see that there has been a 70 to 100 percent improvement in survival for people with kidney cancer multiple myeloma colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors that's impressive but for other tumors and cancer types the improvements have only been modest so I started asking myself why haven't we been able to do better and the answer to me is obvious we're treating cancer too late in the game when it's already established and oftentimes it's already spread or metastasize and as a doctor I know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage achieving a cure can be difficult if not impossible so I went back to the biology of angiogenesis and started thinking could the answer to cancer be preventing Andrew Genesis beating cancer its own game so the cancers could never become dangerous this could help healthy people as well as people who have already beaten cancer once or twice and want to find a way to keep it from coming back so to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer I went back to look at cancerous causes and what really intrigued me was when I saw that diet accounts for 30 to 35 percent of environmentally caused cancers now the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet what to strip out take away but I actually took a completely opposite approach it began asking what could we be adding to our diet that's naturally anti-angiogenic that could boost the body's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers in other words can we eat to starve cancer well the answer is yes and I'm going to show you how and our search for this has taken us to the market the farm and to the spice cabinet because what we've discovered is that Mother Nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis so here's a test system we developed at the center as a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion and we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are attainable by eating so let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes the active ingredient resveratrol it's also found in red wine this inhibits abnormal angiogenesis by 60 percent here's what happens when we add an extract from strawberries it potently inhibits angiogenesis an extract from soybeans and here is a growing list of our anti-angiogenic foods and beverages that we're interested in studying and for each food type we believe that there's different potencies within different strains and varietals and we want to measure this because well while you're eating a strawberry or drinking tea why not select the one that's most potent for preventing cancer so here are four different teas that we've tested they're all common ones Chinese Jasmine Japanese Sencha Earl Grey and a special blend that we prepared and you can see clearly that the tea's vary in their potency from less potent to more potent but what's very cool is when we actually combine the two less potent teas together the combination the blend is more potent than either one alone this means there's food synergy here's some more data from our testing now in the lab we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar and using the system we can test a potency of cancer drugs so the shorter the bar less angiogenesis that's good and here are some common drugs that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people statins non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a few others they inhibit angiogenesis - and here are the dietary factors going head-to-head against these drugs you can see they clearly hold their own and in some cases they're more potent than the actual drugs soy parsley garlic grapes berries I could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients so imagine if we could create the world's first rating system in which we could score foods according to their anti-angiogenic cancer preventative properties and that's what we're doing right now now I've shown you a bunch of lab data and so the real question is what is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer well the best example I know is the study of 79 thousand men followed over 20 years in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week at up to a 50% reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer now we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene and lycopene is anti-angiogenic but what's even more interesting from this study is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer those who ate more servings of tomato sauce actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer so this human study is a prime example of how anti-angiogenic substances present food and consumed impractical levels can impact on cancer and we're now studying the role of a healthy diet with Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University on the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis that we can find in the bloodstream now obviously what I've shared with you has some far ranging implications even beyond cancer research because if we're right it could impact on consumer education food services public health and even the insurance industry and in fact some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines check out this ad from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota and for many people around the world dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution because not everybody can afford expensive end-stage cancer treatments but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local sustainable anti-angiogenic crops now finally I've talked to you about food and I've talked to you about cancer so there's just one more disease that I have to tell you about and that's obesity because turns out that adipose tissue fat is highly angiogenesis dependent and like a tumor fat grows when blood vessels grow so the question is can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply so the top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese Mouse that eats non-stop until it turns fat like this furry tennis ball and the bottom curve is the weight of a normal Mouse if you take the obese Mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor it loses weight stop the treatment gains the weight back restart the treatment loses the weight again stop the treatment gains away back in fact you can cycle the weight up and down simply by inhibiting Andra Genesis so this approach that we're taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity the really truly interesting thing about this is that we can't take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal Mouse is weight is supposed to be in other words we can't create supermodel mice and this speaks to the role of angiogenesis in regulating healthy setpoints albertson Georgie once said that discovery consists of seeing what everybody is seen and thinking what nobody is thought I hope I've convinced you that for diseases like cancer obesity and other conditions that there may be a great power in attacking their common denominator angiogenesis and that's what I think the world needs now thank so these drugs aren't exactly they're not exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now for anyone out here who has cancer what would you recommend do you recommend pursuing these treatments now for most cancer patients so there are anti energetic treatments that are you should ask there are many clinical trials the in geneticist foundation respond almost 300 companies consider the approved ones look for clinical trials but then between what the doctor can do for you we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves and this is one of the themes that I'm talking about is we can empower ourselves to do the things that doctors can't do for us which is a use knowledge of take action and if Mother Nature has given us some clues we think that there might be some new future in the value of how we eat and what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day right and along those lines for people who might have risk factors for cancer would you recommend pursuing any treatment sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce well you know there's a abundant epidemiological evidence and I think an Information Age it doesn't take long to go to a credible source like PubMed the National Library of Medicine to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and based on common medications and that's certainly something that anybody can look into okay well thank you so much you

what is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer well the best example I know is the study of 79 thousand men followed over 20 years in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week at up to a 50% reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer now we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene and lycopene is anti-angiogenic but what's even more interesting from this study is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer those who ate more servings of tomato sauce actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer so this human study is a prime example of how anti-angiogenic substances present food and consumed impractical levels can impact on cancer and we're now studying the role of a healthy diet with Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University on the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis that we can find in the bloodstream now obviously what I've shared with you has some far ranging implications even beyond cancer research because if we're right it could impact on consumer education food services public health and even the insurance industry and in fact some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines check out this ad from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota and for many people around the world dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution because not everybody can afford expensive end-stage cancer treatments but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local sustainable anti-angiogenic crops now finally I've talked to you about food and I've talked to you about cancer so there's just one more disease that I have to tell you about and that's obesity because turns out that adipose tissue fat is highly angiogenesis dependent and like a tumor fat grows when blood vessels grow so the question is can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply so the top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese Mouse that eats non-stop until it turns fat like this furry tennis ball and the bottom curve is the weight of a normal Mouse if you take the obese Mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor it loses weight stop the treatment gains the weight back restart the treatment loses the weight again stop the treatment gains away back in fact you can cycle the weight up and down simply by inhibiting Andra Genesis so this approach that we're taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity the really truly interesting thing about this is that we can't take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal Mouse is weight is supposed to be in other words we can't create supermodel mice and this speaks to the role of angiogenesis in regulating healthy setpoints albertson Georgie once said that discovery consists of seeing what everybody is seen and thinking what nobody is thought I hope I've convinced you that for diseases like cancer obesity and other conditions that there may be a great power in attacking their common denominator angiogenesis and that's what I think the world needs now thank so these drugs aren't exactly they're not exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now for anyone out here who has cancer what would you recommend do you recommend pursuing these treatments now for most cancer patients so there are anti energetic treatments that are you should ask there are many clinical trials the in geneticist foundation respond almost 300 companies consider the approved ones look for clinical trials but then between what the doctor can do for you we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves and this is one of the themes that I'm talking about is we can empower ourselves to do the things that doctors can't do for us which is a use knowledge of take action and if Mother Nature has given us some clues we think that there might be some new future in the value of how we eat and what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day right and along those lines for people who might have risk factors for cancer would you recommend pursuing any treatment sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce well you know there's a abundant epidemiological evidence and I think an Information Age it doesn't take long to go to a credible source like PubMed the National Library of Medicine to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and based on common medications and that's certainly something that anybody can look into okay well thank you so much you

**Transcript**:
What would you say is the most important discovery made in the past few centuries? Is it the computer? The car? Electricity? Or maybe the discovery of the atom? I would argue that it is this chemical reaction: a nitrogen gas molecule plus three hydrogen gas molecules gets you two ammonia gas molecules. This is the Haber process of binding nitrogen molecules in the air to hydrogen molecules, or turning air into fertilizer. Without this reaction, farmers would be capable of producing enough food for only 4 billion people; our current population is just over 7 billion people. So, without the Haber process, over 3 billion people would be without food. You see, nitrogen in the form of nitrate, NO3, is an essential nutrient for plants to survive. As crops grow, they consume the nitrogen, removing it from the soil. The nitrogen can be replenished through long, natural fertilization processes like decaying animals, but humans want to grow food much faster than that. Now, here's the frustrating part: 78% of the air is composed of nitrogen, but crops can't just take nitrogen from the air because it contains very strong triple bonds, which crops cannot break. What Haber did basically was figure out a way to take this nitrogen in the air and put it into the ground. In 1908, the German chemist Fritz Haber developed a chemical method for utilizing the vast supply of nitrogen in the air. Haber found a method which took the nitrogen in the air and bonded it to hydrogen to form ammonia. Ammonia can then be injected into the soil, where it is quickly converted into nitrate. But if Haber's process was going to be used to feed the world, he would need to find a way to create a lot of this ammonia quickly and easily. In order to understand how Haber accomplished this feat, we need to know something about chemical equilibrium. Chemical equilibrium can be achieved when you have a reaction in a closed container. For example, let's say you put hydrogen and nitrogen into a closed container and allow them to react. In the beginning of the experiment, we have a lot of nitrogen and hydrogen, so the formation of ammonia proceeds at a high speed. But as the hydrogen and nitrogen react and get used up, the reaction slows down because there is less nitrogen and hydrogen in the container. Eventually, the ammonia molecules reach a point where they start to decompose back into the nitrogen and hydrogen. After a while, the two reactions, creating and breaking down ammonia, will reach the same speed. When these speeds are equal, we say the reaction has reached equilibrium. This might sound good, but it's not when what you want is to just create a ton of ammonia. Haber doesn't want the ammonia to break down at all, but if you simply leave the reaction in a closed container, that's what will happen. Here's where Henry Le Chatelier, a French chemist, can help. What he found was that if you take a system in equilibrium and you add something to it, like, say, nitrogen, the system will work to get back to equilibrium again. Le Chatelier also found that if you increase the amount of pressure on a system, the system tries to work to return to the pressure it had. It's like being in a crowded room. The more molecules there are, the more pressure there is. If we look back at our equation, we see that on the left-hand side, there are four molecules on the left and just two on the right. So, if we want the room to be less crowded, and therefore have less pressure, the system will start combining nitrogen and hydrogen to make the more compact ammonia molecules. Haber realized that in order to make large amounts of ammonia, he would have to create a machine that would continually add nitrogen and hydrogen while also increasing the pressure on the equilibrium system, which is exactly what he did. Today, ammonia is one of the most produced chemical compounds in the world. Roughly 131 million metric tons are produced a year, which is about 290 billion pounds of ammonia. That's about the mass of 30 million African elephants, weighing roughly 10,000 pounds each. 80% of this ammonia is used in fertilizer production, while the rest is used in industrial and household cleaners and to produce other nitrogen compounds, such as nitric acid. Recent studies have found that half of the nitrogen from these fertilizers is not assimilated by plants. Consequently, the nitrogen is found as a volatile chemical compound in the Earth's water supplies and atmosphere, severely damaging our environment. Of course, Haber did not foresee this problem when he introduced his invention. Following his pioneering vision, scientists today are looking for a new Haber process of the 21st century, which will reach the same level of aid without the dangerous consequences.

Now, here's the frustrating part: 78% of the air is composed of nitrogen, but crops can't just take nitrogen from the air because it contains very strong triple bonds, which crops cannot break. What Haber did basically was figure out a way to take this nitrogen in the air and put it into the ground. In 1908, the German chemist Fritz Haber developed a chemical method for utilizing the vast supply of nitrogen in the air. Haber found a method which took the nitrogen in the air and bonded it to hydrogen to form ammonia. Ammonia can then be injected into the soil, where it is quickly converted into nitrate. But if Haber's process was going to be used to feed the world, he would need to find a way to create a lot of this ammonia quickly and easily. In order to understand how Haber accomplished this feat, we need to know something about chemical equilibrium. Chemical equilibrium can be achieved when you have a reaction in a closed container. For example, let's say you put hydrogen and nitrogen into a closed container and allow them to react. In the beginning of the experiment, we have a lot of nitrogen and hydrogen, so the formation of ammonia proceeds at a high speed. But as the hydrogen and nitrogen react and get used up, the reaction slows down because there is less nitrogen and hydrogen in the container. Eventually, the ammonia molecules reach a point where they start to decompose back into the nitrogen and hydrogen. After a while, the two reactions, creating and breaking down ammonia, will reach the same speed. When these speeds are equal, we say the reaction has reached equilibrium. This might sound good, but it's not when what you want is to just create a ton of ammonia. Haber doesn't want the ammonia to break down at all, but if you simply leave the reaction in a closed container, that's what will happen. Here's where Henry Le Chatelier, a French chemist, can help. What he found was that if you take a system in equilibrium and you add something to it, like, say, nitrogen, the system will work to get back to equilibrium again. Le Chatelier also found that if you increase the amount of pressure on a system, the system tries to work to return to the pressure it had. It's like being in a crowded room. The more molecules there are, the more pressure there is. If we look back at our equation, we see that on the left-hand side, there are four molecules on the left and just two on the right. So, if we want the room to be less crowded, and therefore have less pressure, the system will start combining nitrogen and hydrogen to make the more compact ammonia molecules. Haber realized that in order to make large amounts of ammonia, he would have to create a machine that would continually add nitrogen and hydrogen while also increasing the pressure on the equilibrium system, which is exactly what he did. Today, ammonia is one of the most produced chemical compounds in the world. Roughly 131 million metric tons are produced a year, which is about 290 billion pounds of ammonia. That's about the mass of 30 million African elephants, weighing roughly 10,000 pounds each. 80% of this ammonia is used in fertilizer production, while the rest is used in industrial and household cleaners and to produce other nitrogen compounds, such as nitric acid. Recent studies have found that half of the nitrogen from these fertilizers is not assimilated by plants. Consequently, the nitrogen is found as a volatile chemical compound in the Earth's water supplies and atmosphere, severely damaging our environment. Of course, Haber did not foresee this problem when he introduced his invention. Following his pioneering vision, scientists today are looking for a new Haber process of the 21st century, which will reach the same level of aid without the dangerous consequences.

two years ago here at Ted I reported that we had discovered at Saturn with the Cassini spacecraft an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small Saturnian moon Enceladus seen here this region seen here for the first time in a Cassini image taken in 2005 this is the south polar region with the famous tiger stripe fractures crossing the South Pole and seen just recently in late 2008 here is that region again now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere is experiencing the onset of August and eventually winter and I also reported that we'd made this mind-blowing discovery this once-in-a-lifetime discovery of towering Jets erupting from those fractures at the South Pole consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane and at that time two years ago I mentioned that we were speculating that these Jets might in fact be geysers and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface but we weren't really sure however the implications of those results of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry and perhaps life itself we're so exciting that in the intervening two years we have focused more on Enceladus we've flown the Cassini spacecraft by this moon now several times flying closer and deeper into these Jets into the denser regions of these Jets so that now we have come away with some very precise compositional measurements and we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex and we previously reported while they're not amino acids we're now finding things like propane and benzene hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde and the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the Jets come from it's of liquid water but that that liquid water is in contact with rock and that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life so we are very encouraged by these results and we're much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon under the South Pole an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms whether or not there are living organisms there of course is an entirely different matter and that will have to await the arrival back at Enceladus of a spacecraft hopefully sometime in the near future specifically equipped to address that particular question but in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the Saturnian system and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park just because we can thank you

Oh, excuse me! Have you ever yawned
because somebody else yawned? You aren't especially tired, yet suddenly your mouth opens wide and a big yawn comes out. This phenomenon is known
as contagious yawning. And while scientists still
don't fully understand why it happens, there are many hypotheses
currently being researched. Let's take a look at a few
of the most prevalent ones, beginning with two
physiological hypotheses before moving to a psychological one. Our first physiological hypothesis states that contagious yawning
is triggered by a specific stimulus, an initial yawn. This is called fixed action pattern. Think of fixed action pattern
like a reflex. Your yawn makes me yawn. Similar to a domino effect,
one person's yawn triggers a yawn in a person nearby
that has observed the act. Once this reflex is triggered,
it must run its course. Have you ever tried to stop
a yawn once it has begun? Basically impossible! Another physiological hypothesis is known as non-conscious mimicry, or the chameleon effect. This occurs when you
imitate someone's behavior without knowing it, a subtle and unintentional
copycat maneuver. People tend to mimic
each other's postures. If you are seated across from someone
that has their legs crossed, you might cross your own legs. This hypothesis suggests that we yawn when we see someone else yawn because we are unconsciously copying
his or her behavior. Scientists believe that this chameleon
effect is possible because of a special set of neurons
known as mirror neurons. Mirror neurons are a type of brain cell that responds equally
when we perform an action as when we see someone else
perform the same action. These neurons are important
for learning and self-awareness. For example, watching someone
do something physical, like knitting or putting on lipstick, can help you do those same
actions more accurately. Neuroimaging studies using fMRI,
functional magnetic resonance imaging, show us that when we seem someone yawn
or even hear their yawn, a specific area of the brain
housing these mirror neurons tends to light up, which, in turn, causes us to respond
with the same action: a yawn! Our psychological hypothesis also involves
the work of these mirror neurons. We will call it the empathy yawn. Empathy is the ability to understand
what someone else is feeling and partake in their emotion, a crucial ability
for social animals like us. Recently, neuroscientists have found
that a subset of mirror neurons allows us to empathize
with others' feelings at a deeper level. (Yawn) Scientists discovered
this empathetic response to yawning while testing the first
hypothesis we mentioned, fixed action pattern. This study was set up to show
that dogs would enact a yawn reflex at the mere sound of a human yawn. While their study showed this to be true,
they found something else interesting. Dogs yawned more frequently
at familiar yawns, such as from their owners, than at unfamiliar yawns from strangers. Following this research,
other studies on humans and primates have also shown that contagious yawning occurs more frequently
among friends than strangers. In fact, contagious
yawning starts occurring when we are about four or five years old, at the point when children develop the ability to identify
others' emotions properly. Still, while newer scientific studies aim
to prove that contagious yawning is based on this capacity for empathy, more research is needed to shed light
on what exactly is going on. It's possible that the answer lies
in another hypothesis altogether. The next time you get caught in a yawn, take a second to think
about what just happened. Were you thinking about a yawn? Did someone near you yawn? Was that person a stranger
or someone close? And are you yawning right now? (Yawn) (Lip smacking)

**Transcript**:
Oh, excuse me! Have you ever yawned
because somebody else yawned? You aren't especially tired, yet suddenly your mouth opens wide and a big yawn comes out. This phenomenon is known
as contagious yawning. And while scientists still
don't fully understand why it happens, there are many hypotheses
currently being researched. Let's take a look at a few
of the most prevalent ones, beginning with two
physiological hypotheses before moving to a psychological one. Our first physiological hypothesis states that contagious yawning
is triggered by a specific stimulus, an initial yawn. This is called fixed action pattern. Think of fixed action pattern
like a reflex. Your yawn makes me yawn. Similar to a domino effect,
one person's yawn triggers a yawn in a person nearby
that has observed the act. Once this reflex is triggered,
it must run its course. Have you ever tried to stop
a yawn once it has begun? Basically impossible! Another physiological hypothesis is known as non-conscious mimicry, or the chameleon effect. This occurs when you
imitate someone's behavior without knowing it, a subtle and unintentional
copycat maneuver. People tend to mimic
each other's postures. If you are seated across from someone
that has their legs crossed, you might cross your own legs. This hypothesis suggests that we yawn when we see someone else yawn because we are unconsciously copying
his or her behavior. Scientists believe that this chameleon
effect is possible because of a special set of neurons
known as mirror neurons. Mirror neurons are a type of brain cell that responds equally
when we perform an action as when we see someone else
perform the same action. These neurons are important
for learning and self-awareness. For example, watching someone
do something physical, like knitting or putting on lipstick, can help you do those same
actions more accurately. Neuroimaging studies using fMRI,
functional magnetic resonance imaging, show us that when we seem someone yawn
or even hear their yawn, a specific area of the brain
housing these mirror neurons tends to light up, which, in turn, causes us to respond
with the same action: a yawn! Our psychological hypothesis also involves
the work of these mirror neurons. We will call it the empathy yawn. Empathy is the ability to understand
what someone else is feeling and partake in their emotion, a crucial ability
for social animals like us. Recently, neuroscientists have found
that a subset of mirror neurons allows us to empathize
with others' feelings at a deeper level. (Yawn) Scientists discovered
this empathetic response to yawning while testing the first
hypothesis we mentioned, fixed action pattern. This study was set up to show
that dogs would enact a yawn reflex at the mere sound of a human yawn. While their study showed this to be true,
they found something else interesting. Dogs yawned more frequently
at familiar yawns, such as from their owners, than at unfamiliar yawns from strangers. Following this research,
other studies on humans and primates have also shown that contagious yawning occurs more frequently
among friends than strangers. In fact, contagious
yawning starts occurring when we are about four or five years old, at the point when children develop the ability to identify
others' emotions properly. Still, while newer scientific studies aim
to prove that contagious yawning is based on this capacity for empathy, more research is needed to shed light
on what exactly is going on. It's possible that the answer lies
in another hypothesis altogether. The next time you get caught in a yawn, take a second to think
about what just happened. Were you thinking about a yawn? Did someone near you yawn? Was that person a stranger
or someone close? And are you yawning right now? (Yawn) (Lip smacking)

**Transcript**:
Everybody loves fireworks -- the lights, the colors, and, of course, the big boom. But the history of fireworks isn't all hugs and celebrations. Long before epic fireworks displays, chemists in China invented the key ingredient that propels those bright lights into the sky. That invention was what we now call gunpowder. Our story begins back in ancient China in the mid-ninth century where early Chinese alchemists were trying to create a potion for immortality. Instead, what they created was a flammable powder that burned down many of their homes. They quickly realized that this black powder, which they called fire medicine, was precisely the opposite of something that would make you live forever. In these early days, the Chinese hadn't yet figured out how to make the powder explode; it was simply very flammable, and their armies used it to make flaming arrows and even a flamethrower. But once they figured out the right proportions of ingredients to create a blast, they began using the powder even more, creating fireworks to keep evil spirits away and bombs to defend themselves against Mongol invaders. It was these Mongols, most likely, who spread the invention of gunpowder across the world. After fielding Chinese attacks, they learned how to produce the powder themselves and brought it with them on their conquests in Persia and India. William of Rubruck, a European ambassador to the Mongols, was likely responsible for bringing gunpowder back to Europe around 1254. From there, engineers and military inventors created all kinds of destructive weapons. From bombs to guns to cannons, gunpowder left its mark on the world in some pretty terrible ways, in contrast to the beautiful marks it can leave in the air. So, how does black powder propel fireworks into the sky? You might have seen old Westerns or cartoons where a trail of gunpowder is lit and it leads to a large and obviously explosive barrel. Once the fire gets to the barrel, a large boom occurs. But why doesn't the trail itself explode? The reason is that burning the powder releases energy and gases. While the trail is burning, these are easily released into the surrounding air. But when the gunpowder is contained within the barrel, the energy and gases cannot easily escape and build up until BOOM! Firework canisters provide a single, upward-facing outlet to channel this explosive energy. The wick ignites the gunpowder and the energy takes the easiest exit from the canister, launching the firework high into the sky. The flame then makes its way through the firework's encasing and the same reaction occurs high above our heads. So, while the Chinese alchemists never found the compound for eternal life, they did find something that would go on to shape all of civilization, something that has caused many tragic moments in human history, and yet still gives us hope when we look up in celebration at the colorful night sky.

**Transcript**:
Everybody loves fireworks -- the lights, the colors, and, of course, the big boom. But the history of fireworks isn't all hugs and celebrations. Long before epic fireworks displays, chemists in China invented the key ingredient that propels those bright lights into the sky. That invention was what we now call gunpowder. Our story begins back in ancient China in the mid-ninth century where early Chinese alchemists were trying to create a potion for immortality. Instead, what they created was a flammable powder that burned down many of their homes. They quickly realized that this black powder, which they called fire medicine, was precisely the opposite of something that would make you live forever. In these early days, the Chinese hadn't yet figured out how to make the powder explode; it was simply very flammable, and their armies used it to make flaming arrows and even a flamethrower. But once they figured out the right proportions of ingredients to create a blast, they began using the powder even more, creating fireworks to keep evil spirits away and bombs to defend themselves against Mongol invaders. It was these Mongols, most likely, who spread the invention of gunpowder across the world. After fielding Chinese attacks, they learned how to produce the powder themselves and brought it with them on their conquests in Persia and India. William of Rubruck, a European ambassador to the Mongols, was likely responsible for bringing gunpowder back to Europe around 1254. From there, engineers and military inventors created all kinds of destructive weapons. From bombs to guns to cannons, gunpowder left its mark on the world in some pretty terrible ways, in contrast to the beautiful marks it can leave in the air. So, how does black powder propel fireworks into the sky? You might have seen old Westerns or cartoons where a trail of gunpowder is lit and it leads to a large and obviously explosive barrel. Once the fire gets to the barrel, a large boom occurs. But why doesn't the trail itself explode? The reason is that burning the powder releases energy and gases. While the trail is burning, these are easily released into the surrounding air. But when the gunpowder is contained within the barrel, the energy and gases cannot easily escape and build up until BOOM! Firework canisters provide a single, upward-facing outlet to channel this explosive energy. The wick ignites the gunpowder and the energy takes the easiest exit from the canister, launching the firework high into the sky. The flame then makes its way through the firework's encasing and the same reaction occurs high above our heads. So, while the Chinese alchemists never found the compound for eternal life, they did find something that would go on to shape all of civilization, something that has caused many tragic moments in human history, and yet still gives us hope when we look up in celebration at the colorful night sky.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] believe it or not I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem with the requisite focus on climate and the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the Earth by humankind and the resulting decline of the biosphere that culprit is business and industry which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956 as an Industrial Engineer come aspiring and then successful entrepreneur after founding my company interface from scratch in 1973 36 years go to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets and shepherding it through startup and survival to prosperity and Global dominance in its field I read Paul Hawkins book The Ecology of Commerce the sum of 1994 in his book Paul charges business and industry as one the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere and two the only institution that is large enough and pervasive enough and powerful enough to really lead humankind out of this mess and by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth and I then challenged the people of interface my company to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability which we defined as eventually operating a petroleum intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the Earth naturally and rapidly not another fresh of oil and to do no harm to the biosphere take nothing Do no harm I simply said if hawan is right in business and industry must lead who will lead business and industry unless somebody leads nobody will it's axiomatic why not us and thanks to the people of inace I have become a recovering plunderer [Applause] I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail and that became the headline of a fortune article that went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO from plunderer to recovering plunderer to America's greenest CEO in five years that frankly was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999 asked later in the Canadian documentary of the corporation what I meant by the go go to jail remark I offered that theft is a crime and theft of our children's Future Would someday be a crime but I realized for that to be true for theft of our children's future to be a crime there must be a clear demonstrable alternative to the take make waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization and is the major culprit stealing our children's future by digging up the Earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerate in short digging up the Earth and converting it to pollution according to Paul and an erck and their well-known environmental impact equation impact a bad thing is the product of population affluence and technology that is impact is generated by people what they consume in their affluence and how it is produced I know the equation is largely subjective you can perhaps quantify people and perhaps quantify affluence but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify so the equation is conceptual still it works to help us understand the problem so we set out at interface in 1994 to create an example to transform the way we made carpet a petroleum intensive product for materials as well as energy and to transform our our Technologies so they diminished environmental impact rather than multiplied it Paul andan ER environmental impact equation I is equal to P * a * T population affluence and Technology I wanted interface to rewrite that equation so that it read i = p * a ided by T now the mathematically minded will see immediately that t in the numerator increases impact a bad thing but T in the denominator decreases impact so I ask what would move T technology from the numerator call it T1 where it increases impact to the denominator call it T2 where it reduces impact I thought about the characteristics of first Industrial Revolution T1 as we practiced it ENT aace and it had the following characteristics extractive taking raw materials from the earth linear take make waste powered by fossil fuel derived energy wasteful abusive and focused on labor productivity More carpet per man hour thinking it through I realize that all those attributes must be changed to move t to the denominator in the new Industrial Revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable Linear by cyclical fossil fuel energy by renewable energy sunlight waste wasteful by waste free and abusive by benign and labor productivity by resource productivity and I reason that if we could make that those transformative changes and get rid of T1 all together we could reduce our impact to zero including our impact on the climate and that became the interface plan in 1995 and has been the plan ever since we have measured our progress very rigorously so I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years net greenhouse gas emissions down 82% in absolute tonnage over the same span of time sales have increased by 2/3 and profits have doubled so an 82% absolute reduction translates into a 90 % reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales this is the magnitude of the reduction the entire Global technosphere must Realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate climate disruption so the scientists are telling us fossil fuel usage is down 60% per unit of production due to efficiencies in Renewables the cheapest most secure barrel of all there is is the one not used for through efficiencies water usage is down 75% in our worldwide carpet tile business down 40% in our broadland carpet business which we acquired in 1993 right here in California City of Industry where water is so precious renewable of recycled materials in add 25% of the total and growing rapidly renewable energy is 27% of our total going for 100% we have diverted 148 million pounds that's 74,000 tons of used carpet from landfills closing the loop on material flows through reverse Logistics and postc consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago those new cyclical technologies have contribut mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate neutral carpet since 2004 meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain from mind and Wellhead clear to end of life Reclamation independent third party certified we call it cool carpet and it has been a powerful Marketplace differentiated increasing sales and profits 3 years ago we launched carpet tile for the home under the brand Flo misspelled f l r you can point and click today at fl.com and have cool carpet delivered to your front door in 5 days it is practical and pretty too we reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our Goal Zero impact zero footprint we've set 2020 as our Target year for zero for reaching the top the summit of Mount sustainability we call this Mission zero and this is perhaps the most important fact that we have found Mission zero to be incredibly good for business a better business model a better way to bigger profits here's the business case for sustainability from real life experience cost are down not up reflecting some $400 million of avoided cost in pursuit of zero waste the first face of Mount sustainability this has paid all the cost for the transformation of interace and this dispels a myth to this false choice between the environment and the economy our products are the best they've ever been inspired by design for sustainability and unexpected Wellspring of innovation our people are galvanized around the share higher purpose you cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together and the Goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing no amount of advertising no clever marketing campaign at any price could have produced or created as much Goodwill costs products people Marketplace what else is there it is a better business model and here's our 14-year record of sales and profits there's a dip there from 2001 to 2003 a dip when our sales over a threeyear period were down 177% but the marketplace was down 36% we literally gained market chain we might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability now if every business were pursuing the interface plan would that solve all our problems I don't think so I remain troubled by the revised early equation I equal p * a / T2 that a is a capital A suggesting that affluence is an end in itself but what if we reframed ear further and what if we made a a lowercase a suggesting that it a a means to an end and that end is happiness more happiness with less stuff you know that would reframe civilization itself and our whole system of economics if not for our species then perhaps for the one that SU exceeds us the sustainable species living on a finite Earth ethically happily and ecologically inbalance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand Generations or 10,000 Generations that is to say into the indefinite future but does the Earth have to wait for our Extinction as a species well maybe so but I don't think so iten a face we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable zero footprint an industrial company fully into existence by 2020 we can see our way now clear to the top of that mountain and now the challenge is in execution and as my good friend and advisor Amry lovens says if something exists it must be possible if we if we can actually do it it must be possible if we a Petro intensive company can do it anybody can and if anybody can it follows that everybody can hawen fulfilled business and industry leading humankind away from the abyss because with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere a d a very dear person is at risk here frankly at unacceptable risk who is that person not you not I but let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here and I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain CL climb on a Tuesday Morning in March of 1996 I was talking to our people as I did at every opportunity back then bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting but about 5 days later back in Atlanta I received an email from Glenn Thomas one of my people in the California meeting he was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday Morning together and when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life because it told me by God one person got it here's what Glenn wrote and here's that person most at risk please meet Tomorrow's Child without a name and unseen face and knowing not your time or place Tomorrow's Child though yet unborn I met you first last Tuesday Morning a wise friend introduced us to and through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see a day for you but not for me knowing you has changed my thinking for I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday somehow threaten you Tomorrow's Child my daughter son I'm afraid I've just begun to think of you and our you are good though always having known I should begin I will to weigh the cost of what I squander what is lost If Ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too well every day of my life since tomorrow's child has spoken to me with one simple but profound message which I presume to share with you we are each and everyone a part of the Web of Life the Continuum of humanity is sure but in the largest sense the web of life itself and we have a choice to make during our brief brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet to hurt it or to help it for you it's your call thank you

denominator decreases impact so I ask what would move T technology from the numerator call it T1 where it increases impact to the denominator call it T2 where it reduces impact I thought about the characteristics of first Industrial Revolution T1 as we practiced it ENT aace and it had the following characteristics extractive taking raw materials from the earth linear take make waste powered by fossil fuel derived energy wasteful abusive and focused on labor productivity More carpet per man hour thinking it through I realize that all those attributes must be changed to move t to the denominator in the new Industrial Revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable Linear by cyclical fossil fuel energy by renewable energy sunlight waste wasteful by waste free and abusive by benign and labor productivity by resource productivity and I reason that if we could make that those transformative changes and get rid of T1 all together we could reduce our impact to zero including our impact on the climate and that became the interface plan in 1995 and has been the plan ever since we have measured our progress very rigorously so I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years net greenhouse gas emissions down 82% in absolute tonnage over the same span of time sales have increased by 2/3 and profits have doubled so an 82% absolute reduction translates into a 90 % reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales this is the magnitude of the reduction the entire Global technosphere must Realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate climate disruption so the scientists are telling us fossil fuel usage is down 60% per unit of production due to efficiencies in Renewables the cheapest most secure barrel of all there is is the one not used for through efficiencies water usage is down 75% in our worldwide carpet tile business down 40% in our broadland carpet business which we acquired in 1993 right here in California City of Industry where water is so precious renewable of recycled materials in add 25% of the total and growing rapidly renewable energy is 27% of our total going for 100% we have diverted 148 million pounds that's 74,000 tons of used carpet from landfills closing the loop on material flows through reverse Logistics and postc consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago those new cyclical technologies have contribut mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate neutral carpet since 2004 meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain from mind and Wellhead clear to end of life Reclamation independent third party certified we call it cool carpet and it has been a powerful Marketplace differentiated increasing sales and profits 3 years ago we launched carpet tile for the home under the brand Flo misspelled f l r you can point and click today at fl.com and have cool carpet delivered to your front door in 5 days it is practical and pretty too we reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our Goal Zero impact zero footprint we've set 2020 as our Target year for zero for reaching the top the summit of Mount sustainability we call this Mission zero and this is perhaps the most important fact that we have found Mission zero to be incredibly good for business a better business model a better way to bigger profits here's the business case for sustainability from real life experience cost are down not up reflecting some $400 million of avoided cost in pursuit of zero waste the first face of Mount sustainability this has paid all the cost for the transformation of interace and this dispels a myth to this false choice between the environment and the economy our products are the best they've ever been inspired by design for sustainability and unexpected Wellspring of innovation our people are galvanized around the share higher purpose you cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together and the Goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing no amount of advertising no clever marketing campaign at any price could have produced or created as much Goodwill costs products people Marketplace what else is there it is a better business model and here's our 14-year record of sales and profits there's a dip there from 2001 to 2003 a dip when our sales over a threeyear period were down 177% but the marketplace was down 36% we literally gained market chain we might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability now if every business were pursuing the interface plan would that solve all our problems I don't think so I remain troubled by the revised early equation I equal p * a / T2 that a is a capital A suggesting that affluence is an end in itself but what if we reframed ear further and what if we made a a lowercase a suggesting that it a a means to an end and that end is happiness more happiness with less stuff you know that would reframe civilization itself and our whole system of economics if not for our species then perhaps for the one that SU exceeds us the sustainable species living on a finite Earth ethically happily and ecologically inbalance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand Generations or 10,000 Generations that is to say into the indefinite future but does the Earth have to wait for our Extinction as a species well maybe so but I don't think so iten a face we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable zero footprint an industrial company fully into existence by 2020 we can see our way now clear to the top of that mountain and now the challenge is in execution and as my good friend and advisor Amry lovens says if something

of my life because it told me by God one person got it here's what Glenn wrote and here's that person most at risk please meet Tomorrow's Child without a name and unseen face and knowing not your time or place Tomorrow's Child though yet unborn I met you first last Tuesday Morning a wise friend introduced us to and through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see a day for you but not for me knowing you has changed my thinking for I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday somehow threaten you Tomorrow's Child my daughter son I'm afraid I've just begun to

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] believe it or not I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem with the requisite focus on climate and the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the Earth by humankind and the resulting decline of the biosphere that culprit is business and industry which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956 as an Industrial Engineer come aspiring and then successful entrepreneur after founding my company interface from scratch in 1973 36 years go to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets and shepherding it through startup and survival to prosperity and Global dominance in its field I read Paul Hawkins book The Ecology of Commerce the sum of 1994 in his book Paul charges business and industry as one the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere and two the only institution that is large enough and pervasive enough and powerful enough to really lead humankind out of this mess and by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth and I then challenged the people of interface my company to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability which we defined as eventually operating a petroleum intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the Earth naturally and rapidly not another fresh of oil and to do no harm to the biosphere take nothing Do no harm I simply said if hawan is right in business and industry must lead who will lead business and industry unless somebody leads nobody will it's axiomatic why not us and thanks to the people of inace I have become a recovering plunderer [Applause] I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail and that became the headline of a fortune article that went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO from plunderer to recovering plunderer to America's greenest CEO in five years that frankly was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999 asked later in the Canadian documentary of the corporation what I meant by the go go to jail remark I offered that theft is a crime and theft of our children's Future Would someday be a crime but I realized for that to be true for theft of our children's future to be a crime there must be a clear demonstrable alternative to the take make waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization and is the major culprit stealing our children's future by digging up the Earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerate in short digging up the Earth and converting it to pollution according to Paul and an erck and their well-known environmental impact equation impact a bad thing is the product of population affluence and technology that is impact is generated by people what they consume in their affluence and how it is produced I know the equation is largely subjective you can perhaps quantify people and perhaps quantify affluence but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify so the equation is conceptual still it works to help us understand the problem so we set out at interface in 1994 to create an example to transform the way we made carpet a petroleum intensive product for materials as well as energy and to transform our our Technologies so they diminished environmental impact rather than multiplied it Paul andan ER environmental impact equation I is equal to P * a * T population affluence and Technology I wanted interface to rewrite that equation so that it read i = p * a ided by T now the mathematically minded will see immediately that t in the numerator increases impact a bad thing but T in the

Mysteries of vernacular: Robot, a machine capable of carrying out a programmable series of actions. The origin of the word robot dates back more than a thousand years to the era of serfdom in central Europe when servitude was the currency for rent. In those days, the Old Church Slavonic word rabota described the forced labor of the people. A slight adjustment of spelling, and rabota became the Czech robota, which, in addition to defining the toil of the serfs, was also used figuratively to describe any kind of hard work or drudgery. In 1920, Czech writer Karel Capek published a science fiction play called "R.U.R.", short for "Rossum's Universal Robots." The story featured automated machines with distinctly human features that, until they revolt, catered to the whims of the people of Earth. Capek originally considered calling these hard-working machines labori from the Latin word for labor, but he worried it sounded a bit too scholarly. He opted, instead, to emphasize their enslaved state by naming them roboti, or robot in English. "R.U.R." was wildly successful, and when it was translated into English in 1923, the word robot was enthusiastically embraced. Though most of today's robots look quite different than Capek imagined, they've become just as popular as he predicted. Unlike in "R.U.R.", though, our robots haven't risen up against us, and here's hoping it stays that way!

**Transcript**:
Good evening! What's the matter? Are you afraid of vampires? He he, no need to worry, I'm not staying for dinner. (Laughter) I'm here to guide you
through a brief history of vampires, illustrating how our image has changed from a shambling corpse to the dapper gentleman
you see before you. Vampires are nearly as old as you humans. Stories about us, revenants, appear in cultures extending
as far back as prehistoric times. But we weren't called vampires back then and most of us did not look the way
we imagine vampires today. Ha, far from it! For example, the Mesopotamian Lamashtu was a creature with the head of a lion
and the body of the donkey, and the ancient Greek striges were simply described
as bloodthirsty birds. Others were even stranger. The Philippine manananggal
would sever her upper torso and sprout huge, bat-like wings to fly. The Malaysian penanggalan
was a flying female head with dangling entrails. (Laughter) And the Australian Yara-ma-yha-who was a little red guy with a big head, a large mouth, and bloodsuckers on his hands and feet. Oh, and let's not forget
the Caribbean's soucouyant, the West African obayifo, and the Mexican Tlahuelpuchi. (Laughter) Charming, aren't they? Though they may look vastly different, all of these beings have
one common characteristic: They sustain themselves by consuming
the life force of a living creature. This shared trait
is what defines a vampire -- all the other attributes
change with the tides. So, how do we arrive at the reanimated fellow
you see before you? Our modern ideal emerges
in 18th-century Eastern Europe. With the dramatic increase
of vampire superstitions, stories of bloodsucking, shadowy creatures become nightly bedside terrors. And popular folklore, like the moroi among the Romani people and the lugat in Albania, provide the most common
vampire traits known today, such as vampires being undead and nocturnal and shape-shifting. You see, Eastern Europe
in the 18th century was a pretty grim place with many deaths occurring
from unknown diseases and plagues. Without medical explanations,
people searched for supernatural causes and found what looked like evidence
in the corpses of the victims. When villagers dug up bodies to discern the cause
of the mysterious deaths, they would often find the cadavers looking very much alive -- longer hair and fingernails, bloated bellies, and blood at the corners of mouths. (Laughter) Clearly, these people
were not really dead. Heh, they were vampires! And they had been leaving their graves to feast on the living. (Grunt) The terrified villagers
would quickly enact a ritual to kill the undead. The practices varied across the region, but usually included beheadings, burnings, and staking
the body to the coffin to prevent it from getting up. (Laughter) Grizzly stuff! But what the villagers interpreted
as unholy reanimation were actually normal symptoms of death. When a body decomposes,
the skin dehydrates, causing the hair
and fingernails to extend. Bacteria in the stomach creates gases that fill the belly, which force out blood
and matter through the mouth. Unfortunately, this science
was not yet known, so the villagers kept digging. In fact, so many bodies were dug up that the Empress of Austria sent her physician around
to disprove the vampire stories, and she even established a law
prohibiting grave tampering. Still, even after the vampire
hunts had died down, the stories of legends survived
in local superstition. This led to works of literature,
such as Polidori's "The Vampyre," the Gothic novel "Carmilla," and, most famously,
Bram Stoker's "Dracula." Although Stoker incorporated
historical material, like Elizabeth Báthory's
virgin blood baths and the brutal executions of Vlad Dracul, it was these local myths that inspired the main
elements of his story: the Transylvanian setting, using garlic to defend oneself, and the staking of the heart. While these attributes

**Transcript**:
Good evening! What's the matter? Are you afraid of vampires? He he, no need to worry, I'm not staying for dinner. (Laughter) I'm here to guide you
through a brief history of vampires, illustrating how our image has changed from a shambling corpse to the dapper gentleman
you see before you. Vampires are nearly as old as you humans. Stories about us, revenants, appear in cultures extending
as far back as prehistoric times. But we weren't called vampires back then and most of us did not look the way
we imagine vampires today. Ha, far from it! For example, the Mesopotamian Lamashtu was a creature with the head of a lion
and the body of the donkey, and the ancient Greek striges were simply described
as bloodthirsty birds. Others were even stranger. The Philippine manananggal
would sever her upper torso and sprout huge, bat-like wings to fly. The Malaysian penanggalan
was a flying female head with dangling entrails. (Laughter) And the Australian Yara-ma-yha-who was a little red guy with a big head, a large mouth, and bloodsuckers on his hands and feet. Oh, and let's not forget
the Caribbean's soucouyant, the West African obayifo, and the Mexican Tlahuelpuchi. (Laughter) Charming, aren't they? Though they may look vastly different, all of these beings have
one common characteristic: They sustain themselves by consuming
the life force of a living creature. This shared trait
is what defines a vampire -- all the other attributes
change with the tides. So, how do we arrive at the reanimated fellow
you see before you? Our modern ideal emerges
in 18th-century Eastern Europe. With the dramatic increase
of vampire superstitions, stories of bloodsucking, shadowy creatures become nightly bedside terrors. And popular folklore, like the moroi among the Romani people and the lugat in Albania, provide the most common
vampire traits known today, such as vampires being undead and nocturnal and shape-shifting. You see, Eastern Europe
in the 18th century was a pretty grim place with many deaths occurring
from unknown diseases and plagues. Without medical explanations,
people searched for supernatural causes and found what looked like evidence
in the corpses of the victims. When villagers dug up bodies to discern the cause
of the mysterious deaths, they would often find the cadavers looking very much alive -- longer hair and fingernails, bloated bellies, and blood at the corners of mouths. (Laughter) Clearly, these people
were not really dead. Heh, they were vampires! And they had been leaving their graves to feast on the living. (Grunt) The terrified villagers
would quickly enact a ritual to kill the undead. The practices varied across the region, but usually included beheadings, burnings, and staking
the body to the coffin to prevent it from getting up. (Laughter) Grizzly stuff! But what the villagers interpreted
as unholy reanimation were actually normal symptoms of death. When a body decomposes,
the skin dehydrates, causing the hair
and fingernails to extend. Bacteria in the stomach creates gases that fill the belly, which force out blood
and matter through the mouth. Unfortunately, this science
was not yet known, so the villagers kept digging. In fact, so many bodies were dug up that the Empress of Austria sent her physician around
to disprove the vampire stories, and she even established a law
prohibiting grave tampering. Still, even after the vampire
hunts had died down, the stories of legends survived
in local superstition. This led to works of literature,
such as Polidori's "The Vampyre," the Gothic novel "Carmilla," and, most famously,
Bram Stoker's "Dracula." Although Stoker incorporated
historical material, like Elizabeth Báthory's
virgin blood baths and the brutal executions of Vlad Dracul, it was these local myths that inspired the main
elements of his story: the Transylvanian setting, using garlic to defend oneself, and the staking of the heart. While these attributes
are certainly familiar to us, elements he invented himself
have also lasted over the years: fear of crucifixes, weakness in sunlight, and the vampire's inability

**Transcript**:
10,000 years ago, a deadly virus arose in northeastern Africa. The virus spread through the air, attacking the skin cells, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes of its victims. The unlucky infected developed fevers, vomiting, and rashes. 30% of infected people died during the second week of infection. Survivors bore scars and scabs for the rest of their lives. Smallpox had arrived. In 1350 B.C., the first smallpox epidemics hit during the Egypt-Hittite war. Egyptian prisoners spread smallpox to the Hittites, which killed their king and devastated his civilization. Insidiously, smallpox made its way around the world via Egyptian merchants, then through the Arab world with the Crusades, and all the way to the Americas with the Spanish and Portuguese conquests. Since then, it has killed billions of people with an estimated 300 to 500 million people killed in the 20th century alone. But smallpox is not unbeatable. In fact, the fall of smallpox started long before modern medicine. It began all the way back in 1022 A.D. According to a small book, called "The Correct Treatment of Small Pox," a Buddhist nun living in a famous mountain named O Mei Shan in the southern providence of Sichuan would grind up smallpox scabs and blow the powder into nostrils of healthy people. She did this after noticing that those who managed to survive smallpox never got it again, and her odd treatment worked. The procedure, called variolation, slowly evolved and by the 1700's, doctors were taking material from sores and putting them into healthy people through four or five scratches on the arm. This worked pretty well as inoculated people would not get reinfected, but it wasn't foolproof. Up to three percent of people would still die after being exposed to the puss. It wasn't until English physician Edward Jenner noticed something interesting about dairy maids that we got our modern solution. At age 13, while Jenner was apprentice to a country surgeon and apothecary in Sodbury, near Bristol, he heard a dairy maid say, "I shall never have smallpox, for I have had cowpox. I shall never have an ugly, pockmarked face." Cowpox is a skin disease that resembles smallpox and infects cows. Later on, as a physician, he realized that she was right, women who got cowpox didn't develop the deadly smallpox. Smallpox and cowpox viruses are from the same family. But when a virus infects an unfamiliar host, in this case cowpox infecting a human, it is less virulent, so Jenner decided to test whether the cowpox virus could be used to protect against smallpox. In May 1796, Jenner found a young dairy maid, Sarah Nelmes, who had fresh cowpox lesions on her hand and arm caught from the utters of a cow named Blossom. Using matter from her pustules, he inoculated James Phipps, the eight-year-old son of his gardener. After a few days of fever and discomfort, the boy seemed to recover. Two months later, Jenner inoculated the boy again, this time with matter from a fresh smallpox lesion. No disease developed, and Jenner concluded that protection was complete. His plan had worked. Jenner later used the cowpox virus in several other people and challenged them repeatedly with smallpox, proving that they were immune to the disease. With this procedure, Jenner invented the smallpox vaccination. Unlike variolation, which used actual smallpox virus to try to protect people, vaccination used the far less dangerous cowpox virus. The medical establishment, cautious then as now, deliberated at length over his findings before accepting them. But eventually vaccination was gradually accepted and variolation became prohibited
in England in 1840. After large vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the World Health Organization certified smallpox's eradication in 1979. Jenner is forever remembered as the father of immunology, but let's not forget the Buddhist nun, dairy maid Sarah Nelmes, 
and James Phipps, all heroes in this great adventure of vaccination who helped eradicate smallpox.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
10,000 years ago, a deadly virus arose in northeastern Africa. The virus spread through the air, attacking the skin cells, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes of its victims. The unlucky infected developed fevers, vomiting, and rashes. 30% of infected people died during the second week of infection. Survivors bore scars and scabs for the rest of their lives. Smallpox had arrived. In 1350 B.C., the first smallpox epidemics hit during the Egypt-Hittite war. Egyptian prisoners spread smallpox to the Hittites, which killed their king and devastated his civilization. Insidiously, smallpox made its way around the world via Egyptian merchants, then through the Arab world with the Crusades, and all the way to the Americas with the Spanish and Portuguese conquests. Since then, it has killed billions of people with an estimated 300 to 500 million people killed in the 20th century alone. But smallpox is not unbeatable. In fact, the fall of smallpox started long before modern medicine. It began all the way back in 1022 A.D. According to a small book, called "The Correct Treatment of Small Pox," a Buddhist nun living in a famous mountain named O Mei Shan in the southern providence of Sichuan would grind up smallpox scabs and blow the powder into nostrils of healthy people. She did this after noticing that those who managed to survive smallpox never got it again, and her odd treatment worked. The procedure, called variolation, slowly evolved and by the 1700's, doctors were taking material from sores and putting them into healthy people through four or five scratches on the arm. This worked pretty well as inoculated people would not get reinfected, but it wasn't foolproof. Up to three percent of people would still die after being exposed to the puss. It wasn't until English physician Edward Jenner noticed something interesting about dairy maids that we got our modern solution. At age 13, while Jenner was apprentice to a country surgeon and apothecary in Sodbury, near Bristol, he heard a dairy maid say, "I shall never have smallpox, for I have had cowpox. I shall never have an ugly, pockmarked face." Cowpox is a skin disease that resembles smallpox and infects cows. Later on, as a physician, he realized that she was right, women who got cowpox didn't develop the deadly smallpox. Smallpox and cowpox viruses are from the same family. But when a virus infects an unfamiliar host, in this case cowpox infecting a human, it is less virulent, so Jenner decided to test whether the cowpox virus could be used to protect against smallpox. In May 1796, Jenner found a young dairy maid, Sarah Nelmes, who had fresh cowpox lesions on her hand and arm caught from the utters of a cow named Blossom. Using matter from her pustules, he inoculated James Phipps, the eight-year-old son of his gardener. After a few days of fever and discomfort, the boy seemed to recover. Two months later, Jenner inoculated the boy again, this time with matter from a fresh smallpox lesion. No disease developed, and Jenner concluded that protection was complete. His plan had worked. Jenner later used the cowpox virus in several other people and challenged them repeatedly with smallpox, proving that they were immune to the disease. With this procedure, Jenner invented the smallpox vaccination. Unlike variolation, which used actual smallpox virus to try to protect people, vaccination used the far less dangerous cowpox virus. The medical establishment, cautious then as now, deliberated at length over his findings before accepting them. But eventually vaccination was gradually accepted and variolation became prohibited
in England in 1840. After large vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the World Health Organization certified smallpox's eradication in 1979. Jenner is forever remembered as the father of immunology, but let's not forget the Buddhist nun, dairy maid Sarah Nelmes, 
and James Phipps, all heroes in this great adventure of vaccination who helped eradicate smallpox.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Acids and bases are everywhere. They're used to make foods, soaps and detergents, fertilizers, explosives, dyes, plastics, pesticides, even paper. Our stomachs are very acidic. Our blood is slightly basic. Our proteins are made up of amino acids, and the letters in our genetic code, those As, Ts, Cs, and Gs, are all bases. You were probably taught how acids and bases behave on the molecular level. You were probably never taught that a long time ago, like ancient Greek ago, before anyone knew about atoms or molecules, acids and bases were defined by how they behaved. Acids tasted sour and corroded metal. Bases felt slippery and could somehow counteract acids. When molecules dissolved in water interact, they are exchanging two main currencies with their surroundings: protons, also known as hydrogen ions, and electrons. Depending on how a molecule is composed or shaped, it may be willing to donate or accept either protons or electrons with some other community member. And some molecules are far more aggressive than others when it comes to donating or accepting either currency. Remember that protons are positively charged and electrons are negatively charged. So, if a molecule is willing to give up a proton, that's not too different from it being willing to accept an electron -- either way it's becoming more negatively charged. Other molecules are willing to accept a proton or give up an electron. These are becoming more positively charged. Some substances are so aggressive about donating their protons that when they get a chance, all of the molecules in a sample will dump a proton, sometimes more than one, to the surrounding water molecules. We call these strong acids. Meanwhile, some compounds are so ready to accept a proton that they won't wait around, they'll just rip one off water, which usually has two protons but is generous enough to hang out with just one. We call these strong bases. Other acids and bases are not so strong. They may donate just a few of their protons to water or accept just a few protons from water, but most of their molecules stay exactly the same. If left alone in water, they'll reach some equilibrium point where maybe only one out of a hundred or one out of ten thousand of their molecules has exchanged currency with water. As you might guess, we label these acids and bases weak, but in the common sense of the word, they're not weak. The vinegar in your salad dressing that you can smell from across the room, that is a weak acid. The ammonia you spray on glass for a streak-free shine, that is a weak base. So, it doesn't take much to be an active player in the chemical economy. Most acid-base chemistry takes place in water, which can act as either an acid or a base, accepting deposits and enabling withdrawals like a 24-hour molecular ATM. And when a proton-deposit customer, that's an acid, and a proton-withdrawal customer, the base, shop at the same time, their net effect on water's account may cancel out, and we call this neutralization. Now, certain molecules can behave as acids or bases without water, but that's another story. Let's end by saluting water as the resilient and fair banker for acids and bases. It's always open for business, doesn't charge interest, and will never foreclose on your molecules, which is more than I can say for [bleep]. Waah-waah.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever daydreamed
about traveling through time, perhaps fast forward in the centuries
and seeing the distant future? Well, time travel is possible, and what's more, it's already been done. Meet Sergei Krikalev, the greatest time traveler
in human history. This Russian cosmonaut holds the record for the most amount of time
spent orbiting our planet, a total of 803 days,
9 hours, and 39 minutes. During his stay in space, he time traveled into his own future by 0.02 seconds. Traveling at 17,500 miles an hour, he experienced an effect
known as time dilation, and one day the same effect might make significant time travel
to the future commonplace. To see why moving faster through space
affects passage of time, we need to go back to the 1880s, when two American scientists, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley, were trying to measure the effect
of the Earth's movement around the Sun on the speed of light. When a beam of light was moving
in the same direction as the Earth, they expected the light to travel faster. And when the Earth was moving
in the opposite direction, they expected it to go slower. But they found something very curious. The speed of light remained the same
no matter what the Earth was doing. Two decades later,
Albert Einstein was thinking about the consequences
of that never-changing speed of light. And it was his conclusions, formulated in the theory
of special relativity, that opened the door
into the world of time travel. Imagine a man named Jack, standing in the middle
of a train carriage, traveling at a steady speed. Jack's bored and starts bouncing
a ball up and down. What would Jill, standing on the platform,
see through the window as the train whistles through? Well, between Jack dropping the ball
and catching it again, Jill would have seen him move
slightly further down the track, resulting in her seeing the ball
follow a triangular path. This means Jill sees the ball
travel further than Jack does in the same time period. And because speed
is distance divided by time, Jill actually sees the ball move faster. But what if Jack's bouncing ball
is replaced with two mirrors which bounce a beam of light between them? Jack still sees the beam dropping down and Jill still sees the light beam
travel a longer distance, except this time Jack and Jill
cannot disagree on the speed because the speed of light
remains the same no matter what. And if the speed is the same
while the distance is different, this means the time taken
will be different as well. Thus, time must tick at different rates
for people moving relative to each other. Imagine that Jack and Jill
have highly accurate watches that they synchronize
before Jack boards the train. During the experiment,
Jack and Jill would each see their own watch ticking normally. But if they meet up again later
to compare watches, less time would have
elapsed on Jack's watch, balancing the fact that Jill saw
the light move further. This idea may sound crazy, but like any good scientific theory, it can be tested. In the 1970s, scientists boarded a plane with some super-accurate atomic clocks that were synchronized
with some others left on the ground. After the plane had
flown around the world, the clocks on board
showed a different time from those left behind. Of course, at the speed
of trains and planes, the effect is minuscule. But the faster you go,
the more time dilates. For astronauts orbiting
the Earth for 800 days, it starts to add up. But what affects humans
also affects machines. Satellites of the global
positioning system are also hurdling around the Earth at thousands of miles an hour. So, time dilation kicks in here, too. In fact, their speed causes
the atomic clocks on board to disagree with clocks on the ground by seven millionths of a second daily. Left uncorrected, this would cause GPS to lose accuracy by a few kilometers each day. So, what does all this have
to do with time travel to the far, distant future? Well, the faster you go,
the greater the effect of time dilation. If you could travel really close to the speed of light, say 99.9999%, on a round-trip through space for what seemed to you like ten years, you'd actually return to Earth around the year 9000. Who knows what you'd see
when you returned?! Humanity merged with machines, extinct due to climate change
or asteroid impact, or inhabiting a permanent colony on Mars. But the trouble is, getting heavy things like people,
not to mention space ships, up to such speeds requires
unimaginable amounts of energy. It already takes enormous
particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider to accelerate tiny subatomic particles
to close to light speed. But one day, if we can develop the tools
to accelerate ourselves to similar speeds, then we may regularly send time travelers into the future, bringing with them tales
of a long, forgotten past.

known as time dilation, and one day the same effect might make significant time travel
to the future commonplace. To see why moving faster through space
affects passage of time, we need to go back to the 1880s, when two American scientists, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley, were trying to measure the effect
of the Earth's movement around the Sun on the speed of light. When a beam of light was moving
in the same direction as the Earth, they expected the light to travel faster. And when the Earth was moving
in the opposite direction, they expected it to go slower. But they found something very curious. The speed of light remained the same
no matter what the Earth was doing. Two decades later,
Albert Einstein was thinking about the consequences
of that never-changing speed of light. And it was his conclusions, formulated in the theory
of special relativity, that opened the door
into the world of time travel. Imagine a man named Jack, standing in the middle
of a train carriage, traveling at a steady speed. Jack's bored and starts bouncing
a ball up and down. What would Jill, standing on the platform,
see through the window as the train whistles through? Well, between Jack dropping the ball
and catching it again, Jill would have seen him move
slightly further down the track, resulting in her seeing the ball
follow a triangular path. This means Jill sees the ball
travel further than Jack does in the same time period. And because speed
is distance divided by time, Jill actually sees the ball move faster. But what if Jack's bouncing ball
is replaced with two mirrors which bounce a beam of light between them? Jack still sees the beam dropping down and Jill still sees the light beam
travel a longer distance, except this time Jack and Jill
cannot disagree on the speed because the speed of light
remains the same no matter what. And if the speed is the same
while the distance is different, this means the time taken
will be different as well. Thus, time must tick at different rates
for people moving relative to each other. Imagine that Jack and Jill
have highly accurate watches that they synchronize
before Jack boards the train. During the experiment,
Jack and Jill would each see their own watch ticking normally. But if they meet up again later
to compare watches, less time would have
elapsed on Jack's watch, balancing the fact that Jill saw
the light move further. This idea may sound crazy, but like any good scientific theory, it can be tested. In the 1970s, scientists boarded a plane with some super-accurate atomic clocks that were synchronized
with some others left on the ground. After the plane had
flown around the world, the clocks on board
showed a different time from those left behind. Of course, at the speed
of trains and planes, the effect is minuscule. But the faster you go,
the more time dilates. For astronauts orbiting
the Earth for 800 days, it starts to add up. But what affects humans
also affects machines. Satellites of the global
positioning system are also hurdling around the Earth at thousands of miles an hour. So, time dilation kicks in here, too. In fact, their speed causes
the atomic clocks on board to disagree with clocks on the ground by seven millionths of a second daily. Left uncorrected, this would cause GPS to lose accuracy by a few kilometers each day. So, what does all this have
to do with time travel to the far, distant future? Well, the faster you go,
the greater the effect of time dilation. If you could travel really close to the speed of light, say 99.9999%, on a round-trip through space for what seemed to you like ten years, you'd actually return to Earth around the year 9000. Who knows what you'd see
when you returned?! Humanity merged with machines, extinct due to climate change
or asteroid impact, or inhabiting a permanent colony on Mars. But the trouble is, getting heavy things like people,
not to mention space ships, up to such speeds requires
unimaginable amounts of energy. It already takes enormous
particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider to accelerate tiny subatomic particles
to close to light speed. But one day, if we can develop the tools
to accelerate ourselves to similar speeds, then we may regularly send time travelers into the future, bringing with them tales
of a long, forgotten past.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers uh that work together on a remarkable film project for the last four years um and along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization so I want to show you clip of the film now hopefully it won't stutter um and uh if we did our jobs well you won't know that we uh were even involved I don't know how it's possible but you seem to have more higher what if I told you that I wasn't getting older but I was getting younger everybody [Music] else I was born with some form of disease what kind of disease I was born old I'm sorry no need to be there's nothing wrong with old [Music] age are you sick I heard mama and tizzy whisper and they said I was going to die soon but maybe not you're different than anybody I've ever met there were many changes some you could see some you couldn't hair has started growing in all sorts of places along with other things I felt pretty good considering that was a clip from The Curious Case of Benjamin Button many you maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story um but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film The main character Benjamin Button who's played by Brad Pit is completely computer generated from the neck up now there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimposed over over another actor's body we've created a completely digital human head so I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project this is based on an F Scott Fitzgerald short story um it's about a man who's born old and lives his life In Reverse um now this movie's floated around Hollywood for well over half a century uh we first got involved with the project in the early 90s with Ron Howard as the Director we took a lot of meetings and uh we seriously considered it and at the time we had to throw in the towel uh it was deemed impossible it was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man Aging in back backwards the the human form and particularly the human head has been considered the Holy Grail of our industry um the project came back to us about a decade later and this time with a director named David Fincher now Fincher is is an interesting guy um David is fearless of technology and he is absolutely tenacious and David won't take no and David believed like we do uh in the visual effects industry that anything is possible as long as you have enough time resources and of course money um and so David had an interesting take on the film and he threw a challenge at us he wanted the film to be or the main character of the film to be played from the Cradle to the Grave by one actor it happened to be this guy we went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery uh with Dave and we ruled out of course swapping actors that was one idea that we would have different actors we would hand off from actor to actor and we even ruled out the idea of using makeup we we realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up um particularly in closeup and makeup is an additive process you have to build the face up and David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's face to bring the Aging to this character uh he needed to be very sympathetic character um so we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of Benjamin at different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a computer generated version of Brad's head aged to appear as Benjamin and attach that to the body of the real actor sounded great of course this was the Holy Grail of our our industry and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help uh either because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store you know we see his face constantly so there really was no tolerable margin of error there were two Studios involved uh Warner Brothers and paramont and they both believed this would make an amazing film of course but it was a very high-risk proposition there was lots of money and reputations at stake and um we believed that we had a very solid methodology that might work uh but despite our verbal assurances they wanted some proof um and so in 2004 they commissioned us to do a a screen test of Benjamin and uh we did it in about five weeks uh but we used lots of cheats and shortcuts we basically put something together to get through the meeting and I'll roll that for you now this was the first test for Benjamin Button and in here you can see it's a that's a computer generated head it's pretty good attached to the body of another actor um and it worked and it gave the studio great relief after many years of starts and stops on this project and and making that tough decision uh they finally decided to Greenlight the movie and I can remember actually when I got the phone call to congratulate us that the the movie was a go I I actually threw up uh um you know this is this is some tough stuff um so we we started to have early team meetings and and we got everybody together and um it was really more like therapy in the beginning uh convincing other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this we had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character and it's not a special effects film it has to be a man um we we really felt like we were a in a kind of like a 12-step program and of course you know the first step is admit you've got a problem so um we had a big problem we didn't know how we were going to do this um and uh but we did know one thing being from the visual effects industry we with David believed that we now had enough time enough resource ources and God we hoped we had enough money um and we had enough passion to will the process season technology into existence so when you're faced with something like that of course you got to break it down you take the big problem you break it down into smaller pieces and you can start to attack that so we had three main areas that we had to focus on we needed to make Brad look a lot older we needed to age him 45 years or so um and we also needed to make sure that um we could take Brad's uh idiosyncrasies his little ticks the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that trans through our process so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen and we also needed to create um a character that could hold up under really all conditions uh he needed to be able to walk in broad daylight at night time under candl light he had to hold an extreme closeup he had to deliver dialogue he had to be able to run he had to be able to sweat he had to be able to take a bath to cry he even had to throw up not all at the same time but he had to you know do all of those those things and the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie we did about 325 shots so we needed A system that would allow Benjamin to be able to do everything a human being can do and we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state-of-the-art of technology in about 2004 and where we needed it to be so we focused on motion capture now I'm sure many of you have seen motion capture um and and the state-of-the-art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture I'll show you an example here it's basically the idea of you wear a leotard and they put some reflective markers on your body and instead of using cameras there's infrared sensors around of volume and those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional position of those markers in real time and then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers and apply them to a computer generated character so you can see the uh computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the uh as the dancers so we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process and as you can see it gives you a a pretty crappy performance um that's not terribly compelling and what we realized was that what we needed was the information what was going on between the markers we needed the the subtleties of the skin we needed to see skin moving over muscle over bone needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things so our first big Revelation was to completely abort and walk away from the technology of the day the status quo the state-of-the-art and so we aborted using motion capture and we were now well out of our comfort zone and un Uncharted Territory so we were left with this idea that we ended up kind of calling uh technology stew we started to look out in other fields and the idea was that we were going to find nuggets or gems of technology that perhaps come from other Industries like Medical Imaging or the the video game space and and reappropriate them and we had to create kind of a a sauce and the sauce was a code in software that we written to allow these disperate pieces of Technologies to come together and work as one and so initially we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named Dr Paul mman in the early '70s and he believed uh that he could in fact catalog the human face and he came up with his idea of facial action coding system he believed that there are basically 70 basic poses or shapes of the human face and that um from those basic poses or shapes of the face they can be combined to create infinite possibilities of everything the human face is capable of doing and of course um these transcend age race culture gender and so this was uh became kind of the foundation of our research as we went forward and then we came across some remarkable technology called contour and here you can see a subject having phosphorescent makeup stippled on her face and now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture as opposed to a marker capture the subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras and those cameras can frame by frame reconstruct geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment right so effectively you get uh 3D data in real time of the subject and if you look in a comparison on the left uh we we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us so clearly we were in a substantially better place for this but these were the early days of this technology and it wasn't really proven yet but you know we measure uh complexity and and Fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count and so um on the left we were seeing 100,000 polygons we could go up into the millions of polygons it seemed to be infinite this is when we had our our aha this was the Breakthrough this is when like okay we're going to be okay this is actually going to work and um the AHA was what if we could take Brad Pit and we could put Brad uh in this device um and use this Contour process and we could stipple on the phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights and we could in fact scan him in real time performing eckman's fax poses right so effectively we ended up with a 3D database of Everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing so from there we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of of his face so we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes a complete database of all possibilities that his face is capable of of uh of doing now that's great except we had him at age 44 we need to put another 40 years on him at this point we brought in Rick Baker and Rick's one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry and uh and we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu suji and Kazu suuji is one of the great photo real sculptors of our time and we commissioned them to make a uh a maette or a bust of of Benjamin and so in the spirit of the great unveiling I had to do this I had to I had to unveil something so this is Ben 80 right now with uh um we created three of these there's Ben 80 there's Ben 70 there's Ben 60 and this really became the uh the template of moving forward now this was made from a life cast of Brad so in fact um anatomically it is correct the eyes the jaw the teeth everything is imperfect alignment with what the real guy has we have these mettes scanned into the computer at at very high RIS resolution an enormous polygonal count um and so now we had uh three age increments of Benjamin in the computer but we needed to get um a database of him doing more than that so we went through this process then called retargeting so this is Brad doing one of the emman fact poses and here's the resulting data that comes from that or the model that comes from that and retargeting is the process of transposing that data onto another model and because the Life cast or the bust the maette of Benjamin was made from Brad we could transpose the data of Brad at 44 onto Brad at 87 so now we had a 3D database of Everything Brad Pitt's face can do at age ' 87 in his 70s and then in his 60s next we had to go into the shooting process so while that's going on we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world and we shot our body actors and we shot them wearing blue hoods so these are the gentlemen who played Benjamin and the blue hoods helped us for two things one we could easily erase their heads and we also put tracking markers on their heads so so in fact we could recreate the camera motion and the lens Optics from the set but now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin and so we edited the footage that was shot on the location with the the rest of the cast and the uh uh the body actors and um about 6 months later we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles and he watched on the screen and uh his job then was to become Benjamin and so we looped the scenes he watched again and again we encouraged him to improvise and he took Benjamin and interesting unusual places that we didn't think he was going to go we shot him with four HD cameras so we get multiple views of him and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast and from there we went into a process called image analysis and so here you can see again the chosen take and we are seeing now that data being transposed onto Ben 877 and so what's interesting about this is we use something called image analysis which is taking timings from different components of benjam 's face so we could choose say his left eyebrow and the software would tell us that well in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here it concludes moving in frame 32 and so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from and then the sauce I talked about with our technology stew that secret sauce um was effectively software that allowed us to match the performance footage of Brad in liveaction uh with our our database of aged Benjamin the the fact shapes that we had and on a frame by frame basis we could actually reconstruct a 3D head that exactly matched the performance of Brad so this was how the finish shot appeared in the film and here you can see the body actor and then this is what we called the dead head no reference to Jerry Garcia and uh then here's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance and then again the final shot it was a long process um so thank you um next next section here I'm going to just blast through this because we could do a whole Ted Talk on the next you know several slides um we had to create a lighting system so really a big part of our proc say we're creating a lighting environment for every single location that Benjamin had to appear so that um we could put Ben's head into any scene and would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors in the real world we also had to create an eye system we found the old adage you know the eyes of the window to the soul is absolutely true so the goal here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes and if you could feel the warmth and feel the humanity and feel his intent coming through the eyes then we would succeed so we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years we also had to create a mouth system we worked from Dental molds of Brad we had to age the teeth over time we also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words so there's a whole system in software written to articulate the tongue we had one person voted of the tongue for about 9 months he was uh he was very popular skin displacement another big deal the skin had to be absolutely accurate and he's also in an old age home he's in a nursing home around other old people so he had to look exactly the same as the others so lots of work on skin deformation you can see in some of these cases it works in some cases it looks bad this is a very very very early test in our process so effectively we created a digital puppet that Brad Pit could operate with his own face there were no animators necessary to come in and interpret beh behavior um or uh enhance his performance there was something we encountered though that we end up kind of calling uh the digital Botox effect so as things kind of went through this process it did kind of um uh Fincher would always say it sand blasts the edges off of the performance and one thing that our our our process and the technology uh couldn't do is it couldn't understand intent the intent of the actor so it sees A Smile as a smile it doesn't recognize an ironic smile or a a happy smile or frustrated smile so it did take humans to kind of push it one way or the other um but we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology emotion capture as opposed to just motion capture so take take another look well I heard mama and tizzy whisper and they said I was going to die soon but maybe not well I heard mama and tizzy Whispering they said I was going to die soon but maybe not well I heard mama and tizzy whis and they said I was going to die soon but maybe not that's how to create a digital human in 18 minutes U thank [Music] you just a couple of uh just quick factoids it it really took uh 155 people over two years um and we didn't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all digital haircut but uh that is Benjamin thank you [Applause] incredible

that so we had three main areas that we had to focus on we needed to make Brad look a lot older we needed to age him 45 years or so um and we also needed to make sure that um we could take Brad's uh idiosyncrasies his little ticks the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that trans through our process so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen and we also needed to create um a character that could hold up under really all conditions uh he needed to be able to walk in broad daylight at night time under candl light he had to hold an extreme closeup he had to deliver dialogue he had to be able to run he had to be able to sweat he had to be able to take a bath to cry he even had to throw up not all at the same time but he had to you know do all of those those things and the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie we did about 325 shots so we needed A system that would allow Benjamin to be able to do everything a human being can do and we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state-of-the-art of technology in about 2004 and where we needed it to be so we focused on motion capture now I'm sure many of you have seen motion capture um and and the state-of-the-art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture I'll show you an example here it's basically the idea of you wear a leotard and they put some reflective markers on your body and instead of using cameras there's infrared sensors around of volume and those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional position of those markers in real time and then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers and apply them to a computer generated character so you can see the uh computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the uh as the dancers so we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process and as you can see it gives you a a pretty crappy performance um that's not terribly compelling and what we realized was that what we needed was the information what was going on between the markers we needed the the subtleties of the skin we needed to see skin moving over muscle over bone needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things so our first big Revelation was to completely abort and walk away from the technology of the day the status quo the state-of-the-art and so we aborted using motion capture and we were now well out of our comfort zone and un Uncharted Territory so we were left with this idea that we ended up kind of calling uh technology stew we started to look out in other fields and the idea was that we were going to find nuggets or gems of technology that perhaps come from other Industries like Medical Imaging or the the video game space and and reappropriate them and we had to create kind of a a sauce and the sauce was a code in software that we written to allow these disperate pieces of Technologies to come together and work as one and so initially we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named Dr Paul mman in the early '70s and he believed uh that he could in fact catalog the human face and he came up with his idea of facial action coding system he believed that there are basically 70 basic poses or shapes of the human face and that um from those basic poses or shapes of the face they can be combined to create infinite possibilities of everything the human face is capable of doing and of course um these transcend age race culture gender and so this was uh became kind of the foundation of our research as we went forward and then we came across some remarkable technology called contour and here you can see a subject having phosphorescent makeup stippled on her face and now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture as opposed to a marker capture the subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras and those cameras can frame by frame reconstruct geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment right so effectively you get uh 3D data in real time of the subject and if you look in a comparison on the left uh we we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us so clearly we were in a substantially better place for this but these were the early days of this technology and it wasn't really proven yet but you know we measure uh complexity and and Fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count and so um on the left we were seeing 100,000 polygons we could go up into the millions of polygons it seemed to be infinite this is when we had our our aha this was the Breakthrough this is when like okay we're going to be okay this is actually going to work and um the AHA was what if we could take Brad Pit and we could put Brad uh in this device um and use this Contour process and we could stipple on the phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights and we could in fact scan him in real time performing eckman's fax poses right so effectively we ended up with a 3D database of Everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing so from there we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of of his face so we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes a complete database of all possibilities that his face is capable of of uh of doing now that's great except we had him at age 44 we need to put another 40 years on him at this point we brought in Rick Baker and Rick's one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry and uh and we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu suji and Kazu suuji is one of the great photo real sculptors of our time and we commissioned them to make a uh a maette or a bust of of Benjamin and so in the spirit of the great unveiling I had to do this I had to I had to unveil something so this is Ben 80 right now with uh um we created three of these there's Ben 80 there's Ben 70 there's Ben 60 and this really became the uh the template of moving forward now this was made from a life cast of Brad so in fact um anatomically it is correct the eyes the jaw the teeth everything is imperfect alignment with what the real guy has we have these mettes scanned into the computer at at very high RIS resolution an enormous polygonal count um and so now we had uh three age increments of Benjamin in the computer but we needed to get um a database of him doing more than that so we went through this process then called retargeting so this is Brad doing one of the emman fact poses and here's the resulting data that comes from that or the model that comes from that and retargeting is the process of transposing that data onto another model and because the Life cast or the bust the maette of Benjamin was made from Brad we could transpose the data of Brad at 44 onto Brad at 87 so now we had a 3D database of Everything Brad Pitt's face can do at age ' 87 in his 70s and then in his 60s next we had to go into the shooting process so while that's going on we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world and we shot our body actors and we shot them wearing blue hoods so these are the gentlemen who played Benjamin and the blue hoods helped us for two things one we could easily erase their heads and we also put tracking markers on their heads so so in fact we could recreate the camera motion and the lens Optics from the set but now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin and so we edited the footage that was shot on the location with the the rest of the cast and the uh uh the body actors and um about 6 months later we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles and he watched on the screen and uh his job then was to become Benjamin and so we looped the scenes he watched again and again we encouraged him to improvise and he took Benjamin and interesting unusual places that we didn't think he was going to go we shot him with four HD cameras so we get multiple views of him and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast and from there we went into a process called image analysis and so here you can see again the chosen take and we are seeing now that data being transposed onto Ben 877 and so what's interesting about this is we use something called image analysis which is taking timings from different components of benjam 's face so we could choose say his left eyebrow and the software would tell us that well in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here it concludes moving in frame 32 and so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from and then the sauce I talked about with our technology stew that secret sauce um was effectively software that allowed us to match the performance footage of Brad in liveaction uh with our our database of aged Benjamin the the fact shapes that we had and on a frame by frame basis we could actually reconstruct a 3D head that exactly matched the performance of Brad so this was how the finish shot appeared in the film and here you can see the body actor and then this is what we called the dead head no reference to Jerry Garcia and uh then here's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance and then again the final shot it was a long process um so thank you um next next section here I'm going to just blast through this because we could do a whole Ted Talk on the next you know several slides um we had to create a lighting system so really a big part of our proc say we're creating a lighting environment for every single location that Benjamin had to appear so that um we could put Ben's head into any scene and would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors in the real world we also had to create an eye system we found the old adage you know the eyes of the window to the soul is absolutely true so the goal here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes and if you could feel the warmth and feel the humanity and feel his intent coming through the eyes then we would succeed so we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years we also had to create a mouth system we worked from Dental molds of Brad we had to age the teeth over time we also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words so there's a whole system in software written to articulate the tongue we had one person voted of the tongue for about 9 months he was uh he was very popular skin displacement another big deal the skin had to be absolutely accurate and he's also in an old age home he's in a nursing home around other old people so he had to look exactly the same as the others so lots of work on skin deformation you can see in some of these cases it works in some cases it looks bad this is a very very very early test in our process so effectively we created a digital puppet that Brad Pit could operate with his own face there were no animators necessary to come in and interpret beh behavior um or uh enhance his performance there was something we encountered though that we end up kind of calling uh the digital Botox effect so as things kind of went through this process it did kind of um uh Fincher would always say it sand blasts the edges off of the performance and one thing that our our our process and the technology uh couldn't do is it couldn't understand intent the intent of the actor so it sees A Smile as a smile it doesn't recognize an ironic smile or a a happy smile or frustrated smile so it did take humans to kind of push it one way or the other um but we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology emotion capture as opposed to just motion capture so take take another look well I heard mama and tizzy whisper and they said I was going to die soon but maybe not well I heard mama and tizzy Whispering they said I was going to die soon but maybe not well I heard mama and tizzy whis and they said I was going to die soon but maybe not that's how to create a digital human in 18 minutes U thank [Music] you just a couple of uh just quick factoids it it really took uh 155 people over two years um and we didn't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all digital haircut but uh that is Benjamin thank you [Applause] incredible

**Transcript**:
I want to start by asking you to think back to when you were a kid playing with blocks as you figured out how to reach out and grasp pick them up and move them around you're actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us so as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects along with my adviser Patty and my collaborator Jeevan kallana thei I started to wonder what if when we use a computer instead of having this one mouse cursor that it was like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically arranging it the way we wanted this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer by building SIF tables in a nutshell acceptable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie they're able to be moved around by hand they can sense each other they can sense their motion and they have a screen and a wireless radio most importantly their physical select the blocks you can move them just by reaching out and grasping and the septa bowls are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information and as these tools become more physical more aware of their motion aware of each other and aware of the nuance of how we move them we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles so I'm going to start with some simple examples this system was configured to show video and if I tilt it in one direction he'll roll the video this way if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards and these interactive portraits are aware of each other so if I put them next to each other they get interested if they get surrounded they notice that - you might get a little flustered and they can also sense their motion and tilt so one of the interesting implications on interaction we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid so in this case we've got three septa bowls configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one where they get mixed if we overshoot we can pour a little bit back there are also some neat possibilities for education like language math and logic games so you want to give people the ability to try things quickly and view the results immediately so here I'm this is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and boggle basically in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each sip table and as you try to make words it checks against the dictionary then after about 30 seconds it reshuffles and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try thank you so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab and I managed to get them to try it out and shoot a video they really loved it and one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions all I have to say is make words and they know exactly what to do so here's another few people trying it out that's our youngest beta tester down there on the right turns out all he wanted to do was to stack the SIF tables up so to him there were just blocks now this is an interactive cartoon application and we wanted to build a learning tool for for language learners and this is Felix actually and he can bring new characters into the scene just by lifting the SIP tools off the table that have that character shown on them here he's bringing the Sun out the Sun is rising now he's brought a tractor into the scene the orange tractor so by shaking the SIP Sable's and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact inventing his own narrative it's an open-ended story and he gets to decide how it unfolds so the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we've built recently in which sift Able's act as sounds like lead bass and drums each of these has four different variations you get to choose which one you want to use and you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want and you inject it by just bumping up the sound Cybil against a sequence if table there are effects that you can control live like reverb and filter you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it and then overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence so let's have a look start by putting a lead into two sequence if tables arrange them into a series extend it add a little more lead now I put a bassline in now I'll put some percussion in and now I'll attach the filter to the drum so I can control the effect live I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo to 1 one way or the other and now I'll attach the filter to the base for some more expression I can rearrange the sequence while it plays I don't have to plan it out in advance but I can improvise changing it making it longer or shorter as I go and now finally I can fade the whole sequence out using the volume shift of all tilted to the left thank you so as you can see my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work and today I had time to show you one point in this new design space and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory so the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms thank you very much I look forward to talking with all of you

Mysteries of vernacular: Ukulele, a small, four-stringed guitar. Oddly enough, the word ukulele, in its native Hawaiian, literally translates to jumping flea. Even more surprising, the instrument itself did not originate in Hawaii. So, how did a Hawaiian word come to describe a non-Hawaiian instrument? Back in the late 1800s, King Kalākaua was the last reigning king of the kingdom of Hawaii. He was nicknamed "The Merry Monarch" because of his joy for life and, in particular, his love of music. In the King's court, there was a former British army officer named Edward Purvis. Though a small man, he was quite lively, and his nickname was "Jumping Flea," "Ukulele" in Hawaiian. Like the King, he was a great lover of music. In 1879, a group of Portuguese immigrants arrived on the islands of Hawaii, bringing with them a small, four-stringed guitar known as a braguinha. Purvis was immediately taken with the instrument and helped spread its popularity throughout the King's court. As the story goes, it was not long before his nickname, Ukulele, jumped from the man to his favorite instrument. As demand grew, several Portuguese families began to manufacture the minuscule guitar on the islands, making small modifications until it became the same ukulele we recognize today.

**Transcript**:
What is the shape of a molecule? Well, a molecule is mostly empty space. Almost all of its mass is concentrated in the extremely dense nuclei of its atoms. And its electrons, which determine how the atoms are bonded to each other, are more like clouds of negative charge than individual, discrete particles. So, a molecule doesn't have a shape in the same way that, for example, a statue has a shape. But for every molecule, there's at least one way to arrange the nuclei and electrons so as to maximize the attraction of opposite charges and minimize the repulsion of like charges. Now, let's assume that the only electrons that matter to a molecule's shape are the outermost ones from each participating atom. And let's also assume that the electron clouds in between atoms, in other words, a molecule's bonds, are shaped kind of like sausages. Remember that nuclei are positively charged and electrons are negatively charged, and if all of a molecule's nuclei were bunched up together or all of its electrons were bunched up together, they would just repel each other and fly apart, and that doesn't help anyone. In 1776, Alessandro Volta, decades before he would eventually invent batteries, discovered methane. Now, the chemical formula of methane is CH4. And this formula tells us that every molecule of methane is made up of one carbon and four hydrogen atoms, but it doesn't tell us what's bonded to what or how they atoms are arranged in 3D space. From their electron configurations, we know that carbon can bond with up to four other atoms and that each hydrogen can only bond with one other atom. So, we can guess that the carbon should be the central atom bonded to all the hydrogens. Now, each bond represents the sharing of two electrons and we draw each shared pair of electrons as a line. So, now we have a flat representation of this molecule, but how would it look in three dimensions? We can reasonably say that because each of these bonds is a region of negative electric charge and like charges repel each other, the most favorable configuration of atoms would maximize the distance between bonds. And to get all the bonds as far away from each other as possible, the optimal shape is this. This is called a tetrahedron. Now, depending on the different atoms involved, you can actually get lots of different shapes. Ammonia, or NH3, is shaped like a pyramid. Carbon dioxide, or CO2, is a straight line. Water, H2O, is bent like your elbow would be bent. And chlorine trifluoride, or ClF3, is shaped like the letter T. Remember that what we've been doing here is expanding on our model of atoms and electrons to build up to 3D shapes. We'd have to do experiments to figure out if these molecules actually do have the shapes we predict. Spoiler alert: most of the do, but some of them don't. Now, shapes get more complicated as you increase the number of atoms. All the examples we just talked about had one obviously central atom, but most molecules, from relatively small pharmaceuticals all the way up to long polymers like DNA or proteins, don't. The key thing to remember is that bonded atoms will arrange themselves to maximize the attraction between opposite charges and minimize the repulsion between like charges. Some molecules even have two or more stable arrangements of atoms, and we can actually get really cool chemistry from the switches between those configurations, even when the composition of that molecule, that's to say the number and identity of its atoms, has not changed at all.

**Transcript**:
You probably know that all stuff
is made up of atoms and that an atom is a really, really, really,
really tiny particle. Every atom has a core, which is made up of at least one positively charged particle called a proton, and in most cases, some number of neutral
particles called neutrons. That core is surrounded by negatively charged
particles called electrons. The identity of an atom is determined only by the number
of protons in its nucleus. Hydrogen is hydrogen because it
has just one proton, carbon is carbon because it has six, gold is gold because it has 79, and so on. Indulge me in a momentary tangent. How do we know about atomic structure? We can't see protons,
neutrons, or electrons. So, we do a bunch of experiments and develop a model
for what we think is there. Then we do some more experiments and see if they agree with the model. If they do, great. If they don't, it might
be time for a new model. We've had lots of very
different models for atoms since Democritus in 400 BC, and there will almost certainly be many more to come. Okay, tangent over. The cores of atoms tend to stick together, but electrons are free to move, and this is why chemists love electrons. If we could marry them, we probably would. But electrons are weird. They appear to behave either as particles, like little baseballs, or as waves, like water waves, depending on the experiment
that we perform. One of the weirdest things about electrons is that we can't exactly
say where they are. It's not that we don't have the equipment, it's that this uncertainty is part of our model of the electron. So, we can't pinpoint them, fine. But we can say
there's a certain probability of finding an electron in a given space around the nucleus. And that means that we can
ask the following question: If we drew a shape around the nucleus such that we would be 95% sure of finding a given electron
within that shape, what would it look like? Here are a few of these shapes. Chemists call them orbitals, and what each one looks like depends on, among other things, how much energy it has. The more energy an orbital has, the farther most of its density is from the nucleus. By they way, why did we pick 95% and not 100%? Well, that's another quirk of our model of the electron. Past a certain distance from the nucleus, the probability of finding an electron starts to decrease more or less exponentially, which means that while it
will approach zero, it'll never actually hit zero. So, in every atom, there is some small,
but non-zero, probability that for a very, very
short period of time, one of its electrons is at the other end of the known universe. But mostly electrons stay
close to their nucleus as clouds of negative charged density that shift and move with time. How electrons from one atom interact with electrons from another determines almost everything. Atoms can give up their electrons, surrendering them to other atoms, or they can share electrons. And the dynamics of this social network are what make chemistry interesting. From plain old rocks to the beautiful complexity of life, the nature of everything we see, hear, smell, taste, touch, and even feel is determined at the atomic level.

**Transcript**:
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation sharing some of the problems and Warren Buffett had recommended I do that being honest about what was going well what wasn't and making it kind of an annual thing a goal I had There was to draw more people in to work on those problems because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally that is the market does not drive the scientists the communicators the thinkers the government's to do the right things and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw their people in can we make as much progress as we need to so this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand but before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist any top problem I think it it can be solved and part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past over the last century average lifespan has more than doubled another statistic perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths as recently as nineteen sixty 110 million children were born and 20 million of those died before the age of five five years ago a hundred and thirty five million children were born so more and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five so that's a factor of two reduction in the child to death rate it's a phenomenal things I mean each one of those lives matters a lot and the key reason we were able to do it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs vaccines that were used more widely for example measles was 4 million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000 so we really can make changes the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 mm in half again and I think that's doable in well under 20 years why well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths diarrhea pneumonia and malaria and so that brings us to the the first problem that all all raised this morning which is how do we stop a disease a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitoes what's the history of this disease it's been a severe disease for thousands of years in fact we look at the genetic code it's the only disease we can see the people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths that's actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s so it was absolutely gigantic and the disease was all over the world terrible disease it was in the United States it was in Europe people didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitoes so it was everywhere and two tools helped bring the death breakdown one was killing the mosquitoes with DDT and the other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivatives and so that's why the death rate did come down now ironically what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones which is where all the rich countries are so we can see 1900s everywhere 1945 still most places 1970 the US and most of Europe have gotten rid of it 1990 you've gotten more Stu northern areas and then more recently you can see it's just around the equator and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poor countries it doesn't get much investment for example there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria now baldness is it's terrible and rich men are afflicted and so that's why that priority has been set but malaria they even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because there's just it holds things back so much now malaria of course transmitted by mosquitoes I brought some here so you could experience this we'll let let those roam around the auditorium a little bit there there's no reason only poor people should have have the experience not those mosquitoes are not not infected but so we've come up with a few new things we've got bed nets and bed nets are a great tool what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night and so the mosquitoes that bite late at night I can't get at them and when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50% and that's happened now in a number of countries it's great to see but we have to be careful because malaria the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves so every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective and so you end up with two choices if you go into a country with the right tools in the right way and you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication and that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking or if you go in kind of half-heartedly for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again and the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention now we're on the upswing bed net funding is up there's new drug discovery going on our foundation is back to vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months and that should save over two-thirds of lives if it's effective and so we're going to have these new tools but that alone doesn't give us the roadmap because the roadmap to get rid of this disease involves many things it involves communicators to keep the funding high to keep the visibility high to tell the success stories it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just 70% of people to use the bed nets but 90% we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to monte-carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise we need rich world governments to be very generous in in providing aid for these things and so as these elements come together I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria well now let me turn to a second question a fairly different question but I'd say equally important and this is how do you make a teacher great now seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on and that we'd understand very well and the answer is really that we don't let's start with why this is important well all of us here all bat had some great teachers we all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today part of the reason we're successful I can say that even though I'm a college dropout I had great teachers and in fact in the United States the teaching system has worked fairly well there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places so the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education and those top 20 percent have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top twenty percent and they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u.s. at the forefront now the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting not only is that been weak it's getting weaker and if you look at the economy it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education and so we have to change this we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays in the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education like Science and Mathematics when I first learned the statistics I was pretty how bad things are over 30% of kids never finish high school and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate is the number who started in senior year and and then compared it to the number of the finished senior year because they were tracking where the kids were before that but most of the dropouts had taken place before that so they had to raise the state of dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over 30 percent for minority kids it's over 50 percent and even if you graduate from high school if you're low income you have less than a 25% chance of ever completing a college degree if you're low income in the United States you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree and that you know doesn't seem entirely fair so how do you make education better our foundation for the last nine years is invested in this there's many people working on it we've worked on small schools we funded scholarships we've done things in libraries a lot of these things had a good effect but the more we looked at it the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing and so we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between say the top quartile the very best and the bottom quartile how much variation is there within a school or between schools and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable a top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over 10% in a single year what does that mean well that means that the entire us for two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between US and Asia would go away and within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away so it's simple all you need is those top quartile teachers and so you'd say well wow that's good we should reward those people we should retain those people we should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people but I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today what are the characteristics of this top quartile what do they they look like you might think well these must be very senior teachers and the answer is no once somebody is taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter the variation is very very small you might think well these are people with master's degrees they've gone back and they've gotten their masters education this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality that bottom thing which says there's no effect at all is a master's degree now the way the P system works is there's two things are rewarded one is seniority because your pay goes up and you vest in your pension and the second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree but in no ways associated with being a better teacher Teach for America slight effect for math teachers majoring in math is a measurable effect but overwhelmingly it's your past performance there are some people who are very good at this and we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in to to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system you might say we'll do the good teachers stay in the bad teachers leave the answer is on average the slightly better teachers leave the system and it's a system with very high turnover now there are a few places very few where great teachers are being made a good example of one is a set of charter schools called Kip Kip means knowledge is power it's an unbelievable thing they have 66 schools mostly middle schools seven high schools and what goes on is great teaching they take the poorest kids and over 96% of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public school they're team-teaching they're constantly improving their teachers they're taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher hey you caused this amount of increase and so they're deeply engaged in making teaching better when you actually go in and sit in one of these classrooms at first it's very bizarre i sat down and I thought what is going on the teacher was running around and the entered light energy levels high I thought well I'm in the prep the the sports rally or something what's going on and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention which kids were bored and calling on kids rapidly putting things up on the board it was a very dynamic environment because particularly in those middle school years two through eighth grade keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets make fun of it or have the position of you know the kid who who doesn't want to be there everybody needs to be involved and so Kipp is doing it how does that compare to a normal school within a normal school teachers aren't told how good they are the data isn't gathered in the teachers contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom sometimes two once per year and they need advance notice to do that so imagine running a factory we've got these workers some of them just making crap and the management is told hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually do fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment even a teacher wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it they don't have the test scores and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data for example New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure to say for the teachers and so that's sort of working in the opposite directions but I'm optimistic about this I think there's some clear things we can do first of all there's a lot more testing going on and that's given us the picture of where we are and that allows us to understand who's doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques are of course digital video is cheap now putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are are being recorded on an ongoing basis it is very practical in all public schools and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say okay here's a little clip of something I thought I did well here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly advise me when this kid acted up how should I have dealt with that and they can all sit and work together on those problems you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best teaching the stuff you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course learn from that if you have a kid who's behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept and in fact these three courses could not only be available just on the internet but you could make it so that DVDs were always available and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers and so by thinking of this is a a personnel system we can do it much better there's a book actually about hip the place that this is going on the Jay Matthews a news reporter wrote called work hard be nice and I thought it was so fantastic give you a sense of what a good teacher does I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book now we put a lot of money into education and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a futurist should have fact we have in the stimulus bill it's interesting the House version actually had money in it for these data systems and was taken out in the Senate because they're there people are threatened by these things but I am optimistic I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it right well I only had time to pray those two problems there's a lot more problems like that aids pneumonia and just see you're getting excited just at the very name of these things and the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad you know the system doesn't naturally make it happen governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way the private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things so it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things get other people involved and you're helping to come up with solutions and with that I think there's some great things will come out of it thank you you

used in the tenure to say for the teachers and so that's sort of working in the opposite directions but I'm optimistic about this I think there's some clear things we can do first of all there's a lot more testing going on and that's given us the picture of where we are and that allows us to understand who's doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques are of course digital video is cheap now putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are are being recorded on an ongoing basis it is very practical in all public schools and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say okay here's a little clip of something I thought I did well here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly advise me when this kid acted up how should I have dealt with that and they can all sit and work together on those problems you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best teaching the stuff you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course learn from that if you have a kid who's behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept and in fact these three courses could not only be available just on the internet but you could make it so that DVDs were always available and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers and so by thinking of this is a a personnel system we can do it much better there's a book actually about hip the place that this is going on the Jay Matthews a news reporter wrote called work hard be nice and I thought it was so fantastic give you a sense of what a good teacher does I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book now we put a lot of money into education and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a futurist should have fact we have in the stimulus bill it's interesting the House version actually had money in it for these data systems and was taken out in the Senate because they're there people are threatened by these things but I am optimistic I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it right well I only had time to pray those two problems there's a lot more problems like that aids pneumonia and just see you're getting excited just at the very name of these things and the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad you know the system doesn't naturally make it happen governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way the private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things so it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things get other people involved and you're helping to come up with solutions and with that I think there's some great things will come out of it thank you you

**Transcript**:
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation sharing some of the problems and Warren Buffett had recommended I do that being honest about what was going well what wasn't and making it kind of an annual thing a goal I had There was to draw more people in to work on those problems because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally that is the market does not drive the scientists the communicators the thinkers the government's to do the right things and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw their people in can we make as much progress as we need to so this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand but before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist any top problem I think it it can be solved and part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past over the last century average lifespan has more than doubled another statistic perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths as recently as nineteen sixty 110 million children were born and 20 million of those died before the age of five five years ago a hundred and thirty five million children were born so more and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five so that's a factor of two reduction in the child to death rate it's a phenomenal things I mean each one of those lives matters a lot and the key reason we were able to do it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs vaccines that were used more widely for example measles was 4 million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000 so we really can make changes the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 mm in half again and I think that's doable in well under 20 years why well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths diarrhea pneumonia and malaria and so that brings us to the the first problem that all all raised this morning which is how do we stop a disease a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitoes what's the history of this disease it's been a severe disease for thousands of years in fact we look at the genetic code it's the only disease we can see the people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths that's actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s so it was absolutely gigantic and the disease was all over the world terrible disease it was in the United States it was in Europe people didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitoes so it was everywhere and two tools helped bring the death breakdown one was killing the mosquitoes with DDT and the other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivatives and so that's why the death rate did come down now ironically what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones which is where all the rich countries are so we can see 1900s everywhere 1945 still most places 1970 the US and most of Europe have gotten rid of it 1990 you've gotten more Stu northern areas and then more recently you can see it's just around the equator and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poor countries it doesn't get much investment for example there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria now baldness is it's terrible and rich men are afflicted and so that's why that priority has been set but malaria they even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because there's just it holds things back so much now malaria of course transmitted by mosquitoes I brought some here so you could experience this we'll let let those roam around the auditorium a little bit there there's no reason only poor people should have have the experience not those mosquitoes are not not infected but so we've come up with a few new things we've got bed nets and bed nets are a great tool what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night and so the mosquitoes that bite late at night I can't get at them and when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50% and that's happened now in a number of countries it's great to see but we have to be careful because malaria the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves so every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective and so you end up with two choices if you go into a country with the right tools in the right way and you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication and that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking or if you go in kind of half-heartedly for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again and the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention now we're on the upswing bed net funding is up there's new drug discovery going on our foundation is back to vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months and that should save over two-thirds of lives if it's effective and so we're going to have these new tools but that alone doesn't give us the roadmap because the roadmap to get rid of this disease involves many things it involves communicators to keep the funding high to keep the visibility high to tell the success stories it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just 70% of people to use the bed nets but 90% we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to monte-carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise we need rich world governments to be very generous in in providing aid for these things and so as these elements come together I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria well now let me turn to a second question a fairly different question but I'd say equally important and this is how do you make a teacher great now seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on and that we'd understand very well and the answer is really that we don't let's start with why this is important well all of us here all bat had some great teachers we all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today part of the reason we're successful I can say that even though I'm a college dropout I had great teachers and in fact in the United States the teaching system has worked fairly well there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places so the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education and those top 20 percent have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top twenty percent and they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u.s. at the forefront now the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting not only is that been weak it's getting weaker and if you look at the economy it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education and so we have to change this we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays in the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education like Science and Mathematics when I first learned the statistics I was pretty how bad things are over 30% of kids never finish high school and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate is the number who started in senior year and and then compared it to the number of the finished senior year because they were tracking where the kids were before that but most of the dropouts had taken place before that so they had to raise the state of dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over 30 percent for minority kids it's over 50 percent and even if you graduate from high school if you're low income you have less than a 25% chance of ever completing a college degree if you're low income in the United States you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree and that you know doesn't seem entirely fair so how do you make education better our foundation for the last nine years is invested in this there's many people working on it we've worked on small schools we funded scholarships we've done things in libraries a lot of these things had a good effect but the more we looked at it the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing and so we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between say the top quartile the very best and the bottom quartile how much variation is there within a school or between schools and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable a top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over 10% in a single year what does that mean well that means that the entire us for two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between US and Asia would go away and within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away so it's simple all you need is those top quartile teachers and so you'd say well wow that's good we should reward those people we should retain those people we should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people but I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today what are the characteristics of this top quartile what do they they look like you might think well these must be very senior teachers and the answer is no once somebody is taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter the variation is very very small you might think well these are people with master's degrees they've gone back and they've gotten their masters education this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality that bottom thing which says there's no effect at all is a master's degree now the way the P system works is there's two things are rewarded one is seniority because your pay goes up and you vest in your pension and the second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree but in no ways associated with being a better teacher Teach for America slight effect for math teachers majoring in math is a measurable effect but overwhelmingly it's your past performance there are some people who are very good at this and we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in to to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system you might say we'll do the good teachers stay in the bad teachers leave the answer is on average the slightly better teachers leave the system and it's a system with very high turnover now there are a few places very few where great teachers are being made a good example of one is a set of charter schools called Kip Kip means knowledge is power it's an unbelievable thing they have 66 schools mostly middle schools seven high schools and what goes on is great teaching they take the poorest kids and over 96% of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public school they're team-teaching they're constantly improving their teachers they're taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher hey you caused this amount of increase and so they're deeply engaged in making teaching better when you actually go in and sit in one of these classrooms at first it's very bizarre i sat down and I thought what is going on the teacher was running around and the entered light energy levels high I thought well I'm in the prep the the sports rally or something what's going on and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention which kids were bored and calling on kids rapidly putting things up on the board it was a very dynamic environment because particularly in those middle school years two through eighth grade keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets make fun of it or have the position of you know the kid who who doesn't want to be there everybody needs to be involved and so Kipp is doing it how does that compare to a normal school within a normal school teachers aren't told how good they are the data isn't gathered in the teachers contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom sometimes two once per year and they need advance notice to do that so imagine running a factory we've got these workers some of them just making crap and the management is told hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually do fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment even a teacher wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it they don't have the test scores and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data for example New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure to say for the teachers and so that's sort of working in the opposite directions but I'm optimistic about this I think there's some clear things we can do first of all there's a lot more testing going on and that's given us the picture of where we are and that allows us to understand who's doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques are of course digital video is cheap now putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are are being recorded on an ongoing basis it is very practical in all public schools and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say okay here's a little clip of something I thought I did well here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly advise me when this kid acted up how should I have dealt with that and they can all sit and work together on those problems you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best teaching the stuff you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course learn from that if you have a kid who's behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept and in fact these three courses could not only be available just on the internet but you could make it so that DVDs were always available and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers and so by thinking of this is a a personnel system we can do it much better there's a book actually about hip the place that this is going on the Jay Matthews a news reporter wrote called work hard be nice and I thought it was so fantastic give you a sense of what a good teacher does I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book now we put a lot of money into education and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a futurist should have fact we have in the stimulus bill it's interesting the House version actually had money in it for these data systems and was taken out in the Senate because they're there people are threatened by these things but I am optimistic I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it right well I only had time to pray those two problems there's a lot more problems like that aids pneumonia and just see you're getting excited just at the very name of these things and the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad you know the system doesn't naturally make it happen governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way the private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things so it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things get other people involved and you're helping to come up with solutions and with that I think there's some great things will come out of it thank you you

but I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today what are the characteristics of this top quartile what do they they look like you might think well these must be very senior teachers and the answer is no once somebody is taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter the variation is very very small you might think well these are people with master's degrees they've gone back and they've gotten their masters education this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality that bottom thing which says there's no effect at all is a master's degree now the way the P system works is there's two things are rewarded one is seniority because your pay goes up and you vest in your pension and the second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree but in no ways associated with being a better teacher Teach for America slight effect for math teachers majoring in math is a measurable effect but overwhelmingly it's your past performance there are some people who are very good at this and we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in to to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system you might say we'll do the good teachers stay in the bad teachers leave the answer is on average the slightly better teachers leave the system and it's a system with very high turnover now there are a few places very few where great teachers are being made a good example of one is a set of charter schools called Kip Kip means knowledge is power it's an unbelievable thing they have 66 schools mostly middle schools seven high schools and what goes on is great teaching they take the poorest kids and over 96% of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public school they're team-teaching they're constantly improving their teachers they're taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher hey you caused this amount of increase and so they're deeply engaged in making teaching better when you actually go in and sit in one of these classrooms at first it's very bizarre i sat down and I thought what is going on the teacher was running around and the entered light energy levels high I thought well I'm in the prep the the sports rally or something what's going on and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention which kids were bored and calling on kids rapidly putting things up on the board it was a very dynamic environment because particularly in those middle school years two through eighth grade keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets make fun of it or have the position of you know the kid who who doesn't want to be there everybody needs to be involved and so Kipp is doing it how does that compare to a normal school within a normal school teachers aren't told how good they are the data isn't gathered in the teachers contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom sometimes two once per year and they need advance notice to do that so imagine running a factory we've got these workers some of them just making crap and the management is told hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually do fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment even a teacher wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it they don't have the test scores and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data for example New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure to say for the teachers and so that's sort of working in the opposite directions but I'm optimistic about this I think there's some clear things we can do first of all there's a lot more testing going on and that's given us the picture of where we are and that allows us to understand who's doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques are of course digital video is cheap now putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are are being recorded on an ongoing basis it is very practical in all public schools and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say okay here's a little clip of something I thought I did well here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly advise me when this kid acted up how should I have dealt with that and they can all sit and work together on those problems you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best teaching the stuff you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course learn from that if you have a kid who's behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept and in fact these three courses could not only be available just on the internet but you could make it so that DVDs were always available and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers and so by thinking of this is a a personnel system we can do it much better there's a book actually about hip the place that this is going on the Jay Matthews a news reporter wrote called work hard be nice and I thought it was so fantastic give you a sense of what a good teacher does I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book now we put a lot of money into education and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a futurist should have fact we have in the stimulus bill it's interesting the House version actually had money in it for these data systems and was taken out in the Senate because they're there people are threatened by these things but I am optimistic I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it right well I only had time to pray those two problems there's a lot more problems like that aids pneumonia and just see you're getting excited just at the very name of these things and the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad you know the system doesn't naturally make it happen governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way the private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things so it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things get other people involved and you're helping to come up with solutions and with that I think there's some great things will come out of it thank you you

**Transcript**:
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation sharing some of the problems and Warren Buffett had recommended I do that being honest about what was going well what wasn't and making it kind of an annual thing a goal I had There was to draw more people in to work on those problems because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally that is the market does not drive the scientists the communicators the thinkers the government's to do the right things and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw their people in can we make as much progress as we need to so this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand but before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist any top problem I think it it can be solved and part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past over the last century average lifespan has more than doubled another statistic perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths as recently as nineteen sixty 110 million children were born and 20 million of those died before the age of five five years ago a hundred and thirty five million children were born so more and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five so that's a factor of two reduction in the child to death rate it's a phenomenal things I mean each one of those lives matters a lot and the key reason we were able to do it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs vaccines that were used more widely for example measles was 4 million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000 so we really can make changes the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 mm in half again and I think that's doable in well under 20 years why well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths diarrhea pneumonia and malaria and so that brings us to the the first problem that all all raised this morning which is how do we stop a disease a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitoes what's the history of this disease it's been a severe disease for thousands of years in fact we look at the genetic code it's the only disease we can see the people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths that's actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s so it was absolutely gigantic and the disease was all over the world terrible disease it was in the United States it was in Europe people didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitoes so it was everywhere and two tools helped bring the death breakdown one was killing the mosquitoes with DDT and the other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivatives and so that's why the death rate did come down now ironically what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones which is where all the rich countries are so we can see 1900s everywhere 1945 still most places 1970 the US and most of Europe have gotten rid of it 1990 you've gotten more Stu northern areas and then more recently you can see it's just around the equator and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poor countries it doesn't get much investment for example there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria now baldness is it's terrible and rich men are afflicted and so that's why that priority has been set but malaria they even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because there's just it holds things back so much now malaria of course transmitted by mosquitoes I brought some here so you could experience this we'll let let those roam around the auditorium a little bit there there's no reason only poor people should have have the experience not those mosquitoes are not not infected but so we've come up with a few new things we've got bed nets and bed nets are a great tool what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night and so the mosquitoes that bite late at night I can't get at them and when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50% and that's happened now in a number of countries it's great to see but we have to be careful because malaria the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves so every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective and so you end up with two choices if you go into a country with the right tools in the right way and you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication and that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking or if you go in kind of half-heartedly for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again and the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention now we're on the upswing bed net funding is up there's new drug discovery going on our foundation is back to vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months and that should save over two-thirds of lives if it's effective and so we're going to have these new tools but that alone doesn't give us the roadmap because the roadmap to get rid of this disease involves many things it involves communicators to keep the funding high to keep the visibility high to tell the success stories it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just 70% of people to use the bed nets but 90% we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to monte-carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise we need rich world governments to be very generous in in providing aid for these things and so as these elements come together I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria well now let me turn to a second question a fairly different question but I'd say equally important and this is how do you make a teacher great now seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on and that we'd understand very well and the answer is really that we don't let's start with why this is important well all of us here all bat had some great teachers we all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today part of the reason we're successful I can say that even though I'm a college dropout I had great teachers and in fact in the United States the teaching system has worked fairly well there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places so the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education and those top 20 percent have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top twenty percent and they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u.s. at the forefront now the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting not only is that been weak it's getting weaker and if you look at the economy it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education and so we have to change this we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays in the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education like Science and Mathematics when I first learned the statistics I was pretty how bad things are over 30% of kids never finish high school and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate is the number who started in senior year and and then compared it to the number of the finished senior year because they were tracking where the kids were before that but most of the dropouts had taken place before that so they had to raise the state of dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over 30 percent for minority kids it's over 50 percent and even if you graduate from high school if you're low income you have less than a 25% chance of ever completing a college degree if you're low income in the United States you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree and that you know doesn't seem entirely fair so how do you make education better our foundation for the last nine years is invested in this there's many people working on it we've worked on small schools we funded scholarships we've done things in libraries a lot of these things had a good effect but the more we looked at it the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing and so we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between say the top quartile the very best and the bottom quartile how much variation is there within a school or between schools and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable a top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over 10% in a single year what does that mean well that means that the entire us for two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between US and Asia would go away and within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away so it's simple all you need is those top quartile teachers and so you'd say well wow that's good we should reward those people we should retain those people we should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people but I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today what are the characteristics of this top quartile what do they they look like you might think well these must be very senior teachers and the answer is no once somebody is taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter the variation is very very small you might think well these are people with master's degrees they've gone back and they've gotten their masters education this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality that bottom thing which says there's no effect at all is a master's degree now the way the P system works is there's two things are rewarded one is seniority because your pay goes up and you vest in your pension and the second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree but in no ways associated with being a better teacher Teach for America slight effect for math teachers majoring in math is a measurable effect but overwhelmingly it's your past performance there are some people who are very good at this and we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in to to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system you might say we'll do the good teachers stay in the bad teachers leave the answer is on average the slightly better teachers leave the system and it's a system with very high turnover now there are a few places very few where great teachers are being made a good example of one is a set of charter schools called Kip Kip means knowledge is power it's an unbelievable thing they have 66 schools mostly middle schools seven high schools and what goes on is great teaching they take the poorest kids and over 96% of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public school they're team-teaching they're constantly improving their

one of these classrooms at first it's very bizarre i sat down and I thought what is going on the teacher was running around and the entered light energy levels high I thought well I'm in the prep the the sports rally or something what's going on and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention which kids were bored and calling on kids rapidly putting things up on the board it was a very dynamic environment because particularly in those middle school years two through eighth grade keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets make fun of it or have the position of you know the kid who who doesn't want to be there everybody needs to be involved and so Kipp is doing it how does that compare to a normal school within a normal school teachers aren't told how good they are the data isn't gathered in the teachers contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom

down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually do fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment even a teacher wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it they don't have the test scores and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data for example New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure to say for the teachers and so that's sort of working in the opposite directions but I'm optimistic about this I think there's some clear things we can do first of all there's a lot more testing going on and that's given us the picture of where we are and that allows us to understand who's doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques are of course digital video is cheap now putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are are being recorded on an ongoing basis it is very practical in all public schools and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say okay here's a little clip of something I thought I did well here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly advise me when this kid acted up how should I have dealt with that and they can all sit and work together on those problems you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best teaching the stuff you can take

watch and review the concept and in fact these three courses could not only be available just on the internet but you could make it so that DVDs were always available and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers and so by thinking of this is a a personnel system we can do it much better there's a book actually about hip the place that this is going on the Jay Matthews a news reporter wrote called work hard be nice and I thought it was so fantastic give you a sense of what a good teacher does I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book now we put a lot of money into education and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a futurist should have fact we have in the stimulus bill it's interesting the House version actually had money in it for these data systems and was taken out in the Senate because they're there people are threatened by these things but I am optimistic I

question but I'd say equally important and this is how do you make a teacher great now seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on and that we'd understand very well and the answer is really that we don't let's start with why this is important well all of us here all bat had some great teachers we all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today part of the reason we're successful I can say that even though I'm a college dropout I had great teachers and in fact in the United States the teaching system has worked fairly well there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places so the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education and those top 20 percent have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top twenty percent and they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u.s. at the forefront now the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting not only is that been weak it's getting weaker and if you look at the economy it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education and so we have to change this we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays in the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education like Science and Mathematics when I first learned the statistics I was pretty how bad things are over 30% of kids never finish high school and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate is the number who started in senior year and and then compared it to the number of the finished senior year because they were tracking where the kids were before that but most of the dropouts had taken place before that so they had to raise the state of dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over 30 percent for minority kids it's over 50 percent and even if you graduate from high school if you're low income you have less than a 25% chance of ever completing a college degree if you're low income in the United States you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree and that you know doesn't seem entirely fair so how do you make education better our foundation for the last nine years is invested in this there's many people working on it we've worked on small schools we funded scholarships we've done things in libraries a lot of these things had a good effect but the more we looked at it the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing and so we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between say the top quartile the very best and the bottom quartile how much variation is there within a school or between schools and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable a top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over 10% in a single year what does that mean well that means that the entire us for two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between US and Asia would go away and within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away so it's simple all you need is those top quartile teachers and so you'd say well wow that's good we should reward those people we should retain those people we should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people but I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today what are the characteristics of this top quartile what do they they look like you might think well these must be very senior teachers and the answer is no once somebody is taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter the variation is very very small you might think well these are people with master's degrees they've gone back and they've gotten their masters education this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality that bottom thing which says there's no effect at all is a master's degree now the way the P system works is there's two things are rewarded one is seniority because your pay goes up and you vest in your pension and the second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree but in no ways associated with being a better teacher Teach for America slight effect for math teachers majoring in math is a measurable effect but overwhelmingly it's your past performance there are some people who are very good at this and we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in to to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system you might say we'll do the good teachers stay in the bad teachers leave the answer is on average the slightly better teachers leave the system and it's a system with very high turnover now there are a few places very few where great teachers are being made a good example of one is a set of charter schools called Kip Kip means knowledge is power it's an unbelievable thing they have 66 schools mostly middle schools seven high schools and what goes on is great teaching they take the poorest kids and over 96% of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public school they're team-teaching they're constantly improving their teachers they're taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher hey you caused this amount of increase and so they're deeply engaged in making teaching better when you actually go in and sit in one of these classrooms at first it's very bizarre i sat down and I thought what is going on the teacher was running around and the entered light energy levels high I thought well I'm in the prep the the sports rally or something what's going on and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention which kids were bored and calling on kids rapidly putting things up on the board it was a very dynamic environment because particularly in those middle school years two through eighth grade keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets make fun of it or have the position of you know the kid who who doesn't want to be there everybody needs to be involved and so Kipp is doing it how does that compare to a normal school within a normal school teachers aren't told how good they are the data isn't gathered in the teachers contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom sometimes two once per year and they need advance notice to do that so imagine running a factory we've got these workers some of them just making crap and the management is told hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually do fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment even a teacher wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it they don't have the test scores and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data for example New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure to say for the teachers and so that's sort of working in the opposite directions but I'm optimistic about this I think there's some clear things we can do first of all there's a lot more testing going on and that's given us the picture of where we are and that allows us to understand who's doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques are of course digital video is cheap now putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are are being recorded on an ongoing basis it is very practical in all public schools and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say okay here's a little clip of something I thought I did well here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly advise me when this kid acted up how should I have dealt with that and they can all sit and work together on those problems you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best teaching the stuff you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course learn from that if you have a kid who's behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept and in fact these three courses could not only be available just on the internet but you could make it so that DVDs were always available and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers and so by thinking of this is a a personnel system we can do it much better there's a book actually about hip the place that this is going on the Jay Matthews a news reporter wrote called work hard be nice and I thought it was so fantastic give you a sense of what a good teacher does I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book now we put a lot of money into education and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a futurist should have fact we have in the stimulus bill it's interesting the House version actually had money in it for these data systems and was taken out in the Senate because they're there people are threatened by these things but I am optimistic I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it right well I only had time to pray those two problems there's a lot more problems like that aids pneumonia and just see you're getting excited just at the very name of these things and the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad you know the system doesn't naturally make it happen governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way the private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things so it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things get other people involved and you're helping to come up with solutions and with that I think there's some great things will come out of it thank you you

**Transcript**:
Why does salt dissolve in water but oil doesn't? Well, in a word, chemistry, but that's not very satisfying, is it? Well, the reason salt dissolves and oil does not comes down to the two big reasons why anything happens at all: energetics and entropy. Energetics deals primarily with the attractive forces between things. When we look at oil or salt in water, we focus on the forces between particles on a very, very, very small scale, the molecular level. To give you a sense of this scale, in one glass of water, there are more molecules than known stars in the universe. Now, all of these molecules are in constant motion, moving, vibrating, and rotating. What prevents almost all of those molecules from just flying out of the glass are the attractive interactions between molecules. The strength of the interactions between water, itself, and other substances is what we mean when we say energetics. You can think of the water molecules engaging in a constant dance, sort of like a square dance where they constantly and randomly exchange partners. Put simply, the ability for substances to interact with water, balanced with how they disrupt how water interacts with itself, plays an important role in explaining why certain things mix well into water and others don't. Entropy basically describes the way things and energy can be arranged based on random motion. For example, think of the air in a room. Imagine all the different possible arrangements in space for the trillions of particles that make up the air. Some of those arrangments might have all the oxygen molecules over here and all the nitrogen molecules over there, separated. But far more of the possible arrangements have those molecules mixed up with one another. So, entropy favors mixing. Energetics deals with attractive forces. And so, if attractive forces are present, the probability of some arrangements can be enhanced, the ones where things are attracted to each other. So, it is always the balance of these two things that determines what happens. On the molecular level, water is comprised of water molecules, made up of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom. As liquid water, these molecules are engaged in a constant and random square dance that is called the hydrogen bonding network. Entropy favors keeping the square dance going at all times. There are always more ways that all the water molecules can arrange in a square dance, as compared to if the water molecules did a line dance. So, the square dance constantly goes on. So, what happens when you put salt in the water? Well, on the molecular level, salt is actually made up of two different ions, chlorine and sodium, that are organized like a brick wall. They show up to the dance as a big group in formation and sit on the side at first, shy and a bit reluctant to break apart into individual ions to join the dance. But secretly, those shy dancers just want someone to ask them to join. So, when a water randomly bumps into one of them and pulls them into the dance away from their group, they go. And once they go into the dance, they don't come back out. And in fact, the addition of the salt ions adds more possible dance positions in the square dance, so it is favored for them to stay dancing with water. Now, let's take oil. With oil, the molecules are sort of interested in dancing with water, so entropy favors them joining the dance. The problem is that oil molecules are wearing gigantic ballgowns, and they're way bigger than water molecules. So, when an oil molecule gets pulled in, their size is really disruptive to the dance and the random exchange of partners that the waters engage in, a very important part of the dance. In addition, they are not great dancers. The water molecules try to engage the oil molecules in the dance, but they just keep bumping into their dresses and taking up all the room on the dance floor. There are way more ways the waters can dance when the oil gets off the floor, so the waters squeeze out the oil, pushing it back to the bench with the others. Pretty soon, when a large number of oils have been squeezed over to the side, they band together to commiserate about how unfair the waters are being and stick together as a group. So, it is this combination of the interactions between molecules and the configurations available to them when they're moving randomly that dictates whether they mix. In other words, water and oil don't mix because they just don't make great dance partners.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Energetics deals with ________.

The problem is that oil molecules are wearing gigantic ballgowns, and they're way bigger than water molecules. So, when an oil molecule gets pulled in, their size is really disruptive to the dance and the random exchange of partners that the waters engage in, a very important part of the dance. In addition, they are not great dancers. The water molecules try to engage the oil molecules in the dance, but they just keep bumping into their dresses and taking up all the room on the dance floor. There are way more ways the waters can dance when the oil gets off the floor, so the waters squeeze out the oil, pushing it back to the bench with the others. Pretty soon, when a large number of oils have been squeezed over to the side, they band together to commiserate about how unfair the waters are being and stick together as a group. So, it is this combination of the interactions between molecules and the configurations available to them when they're moving randomly that dictates whether they mix. In other words, water and oil don't mix because they just don't make great dance partners.

**Transcript**:
Why does salt dissolve in water but oil doesn't? Well, in a word, chemistry, but that's not very satisfying, is it? Well, the reason salt dissolves and oil does not comes down to the two big reasons why anything happens at all: energetics and entropy. Energetics deals primarily with the attractive forces between things. When we look at oil or salt in water, we focus on the forces between particles on a very, very, very small scale, the molecular level. To give you a sense of this scale, in one glass of water, there are more molecules than known stars in the universe. Now, all of these molecules are in constant motion, moving, vibrating, and rotating. What prevents almost all of those molecules from just flying out of the glass are the attractive interactions between molecules. The strength of the interactions between water, itself, and other substances is what we mean when we say energetics. You can think of the water molecules engaging in a constant dance, sort of like a square dance where they constantly and randomly exchange partners. Put simply, the ability for substances to interact with water, balanced with how they disrupt how water interacts with itself, plays an important role in explaining why certain things mix well into water and others don't. Entropy basically describes the way things and energy can be arranged based on random motion. For example, think of the air in a room. Imagine all the different possible arrangements in space for the trillions of particles that make up the air. Some of those arrangments might have all the oxygen molecules over here and all the nitrogen molecules over there, separated. But far more of the possible arrangements have those molecules mixed up with one another. So, entropy favors mixing. Energetics deals with attractive forces. And so, if attractive forces are present, the probability of some arrangements can be enhanced, the ones where things are attracted to each other. So, it is always the balance of these two things that determines what happens. On the molecular level, water is comprised of water molecules, made up of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom. As liquid water, these molecules are engaged in a constant and random square dance that is called the hydrogen bonding network. Entropy favors keeping the square dance going at all times. There are always more ways that all the water molecules can arrange in a square dance, as compared to if the water molecules did a line dance. So, the square dance constantly goes on. So, what happens when you put salt in the water? Well, on the molecular level, salt is actually made up of two different ions, chlorine and sodium, that are organized like a brick wall. They show up to the dance as a big group in formation and sit on the side at first, shy and a bit reluctant to break apart into individual ions to join the dance. But secretly, those shy dancers just want someone to ask them to join. So, when a water randomly bumps into one of them and pulls them into the dance away from their group, they go. And once they go into the dance, they don't come back out. And in fact, the addition of the salt ions adds more possible dance positions in the square dance, so it is favored for them to stay dancing with water. Now, let's take oil. With oil, the molecules are sort of interested in dancing with water, so entropy favors them joining the dance. The problem is that oil molecules are wearing gigantic ballgowns, and they're way bigger than water molecules. So, when an oil molecule gets pulled in, their size is really disruptive to the dance and the random exchange of partners that the waters engage in, a very important part of the dance. In addition, they are not great dancers. The water molecules try to engage the oil molecules in the dance, but they just keep bumping into their dresses and taking up all the room on the dance floor.

So, it is this combination of the interactions between molecules and the configurations available to them when they're moving randomly that dictates whether they mix. In other words, water and oil don't mix because they just don't make great dance partners.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: When oil molecules are put into water, they _______.
Options: A. Are more attracted to themselves than the water so they show no interest in “dancing” with the water molecules, B.

Palms sweaty, heart racing, stomach in knots. You can't cry for help. Not only is your throat
too tight to breathe, but it'd be so embarrassing. No, you aren't being stalked by a monster, you're speaking in public, a fate some deem worse than death. See, when you're dead, you feel nothing; at a podium, you feel stage fright. But at some point
we've all had to communicate in front of people, so you have to try and overcome it. To start, understand what stage fright is. Humans, social animals that we are, are wired to worry about reputation. Public speaking can threaten it. Before a speech, you fret, "What if people think I'm
awful and I'm an idiot?" That fear of being seen as an awful idiot is a threat reaction from a primitive part of your brain that's very hard to control. It's the fight or flight response, a self-protective process
seen in a range of animals, most of which don't give speeches. But we have a wise partner in the study of freaking out. Charles Darwin tested fight or flight at the London Zoo snake exhibit. He wrote in his diary, "My will and reason were powerless
against the imagination of a danger which had never been experienced." He concluded that his response was an ancient reaction unaffected by the nuances of modern civilization. So, to your conscious modern mind, it's a speech. To the rest of your brain, built up to code
with the law of the jungle, when you perceive
the possible consequences of blowing a speech, it's time to run for your life or fight to the death. Your hypothalamus, common
to all vertebrates, triggers your pituitary gland to secrete the hormone ACTH, making your adrenal gland shoot adrenaline into your blood. Your neck and back tense up, you slouch. Your legs and hand shake as your muscles prepare for attack. You sweat. Your blood pressure jumps. Your digestion shuts down to maximize the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to muscles and vital organs, so you get dry mouth, butterflies. Your pupils dilate, it's hard to read anything up close, like your notes, but long range is easy. That's how stage fright works. How do we fight it? First, perspective. This isn't all in your head. It's a natural, hormonal,
full body reaction by an autonomic nervous
system on autopilot. And genetics play a huge
role in social anxiety. John Lennon played live
thousands of times. Each time he vomited beforehand. Some people are just wired to feel more scared performing in public. Since stage fright
is natural and inevitable, focus on what you can control. Practice a lot, starting long before in an environment similar
to the real performance. Practicing any task
increases your familiarity and reduces anxiety, so when it's time to speak in public, you're confident in yourself
and the task at hand. Steve Jobs rehearsed his epic speeches for hundreds of hours, starting weeks in advance. If you know what you're saying, you'll feed off the crowd's energy instead of letting your hypothalamus
convince your body it's about to be lunch for a pack of predators. But hey, the vertebrate hypothalamus has had millions of years
more practice than you. Just before you go on stage, it's time to fight dirty and trick your brain. Stretch your arms up and breath deeply. This makes your hypothalamus trigger a relaxation response. Stage fright usually hits hardest
right before a presentation, so take that last minute
to stretch and breathe. You approach the Mic, voice clear, body relaxed. Your well-prepared speech
convinces the wild crowd you're a charismatic genius. How? You didn't overcome stage fright, you adapted to it. And to the fact that no matter how civilized you may seem, in part of your brain, you're still a wild animal, a profound, well-spoken wild animal.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Palms sweaty, heart racing, stomach in knots. You can't cry for help. Not only is your throat
too tight to breathe, but it'd be so embarrassing. No, you aren't being stalked by a monster, you're speaking in public, a fate some deem worse than death. See, when you're dead, you feel nothing; at a podium, you feel stage fright. But at some point
we've all had to communicate in front of people, so you have to try and overcome it. To start, understand what stage fright is. Humans, social animals that we are, are wired to worry about reputation. Public speaking can threaten it. Before a speech, you fret, "What if people think I'm
awful and I'm an idiot?" That fear of being seen as an awful idiot is a threat reaction from a primitive part of your brain that's very hard to control. It's the fight or flight response, a self-protective process
seen in a range of animals, most of which don't give speeches. But we have a wise partner in the study of freaking out. Charles Darwin tested fight or flight at the London Zoo snake exhibit. He wrote in his diary, "My will and reason were powerless
against the imagination of a danger which had never been experienced." He concluded that his response was an ancient reaction unaffected by the nuances of modern civilization. So, to your conscious modern mind, it's a speech. To the rest of your brain, built up to code
with the law of the jungle, when you perceive
the possible consequences of blowing a speech, it's time to run for your life or fight to the death. Your hypothalamus, common
to all vertebrates, triggers your pituitary gland to secrete the hormone ACTH, making your adrenal gland shoot adrenaline into your blood. Your neck and back tense up, you slouch. Your legs and hand shake as your muscles prepare for attack. You sweat. Your blood pressure jumps. Your digestion shuts down to maximize the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to muscles and vital organs, so you get dry mouth, butterflies. Your pupils dilate, it's hard to read anything up close, like your notes, but long range is easy. That's how stage fright works. How do we fight it? First, perspective. This isn't all in your head. It's a natural, hormonal,
full body reaction by an autonomic nervous
system on autopilot. And genetics play a huge
role in social anxiety. John Lennon played live
thousands of times. Each time he vomited beforehand. Some people are just wired to feel more scared performing in public. Since stage fright
is natural and inevitable, focus on what you can control. Practice a lot, starting long before in an environment similar
to the real performance. Practicing any task
increases your familiarity and reduces anxiety, so when it's time to speak in public, you're confident in yourself
and the task at hand. Steve Jobs rehearsed his epic speeches for hundreds of hours, starting weeks in advance. If you know what you're saying, you'll feed off the crowd's energy instead of letting your hypothalamus
convince your body it's about to be lunch for a pack of predators. But hey, the vertebrate hypothalamus has had millions of years
more practice than you. Just before you go on stage, it's time to fight dirty and trick your brain. Stretch your arms up and breath deeply. This makes your hypothalamus trigger a relaxation response. Stage fright usually hits hardest
right before a presentation, so take that last minute
to stretch and breathe. You approach the Mic, voice clear, body relaxed. Your well-prepared speech
convinces the wild crowd you're a charismatic genius. How? You didn't overcome stage fright, you adapted to it. And to the fact that no matter how civilized you may seem, in part of your brain, you're still a wild animal, a profound, well-spoken wild animal.

**Transcript**:
We've all seen movies about terrible insects from outer space or stories of abduction by little green men, but the study of life in the universe, including the possibility of extraterrestrial life, is also a serious, scientific pursuit. Astrobiology draws on diverse fields, such as physics, biology, astronomy, and geology, to study how life was formed on Earth, how it could form elsewhere, and how we might detect it. Many ancient religions described other worlds inhabited by known human beings, but these are more like mythical realms or parallel universes than other planets existing in the same physical world. It is only within the last century that scientists have been able to seriously undertake the search for extraterrestrial life. We know that at the most basic level organisms on Earth need three things: liquid water, a source of energy, and organic, carbon-based material. We also know that the Earth is just the right distance from the Sun, so as not to be either frozen or molten. So, planets within such a habitable range from their own stars may be able to support life. But while we used to think that life could only exist in such Earth-like environments, one of the most amazing discoveries of astrobiology has been just how versatile life is. We now know that life can thrive in some of the most extreme environments that'd be fatal for most known organisms. Life is found everywhere, from black smoke of hydrothermal vents in the dark depths of Earth's oceans, to bubbling, hot, acidic springs on the flanks of volcanoes, to high up in the atmosphere. Organisms that live in these challenging environments are called extremophiles, and they can survive at extremes of temperature, pressure, and radiation, as well as salinity, acidity, and limited availability of sunlight, water, or oxygen. What is most remarkable about these extremophiles is that they are found thriving in environments that mimic those on alien worlds. One of the most important of these worlds is our red and dusty neighbor, Mars. Today, astrobiologists are exploring places where life might once have existed on Mars using NASA's Curiosity rover. One of these is Gale Crater, an impact crater created when a meteor hit the surface of Mars nearly 3.8 billions years ago. Evidence from orbit suggest past traces of water, which means the crater might once have supported life. Planets are not the only places astrobiologists are looking at. For example, Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter, and Enceladus and Titan, two of Saturn's moons, are all exciting possibilities. Although these moons are extremely cold and two are covered in thick ice, there is evidence of liquid oceans beneath the shell. Could life be floating around in these oceans, or could it be living around black smoker vents at the bottom? Titan is particularly promising as it has an atmosphere and Earth-like lakes, seas, and rivers flowing across the surface. It is very cold, however, too cold for liquid water, so these rivers may instead be flowing with liquid hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane. These are composed of hydrogen, and, more importantly, carbon, which is the basic building block of all life as we know it. So, could life be found in these lakes? Although instruments are being designed to study these distant worlds, it takes many years to build them and even longer to get them where they need to be. In the meantime, astrobiologists work in our own natural laboratory, the Earth, to learn about all the weird and wonderful forms of life that can exist and to help us one day answer one of humanity's oldest questions: Are we alone?

We've all seen movies about terrible insects from outer space or stories of abduction by little green men, but the study of life in the universe, including the possibility of extraterrestrial life, is also a serious, scientific pursuit. Astrobiology draws on diverse fields, such as physics, biology, astronomy, and geology, to study how life was formed on Earth, how it could form elsewhere, and how we might detect it. Many ancient religions described other worlds inhabited by known human beings, but these are more like mythical realms or parallel universes than other planets existing in the same physical world. It is only within the last century that scientists have been able to seriously undertake the search for extraterrestrial life. We know that at the most basic level organisms on Earth need three things: liquid water, a source of energy, and organic, carbon-based material. We also know that the Earth is just the right distance from the Sun, so as not to be either frozen or molten. So, planets within such a habitable range from their own stars may be able to support life. But while we used to think that life could only exist in such Earth-like environments, one of the most amazing discoveries of astrobiology has been just how versatile life is. We now know that life can thrive in some of the most extreme environments that'd be fatal for most known organisms. Life is found everywhere, from black smoke of hydrothermal vents in the dark depths of Earth's oceans, to bubbling, hot, acidic springs on the flanks of volcanoes, to high up in the atmosphere. Organisms that live in these challenging environments are called extremophiles, and they can survive at extremes of temperature, pressure, and radiation, as well as salinity, acidity, and limited availability of sunlight, water, or oxygen. What is most remarkable about these extremophiles is that they are found thriving in environments that mimic those on alien worlds. One of the most important of these worlds is our red and dusty neighbor, Mars. Today, astrobiologists are exploring places where life might once have existed on Mars using NASA's Curiosity rover. One of these is Gale Crater, an impact crater created when a meteor hit the surface of Mars nearly 3.8 billions years ago. Evidence from orbit suggest past traces of water, which means the crater might once have supported life. Planets are not the only places astrobiologists are looking at. For example, Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter, and Enceladus and Titan, two of Saturn's moons, are all exciting possibilities. Although these moons are extremely cold and two are covered in thick ice, there is evidence of liquid oceans beneath the shell. Could life be floating around in these oceans, or could it be living around black smoker vents at the bottom? Titan is particularly promising as it has an atmosphere and Earth-like lakes, seas, and rivers flowing across the surface. It is very cold, however, too cold for liquid water, so these rivers may instead be flowing with liquid hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane. These are composed of hydrogen, and, more importantly, carbon, which is the basic building block of all life as we know it. So, could life be found in these lakes? Although instruments are being designed to study these distant worlds, it takes many years to build them and even longer to get them where they need to be. In the meantime, astrobiologists work in our own natural laboratory, the Earth, to learn about all the weird and wonderful forms of life that can exist and to help us one day answer one of humanity's oldest questions: Are we alone?

**Transcript**:
good afternoon there's a medical revolution happening all around us and it's one that's going to help us conquer some of society's most dreaded conditions including cancer and the revolution is called angiogenesis and it's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels so why should we care about blood vessels well the human body is literally packed with them 60,000 miles worth in a typical adult and the end that would form a line that would circle the Earth twice the smallest blood vessels are called capillaries we've got 19 billion of them in our bodies and these are the vessels of life and as I'll show you they can also be the vessels of death now the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they're growing in for example in the liver they form channels to detoxify the blood in the lung they line air sacs for gas exchange in muscle they corkscrew so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation and in nerves they course along like power lines keeping those nerves alive and we get most of these blood vessels when we're actually still in the womb and what that means is that as adults blood vessels don't normally grow except in a few special circumstances in women blood vessels grow every month to build the lining of the uterus during pregnancy they form the placenta which connects mom and baby and after injury blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab in order to heal a wound and this is actually what it looks like hundreds of blood vessels all growing towards the center of the wound so the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time and it does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis such that when we need a brief burst of blood vessels the body can do this by releasing stimulators proteins called angiogenic factors that act as natural fertilizer and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout and when those excess vessels are no longer needed the body prunes them back to baseline using naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis now there are other situations where we start beneath the baseline and we need to grow more blood vessels just to get back to normal levels for example after an injury and a body can do that too but only to that normal level that's setpoint but what we now know is that for a number of diseases there are defects in the system where the body can't prune back extra blood vessels or can't grow enough new ones in a right place at the right time and in these situations angiogenesis is out of balance and when angiogenesis is out of balance a myriad of diseases result for example insufficient angiogenesis not enough blood vessels leads to wounds that don't heal heart attacks legs without circulation death from stroke nerve damage and on the other hand excessive angiogenesis too many blood vessels drives disease and we see this in cancer blindness arthritis obesity Alzheimer's disease in total there are more than 70 major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide that all look on the surface to be different from one another but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator in this realization is allowing us to reconceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases by controlling and your genesis now I'm going to focus on cancer because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer every type of cancer so here we go this is a tumor dark grey ominous mass growing inside a brain and under the microscope you can see hundreds of these brown staining blood vessels capillaries that are feeding cancer cells bringing oxygen and nutrients but cancers don't start out like this and if that cancers don't start out with a blood supply they start out as small microscopic nests of cells that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size that's the tip of a ballpoint pen then they can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply so they don't have enough oxygen or nutrients and in fact we're probably forming these microscopic cancers all the time in our body autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents have shown that about 40% of women between the ages of 40 and 50 actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts about 50% of men in their 50s and 60s have microscopic prostate cancers and all virtually a hundred percent of us by the time we reach our 70s will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid yet without a blood supply most of these cancers will never become dangerous dr. Judah Folkman who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field once called this cancer without disease so the body's ability to balance angiogenesis when it's working properly prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers and this turns out to be one of our most important defense mechanisms against cancer in fact if you actually block angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells tumors simply can't grow up but once angiogenesis occurs cancers can grow exponentially and this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to deadly cancer cells mutate and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors natural fertilizer that tipped the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer and once those vessels invade the cancer it can expand it can invade local tissues in the same vessels that are feeding tumors allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases and unfortunately this late stage of cancer is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed when angiogenesis has already turned on and cancer cells are growing like wild so Evandro Genesis is a tipping point between a harmless cancer and a harmful one then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution is a new approach to treating cancer by cutting off the blood supply we call this anti-angiogenic therapy and it's completely different from chemotherapy because it's selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers and we can do this because tomber blood vessels are unlike normal healthy vessels we see in other places of the body they're abnormal they are very poorly constructed and because of that they're highly vulnerable to treatments that target them in fact when we give cancer patients anti-angiogenic therapy here an experimental drug for a glioma which is a type of a brain tumor you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being starved here's a woman with a breast cancer being treated with the anti-angiogenic drug called Avastin which is fda-approved and you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment now I've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to anti-angiogenic therapy so a few years ago I asked myself can we take this one step further and treat other cancers even in other species so here is a nine-year-old boxer named Milo who had a very aggressive tumor called a malignant neurofibroma growing in his shoulder and invaded to his lungs his veterinarian only gave him three months to live so we created a cocktail of anti-angiogenic drugs that could be mixed into his dog food as well as an anti-angiogenic cream that could be applied on the surface of the tumor and within a few weeks of treatment we were able to slow down that cancers growth such that we were ultimately able to extend Milo's survival to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted all with the very good quality of life and we've subsequently treated more than 600 dogs we have about a 60% response rate and improved survival for these pets that were about to be euthanized so let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples this is a 20 year old dolphin living in Florida and she had these lesions in her mouth that over the course of three years developed into invasive squamous cell cancers so we created an anti-angiogenic paste we had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week and over the course of seven months the cancer has completely disappeared and the biopsies came back as normal here's a cancer growing on the lip of a quarter horse named it's a very very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma had already spread to his lymph nodes so we used an anti-angiogenic skin cream for the lip and the oral cocktail so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside and over the course of six months he experienced a complete remission and here he is six years later guinness with his very happy owner now obviously antigenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers in fact the first pioneered treatments for people as well as dogs already becoming available there's 12 different drugs 11 different cancer types but the real question is how well do these work in practice so here is actually the patient survival data from 8 different types of cancer and the bars represent survival time taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy or surgery or radiation available but starting in 2004 when anti-angiogenic therapies first became available you can see that there has been a 70 to 100 percent improvement in survival for people with kidney cancer multiple myeloma colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors that's impressive but for other tumors and cancer types the improvements have only been modest so I started asking myself why haven't we been able to do better and the answer to me is obvious we're treating cancer too late in the game when it's already established and oftentimes it's already spread or metastasize and as a doctor I know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage achieving a cure can be difficult if not impossible so I went back to the biology of angiogenesis and started thinking could the answer to cancer be preventing Andrew Genesis beating cancer its own game so the cancers could never become dangerous this could help healthy people as well as people who have already beaten cancer once or twice and want to find a way to keep it from coming back so to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer I went back to look at cancerous causes and what really intrigued me was when I saw that diet accounts for 30 to 35 percent of environmentally caused cancers now the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet what to strip out take away but I actually took a completely opposite approach it began asking what could we be adding to our diet that's naturally anti-angiogenic that could boost the body's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers in other words can we eat to starve cancer well the answer is yes and I'm going to show you how and our search for this has taken us to the market the farm and to the spice cabinet because what we've discovered is that Mother Nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis so here's a test system we developed at the center as a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion and we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are attainable by eating so let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes the active ingredient resveratrol it's also found in red wine this inhibits abnormal angiogenesis by 60 percent here's what happens when we add an extract from strawberries it potently inhibits angiogenesis an extract from soybeans and here is a growing list of our anti-angiogenic foods and beverages that we're interested in studying and for each food type we believe that there's different potencies within different strains and varietals and we want to measure this because well while you're eating a strawberry or drinking tea why not select the one that's most potent for preventing cancer so here are four different teas that we've tested they're all common ones Chinese Jasmine Japanese Sencha Earl Grey and a special blend that we prepared and you can see clearly that the tea's vary in their potency from less potent to more potent but what's very cool is when we actually combine the two less potent teas together the combination the blend is more potent than either one alone this means there's food synergy here's some more data from our testing now in the lab we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar and using the system we can test a potency of cancer drugs so the shorter the bar less angiogenesis that's good and here are some common drugs that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people statins non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a few others they inhibit angiogenesis - and here are the dietary factors going head-to-head against these drugs you can see they clearly hold their own and in some cases they're more potent than the actual drugs soy parsley garlic grapes berries I could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients so imagine if we could create the world's first rating system in which we could score foods according to their anti-angiogenic cancer preventative properties and that's what we're doing right now now I've shown you a bunch of lab data and so the real question is what is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer well the best example I know is the study of 79 thousand men followed over 20 years in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week at up to a 50% reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer now we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene and lycopene is anti-angiogenic but what's even more interesting from this study is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer those who ate more servings of tomato sauce actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer so this human study is a prime example of how anti-angiogenic substances present food and consumed impractical levels can impact on cancer and we're now studying the role of a healthy diet with Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University on the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis that we can find in the bloodstream now obviously what I've shared with you has some far ranging implications even beyond cancer research because if we're right it could impact on consumer education food services public health and even the insurance industry and in fact some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines check out this ad from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota and for many people around the world dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution because not everybody can afford expensive end-stage cancer treatments but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local sustainable anti-angiogenic crops now finally I've talked to you about food and I've talked to you about cancer so there's just one more disease that I have to tell you about and that's obesity because turns out that adipose tissue fat is highly angiogenesis dependent and like a tumor fat grows when blood vessels grow so the question is can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply so the top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese Mouse that eats non-stop until it turns fat like this furry tennis ball and the bottom curve is the weight of a normal Mouse if you take the obese Mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor it loses weight stop the treatment gains the weight back restart the treatment loses the weight again stop the treatment gains away back in fact you can cycle the weight up and down simply by inhibiting Andra Genesis so this approach that we're taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity the really truly interesting thing about this is that we can't take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal Mouse is weight is supposed to be in other words we can't create supermodel mice and this speaks to the role of angiogenesis in regulating healthy setpoints albertson Georgie once said that discovery consists of seeing what everybody is seen and thinking what nobody is thought I hope I've convinced you that for diseases like cancer obesity and other conditions that there may be a great power in attacking their common denominator angiogenesis and that's what I think the world needs now thank so these drugs aren't exactly they're not exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now for anyone out here who has cancer what would you recommend do you recommend pursuing these treatments now for most cancer patients so there are anti energetic treatments that are you should ask there are many clinical trials the in geneticist foundation respond almost 300 companies consider the approved ones look for clinical trials but then between what the doctor can do for you we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves and this is one of the themes that I'm talking about is we can empower ourselves to do the things that doctors can't do for us which is a use knowledge of take action and if Mother Nature has given us some clues we think that there might be some new future in the value of how we eat and what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day right and along those lines for people who might have risk factors for cancer would you recommend pursuing any treatment sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce well you know there's a abundant epidemiological evidence and I think an Information Age it doesn't take long to go to a credible source like PubMed the National Library of Medicine to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and based on common medications and that's certainly something that anybody can look into okay well thank you so much you

cancer too late in the game when it's already established and oftentimes it's already spread or metastasize and as a doctor I know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage achieving a cure can be difficult if not impossible so I went back to the biology of angiogenesis and started thinking could the answer to cancer be preventing Andrew Genesis beating cancer its own game so the cancers could never become dangerous this could help healthy people as well as people who have already beaten cancer once or twice and want to find a way to keep it from coming back so to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer I went back to look at cancerous causes and what really intrigued me was when I saw that diet accounts for 30 to 35 percent of environmentally caused cancers now the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet what to strip out take away but I actually took a completely opposite approach it began asking what could we be adding to our diet that's naturally anti-angiogenic that could boost the body's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers in other words can we eat to starve cancer well the answer is yes and I'm going to show you how and our search for this has taken us to the market the farm and to the spice cabinet because what we've discovered is that Mother Nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis so here's a test system we developed at the center as a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion and we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are attainable by eating so let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes the active ingredient resveratrol it's also found in red wine this inhibits abnormal angiogenesis by 60 percent here's what happens when we add an extract from strawberries it potently inhibits angiogenesis an extract from soybeans and here is a growing list of our anti-angiogenic foods and beverages that we're interested in studying and for each food type we believe that there's different potencies within different strains and varietals and we want to measure this because well while you're eating a strawberry or drinking tea why not select the one that's most potent for preventing cancer so here are four different teas that we've tested they're all common ones Chinese Jasmine Japanese Sencha Earl Grey and a special blend that we prepared and you can see clearly that the tea's vary in their potency from less potent to more potent but what's very cool is when we actually combine the two less potent teas together the combination the blend is more potent than either one alone this means there's food synergy here's some more data from our testing now in the lab we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar and using the system we can test a potency of cancer drugs so the shorter the bar less angiogenesis that's good and here are some common drugs that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people statins non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a few others they inhibit angiogenesis - and here are the dietary factors going head-to-head against these drugs you can see they clearly hold their own and in some cases they're more potent than the actual drugs soy parsley garlic grapes berries I could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients so imagine if we could create the world's first rating system in which we could score foods according to their anti-angiogenic cancer preventative properties and that's what we're doing right now now I've shown you a bunch of lab data and so the real question is what is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer well the best example I know is the study of 79 thousand men followed over 20 years in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week at up to a 50% reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer now we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene and lycopene is anti-angiogenic but what's even more interesting from this study is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer those who ate more servings of tomato sauce actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer so this human study is a prime example of how anti-angiogenic substances present food and consumed impractical levels can impact on cancer and we're now studying the role of a healthy diet with Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University on the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis that we can find in the bloodstream now obviously what I've shared with you has some far ranging implications even beyond cancer research because if we're right it could impact on consumer education food services public health and even the insurance industry and in fact some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines check out this ad from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota and for many people around the world dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution because not everybody can afford expensive end-stage cancer treatments but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local sustainable anti-angiogenic crops now finally I've talked to you about food and I've talked to you about cancer so there's just one more disease that I have to tell you about and that's obesity because turns out that adipose tissue fat is highly angiogenesis dependent and like a tumor fat grows when blood vessels grow so the question is can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply so the top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese Mouse that eats non-stop until it turns fat like this furry tennis ball and the bottom curve is the weight of a normal Mouse if you take the obese Mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor it loses weight stop the treatment gains the weight back restart the treatment loses the weight again stop the treatment gains away back in fact you can cycle the weight up and down simply by inhibiting Andra Genesis so this approach that we're taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity the really truly interesting thing about this is that we can't take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal Mouse is weight is supposed to be in other words we can't create supermodel mice and this speaks to the role of angiogenesis in regulating healthy setpoints albertson Georgie once said that discovery consists of seeing what everybody is seen and thinking what nobody is thought I hope I've convinced you that for diseases like cancer obesity and other conditions that there may be a great power in attacking their common denominator angiogenesis and that's what I think the world needs now thank so these drugs aren't exactly they're not exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now for anyone out here who has cancer what would you recommend do you recommend pursuing these treatments now for most cancer patients so there are anti energetic treatments that are you should ask there are many clinical trials the in geneticist foundation respond almost 300 companies consider the approved ones look for clinical trials but then between what the doctor can do for you we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves and this is one of the themes that I'm talking about is we can empower ourselves to do the things that doctors can't do for us which is a use knowledge of take action and if Mother Nature has given us some clues we think that there might be some new future in the value of how we eat and what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day right and along those lines for people who might have risk factors for cancer would you recommend pursuing any treatment sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce well you know there's a abundant epidemiological evidence and I think an Information Age it doesn't take long to go to a credible source like PubMed the National Library of Medicine to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and based on common medications and that's certainly something that anybody can look into okay well thank you so much you

**Transcript**:
good afternoon there's a medical revolution happening all around us and it's one that's going to help us conquer some of society's most dreaded conditions including cancer and the revolution is called angiogenesis and it's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels so why should we care about blood vessels well the human body is literally packed with them 60,000 miles worth in a typical adult and the end that would form a line that would circle the Earth twice the smallest blood vessels are called capillaries we've got 19 billion of them in our bodies and these are the vessels of life and as I'll show you they can also be the vessels of death now the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they're growing in for example in the liver they form channels to detoxify the blood in the lung they line air sacs for gas exchange in muscle they corkscrew so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation and in nerves they course along like power lines keeping those nerves alive and we get most of these blood vessels when we're actually still in the womb and what that means is that as adults blood vessels don't normally grow except in a few special circumstances in women blood vessels grow every month to build the lining of the uterus during pregnancy they form the placenta which connects mom and baby and after injury blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab in order to heal a wound and this is actually what it looks like hundreds of blood vessels all growing towards the center of the wound so the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time and it does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis such that when we need a brief burst of blood vessels the body can do this by releasing stimulators proteins called angiogenic factors that act as natural fertilizer and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout and when those excess vessels are no longer needed the body prunes them back to baseline using naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis now there are other situations where we start beneath the baseline and we need to grow more blood vessels just to get back to normal levels for example after an injury and a body can do that too but only to that normal level that's setpoint but what we now know is that for a number of diseases there are defects in the system where the body can't prune back extra blood vessels or can't grow enough new ones in a right place at the right time and in these situations angiogenesis is out of balance and when angiogenesis is out of balance a myriad of diseases result for example insufficient angiogenesis not enough blood vessels leads to wounds that don't heal heart attacks legs without circulation death from stroke nerve damage and on the other hand excessive angiogenesis too many blood vessels drives disease and we see this in cancer blindness arthritis obesity Alzheimer's disease in total there are more than 70 major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide that all look on the surface to be different from one another but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator in this realization is allowing us to reconceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases by controlling and your genesis now I'm going to focus on cancer because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer every type of cancer so here we go this is a tumor dark grey ominous mass growing inside a brain and under the microscope you can see hundreds of these brown staining blood vessels capillaries that are feeding cancer cells bringing oxygen and nutrients but cancers don't start out like this and if that cancers don't start out with a blood supply they start out as small microscopic nests of cells that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size that's the tip of a ballpoint pen then they can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply so they don't have enough oxygen or nutrients and in fact we're probably forming these microscopic cancers all the time in our body autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents have shown that about 40% of women between the ages of 40 and 50 actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts about 50% of men in their 50s and 60s have microscopic prostate cancers and all virtually a hundred percent of us by the time we reach our 70s will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid yet without a blood supply most of these cancers will never become dangerous dr. Judah Folkman who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field once called this cancer without disease so the body's ability to balance angiogenesis when it's working properly prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers and this turns out to be one of our most important defense mechanisms against cancer in fact if you actually block angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells tumors simply can't grow up but once angiogenesis occurs cancers can grow exponentially and this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to deadly cancer cells mutate and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors natural fertilizer that tipped the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer and once those vessels invade the cancer it can expand it can invade local tissues in the same vessels that are feeding tumors allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases and unfortunately this late stage of cancer is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed when angiogenesis has already turned on and cancer cells are growing like wild so Evandro Genesis is a tipping point between a harmless cancer and a harmful one then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution is a new approach to treating cancer by cutting off the blood supply we call this anti-angiogenic therapy and it's completely different from chemotherapy because it's selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers and we can do this because tomber blood vessels are unlike normal healthy vessels we see in other places of the body they're abnormal they are very poorly constructed and because of that they're highly vulnerable to treatments that target them in fact when we give cancer patients anti-angiogenic therapy here an experimental drug for a glioma which is a type of a brain tumor you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being starved here's a woman with a breast cancer being treated with the anti-angiogenic drug called Avastin which is fda-approved and you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment now I've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to anti-angiogenic therapy so a few years ago I asked myself can we take this one step further and treat other cancers even in other species so here is a nine-year-old boxer named Milo who had a very aggressive tumor called a malignant neurofibroma growing in his shoulder and invaded to his lungs his veterinarian only gave him three months to live so we created a cocktail of anti-angiogenic drugs that could be mixed into his dog food as well as an anti-angiogenic cream that could be applied on the surface of the tumor and within a few weeks of treatment we were able to slow down that cancers growth such that we were ultimately able to extend Milo's survival to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted all with the very good quality of life and we've subsequently treated more than 600 dogs we have about a 60% response rate and improved survival for these pets that were about to be euthanized so let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples this is a 20 year old dolphin living in Florida and she had these lesions in her mouth that over the course of three years developed into invasive squamous cell cancers so we created an anti-angiogenic paste we had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week and over the course of seven months the cancer has completely disappeared and the biopsies came back as normal here's a cancer growing on the lip of a quarter horse named it's a very very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma had already spread to his lymph nodes so we used an anti-angiogenic skin cream for the lip and the oral cocktail so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside and over the course of six months he experienced a complete remission and here he is six years later guinness with his very happy owner now obviously antigenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers in fact the first pioneered treatments for people as well as dogs already becoming available there's 12 different drugs 11 different cancer types but the real question is how well do these work in practice so here is actually the patient survival data from 8 different types of cancer and the bars represent survival time taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy or surgery or radiation available but starting in 2004 when anti-angiogenic therapies first became available you can see that there has been a 70 to 100 percent improvement in survival for people with kidney cancer multiple myeloma colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors that's impressive but for other tumors and cancer types the improvements have only been modest so I started asking myself why haven't we been able to do better and the answer to me is obvious we're treating cancer too late in the game when it's already established and oftentimes it's already spread or metastasize and as a doctor I know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage achieving a cure can be difficult if not impossible so I went back to the biology of angiogenesis and started thinking could the answer to cancer be preventing Andrew Genesis beating cancer its own game so the cancers could never become dangerous this could help healthy people as well as people who have already beaten cancer once or twice and want to find a way to keep it from coming back so to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer I went back to look at cancerous causes and what really intrigued me was when I saw that diet accounts for 30 to 35 percent of environmentally caused cancers now the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet what to strip out take away but I actually took a completely opposite approach it began asking what could we be adding to our diet that's naturally anti-angiogenic that could boost the body's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers in other words can we eat to starve cancer well the answer is yes and I'm going to show you how and our search for this has taken us to the market the farm and to the spice cabinet because what we've discovered is that Mother Nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis so here's a test system we developed at the center as a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion and we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are attainable by eating so let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes the active ingredient resveratrol it's also found in red wine this inhibits abnormal angiogenesis by 60 percent here's what happens when we add an extract from strawberries it potently inhibits angiogenesis an extract from soybeans and here is a growing list of our anti-angiogenic foods and beverages that we're interested in studying and for each food type we believe that there's different potencies within different strains and varietals and we want to measure this because well while you're eating a strawberry or drinking tea why not select the one that's most potent for preventing cancer so here are four different teas that we've tested they're all common ones Chinese Jasmine Japanese Sencha Earl Grey and a special blend that we prepared and you can see clearly that the tea's vary in their potency from less potent to more potent but what's very cool is when we actually combine the two less potent teas together the combination the blend is more potent than either one alone
