**Transcript**:
and I was so excited that element 114 has finally got its official name that we felt that I should try and say a few words in Russian because my father was born in Russia we've already made two videos about the discovery of this element first of all how the discovery was confirmed and people really established that 114 had been made and then the first time that the name was mentioned at the end of the 2011 International year of chemistry so what's new and what's new is that on the 30th of May this year 2012 the element's name was officially adopted and therefore we can make a new video to go in our Periodic Table of videos so this is the official video of the element depending whether you say it with a Russian accent or not is called flerovium or fium element 114 there is no official periodic table in the same way that there's a standard kilogram but when a name is suggested Ed such as the name fluvium was suggested in December last year then people are allowed a few months to point out if there are any problems in the case of element 112 cerium the symbol was changed from CP to CN during this discussion period in the case of flerovium nothing has changed and the element symbol is f l big F little L though in some fonts it looks like F1 which is possibly a problem now like the other super heavy elements these elements are synthesized by taking the nucleus of a heavy element or an atom of a heavy element and banging into it an element that is lighter and so in this case they take plutonium which is element 94 and to make 114 you need 20 so you take a nucleus of calcium which has atomic number 20 you accelerate calcium very rapidly and eventually after bombarding plutonium with millions and or hundreds of mli billions of atoms one of them will fuse together you can see it's quite hard you now have an element with a nucleus of atomic number 114 that's with 114 protons that flies off to be analyzed these experiments were done in the Russian Research Center dubna North of Moscow which was founded by academician fuu the earlier elements like element 105 there was huge nationalistic competition between us labs and Russian labs and arguing who discovered it first these elements 114 and 116 which were named at the same time are a beautiful example of international collaboration this element like the ones around it has only been seen in a number really quite small number of atoms so nobody has made any compound from it though if you look at the periodic table you will see it's in the same group as lead this cup here was made before the name was announced so it says has the old symbol uuq and you would expect the chemistry of fium to be rather like that of lead only rather more so so you might expect it to be a very dense and rather soft metal highly radioactive so you couldn't use it as weights for your fishing like people use lead but it would probably be poisonous even if it were not radioactive and its chemistry might be quite similar to lead though as you go down the periodic table you can get quite some surprises now the real question that you might all be asking is if you can only make a few atoms of this element why on Earth does it need a symol nobody is going to be writing textbooks about the chemistry fluvium with fluvium oxide or fium sulfate so why do you need this symbol and the answer is that the symbol probably isn't use useful in chemistry but it's very useful in physics because as you go to heavier elements say element 116 118 they will Decay via some of these other elements like 114 and so if you want to make charts like this one that I've got on my tie with the different elements and how they Decay away as they give out radioactive particles gamma rays you need the symbols and if you don't have the symbol then it's quite difficult to construct these so the symbol does have a use even though it's not particularly useful for day-to-day chemistry I've been to Russia quite frequently lots and lots of times to Moscow but not yet to dumna though it's one of the places that Brady and I really want to go I have heard of Florio of course and his Institute but I think that it is rather sad that although he was alive at the time that these elements were discovered the experiments were done that he died before the name was officially announced and so this is why at the beginning of the video I said that the name of this element is really his memorial and I think it's a very positive Memorial because it symbolizes how science has brought countries of the world together in a way although I didn't know him that I'm sure in his heart he really wanted can I ask you a question would you rather have an element named after you or win a Nobel Prize well I think that's that's a very interesting question

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the year when the name "flerovium" was accepted by IUPAC, replacing the generic name "ununquadium". Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 asks about the official name of element 114, but it does not mention the year or IUPAC.

However, I noticed that the transcript mentions the year 2012 as the time when the element's name was officially adopted. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs explicitly ask about this year.

Given the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would suggest Question 1, as it is related to the official name of element 114, which is mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 1 (Note: This is a weak match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be needed to closely match the ground truth MCQ.)

it is one of the few elements that is more or less totally useless protactinium is an element which is actually much more interesting than I expected the first interesting fact is that it is one of the elements whose existence was predicted by melif you've probably all heard how melif predicted the existence of gallium and Scandium because there were holes in his periodic table and he also worked out that there was a hole between thorium and uranium where he felt there should be an element now the reason that people don't make such a fuss about protactinium in the context of melive is that protactinium was only really tied down discovered properly in 1918 well after the death of Mel whereas he was here to celebrate gallium and Scandium and that made made him famous the problem with protactinium is that it exists in a very very small quantities in nature and it is called protactinium originally it was called Proto actinium because it decays by radioactivity to form actinium originally because Mel didn't know about the these series The lanthanides and actinides he put protactinium here so you would have after actinium you would have thorium protactinium and then uranium and so he thought that the chemistry of protactinium would be similar to that of tantalum and it turns out that it is quite similar and that was how it was isolated the chemical problem is that when people were looking at ores these are the minerals that contain Metals the ores of uranium there was some radioactivity which suggested that there may be another element which could Decay by emission of an alpha particle helium nucleus to make actinium so it would jump two spaces to the left to make actinium and the atomic number would go down by two the problem was how to isolate this material radioactive element from all the other radioactive elements that are found in minerals with uranium and as you probably know that radium and ponum were also been isolated from these minerals so there's a real mixture and it was the um Austrian chemist physicist Lisa mner working in the Institute together with Oto Han who eventually in 19118 found a chemical way of precipitating the elements of this group and at the same time as she precipitated those the protactinium was also precipitated because its chemistry was similar and she found some sign of the radioactivity in that material that she precipitated and that was deemed to be the discovery of protactinium and it was published in 1918 they proposed the name Proto actinium everybody found it difficult to say Proto actinium so it quickly got contracted to protactinium that's not easy to say either no but it's easier than Proto actinium all the elements above lead in the periodic table have a degree of radioactivity so if we had a lamp of protactinium here it would be extremely dangerous in terms of its r radioactive decay the isotope that's the particular form of protactinium that was discovered by Lisa miter had a um halflife of I think 32,000 years a few years earlier the chemist fagin discovered a an isotope that had a half life of only one and a half minutes which was so shortlived he called it the name brevium big firm brief so bre and so that in a way was the first discovery of protactinium but it turns out that there is a custom that if several different isotopes of an element are discovered whoever discovers the longest lived isotope wins and they're deemed the discoverer there are two other parts that I aspects I think interesting about protactinium the first one is just like Mel said it does form an oxide p25 in fact this is its most stable compound the second thing which is perhaps a more interesting fact for those of you who are real nerds for the periodic table is that it is one of the occasions where the atomic weight of the element you can see here 231 something is lower than the atomic weight of the elements before it there's a another quite well-known pair here that pottassium at 39 is slightly lighter than argon which is the element that precedes it so these inverted pairs meant that unfortunately men predicted the wrong atomic weight for protactinium it's 231 and he said it's 235 which is still not a bad guess there was an attempt to make quite a large amount of it many years ago in the UK where 60 tons of material were processed to make 125 G of protactinium and according to this book the people paid half a million dollars for the um starting material but they were only charging $33,000 a gram for what they made so if you do quick maths you can see even before you counting the labor they made a loss on the material why were they making it then I have no idea it is used for the dating of sediments at the bottom of the ocean people measure the ratio of the Isotopes of protactinium and thorium and from the value of this ratio they can tell approximately how old the sediment is at the bottom of the sea so you can argue whether or not that is really a use it is more perhaps an application than a use

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is related to the decay of protactinium.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the type of particles emitted when protactinium decays into actinium. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this question.

However, I can suggest that Question 3 is vaguely related to the topic of protactinium decay, as it mentions the discovery of a short-lived isotope of protactinium. Nevertheless, it does not directly address the type of particles emitted during decay.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to pick one, I would say Question 3 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

**Transcript**:
I've only ever seen before a 1 gr sample of aridium which I bought myself for another video and here I've got a big piece of aridium this weighs 3.8 kilos and idium is the second densest metal that exists only osmium is denser but the difference in density is so small that you wouldn't really tell the difference it has one of the highest melting points as well and I'm really impressed by this it looks just like an ordinary piece of metal but it's really quite heavy I've got this sample because I'm at the Johnson ma Noble metal plant where they actually process this material they take the sponge which comes from the mines where they dig up the rocks and process it and turn it into metal objects and this piece of Rod is one of the intermediate stages to get this bar one has to process about 6 or 700,000 tons of rock a huge amount of rock nearly a million tons of rock just to make this why should people want idium it's very useful because it's high melting point and its strength because of its high melting point you can make it into crucibles this is a very little Crucible but if you want to you handle liquids at high temperature 2,000 de centigrade you have no choice you have to use an iridium Crucible so here is quite a small one might make quite a good vodka glass actually but the real crucibles that people use say for growing crystals of silicon and so on are really much bigger this is a sheet of aridium for making a crucible you make The Crucible in two pieces you have a smallish piece here that's the bottom you cut out a circle and then this piece is is wrapped around to form the sides this piece of metal which is really very heavy again will be rolled up and welded and what's unusual about this sheet of metal it's not very thick but it's absolutely rigid it doesn't Bend at all if you had a piece of Steel like this it would be beginning to feel slightly bendy you can feel that it has unusual properties it's not like a metal I felt before and it's very heavy and this density makes it very hard and rigid but you can imagine how much this is worth because the price of aridium is approaching £800 an ounce so these are very expensive materials and we're in a metal free zone we are not allowed to bring in any metal to make sure that nobody steals anything if you don't have any metal it makes it easy to screen you as you go out you have nothing metallic nothing that's an electrical conductor so it's easy to screen if you have lots of bits of metal you might be able to sneak something through so when I came here everything went my favorite pen even my belt from my trousers this is something I've never seen before this is where somebody actually chooses the name of an element so if you look down here I should incline to call the this metal idium so this is the first time that anybody ever wrote down the word idium now of course he might have written it in his notes but this is the first official record of anybody writing the word idium one of the other areas where you have very high temperatures are in the tips of spark plugs you know you put spark plugs into the tops of cylinders of petrol engines and when the spark ignites the explosion ignites the fuel air mixture then you get very high temperature and you don't want it to erode away you want the spark plug to work for thousands if not hundreds of thousands of miles and you do this by putting in a tiny idium tip these are the tips of the spark plugs like that they're really tiny and it's important to stress that modern technology depend depends on making these tiny tiny components of aridium and getting them in the right place so you use the metal you need at the really important point in a spark plug it's much less important what you make the nut from or the contact at this end but you've got to get it really right just there and then you get the maximum performance I also like these here these are the grains of aridium that are made from the sponge that comes from the Bine and the first stage of the processing is making these rather irregular sized grains which can then be melted again and cast into ingots before they make bars like this earlier on we were shown a whole tub full of grains of aridium and I could actually run it through my hands something I'll never do again probably but I really just want to pick this up again make the most of it well I've got the time it's like your periodic videoos mace yeah for once I can keep Brady in order iridium is found in very low concentrations on our planet but it's found in quite high concentrations on asteroids and meteorites and a physicist Lis Alvarez in the N early 1980s pointed out that there is a very thin layer geological layer in the so-called KT boundary in the rocks from 65 million years ago which is rich in idium it has 100 times the concentration of idium and this is believed to come from the asteroid that hit the earth and killed all the dinosaurs because it vaporized and put a layer of aridium around the world and by tracing this tiny layer of rock which contains higher levels of aridium the whole theory of how the dinosaurs disappeared from the world was developed it wasn't the idium that killed the dinosaurs though no they were killed by the explosion but it was the idium that left the signature that let us understand what had happened sequence which is around here you wouldn't write English quite like that nowadays this metal iridium here is the name idium and here he says from the Striking variety of colors which it gives while dissolving in and I can't read the name of the acid it could be muriatic acid

**Transcript**:
I've only ever seen before a 1 gr sample of aridium which I bought myself for another video and here I've got a big piece of aridium this weighs 3.8 kilos and idium is the second densest metal that exists only osmium is denser but the difference in density is so small that you wouldn't really tell the difference it has one of the highest melting points as well and I'm really impressed by this it looks just like an ordinary piece of metal but it's really quite heavy I've got this sample because I'm at the Johnson ma Noble metal plant where they actually process this material they take the sponge which comes from the mines where they dig up the rocks and process it and turn it into metal objects and this piece of Rod is one of the intermediate stages to get this bar one has to process about 6 or 700,000 tons of rock a huge amount of rock nearly a million tons of rock just to make this why should people want idium it's very useful because it's high melting point and its strength because of its high melting point you can make it into crucibles this is a very little Crucible but if you want to you handle liquids at high temperature 2,000 de centigrade you have no choice you have to use an iridium Crucible so here is quite a small one might make quite a good vodka glass actually but the real crucibles that people use say for growing crystals of silicon and so on are really much bigger this is a sheet of aridium for making a crucible you make The Crucible in two pieces you have a smallish piece here that's the bottom you cut out a circle and then this piece is is wrapped around to form the sides this piece of metal which is really very heavy again will be rolled up and welded and what's unusual about this sheet of metal it's not very thick but it's absolutely rigid it doesn't Bend at all if you had a piece of Steel like this it would be beginning to feel slightly bendy you can feel that it has unusual properties it's not like a metal I felt before and it's very heavy and this density makes it very hard and rigid but you can imagine how much this is worth because the price of aridium is approaching £800 an ounce so these are very expensive materials and we're in a metal free zone we are not allowed to bring in any metal to make sure that nobody steals anything if you don't have any metal it makes it easy to screen you as you go out you have nothing metallic nothing that's an electrical conductor so it's easy to screen if you have lots of bits of metal you might be able to sneak something through so when I came here everything went my favorite pen even my belt from my trousers this is something I've never seen before this is where somebody actually chooses the name of an element so if you look down here I should incline to call the this metal idium so this is the first time that anybody ever wrote down the word idium now of course he might have written it in his notes but this is the first official record of anybody writing the word idium one of the other areas where you have very high temperatures are in the tips of spark plugs you know you put spark plugs into the tops of cylinders of petrol engines and when the spark ignites the explosion ignites the fuel air mixture then you get very high temperature and you don't want it to erode away you want the spark plug to work for thousands if not hundreds of thousands of miles and you do this by putting in a tiny idium tip these are the tips of the spark plugs like that they're really tiny and it's important to stress that modern technology depend depends on making these tiny tiny components of aridium and getting them in the right place so you use the metal you need at the really important point in a spark plug it's much less important what you make the nut from or the contact at this end but you've got to get it really right just there and then you get the maximum performance I also like these here these are the grains of aridium that are made from the sponge that comes from the Bine and the first stage of the processing is making these rather irregular sized grains which can then be melted again and cast into ingots before they make bars like this earlier on we were shown a whole tub full of grains of aridium and I could actually run it through my hands something I'll never do again probably but I really just want to pick this up again make the most of it well I've got the time it's like your periodic videoos mace yeah for once I can keep Brady in order iridium is found in very low concentrations on our planet but it's found in quite high concentrations on asteroids and meteorites and a physicist Lis Alvarez in the N early 1980s pointed out that there is a very thin layer geological layer in the so-called KT boundary in the rocks from 65 million years ago which is rich in idium it has 100 times the concentration of idium and this is believed to come from the asteroid that hit the earth and killed all the dinosaurs because it vaporized and put a layer of aridium around the world and by tracing this tiny layer of rock which contains higher levels of aridium the whole theory of how the dinosaurs disappeared from the world was developed it wasn't the idium that killed the dinosaurs though no they were killed by the explosion but it was the idium that left the signature that let us understand what had happened sequence which is around here you wouldn't write English quite like that nowadays this metal iridium here is the name idium and here he says from the Striking variety of colors which it gives while dissolving in and I can't read the name of the acid it could be muriatic acid

Element 113 is, again, labelled with this
new systematic method for the artificial elements. So you
have un-un-trium or it might be ununtrium, I don’t know,
which stands for 113. And you might actually ask, ‘Why should
anybody want to make a few atoms of these artificial elements?’
And I think the answer, I don’t know definitely, is
that there have been predictions that although the elements at
this part of the periodic table are very unstable, that there
may, at heavier elements, be one or two elements which are
surprisingly stable, might last for very much longer. They
are called ‘islands of stability’ that have been
predicted, and so people are working systematically to see whether
in fact there are one or two elements that are in fact really
quite stable even though they are super heavy. And when I was
a young researcher in the 1970s, somebody, I can’t
remember who it was, got very excited because they thought
in remnants of very ancient mineral mica, it’s a sort of
mineral that comes in layers, that they found some strange patterns,
which they thought was an indication of super heavy elements
decaying, perhaps as heavy as element 164. Enormously
heavier than anything anybody has been able to create in
the lab. It turned out not to be as exciting as they thought
and there was some other completely different explanation. But
it is testing theories and things like that that really
move science forward.

**Transcript**:
amorium is really a very radioactive element so it is handled in this glove box and I'm not qualified to use such equipment so Mark who works here will tell us about it so this is a this is a vial of amorium 241 which is one of the Isotopes of amorium and this was separated from some plutonium because one of the Isotopes of plutonium plutonium 241 decays into amarum 241 with a half life of 14 years it turns out you can make amarium a number of ways it's generated when nuclear weapons are detonated it's also found uh in spent nuclear waste from nuclear reactors so for example if you took a ton of material been used in a nuclear reactor and took it to one side there'd be about 100 G in that turn would be amorium this is actually ultraviolet visible spectroscopy cell and it goes into this holder which has two fiber optic connections to it and what happens is we pass light from the spectrometer through these Fiber Optic Cables through the solution and out the other side and the spectrometer provides a fingerprint of what element is in that solution and that fingerprint is very specific to amarium amarium is the only transuranium element that you'll likely to have a sample of in your house in fact you may have several samples because amorium is used in very small quantities nanograms 1 thousandth of a millionth of a gram in smoke detectors that we all have in our houses to prevent us being burnt to death if there's a fire they were meant to put it off hi you forgot to switch it off I've actually uh got uh Martin polyakov's uh old smoke detector you haven't taken a working one from his house we haven't taken the working one no that wouldn't be safe but we took one that stopped working this is the inside of the smoke detector and you can see here it actually says amarium well amarium is a strong emitter of gamma rays and alpha particles and these are used in a smoke detector because if you get particles of smoke the S stuff that makes smoke look white um they intercept the radiation and stop the radiation getting from the radioactive source to the detector in your smoke detector so in fact what's measuring is a drop in the current going between the source and the detector and the alarm goes off and it says that there's .9 micro curies now I don't know about you but I don't normally remember what .9 micro curries really means it means there's n 26 micrograms and you might sit there and think what on Earth does he mean by that well if you think of a grain of rice it weighs 100,000 times less than the grain of rice it's got quite a history to it as well it was first discovered in 1944 but this was Kept Secret for a whole year until it was eventually allowed out into the public domain and the reason it was Kept Secret is because it was part of the Manhattan Project when there was all of a search to generate nuclear weapons so people didn't want compet groups to understand how far ahead they were compared to the competition so they kept the discovery of an entire element in the periodic table secret for a whole year uh but then it was leaked out uh and then basically they had to tell everybody in nuclear fuel reprocessing that the objective is to produce a pure uranium and a pure plutonium product stream now here at cellfield those materials are put into storage and over time one of the Isotopes of plutonium plutonium 241 decays into an isotope of amarium amarium 241 and so over time amarium grows into these plutonium stocks so it's possible to separate the amorium from the plutonium by chemical methods when it was first prepared it was prepared because people predicted that these elements ought to be uh synthesizable it's just they didn't exist naturally Rel so of course this was a challenge to chemists there's a little bit of interesting story uh behind the the synthesis of these elements cuz they were quite arduous quite longwinded a piece of plutonium was coated onto some Platinum foil oxidized to plutonium dioxide put in a cyclotron once this was over with they would take this foil and they would dissolve what they wanted away with concentrated nitric acid and then they had to precipitate what they wanted as a hydroxide using an ammonium reagent and dissolved it in the chloric acid some curium was removed you then had the amorium and the people who did this process found it so tedious and so arduous that they actually referred to it as pandemonium which is Greek for uh all demons or hell what is interesting is that amorium is an element which may become more useful in the future it may be able to replace plutonium in batteries for spacecraft and so on So currently plutonium 238 is used but to be able to generate that within Europe would require very expensive in infrastructure to be put into place including a source of neptunium 237 generation building a reactor specifically for converting neptunium into plutonium 238 and it all becomes very expensive the production of plute 238 stopped in the US uh number of decades ago and they haven't uh resumed production to this date so stocks are running low European Space Agency would like to have an independent supply of these power sources so they've commissioned a program of work to look at an alternative to plutonium 238 and it's possible that amarium 241 could F fulfill this role amarum 241 doesn't produce the same amount of power but it could be used in smaller applications I don't like the names of elements that are named after countries because I feel chemistry is an international subject though I suppose that amarium although it's clearly derived from America doesn't sound terribly like America and therefore it's not bad as a name and once Something's Got a Name it's difficult to change it and everybody calls it amarium so we're stuck with it like that and rotate it around nothing much happens oh let me put it vertical and it stays where it is

**Transcript**:
amorium is really a very radioactive element so it is handled in this glove box and I'm not qualified to use such equipment so Mark who works here will tell us about it so this is a this is a vial of amorium 241 which is one of the Isotopes of amorium and this was separated from some plutonium because one of the Isotopes of plutonium plutonium 241 decays into amarum 241 with a half life of 14 years it turns out you can make amarium a number of ways it's generated when nuclear weapons are detonated it's also found uh in spent nuclear waste from nuclear reactors so for example if you took a ton of material been used in a nuclear reactor and took it to one side there'd be about 100 G in that turn would be amorium this is actually ultraviolet visible spectroscopy cell and it goes into this holder which has two fiber optic connections to it and what happens is we pass light from the spectrometer through these Fiber Optic Cables through the solution and out the other side and the spectrometer provides a fingerprint of what element is in that solution and that fingerprint is very specific to amarium amarium is the only transuranium element that you'll likely to have a sample of in your house in fact you may have several samples because amorium is used in very small quantities nanograms 1 thousandth of a millionth of a gram in smoke detectors that we all have in our houses to prevent us being burnt to death if there's a fire they were meant to put it off hi you forgot to switch it off I've actually uh got uh Martin polyakov's uh old smoke detector you haven't taken a working one from his house we haven't taken the working one no that wouldn't be safe but we took one that stopped working this is the inside of the smoke detector and you can see here it actually says amarium well amarium is a strong emitter of gamma rays and alpha particles and these are used in a smoke detector because if you get particles of smoke the S stuff that makes smoke look white um they intercept the radiation and stop the radiation getting from the radioactive source to the detector in your smoke detector so in fact what's measuring is a drop in the current going between the source and the detector and the alarm goes off and it says that there's .9 micro curies now I don't know about you but I don't normally remember what .9 micro curries really means it means there's n 26 micrograms and you might sit there and think what on Earth does he mean by that well if you think of a grain of rice it weighs 100,000 times less than the grain of rice it's got quite a history to it as well it was first discovered in 1944 but this was Kept Secret for a whole year until it was eventually allowed out into the public domain and the reason it was Kept Secret is because it was part of the Manhattan Project when there was all of a search to generate nuclear weapons so people didn't want compet groups to understand how far ahead they were compared to the competition so they kept the discovery of an entire element in the periodic table secret for a whole year uh but then it was leaked out uh and then basically they had to tell everybody in nuclear fuel reprocessing that the objective is to produce a pure uranium and a pure plutonium product stream now here at cellfield those materials are put into storage and over time one of the Isotopes of plutonium plutonium 241 decays into an isotope of amarium amarium 241 and so over time amarium grows into these plutonium stocks so it's possible to separate the amorium from the plutonium by chemical methods when it was first prepared it was prepared because people predicted that these elements ought to be uh synthesizable it's just they didn't exist naturally Rel so of course this was a challenge to chemists there's a little bit of interesting story uh behind the the synthesis of these elements cuz they were quite arduous quite longwinded a piece of plutonium was coated onto some Platinum foil oxidized to plutonium dioxide put in a cyclotron once this was over with they would take this foil and they would dissolve what they wanted away with concentrated nitric acid and then they had to precipitate what they wanted as a hydroxide using an ammonium reagent and dissolved it in the chloric acid some curium was removed you then had the amorium and the people who did this process found it so tedious and so arduous that they actually referred to it as pandemonium which is Greek for uh all demons or hell what is interesting is that amorium is an element which may become more useful in the future it may be able to replace plutonium in batteries for spacecraft and so on So currently plutonium 238 is used but to be able to generate that within Europe would require very expensive in infrastructure to be put into place including a source of neptunium 237 generation building a reactor specifically for converting neptunium into plutonium 238 and it all becomes very expensive the production of plute 238

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] this is the venue where as a young man some of the music that I wrote was first performed it was remarkably a pretty good sounding room with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere it actually sounded pretty good this is a song that was recorded there this is not talking heads in the picture anyway [Music] so the nature of the room meant that words could be understood the lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood the sound system was kind of decent and there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room so the rhythms could be pretty intact - pretty concise other places around the country had similar rooms this is Tootsie's orchid lounge in Nashville the music was in some ways different but in structure in form very much the same the clientele behavior was very much the same - and so the bands at Tootsie's or at CBGB's had to play loud enough - the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing since then I've played other places that are much nicer I've played the Disney Hall here and Carnegie Hall and places like that and it's been very exciting but I also noticed that sometimes the music that I had written or was writing at the time didn't sound all that great and some of those halls we managed but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited to the music I was making or had made so I asked myself do I write stuff for specific rooms do I have a place a venue in mind when I write is that a kind of model for creativity do we all make things with a venue or context in mind okay Africa most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in West Africa and the music there I would say the instruments the intricate rhythms the way it's played the setting the context it's all perfect it all works perfect the music works perfectly in that setting there's no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms the instruments are loud enough the that can be heard without amplification etc etc it's no accident it's perfect for that particular context and it would be a mess in a context like this this is a Gothic cathedral in a Gothic cathedral this kind of music is perfect it doesn't change key the notes are long is almost no rhythm whatsoever and the room flatters the music it actually improves it this is the room that Bach wrote some of his music for this is the organ it's not as big as a Gothic cathedral so he can write things were a little bit more intricate he can very innovatively actually change keys without risking huge distances [Music] this is a little bit later this is the kinds of rooms that Mozart wrote I think we're in like 1770 somewhere around there they're smaller even less reverberant so he can write really freely music that's very intricate and the it works it fits the room perfectly this is La Scala some around the same time I think was built around 1776 people in the audience and these opera houses when they were built they used to yell out to one another they used to eat drink and yell out to people on the stage just like they do with CBGB's in places like that if they liked an area they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore not at the end of the show but immediately and well that's that's was an opera experience this is the Opera House that vogner built for himself and the size of the room is not that big it's smaller than this but well vogner minute innovation he wanted a bigger band he wanted a little more bomb bass so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there [Music] okay this is Carnegie Hall obviously this kind of thing became popular the halls got bigger Carnegie Hall is fair size it's larger than some of the other Symphony halls and they're a lot more reverberant than La Scala around the same time according to Alex Ross who writes for The New Yorker this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet no more eating drinking and yelling at the stage or gossiping with one another during the show they had to be very quiet so those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls it meant that there could be extreme dynamics which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music quiet parts can be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting but because of the reverberation in those rooms like Carnegie Hall the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic in a little more textural with Mahler it looks like Bob Dylan but it's smaller that was Bob's last record yeah popular music coming along at the same time this is a jazz band according to Scott Joplin the bands were playing on riverboats and in clubs again it's noisy they're playing for dancers and there's certain sections of the song the songs had different sections and they that the dance was really liked and they say play that part again well there's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers so the band started to improvise new melodies been a new form of music was born these are played mainly in small rooms people are dancing shouting and drinking so the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that same thing goes true for okay that's beginning of the century for the whole 20th century popular music whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever it doesn't really change that much it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century when this became one of the primary venues for music and this was one way that the music got their microphones enabled singers in particular and musicians and composers to completely change the kind of music that they were writing so far a lot of the stuff that was on the radio is live music but singers like Frank Sinatra could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone other singers after him went even further funny [Music] sweet chet baker man this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone would have been impossible without recorded music as well and he's singing right into your ear he's whispering into your ears the effect is just electric it's like the guy is sitting next to you whispering who knows what into your ear so at this point music diverged there's live music and there's recorded music and they no longer have to be exactly the same now there's venues like this a discotheque and there's jukeboxes and bars where you don't even need to have a band it doesn't need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever and the sound systems are good people began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems and as with jazz the dancers like certain sections more than they did others so the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections [Music] pmc would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies and another new form of music was born live performance when it was incredibly successful ended up in what is probably acoustically the worst sounding venues on the planet sports stadiums basketball arenas and hockey arenas musicians that who ended up there did the best they could they wrote what is now called arena rock which is medium speed ballads [Music] they did the best they could given that this is what they're writing for the tempos are medium it sounds big it's more a social situation than a musical situation and in some ways the music that they're writing for this place works perfectly so there's more new venues one of the new ones is the automobile I grew up with a radio in a car but now that's evolved into something else the car is a whole venue the music that I would say is written for automobiles sound systems works perfectly on it it might not be what you want to listen to at home but it works great in the car has a huge frequency spectrum you know big bass and high end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle automobile music you can share with your friends there's one other kind of new venue the private mp3 player presumably this is just for Christian music you and in some ways just like Carnegie Hall or that when they were told the audience had to hush up because you can now hear every single detail in other ways it's more like the West African music because if the music and an mp3 player gets too quiet you turn it up in the next minute your ears are blasted out by a louder passage so that doesn't really work I think pop music mainly that's written today to some extent is written for these kind of players for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail but the dynamic doesn't change that much so I asked myself okay is this a model for creation this adaptation that we do and does it happen anywhere else well according to David Attenborough and some other people birds do it too that the birds in the canopy where the foliage is dense they're calls tend to be high-pitched short and repetitive and the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls so that they don't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor and birds like this Savannah sparrow they tend to have a buzzing type call and it turns out that sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the field and Savannah other birds like this can injure have adapted within the same species the Tanager and the east coast of the United States where the Forester little denser has one kind of call and the Tanager on the other side on the West has a different kind of call so birds do it too and I thought well if this is a model for creation if we make music primarily the form at least to fit these contexts and if we make art to fit gallery walls and museum walls and if we write software to fit existing operating systems is that how it works yeah I think it's it's evolutionary it's adaptive but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there this is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional romantic view the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion and then somehow it gets shaped into something and I'm saying well the passion is still there but the vessel that it's going to be injected into important to that is instinctively and intuitively created first we already know where that passion is going but this conflict of views is kind of interesting the writer thomas frank says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests that voters like a lot of us assume that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere that it's coming from the gut that it's passionate that it's more authentic and they'll vote for that so that if somebody can fake sincerity if they can fake passion they stand a better chance of being selected in that way which seems a little dangerous I'm saying the two the passion the joy are not mutually exclusive maybe what the world means now is for us to realize that we are like the birds we adapt we sing and like the birds the joy is still there even though we have changed what we do to fit the context thank you very much [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] this is the venue where as a young man some of the music that I wrote was first performed it was remarkably a pretty good sounding room with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere it actually sounded pretty good this is a song that was recorded there this is not talking heads in the picture anyway [Music] so the nature of the room meant that words could be understood the lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood the sound system was kind of decent and there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room so the rhythms could be pretty intact - pretty concise other places around the country had similar rooms this is Tootsie's orchid lounge in Nashville the music was in some ways different but in structure in form very much the same the clientele behavior was very much the same - and so the bands at Tootsie's or at CBGB's had to play loud enough - the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing since then I've played other places that are much nicer I've played the Disney Hall here and Carnegie Hall and places like that and it's been very exciting but I also noticed that sometimes the music that I had written or was writing at the time didn't sound all that great and some of those halls we managed but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited to the music I was making or had made so I asked myself do I write stuff for specific rooms do I have a place a venue in mind when I write is that a kind of model for creativity do we all make things with a venue or context in mind okay Africa most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in West Africa and the music there I would say the instruments the intricate rhythms the way it's played the setting the context it's all perfect it all works perfect the music works perfectly in that setting there's no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms the instruments are loud enough the that can be heard without amplification etc etc it's no accident it's perfect for that particular context and it would be a mess in a context like this this is a Gothic cathedral in a Gothic cathedral this kind of music is perfect it doesn't change key the notes are long is almost no rhythm whatsoever and the room flatters the music it actually improves it this is the room that Bach wrote some of his music for this is the organ it's not as big as a Gothic cathedral so he can write things were a little bit more intricate he can very innovatively actually change keys without risking huge distances [Music] this is a little bit later this is the kinds of rooms that Mozart wrote I think we're in like 1770 somewhere around there they're smaller even less reverberant so he can write really freely music that's very intricate and the it works it fits the room perfectly this is La Scala some around the same time I think was built around 1776 people in the audience and these opera houses when they were built they used to yell out to one another they used to eat drink and yell out to people on the stage just like they do with CBGB's in places like that if they liked an area they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore not at the end of the show but immediately and well that's that's was an opera experience this is the Opera House that vogner built for himself and the size of the room is not that big it's smaller than this but well vogner minute innovation he wanted a bigger band he wanted a little more bomb bass so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there [Music] okay this is Carnegie Hall obviously this kind of thing became popular the halls got bigger Carnegie Hall is fair size it's larger than some of the other Symphony halls and they're a lot more reverberant than La Scala around the same time according to Alex Ross who writes for The New Yorker this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet no more eating drinking and yelling at the stage or gossiping with one another during the show they had to be very quiet so those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls it meant that there could be extreme dynamics which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music quiet parts can be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting but because of the reverberation in those rooms like Carnegie Hall the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic in a little more textural with Mahler it looks like Bob Dylan but it's smaller that was Bob's last record yeah popular music coming along at the same time this is a jazz band according to Scott Joplin the bands were playing on riverboats and in clubs again it's noisy they're playing for dancers and there's certain sections of the song the songs had different sections and they that the dance was really liked and they say play that part again well there's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers so the band started to improvise new melodies been a new form of music was born these are played mainly in small rooms people are dancing shouting and drinking so the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that same thing goes true for okay that's beginning of the century for the whole 20th century popular music whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever it doesn't really change that much it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century when this became one of the primary venues for music and this was one way that the music got their microphones enabled singers in particular and musicians and composers to completely change the kind of music that they were writing so far a lot of the stuff that was on the radio is live music but singers like Frank Sinatra could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone other singers after

instinctively and intuitively created first we already know where that passion is going but this conflict of views is kind of interesting the writer thomas frank says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests that voters like a lot of us assume that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere that it's coming from the gut that it's passionate that it's more authentic and they'll vote for that so that if somebody can fake sincerity if they can fake passion they stand a better chance of being selected in that way which seems a little dangerous I'm saying the two the passion the joy are not mutually exclusive maybe what the world means now is for us to realize that we are like the birds we adapt we sing and like the birds the joy is still there even though we have changed what we do to fit the context thank you very much [Applause]

**Transcript**:
Imagine being a fossil: touring the world's great museums, inspiring awe in onlookers of all ages, posing for hordes of fawning photographers. Sound like something you'd like? Well, good luck! At least 99.9% of creatures that have ever lived aren't preserved in the fossil record. But forget about them, everyone else will, and listen up! If you want your corpse in the exclusive 0.01% Club, the Hall of Preserved Fossil Fame, it will not be easy. You better work! Step one: die. It's a cold, hard fact of fossilization. Everything paleontologists find was once alive and, at some point, died. We'll skip the details and assume you had a long, fulfilling life so we can get to what is really important -- how you die. There are many ways to become a fossil, so let's highlight your top death options. You could get yourself trapped in tree sap, which, when hardens, turns into amber and can survive intact for millions of years. But unless you find a really big tree to sit under, amber preservation will likely remain the domain of insects and other very small animals. Generally, the right place to be if you want to end up a fossil is wherever sediment is actively being deposited, like a lake or an ocean floor. A mountaintop or prairie? Not good! You need to get buried, the faster the better, because the longer you hang around on the surface, the more likely you'll get eaten, scavenged, or otherwise destroyed before ever having a chance to get preserved. If you can get buried someplace with little to no oxygen, like a bog or a deep lake bottom, even better. That lack of oxygen will slow down your decay and give you more time to fossilize. So, let's say you're lucky enough to die and get buried in a shallow sea under muddy, sandy sediments. What's your next move? One option is a process called permineralization. While all your soft parts decay away, your bones get saturated with mineral-rich waters. Bit by bit, microscopic crystals precipitate out of these waters to fill in the empty spaces and pores in your bones. Otherwise, you'd better hope the sediments around you harden while your bones decay away and another sediment or mineral fills in the spaces your bones leave behind, creating a perfect cast of your skeleton. Over time, the sediments around your fossil will lithify or turn into rock. But you're not in the clear yet! Many things could happen to those sedimentary rocks that might destroy your chances of getting discovered. They could get uplifted into a mountain range and eroded away or carried along in an oceanic plate and subducted back into the Earth's mantle, melting your fossil into hot mush. Fingers crossed your rock surroundings will get gently lifted up by plate tectonics, sea levels will change, and you'll end up under dry land close to the surface, but not so close that erosion from wind and rain wipes you away before someone can come find you. The last step in this long process, an intrepid paleontologist has to come find you. Maybe she's a research scientist scouting for fossils your age and type or just an amateur collector hoping for a fortuitous find. She whacks away at layers of rock above you or spots your fossil exposed in a creek bank after a flood. And there you are, a magnificent scientific discovery, millions of years in the making! She and her colleagues gently extract you from the surrounding sediment, measure and photograph all the bits and pieces they find, and begin the complex task of reconstructing how and when you lived based on the evidence they find in your bones. Paleontologists will be some of your biggest fans along with all those admiring crowds at the museum. You made it! You spent years underground in obscurity, shedding blood, sweat, tears, and your internal organs. You worked yourself to the bone until your bones disintegrated and were replaced by minerals and sediments. But it was all worth it because you're a famous fossil! Now, you better hold that pose!

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is related to the process of fossilization, while the generated MCQs are related to astrophysics and cosmology.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the general concept of "processes that affect something," I would choose:

None

But if I really had to choose, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar, as it talks about a process (adding energy or mass to space) and its effect on space. However, this is a very loose connection, and I would not consider it a good match.

Index: 4 (with a big caveat that it's not a good match)

Please note that the generated MCQs seem to be from a different topic or domain, and it's not possible to find a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine being a fossil: touring the world's great museums, inspiring awe in onlookers of all ages, posing for hordes of fawning photographers. Sound like something you'd like? Well, good luck! At least 99.9% of creatures that have ever lived aren't preserved in the fossil record. But forget about them, everyone else will, and listen up! If you want your corpse in the exclusive 0.01% Club, the Hall of Preserved Fossil Fame, it will not be easy. You better work! Step one: die. It's a cold, hard fact of fossilization. Everything paleontologists find was once alive and, at some point, died. We'll skip the details and assume you had a long, fulfilling life so we can get to what is really important -- how you die. There are many ways to become a fossil, so let's highlight your top death options. You could get yourself trapped in tree sap, which, when hardens, turns into amber and can survive intact for millions of years. But unless you find a really big tree to sit under, amber preservation will likely remain the domain of insects and other very small animals. Generally, the right place to be if you want to end up a fossil is wherever sediment is actively being deposited, like a lake or an ocean floor. A mountaintop or prairie? Not good! You need to get buried, the faster the better, because the longer you hang around on the surface, the more likely you'll get eaten, scavenged, or otherwise destroyed before ever having a chance to get preserved. If you can get buried someplace with little to no oxygen, like a bog or a deep lake bottom, even better. That lack of oxygen will slow down your decay and give you more time to fossilize. So, let's say you're lucky enough to die and get buried in a shallow sea under muddy, sandy sediments. What's your next move? One option is a process called permineralization. While all your soft parts decay away, your bones get saturated with mineral-rich waters. Bit by bit, microscopic crystals precipitate out of these waters to fill in the empty spaces and pores in your bones. Otherwise, you'd better hope the sediments around you harden while your bones decay away and another sediment or mineral fills in the spaces your bones leave behind, creating a perfect cast of your skeleton. Over time, the sediments around your fossil will lithify or turn into rock. But you're not in the clear yet! Many things could happen to those sedimentary rocks that might destroy your chances of getting discovered. They could get uplifted into a mountain range and eroded away or carried along in an oceanic plate and subducted back into the Earth's mantle, melting your fossil into hot mush. Fingers crossed your rock surroundings will get gently lifted up by plate tectonics, sea levels will change, and you'll end up under dry land close to the surface, but not so close that erosion from wind and rain wipes you away before someone can come find you. The last step in this long process, an intrepid paleontologist has to come find you. Maybe she's a research scientist scouting for fossils your age and type or just an amateur collector hoping for a fortuitous find. She whacks away at layers of rock above you or spots your fossil exposed in a creek bank after a flood. And there you are, a magnificent scientific discovery, millions of years in the making! She and her colleagues gently extract you from the surrounding sediment, measure and photograph all the bits and pieces they find, and begin the complex task of reconstructing how and when you lived based on the evidence they find in your bones. Paleontologists will be some of your biggest fans along with all those admiring crowds at the museum. You made it! You spent years underground in obscurity, shedding blood, sweat, tears, and your internal organs. You worked yourself to the bone until your bones disintegrated and were replaced by minerals and sediments. But it was all worth it because you're a famous fossil! Now, you better hold that pose!

I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that by far most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light we can stand on the earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes The Sun Burns our peripheral vision we see light reflected off the moon and in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies the known universe has come to us through light across vast eras in Cosmic history and with all of our modern telescopes we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe these sort of series of snapshots that go all the way back to the big bang and yet the universe is not a silent movie cu the universe isn't silent I'd like to convince you that the Universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on Space itself because space can wobble like a drum it can ring out a kind of recording throughout the Universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of Glorious visual composition that we have of the universe a sort of Sonic composition and uh while we've never heard the sounds from space we really should in the next few years start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there and so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe we turn our Focus to black holes and the promise they have because black holes can bang on SpaceTime like mallets on a drum and they have a very characteristic song which I'd like to play for you some of our predictions for what that song will be like now black holes are dark against a dark sky we can't see them directly they're not brought to us with light at least not directly we can see them indirectly because black holes are weak havoc on their environment they destroy Stars around them they churn up debris in their surroundings but they won't come to us directly through light we might one day see a Shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background but we haven't yet and yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen and that's because they bang on SpaceTime like a drum now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein to whom we owe so much Einstein realized that if space were empty if the universe were empty it would be like this picture except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it but if we were freely falling through the space even without this helpful grid we might be able to paint it ourselves because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines undeflected straight paths through the universe Einstein also realized and this is the real meat of the matter that if you put energy or mass in the universe it would curve space and a freely falling object would pass by let's say the sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in that space it was Einstein's great general theory of relativity now even light will be bent by those paths and you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun as the Earth is or the moon around the earth these are the natural Curves in space what Einstein did not realize was that if you took our sun and you crushed it down to 6 km so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to 6 km across you would make a black hole an object so dense that if light veered too close it would never escape a dark shadow against the universe it wasn't Einstein who realized this it was uh Carl schwar Shield who was a German Jew in World War I join the German Army already an accomplished scientist working on the uh Russian front who I like to imagine short shield in the war in the trenches you know calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire and then in between calculating Einstein's equations you know as you do in the trenches and he was reading Einstein's recently published general theory of relativity and he was thrilled by this Theory and he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary curves so strong that space would rain down into them space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole and even light could not escape this current light would be drag down the hole as everything else would be and all that would be left would be a shadow now he wrote to Einstein and he said as you will see the war has been kind to me enough uh between despite the heavy gunfire um I've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas and Einstein was very impressed with this exact solution and and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist um you know this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions and he took schwar Shield's idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week but Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical Oddity he did not believe they existed in nature he thought nature would protect us from their formation it was decades before the term black hole was coined and people realize that black holes are real astrophysical objects in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it's actually not massive enough but if we did a little thought experiment as Einstein was very fond of doing we could imagine putting the sun crushed down to 6 kilm and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit maybe 30 kilometers outside of of the Black Hole Sun and it would be self-illuminated because now the sun's gone we have no other source of light so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated and you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this uh crushed black hole this crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan more or less it would it might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth but you know basically that's what we're talking we're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan so we move this Earth very close 30 kmers outside and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole there's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe but you actually have to get very close to fall in but what's very impressive is that from our vantage point we can always see the Earth it cannot hide behind the black hole the light from the earth some of it falls in but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us so you can't hide anything behind a black hole If This Were battl Star Galactica and you're fighting the syons don't hide behind the black hole you know they can see you okay now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it's not massive enough but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy and if one were to eclipse the Milky Way this is what it would look like we would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy and its luminous dust lanes and if we were to fall towards this black hole we would see all of that light lensed around it and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't any more than light can escape but even though the black hole is dark from the outside it's not dark on the inside because all of the light from the Galaxy can fall in behind us and even though due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation our clocks would seem to slow down relative to Galactic time it would look as though the evolution of the Galaxy had been sped up and shot at us right before you know we were crushed to death by the black hole it would be like a um a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel but it's like a total death experience and there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole but black holes can be heard even if they're not seen uh imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes each one 10 times the mass of the Sun so now we're going to crush them down to 60 km across they can be spinning hundreds of times a second at the end of their lives they're going around each other very near the speed of light so they're Crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second and as they do so they not only curve space but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space an actual wave on SpaceTime space squeezes and stretch Es as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe and they travel out into the world uh into the cosmos at the speed of light this uh computer simulation is due to a relativity group at Nasa Goddard it took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem this was one of the groups it shows two black holes in orbit around each other again with these helpfully painted curves and if you can see it's kind of faint but if you can see the red waves emanating out those are the gravitational waves they are literally the sounds of space ringing and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coales to one spinning quiet black hole at the end of the day if you were standing near enough your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space you would literally hear the sound now of course your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully so you might have trouble understanding what's going on but um I'd like to play for you the sound uh that we predict this is from my group a slightly less glamorous um computer modeling but imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole the sound you're hearing is a light black hole banging on Space each time it gets close if it gets far away it's a little too quiet but it comes in like a mallet and it literally cracks space wobbling it like a drum and we can predict what the sound will be we know that as it falls in it gets faster and it gets louder and eventually we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy and it's gone now I've never heard it that loud it's actually more dramatic at home sounds kind of anticlimactic it's like ding ding ding um this is uh another sound from my group now I'm not showing you any images because black holes don't leave behind helpful Trails of ink and space is not painted showing you the curves but if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this you want to get moving want to get away from the sound both black holes are moving both black holes are getting closer together in this case they're both wobbling quite a lot and then they're going to merge and it's gone now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging that it chirps up at the end now that's our prediction for what we'll see luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach California and surely somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged and surely the space around us is ringing after maybe traveling a million light years or a million years at the speed of light to get to us but the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever here there are very industrious experiments being built on Earth one called ligo which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over 4 kilm it's a remarkably ambitious experiment and it's going to be Advanced sensitivity within the next few years to pick this up there's also a mission proposed for space which hopefully will launch in the next 10 years called Lisa and Lisa will be able to see super massive black holes black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun in this Hubble image we see two galaxies they look like they're frozen and some Embrace and each one probably har is a super massive black hole at its core but they're not frozen they're actually merging these two black holes are colliding and they will merge over a billion-year time scale it's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration but Lisa could see the final stages of two super massive black holes earlier in the universe's history the last 15 minutes before they fall together and it's not just black holes but it's also any big disturbance in the universe and the biggest of them all is the big bang you know when that expression was coined it was derisive like oh who would believe in a big bang you know but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang it might make a sound this animation from my friends at proton Studio shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside we don't ever want to do that actually we want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe so imagine you're inside the Big Bang it's everywhere it's all around you in the space is WI wobbling chaotically 14 billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us galaxies form and generations of stars form in those galaxies and around one star at least one star is a habitable planet and here we are frantically building these experiments doing these calculations writing these computer codes imagine a billion years ago two black holes collided that song has been ringing through space for all all that time we weren't even here you know it gets closer and closer 40,000 years ago we're still doing cave paintings it's like hurry build your instruments it's getting closer and closer and in 20 whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at Advanced sensitivity we'll build them we'll turn on the machines and bang we'll catch it the first song from space if it was the Big Bang that we were going to pick up it would sound like this it's a terrible sound it's literally the definition of noise it's white noise it's such a chaotic ringing but it's around us everywhere presumably if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe and if we pick it up it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation of our observable universe so within the next few years we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit render uh the universe in audio but if we detect those earliest moments it'll bring us that that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest most elusive questions if we run the movie of our universe backwards we know that there was a big bang in our past and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it but was our big bang the only big bang I mean we have to ask has it happened before will it happen again I mean in the spirit of rising to Ted's challenge to reignite wonder we can ask questions at least for this last minute that honestly might evade us forever but we have to ask is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history or is it possible that we're just a branch off of a Multiverse each branch with its own Big Bang in its past maybe some of them with black holes playing drums maybe some without you know maybe some with sensient life and maybe some without not in our past not in our future but some fundamentally connected to us so we have to wonder if there is a Multiverse in some other patch of that Multiverse are there creatures here's my Multiverse creatures are there other creatures in the Multiverse wondering about us and wondering about their own Origins and if they are I can imagine them uh as we are calculating writing computer code building instruments uh trying to detect that faintest sound of their Origins and wondering who else is out there thank you thank you

**Transcript**:
I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that by far most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light we can stand on the earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes The Sun Burns our peripheral vision we see light reflected off the moon and in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies the known universe has come to us through light across vast eras in Cosmic history and with all of our modern telescopes we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe these sort of series of snapshots that go all the way back to the big bang and yet the universe is not a silent movie cu the universe isn't silent I'd like to convince you that the Universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on Space itself because space can wobble like a drum it can ring out a kind of recording throughout the Universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of Glorious visual composition that we have of the universe a sort of Sonic composition and uh while we've never heard the sounds from space we really should in the next few years start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there and so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe we turn our Focus to black holes and the promise they have because black holes can bang on SpaceTime like mallets on a drum and they have a very characteristic song which I'd like to play for you some of our predictions for what that song will be like now black holes are dark against a dark sky we can't see them directly they're not brought to us with light at least not directly we can see them indirectly because black holes are weak havoc on their environment they destroy Stars around them they churn up debris in their surroundings but they won't come to us directly through light we might one day see a Shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background but we haven't yet and yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen and that's because they bang on SpaceTime like a drum now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein to whom we owe so much Einstein realized that if space were empty if the universe were empty it would be like this picture except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it but if we were freely falling through the space even without this helpful grid we might be able to paint it ourselves because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines undeflected straight paths through the universe Einstein also realized and this is the real meat of the matter that if you put energy or mass in the universe it would curve space and a freely falling object would pass by let's say the sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in that space it was Einstein's great general theory of relativity now even light will be bent by those paths and you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun as the Earth is or the moon around the earth these are the natural Curves in space what Einstein did not realize was that if you took our sun and you crushed it down to 6 km so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to 6 km across you would make a black hole an object so dense that if light veered too close it would never escape a dark shadow against the universe it wasn't Einstein who realized this it was uh Carl schwar Shield who was a German Jew in World War I join the German Army already an accomplished scientist working on the uh Russian front who I like to imagine short shield in the war in the trenches you know calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire and then in between calculating Einstein's equations you know as you do in the trenches and he was reading Einstein's recently published general theory of relativity and he was thrilled by this Theory and he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary curves so strong that space would rain down into them space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole and even light could not escape this current light would be drag down the hole as everything else would be and all that would be left would be a shadow now he wrote to Einstein and he said as you will see the war has been kind to me enough uh between despite the heavy gunfire um I've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas and Einstein was very impressed with this exact solution and and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist um you know this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions and he took schwar Shield's idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week but Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical Oddity he did not believe they existed in nature he thought nature would protect us from their formation it was decades before the term black hole was coined and people realize that black holes are real astrophysical objects in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it's actually not massive enough but if we did a little thought experiment as Einstein was very fond of doing we could imagine putting the sun crushed down to 6 kilm and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit maybe 30 kilometers outside of of the Black Hole Sun and it would be self-illuminated because now the sun's gone we have no other source of light so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated and you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this uh crushed black hole this crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan more or less it would it might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth but you know basically that's what we're talking we're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan so we move this Earth very close 30 kmers outside and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole there's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe but you actually have to get very close to fall in but what's very impressive is that from our vantage point we can always see the Earth it cannot hide behind the black hole the light from the earth some of it falls in but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us so you can't hide anything behind a black hole If This Were battl Star Galactica and you're fighting the syons don't hide behind the black hole you know they can see you okay now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it's not massive enough but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy and if one were to eclipse the Milky Way this is what it would look like we would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy and its luminous dust lanes and if we were to fall towards this black hole we would see all of that light lensed around it and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't any more than light can escape but even though the black hole is dark from the outside it's not dark on the inside because all of the light from the Galaxy can fall in behind us and even though due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation our clocks would seem to slow down relative to Galactic time it would look as though the evolution of the Galaxy had been sped up and shot at us right before you know we were crushed to death by the black hole it would be like a um a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel but it's like a total death experience and there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole but black holes can be heard even if they're not seen uh imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes each one 10 times the mass of the Sun so now we're going to crush them down to 60 km across they can be spinning hundreds of times a second at the end of their lives they're going around each other very near the speed of light so they're Crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second and as they do so they not only curve space but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space an actual wave on SpaceTime space squeezes and stretch Es as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe and they travel out into the world uh into the cosmos at the speed of light this uh computer simulation is due to a relativity group at Nasa Goddard it took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem this was one of the groups it shows two black holes in orbit around each other again with these helpfully painted curves and if you can see it's kind of faint but if you can see the red waves emanating out those are the gravitational waves they are literally the sounds of space ringing and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coales to one spinning quiet black hole at the end of the day if you were standing near enough your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space you would literally hear the sound now of course your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully so you might have trouble understanding what's going on but um I'd like to play for you the sound uh that we predict this is from my group a slightly less glamorous um computer modeling but imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole the sound you're hearing is a light black hole banging on Space each time it gets close if it gets far away it's a little too quiet but it comes in like a mallet and it literally cracks space wobbling it like a drum and we can predict what the sound will be we know that as it falls in it gets faster and it gets louder and eventually we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy and it's gone now I've never heard it that loud it's actually more dramatic at home sounds kind of anticlimactic it's like ding ding ding um this is uh another sound from my group now I'm not showing you any images because black holes don't leave behind helpful Trails of ink and space is not painted showing you the curves but if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this you want to get moving want to get away from the sound both black holes are moving both black holes are getting closer together in this case they're both wobbling quite a lot and then they're going to merge and it's gone now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging that it chirps up at the end now that's our prediction for what we'll see luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach California and surely somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged and surely the space around us is ringing after maybe traveling a million light years or a million years at the speed of light to get to us but the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever here there are very industrious experiments being built on Earth one called ligo which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over 4 kilm it's a remarkably ambitious experiment and it's going to be Advanced sensitivity within the next few years to pick this up there's also a mission proposed for space which hopefully will launch in the next 10 years called Lisa and Lisa will be able to see super massive black holes black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun in this Hubble image we see two galaxies they look like they're frozen and some Embrace and each one probably har is a super massive black hole at its core but they're not frozen they're actually merging these two black holes are colliding and they will merge over a billion-year time scale it's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration but Lisa could see the final stages of two super massive black holes earlier in the universe's history the last 15 minutes before they fall together and it's not just black holes but it's also any big disturbance in the universe and the biggest of them all is the big bang you know when that expression was coined it was derisive like oh who would believe in a big bang you know but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang it might make a sound this animation from my friends at proton Studio shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside we don't ever want to do that actually we want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe so imagine you're inside the Big Bang it's everywhere it's all around you in the space is WI wobbling chaotically 14 billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us galaxies form and generations of stars form in those galaxies and around one star at least one star is a habitable planet and here we are frantically building these experiments doing these calculations writing these computer codes imagine a billion years ago two black holes collided that song has been ringing through space for all all that time we weren't even here you know it gets closer and closer 40,000 years ago we're still doing cave paintings it's like hurry build your instruments it's getting closer and closer and in 20 whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at Advanced sensitivity we'll build them we'll turn on the machines and bang we'll catch it the first song from space if it was the Big Bang that we were going to pick up it would sound like this it's a terrible sound it's literally the definition of noise it's white noise it's such a chaotic ringing but it's around us everywhere presumably if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe and if we pick it up it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation of our observable universe so within the next few years we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit render uh the universe in audio but if we detect those earliest moments it'll bring us that that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest most elusive questions if we run the movie of our universe backwards we know that there was a big bang in our past and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it but was our big bang the only big bang I mean we have to ask has it happened before will it happen again I mean in the spirit of rising to Ted's challenge to reignite wonder we can ask questions at least for this last minute that honestly might evade us forever but we have to ask is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history or is it possible that we're just a branch off of a Multiverse each branch with its own Big Bang in its past maybe some of them with black holes playing drums maybe some without you know maybe some with sensient life and maybe some without not in our past not in our future but some fundamentally connected to us so we have to wonder if there is a Multiverse in some other patch of that Multiverse are there creatures here's my Multiverse creatures are there other creatures in the Multiverse wondering about us and wondering about their own Origins and if they are I can imagine them uh as we are calculating writing computer code building instruments uh trying to detect that faintest sound of their Origins and wondering who else is out there thank you thank you

any images because black holes don't leave behind helpful Trails of ink and space is not painted showing you the curves but if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this you want to get moving want to get away from the sound both black holes are moving both black holes are getting closer together in this case they're both wobbling quite a lot and then they're going to merge and it's gone now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging that it chirps up at the end now that's our prediction for what we'll see luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach California and surely somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged and surely the space around us is ringing after maybe traveling a million light years or a million years at the speed of light to get to us but the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever here there are very industrious experiments being built on Earth one called ligo which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over 4 kilm it's a remarkably ambitious experiment and it's going to be Advanced sensitivity within the next few years to pick this up there's also a mission proposed for space which hopefully will launch in the next 10 years called Lisa and Lisa will be able to see super massive black holes black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun in this Hubble image we see two galaxies they look like they're frozen and some Embrace and each one probably har is a super massive black hole at its core but they're not frozen they're actually merging these two black holes are colliding and they will merge over a billion-year time scale it's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration but Lisa could see the final stages of two super massive black holes earlier in the universe's history the last 15 minutes before they fall together and it's not just black holes but it's also any big disturbance in the universe and the biggest of them all is the big bang you know when that expression was coined it was derisive like oh who would believe in a big bang you know but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang it might make a sound this animation from my friends at proton Studio shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside we don't ever want to do that actually we want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe so imagine you're inside the Big Bang it's everywhere it's all around you in the space is WI wobbling chaotically 14 billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us galaxies form and generations of stars form in those galaxies and around one star at least one star is a habitable planet and here we are frantically building these experiments doing these calculations writing these computer codes imagine a billion years ago two black holes collided that song has been ringing through space for all all that time we weren't even here you know it gets closer and closer 40,000 years ago we're still doing cave paintings it's like hurry build your instruments it's getting closer and closer and in 20 whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at Advanced sensitivity we'll build them we'll turn on the machines and bang we'll catch it the first song from space if it was the Big Bang that we were going to pick up it would sound like this it's a terrible sound it's literally the definition of noise it's white noise it's such a chaotic ringing but it's around us everywhere presumably if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe and if we pick it up it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation of our observable universe so within the next few years we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit render uh the universe in audio but if we detect those earliest moments it'll bring us that that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest most elusive questions if we run the movie of our universe backwards we know that there was a big bang in our past and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it but was our big bang the only big bang I mean we have to ask has it happened before will it happen again I mean in the spirit of rising to Ted's challenge to reignite wonder we can ask questions at least for this last minute that honestly might evade us forever but we have to ask is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history or is it possible that we're just a branch off of a Multiverse each branch with its own Big Bang in its past maybe some of them with black holes playing drums maybe some without you know maybe some with sensient life and maybe some without not in our past not in our future but some fundamentally connected to us so we have to wonder if there is a Multiverse in some other patch of that Multiverse are there creatures here's my Multiverse creatures are there other creatures in the Multiverse wondering about us and wondering about their own Origins and if they are I can imagine them uh as we are calculating writing computer code building instruments uh trying to detect that faintest sound of their Origins and wondering who else is out there thank you thank you

**Transcript**:
I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that by far most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light we can stand on the earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes The Sun Burns our peripheral vision we see light reflected off the moon and in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies the known universe has come to us through light across vast eras in Cosmic history and with all of our modern telescopes we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe these sort of series of snapshots that go all the way back to the big bang and yet the universe is not a silent movie cu the universe isn't silent I'd like to convince you that the Universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on Space itself because space can wobble like a drum it can ring out a kind of recording throughout the Universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of Glorious visual composition that we have of the universe a sort of Sonic composition and uh while we've never heard the sounds from space we really should in the next few years start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there and so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe we turn our Focus to black holes and the promise they have because black holes can bang on SpaceTime like mallets on a drum and they have a very characteristic song which I'd like to play for you some of our predictions for what that song will be like now black holes are dark against a dark sky we can't see them directly they're not brought to us with light at least not directly we can see them indirectly because black holes are weak havoc on their environment they destroy Stars around them they churn up debris in their surroundings but they won't come to us directly through light we might one day see a Shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background but we haven't yet and yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen and that's because they bang on SpaceTime like a drum now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein to whom we owe so much Einstein realized that if space were empty if the universe were empty it would be like this picture except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it but if we were freely falling through the space even without this helpful grid we might be able to paint it ourselves because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines undeflected straight paths through the universe Einstein also realized and this is the real meat of the matter that if you put energy or mass in the universe it would curve space and a freely falling object would pass by let's say the sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in that space it was Einstein's great general theory of relativity now even light will be bent by those paths and you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun as the Earth is or the moon around the earth these are the natural Curves in space what Einstein did not realize was that if you took our sun and you crushed it down to 6 km so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to 6 km across you would make a black hole an object so dense that if light veered too close it would never escape a dark shadow against the universe it wasn't Einstein who realized this it was uh Carl schwar Shield who was a German Jew in World War I join the German Army already an accomplished scientist working on the uh Russian front who I like to imagine short shield in the war in the trenches you know calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire and then in between calculating Einstein's equations you know as you do in the trenches and he was reading Einstein's recently published general theory of relativity and he was thrilled by this Theory and he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary curves so strong that space would rain down into them space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole and even light could not escape this current light would be drag down the hole as everything else would be and all that would be left would be a shadow now he wrote to Einstein and he said as you will see the war has been kind to me enough uh between despite the heavy gunfire um I've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas and Einstein was very impressed with this exact solution and and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist um you know this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions and he took schwar Shield's idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week but Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical Oddity he did not believe they existed in nature he thought nature would protect us from their formation it was decades before the term black hole was coined and people realize that black holes are real astrophysical objects in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it's actually not massive enough but if we did a little thought experiment as Einstein was very fond of doing we could imagine putting the sun crushed down to 6 kilm and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit maybe 30 kilometers outside of of the Black Hole Sun and it would be self-illuminated because now the sun's gone we have no other source of light so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated and you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this uh crushed black hole this crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan more or less it would it might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth but you know basically that's what we're talking we're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan so we move this Earth very close 30 kmers outside and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole there's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe but you actually have to get very close to fall in but what's very impressive is that from our vantage point we can always see the Earth it cannot hide behind the black hole the light from the earth some of it falls in but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us so you can't hide anything behind a black hole If This Were battl Star Galactica and you're fighting the syons don't hide behind the black hole you know they can see you okay now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it's not massive enough but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy and if one were to eclipse the Milky Way this is what it would look like we would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy and its luminous dust lanes and if we were to fall towards this black hole we would see all of that light lensed around it and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't any more than light can escape but even though the black hole is dark from the outside it's not dark on the inside because all of the light from the Galaxy can fall in behind us and even though due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation our clocks would seem to slow down relative to Galactic time it would look as though the evolution of the Galaxy had been sped up and shot at us right before you know we were crushed to death by the black hole it would be like a um a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel but it's like a total death experience and there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole but black holes can be heard even if they're not seen uh imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes each one 10 times the mass of the Sun so now we're going to crush them down to 60 km across they can be spinning hundreds of times a second at the end of their lives they're going around each other very near the speed of light so they're Crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second and as they do so they not only curve space but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space an actual wave on SpaceTime space squeezes and stretch Es as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe and they travel out into the world uh into the cosmos at the speed of light this uh computer simulation is due to a relativity group at Nasa Goddard it took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem this was one of the groups it shows two black holes in orbit around each other again with these helpfully painted curves and if you can see it's kind of faint but if you can see the red waves emanating out those are the gravitational waves they are literally the sounds of space ringing and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coales to one spinning quiet black hole at the end of the day if you were standing near enough your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space you would literally hear the sound now of course your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully so you might have trouble understanding what's going on but um I'd like to play for you the sound uh that we predict this is from my group a slightly less glamorous um computer modeling but imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole the sound you're hearing is a light black hole banging on Space each time it gets close if it gets far away it's a little too quiet but it comes in like a mallet and it literally cracks space wobbling it like a drum and we can predict what the sound will be we know that as it falls in it gets faster and it gets louder and eventually we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy and it's gone now I've never heard it that loud it's actually more dramatic at home sounds kind of anticlimactic it's like ding ding ding um this is uh another sound from my group now I'm not showing you

the end of their lifetime now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it's actually not massive enough but if we did a little thought experiment as Einstein was very fond of doing we could imagine putting the sun crushed down to 6 kilm and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit maybe 30 kilometers outside of of the Black Hole Sun and it would be self-illuminated because now the sun's gone we have no other source of light so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated and you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this uh crushed black hole this crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan more or less it would it might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth but you know basically that's what we're talking we're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan so we move this Earth very close 30 kmers outside and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole there's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe but you actually have to get very close to fall in but what's very impressive is that from our vantage point we can always see the Earth it cannot hide behind the black hole the light from the earth some of it falls in but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us so you can't hide anything behind a black hole If This Were battl Star Galactica and you're fighting the syons don't hide behind the black hole you know they can see you okay now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it's not massive enough but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy and if one were to eclipse the Milky Way this is what it would look like we would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy and its luminous dust lanes and if we were to fall towards this black hole we would see all of that light lensed around it and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't any more than light can escape but even though the black hole is dark from the outside it's not dark on the inside because all of the light from the Galaxy can fall in behind us and even though due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation our clocks would seem to slow down relative to Galactic time it would look as though the evolution of the Galaxy had been sped up and shot at us right before you know we were crushed to death by the black hole it would be like a um a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel but it's like a total death experience and there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole but black holes can be heard even if they're not seen uh imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes each one 10 times the mass of the Sun so now we're going to crush them down to 60 km across they can be spinning hundreds of times a second at the end of their lives they're going around each other very near the speed of light so they're Crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second and as they do so they not only curve space but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space an actual wave on SpaceTime space squeezes and stretch Es as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe and they travel out into the world uh into the cosmos at the speed of light this uh computer simulation is due to a relativity group at Nasa Goddard it took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem this was one of the groups it shows two black holes in orbit around each other again with these helpfully painted curves and if you can see it's kind of faint but if you can see the red waves emanating out those are the gravitational waves they are literally the sounds of space ringing and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coales to one spinning quiet black hole at the end of the day if you were standing near enough your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space you would literally hear the sound now of course your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully so you might have trouble understanding what's going on but um I'd like to play for you the sound uh that we predict this is from my group a slightly less glamorous um computer modeling but imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole the sound you're hearing is a light black hole banging on Space each time it gets close if it gets far away it's a little too quiet but it comes in like a mallet and it literally cracks space wobbling it like a drum and we can predict what the sound will be we know that as it falls in it gets faster and it gets louder and eventually we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy and it's gone now I've never heard it that loud it's actually more dramatic at home sounds kind of anticlimactic it's like ding ding ding um this is uh another sound from my group now I'm not showing you any images because black holes don't leave behind helpful Trails of ink and space is not painted showing you the curves but if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this you want to get moving want to get away from the sound both black holes are moving both black holes are getting closer together in this case they're both wobbling quite a lot and then they're going to merge and it's gone now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging that it chirps up at the end now that's our prediction for what we'll see luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach California and surely somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged and surely the space around us is ringing after maybe traveling a million light years or a million years at the speed of light to get to us but the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever here there are very industrious experiments being built on Earth one called ligo which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over 4 kilm it's a remarkably ambitious experiment and it's going to be Advanced sensitivity within the next few years to pick this up there's also a mission proposed for space which hopefully will launch in the next 10 years called Lisa and Lisa will be able to see super massive black holes black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun in this Hubble image we see two galaxies they look like they're frozen and some Embrace and each one probably har is a super massive black hole at its core but they're not frozen they're actually merging these two black holes are colliding and they will merge over a billion-year time scale it's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration but Lisa could see the final stages of two super massive black holes earlier in the universe's history the last 15 minutes before they fall together and it's not just black holes but it's also any big disturbance in the universe and the biggest of them all is the big bang you know when that expression was coined it was derisive like oh who would believe in a big bang you know but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang it might make a sound this animation from my friends at proton Studio shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside we don't ever want to do that actually we want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe so imagine you're inside the Big Bang it's everywhere it's all around you in the space is WI wobbling chaotically 14 billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us galaxies form and generations of stars form in those galaxies and around one star at least one star is a habitable planet and here we are frantically building these experiments doing these calculations writing these computer codes imagine a billion years ago two black holes collided that song has been ringing through space for all all that time we weren't even here you know it gets closer and closer 40,000 years ago we're still doing cave paintings it's like hurry build your instruments it's getting closer and closer and in 20 whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at Advanced sensitivity we'll build them we'll turn on the machines and bang we'll catch it the first song from space if it was the Big Bang that we were going to pick up it would sound like this it's a terrible sound it's literally the definition of noise it's white noise it's such a chaotic ringing but it's around us everywhere presumably if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe and if we pick it up it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation of our observable universe so within the next few years we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit render uh the universe in audio but if we detect those earliest moments it'll bring us that that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest most elusive questions if we run the movie of our universe backwards we know that there was a big bang in our past and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it but was our big bang the only big bang I mean we have to ask has it happened before will it happen again I mean in the spirit of rising to Ted's challenge to reignite wonder we can ask questions at least for this last minute that honestly might evade us forever but we have to ask is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history or is it possible that we're just a branch off of a Multiverse each branch with its own Big Bang in its past maybe some of them with black holes playing drums maybe some without you know maybe some with sensient life and maybe some without not in our past not in our future but some fundamentally connected to us so we have to wonder if there is a Multiverse in some other patch of that Multiverse are there creatures here's my Multiverse creatures are there other creatures in the Multiverse wondering about us and wondering about their own Origins and if they are I can imagine them uh as we are calculating writing computer code building instruments uh trying to detect that faintest sound of their Origins and wondering who else is out there thank you thank you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to penguins, while the ground truth MCQ is about the Big Bang.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar in terms of question style and format, I would choose:

None

But if I really had to choose, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar in terms of question style, but it's still not similar in terms of content.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and it's likely that the generated MCQs were created for a different topic or context.

If you could provide more context or clarify what you are looking for, I'll be happy to help further.

**Transcript**:
It's the first sense you use
when you're born. One out of every fifty of your genes
is dedicated to it. It must be important, right? Okay, take a deep breath
through your nose. It's your sense of smell, and it's breathtakingly powerful. As an adult, you can distinguish
about 10,000 different smells. Here's how your nose does it. Smell starts when you sniff molecules
from the air into your nostrils. 95% of your nasal cavity is used just to filter that air
before it hits your lungs. But at the very back of your nose is a region called
the olfactory epithelium, a little patch of skin
that's key to everything you smell. The olfactory epithelium has
a layer of olfactory receptor cells, special neurons that sense smells, like the taste buds of your nose. When odor molecules hit
the back of your nose, they get stuck in a layer of mucus
covering the olfactory epithelium. As they dissolve, they bind
to the olfactory receptor cells, which fire and send signals
through the olfactory tract up to your brain. As a side note, you can tell a lot about how good
an animal's sense of smell is by the size of its olfactory epithelium. A dog's olfactory epithelium is 20 times bigger
than your puny human one. But there's still a lot we don't know
about this little patch of cells, too. For example, our olfactory
epithelium is pigmented, and scientists don't really know why. But how do you actually tell
the difference between smells? It turns out that your brain has 40 million different
olfactory receptor neurons, so odor A might trigger neurons 3, 427, and 988, and odor B might trigger neurons 8, 76, and 2,496,678. All of these different combinations let you detect a staggeringly
broad array of smells. Olfactory neurons are always fresh
and ready for action. They're the only neuron in the body
that gets replaced regularly, every four to eight weeks. Once they are triggered,
the signal travels through a bundle called the olfactory tract to destinations all over your brain,
making stops in the amygdala, the thalamus, and the neocortex. This is different from how sight
and sound are processed. Each of those signals goes first
to a relay center in the middle of the cerebral hemisphere and then out to other
regions of the brain. But smell, because it evolved
before most of your other senses, takes a direct route
to these different regions of the brain, where it can trigger
your fight-or-flight response, help you recall memories,
or make your mouth water. But even though we've all got
the same physiological set-up, two nostrils and millions
of olfactory neurons, not everybody smells the same things. One of the most famous examples of this is the ability to smell
so-called "asparagus pee." For about a quarter of the population, urinating after eating asparagus means smelling a distinct odor. The other 75% of us don't notice. And this isn't the only case
of smells differing from nose to nose. For some people, the chemical
androstenone smells like vanilla; to others, it smells like sweaty urine, which is unfortunate because androstenone is commonly found
in tasty things like pork. So with the sweaty urine smellers in mind, pork producers will castrate male pigs to stop them from making androstenone. The inability to smell a scent
is called anosmia, and there are about 100 known examples. People with allicin anosmia
can't smell garlic. Those with eugenol anosmia
can't smell cloves. And some people can't smell anything at all. This kind of full anosmia
could have several causes. Some people are born
without a sense of smell. Others lose it after an accident
or during an illness. If the olfactory epithelium
gets swollen or infected, it can hamper your sense of smell, something you might have experienced
when you were sick. Not being able to smell anything
can mess with your other senses, too. Many people who can't smell at all also can't really taste
the same way the rest of us do. It turns out that how something tastes
is closely related to how it smells. As you chew your food,
air is pushed up your nasal passage, carrying with it the smell of your food. Those scents hit your olfactory epithelium and tell your brain a lot
about what you're eating. Without the ability to smell,
you lose the ability to taste anything more complicated
than the five tastes your taste buds can detect: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and savory. So, the next time you smell exhaust fumes, salty sea air, or roast chicken, you'll know exactly how you've done it and, perhaps, be a little more
thankful that you can.

a layer of olfactory receptor cells, special neurons that sense smells, like the taste buds of your nose. When odor molecules hit
the back of your nose, they get stuck in a layer of mucus
covering the olfactory epithelium. As they dissolve, they bind
to the olfactory receptor cells, which fire and send signals
through the olfactory tract up to your brain. As a side note, you can tell a lot about how good
an animal's sense of smell is by the size of its olfactory epithelium. A dog's olfactory epithelium is 20 times bigger
than your puny human one. But there's still a lot we don't know
about this little patch of cells, too. For example, our olfactory
epithelium is pigmented, and scientists don't really know why. But how do you actually tell
the difference between smells? It turns out that your brain has 40 million different
olfactory receptor neurons, so odor A might trigger neurons 3, 427, and 988, and odor B might trigger neurons 8, 76, and 2,496,678. All of these different combinations let you detect a staggeringly
broad array of smells. Olfactory neurons are always fresh
and ready for action. They're the only neuron in the body
that gets replaced regularly, every four to eight weeks. Once they are triggered,
the signal travels through a bundle called the olfactory tract to destinations all over your brain,
making stops in the amygdala, the thalamus, and the neocortex. This is different from how sight
and sound are processed. Each of those signals goes first
to a relay center in the middle of the cerebral hemisphere and then out to other
regions of the brain. But smell, because it evolved
before most of your other senses, takes a direct route
to these different regions of the brain, where it can trigger
your fight-or-flight response, help you recall memories,
or make your mouth water. But even though we've all got
the same physiological set-up, two nostrils and millions
of olfactory neurons, not everybody smells the same things. One of the most famous examples of this is the ability to smell
so-called "asparagus pee." For about a quarter of the population, urinating after eating asparagus means smelling a distinct odor. The other 75% of us don't notice. And this isn't the only case
of smells differing from nose to nose. For some people, the chemical
androstenone smells like vanilla; to others, it smells like sweaty urine, which is unfortunate because androstenone is commonly found
in tasty things like pork. So with the sweaty urine smellers in mind, pork producers will castrate male pigs to stop them from making androstenone. The inability to smell a scent
is called anosmia, and there are about 100 known examples. People with allicin anosmia
can't smell garlic. Those with eugenol anosmia
can't smell cloves. And some people can't smell anything at all. This kind of full anosmia
could have several causes. Some people are born
without a sense of smell. Others lose it after an accident
or during an illness. If the olfactory epithelium
gets swollen or infected, it can hamper your sense of smell, something you might have experienced
when you were sick. Not being able to smell anything
can mess with your other senses, too. Many people who can't smell at all also can't really taste
the same way the rest of us do. It turns out that how something tastes
is closely related to how it smells. As you chew your food,
air is pushed up your nasal passage, carrying with it the smell of your food. Those scents hit your olfactory epithelium and tell your brain a lot
about what you're eating. Without the ability to smell,
you lose the ability to taste anything more complicated
than the five tastes your taste buds can detect: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and savory. So, the next time you smell exhaust fumes, salty sea air, or roast chicken, you'll know exactly how you've done it and, perhaps, be a little more
thankful that you can.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the similarity between olfactory receptor cells and another entity, while the generated MCQs are discussing unrelated topics such as energy, oil, and materials.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that Question 7 is the most similar in terms of format, but it's still unrelated to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content.

Index: 7 (with a big caveat that it's not really similar)

It's the first sense you use

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, likely energy or sustainability, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the sense of smell and the olfactory epithelium.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match. But please note that the content and intent of Question 4 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

A more accurate approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the topic of the sense of smell and the olfactory epithelium, and then try to match the ground truth MCQ with one of the new generated MCQs.

In this case, I would recommend generating new MCQs that are relevant to the topic, rather than trying to match the ground truth MCQ with one of the existing generated MCQs.

If you would like, I can try to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the topic of the sense of smell and the olfactory epithelium, and then try to match the ground truth MCQ with one of the new generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
Penguins have long captured the imagination and the hearts of people the world over. But while popular culture depicts them as clumsy, adorable birds with endlessly abundant populations, the truth is that penguins are exceedingly graceful, often ornery, and their populations are in rapid free fall. Their real life situation is far more precarious than people think. And if current trends do not change, it may not be long before penguins can only be found in movies. There are many things about penguins that make them odd birds, so to speak. For one thing, they are one of the few bird species that cannot fly, having evolved from flight-capable birds about 60 million years ago. Surprisingly, their closest living relative is the albatross, a bird known for its enormous wingspan and extraordinary soaring abilities. It may seem strange that losing the ability to fly would be an evolutionary advantage, but the penguin's short, flipper-like wings and solid bones allow them to swim faster and dive deeper than any other bird on Earth, filling an ecological niche that no other bird can. Penguins inhabit the southern hemisphere, being one of the few bird species able to breed in the coldest environments. But contrary to popular belief, they are not restricted to cold regions nor are there any at the North Pole. In fact, only 4 of the 18 penguin species regularly live and breed in Antarctica. Most penguins live in subtemperate to temperate regions. And the Galapagos penguin even lives and breeds right near the equator off the coast of South America. They are also found in South Africa, Namibia, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as on a number of islands in the southern Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Antarctic Oceans. Although penguins spend 75% of their lives at sea, they must come to shore every year to reproduce and to molt their feathers. They do this in a variety of places, from the temporary ice sheets of the Antarctic to the beaches of South Africa and Namibia, to the rocky shores of subantarctic islands, to the craggy lava surfaces in the Galapagos. Different penguin species have different nesting practices. Some dig burrows into dirt, sand, or dried guano; some nest in tussock grasses; some build nests out of small rocks, sticks, and bones; while others don't build any nests at all. Although most penguins lay a clutch of two eggs, the two largest species, the King and the Emperor, lay a single egg that they incubate on top of their feet for approximately two months. Unfortunately, 15 of the 18 penguin species are currently listed as threatened, near-threatened, or endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In the last several decades, we have seen the world populations of most penguin species decline by up to 90%, with two of them, the Yellow-eyed and Galapagos penguins, down to just a few thousand birds. Penguins are an indicator species, the proverbial "canary in the coal mine." Simply put, if penguins are dying, it means our oceans are dying. And sadly, most of this decline is attributable to human activities. Historically, penguins have had to deal with multiple disturbances. The mass collection of penguin eggs and the harvesting of the seabird guano they nested in caused the dramatic decline of several penguin species. If you're wondering what humans would want with seabird poop, it was used as an ingredient in fertilizer and in gunpowder, being so valuable that in the 19th century, it was known as white gold. Current threats to penguins include the destruction of both marine and terrestrial habitats, introduced predators, entrapment in fishing nets, and pollution from plastics and chemicals. There have also been several large-scale oil spills over the past 50 years that have killed or impacted tens of thousands of penguins around the world. But the two major threats to penguins today are global warming and overfishing. Global warming impacts penguins in multiple ways, from interrupting the production of krill due to decreased sea ice formation in the Antarctic, to increasing the frequency and severity of storms that destroy nests, to shifting the cold water currents carrying the penguins' prey too far away from penguin breeding and foraging grounds. Even though humans may be the greatest threat to penguins, we are also their greatest hope. Many research and conservation projects are underway to protect penguin habitats and restore vulnerable populations. With a little help from us and some changes in the practices that impact our planet and oceans, there is hope that our tuxedo-clad friends will still be around in the next century.

**Transcript**:
Penguins have long captured the imagination and the hearts of people the world over. But while popular culture depicts them as clumsy, adorable birds with endlessly abundant populations, the truth is that penguins are exceedingly graceful, often ornery, and their populations are in rapid free fall. Their real life situation is far more precarious than people think. And if current trends do not change, it may not be long before penguins can only be found in movies. There are many things about penguins that make them odd birds, so to speak. For one thing, they are one of the few bird species that cannot fly, having evolved from flight-capable birds about 60 million years ago. Surprisingly, their closest living relative is the albatross, a bird known for its enormous wingspan and extraordinary soaring abilities. It may seem strange that losing the ability to fly would be an evolutionary advantage, but the penguin's short, flipper-like wings and solid bones allow them to swim faster and dive deeper than any other bird on Earth, filling an ecological niche that no other bird can. Penguins inhabit the southern hemisphere, being one of the few bird species able to breed in the coldest environments. But contrary to popular belief, they are not restricted to cold regions nor are there any at the North Pole. In fact, only 4 of the 18 penguin species regularly live and breed in Antarctica. Most penguins live in subtemperate to temperate regions. And the Galapagos penguin even lives and breeds right near the equator off the coast of South America. They are also found in South Africa, Namibia, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as on a number of islands in the southern Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Antarctic Oceans. Although penguins spend 75% of their lives at sea, they must come to shore every year to reproduce and to molt their feathers. They do this in a variety of places, from the temporary ice sheets of the Antarctic to the beaches of South Africa and Namibia, to the rocky shores of subantarctic islands, to the craggy lava surfaces in the Galapagos. Different penguin species have different nesting practices. Some dig burrows into dirt, sand, or dried guano; some nest in tussock grasses; some build nests out of small rocks, sticks, and bones; while others don't build any nests at all. Although most penguins lay a clutch of two eggs, the two largest species, the King and the Emperor, lay a single egg that they incubate on top of their feet for approximately two months. Unfortunately, 15 of the 18 penguin species are currently listed as threatened, near-threatened, or endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In the last several decades, we have seen the world populations of most penguin species decline by up to 90%, with two of them, the Yellow-eyed and Galapagos penguins, down to just a few thousand birds. Penguins are an indicator species, the proverbial "canary in the coal mine." Simply put, if penguins are dying, it means our oceans are dying. And sadly, most of this decline is attributable to human activities. Historically, penguins have had to deal with multiple disturbances. The mass collection of penguin eggs and the harvesting of the seabird guano they nested in caused the dramatic decline of several penguin species. If you're wondering what humans would want with seabird poop, it was used as an ingredient in fertilizer and in gunpowder, being so valuable that in the 19th century, it was known as white gold. Current threats to penguins include the destruction of both marine and terrestrial habitats, introduced predators, entrapment in fishing nets, and pollution from plastics and chemicals. There have also been several large-scale oil spills over the past 50 years that have killed or impacted tens of thousands of penguins around the world. But the two major threats to penguins today are global warming and overfishing. Global warming impacts penguins in multiple ways, from interrupting the production of krill due to decreased sea ice formation in the Antarctic, to increasing the frequency and severity of storms that destroy nests, to shifting the cold water currents carrying the penguins' prey too far away from penguin breeding and foraging grounds. Even though humans may be the greatest threat to penguins, we are also their greatest hope. Many research and conservation projects are underway to protect penguin habitats and restore vulnerable populations. With a little help from us and some changes in the practices that impact our planet and oceans, there is hope that our tuxedo-clad friends will still be around in the next century.

**Transcript**:
Everyone knows that stories are made up of words, from short poems to epic novels. But did you know that a single word itself can tell an entire story? You see, just as we can look at a story's plot, setting, and characters, we can also study the history of an individual word, where it developed, and the cultures and people who helped shape it. Looking into the story of a word is like counting the rings of a tree. Newer words, like Google or cyborg, have shorter stories. But the older the word, the longer the story and the more it stands to reveal to us not only about itself, but about ourselves and our history. The oldest words in present-day English are those that come from Old English, the ancestor of our modern language whose first seeds were planted about 1500 years ago. Compared to languages like Greek or Chinese that date back thousands of years, English is just a sapling in the lexical forest. But the stories of its words often start long before English itself took root. One such word is the familiar word true, as in true stories. Let's take a look. True usually means factual, correct, or faithful to reality. It can also mean exact, properly positioned, upright, or straight. A true friend is loyal, reliable, faithful, and steadfast. The word true is a simple word, and we can add some affixes to grow its family tree with words like truer, truest, truly, truth, and untruth. But if we go in the other direction to look at the roots of true itself, we find even more relatives further up the family tree. The words trust, bethroth, and truce all derive from the same source as true, and these words all denote faithfulness or confidence. A thousand years ago, the word true looked and sounded different than it does today. In several Old English dialects, the word treow was a noun that meant good faith or trust, a pledge or a promise. But it also had another definition, tree, and that's no coincidence. If we trace the roots back even farther, we find that both meanings derive from a common origin, where some of the earliest expressions of the concept of truth were associated with the uprightness of an oak, the steadiness of a silver birch, and the fidelity of an orchard baring fruit year after year. This may sound like a stretch at first, but trees are the oldest living organisms on this planet. Some that would have been called treow long ago still stand today. The Fortingall Yew in Scotland is more than 2,000 years old. A Californian Bristlecone Pine is more than 5,000. And Utah's Pando-quaking Aspen Grove has a single root system that dates back more than 80 millennia. Trees have also held a sacred place in many cultures throughout history. The Celtic peoples who first inhabited the British Isles believed that trees housed deities. And, in fact, the ancient Druids take their name from the same ancient root as tree. Planting a tree is itself an act of faith and commitment. Not only are trees upright and prototypically straight, but they are actual, solid, and real, something you can see and touch. And they are as reliable and steadfast to us today as they were a millennium ago, nurturing us, sheltering us, and providing the pages of our books. Philosophers and poets, people in search of the truth, have often sought it in trees. "What did the tree learn from the Earth to be able to talk with the sky?" asked Pablo Neruda. "A tree falls the way it leans," says an old proverb. Just as trees mark our landscapes and witness our histories, the stories of words landscape our language, capturing the rains and sunshine of generations and sending roots and branches far and wide. As there is a whole orchard in a single seed, there is a whole story in a single word, and that's the truth.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Everyone knows that stories are made up of words, from short poems to epic novels. But did you know that a single word itself can tell an entire story? You see, just as we can look at a story's plot, setting, and characters, we can also study the history of an individual word, where it developed, and the cultures and people who helped shape it. Looking into the story of a word is like counting the rings of a tree. Newer words, like Google or cyborg, have shorter stories. But the older the word, the longer the story and the more it stands to reveal to us not only about itself, but about ourselves and our history. The oldest words in present-day English are those that come from Old English, the ancestor of our modern language whose first seeds were planted about 1500 years ago. Compared to languages like Greek or Chinese that date back thousands of years, English is just a sapling in the lexical forest. But the stories of its words often start long before English itself took root. One such word is the familiar word true, as in true stories. Let's take a look. True usually means factual, correct, or faithful to reality. It can also mean exact, properly positioned, upright, or straight. A true friend is loyal, reliable, faithful, and steadfast. The word true is a simple word, and we can add some affixes to grow its family tree with words like truer, truest, truly, truth, and untruth. But if we go in the other direction to look at the roots of true itself, we find even more relatives further up the family tree. The words trust, bethroth, and truce all derive from the same source as true, and these words all denote faithfulness or confidence. A thousand years ago, the word true looked and sounded different than it does today. In several Old English dialects, the word treow was a noun that meant good faith or trust, a pledge or a promise. But it also had another definition, tree, and that's no coincidence. If we trace the roots back even farther, we find that both meanings derive from a common origin, where some of the earliest expressions of the concept of truth were associated with the uprightness of an oak, the steadiness of a silver birch, and the fidelity of an orchard baring fruit year after year. This may sound like a stretch at first, but trees are the oldest living organisms on this planet. Some that would have been called treow long ago still stand today. The Fortingall Yew in Scotland is more than 2,000 years old. A Californian Bristlecone Pine is more than 5,000. And Utah's Pando-quaking Aspen Grove has a single root system that dates back more than 80 millennia. Trees have also held a sacred place in many cultures throughout history. The Celtic peoples who first inhabited the British Isles believed that trees housed deities. And, in fact, the ancient Druids take their name from the same ancient root as tree. Planting a tree is itself an act of faith and commitment. Not only are trees upright and prototypically straight, but they are actual, solid, and real, something you can see and touch. And they are as reliable and steadfast to us today as they were a millennium ago, nurturing us, sheltering us, and providing the pages of our books. Philosophers and poets, people in search of the truth, have often sought it in trees. "What did the tree learn from the Earth to be able to talk with the sky?" asked Pablo Neruda. "A tree falls the way it leans," says an old proverb. Just as trees mark our landscapes and witness our histories, the stories of words landscape our language, capturing the rains and sunshine of generations and sending roots and branches far and wide. As there is a whole orchard in a single seed, there is a whole story in a single word, and that's the truth.

for the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk I'll try to spin a story about energy and oil is a convenient starting place the talk will be broadly about energy but oil is a good place to start and one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff you take about eight carbon aedra so carbon atoms about 20 hydrogen atoms you put them together at exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid very energy dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels it's great stuff now as far as it goes there's a lot of oil out there in the world right here's my little pocket map of where it's all located a bigger one for you to look at but this is it this is the oil in the world geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is this is about a hundred trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today now that's one story about oil and we could end it there and say well oil is going to last forever because well there's just a lot of it but there's actually more to the story than that oh by the way if you think you're very far from some of this oil a thousand meters below where you're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world come talk to me about it I'll fill in some of the details if you want so that's one of the stories of oil there's just a lot of it but what about oil where is it any energy system then here's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil and it's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years now here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about for the last 25 years oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy system there was one kind of peak oil in 1985 when oil represented 50% of global energy supply now it's about 35% it's been declining and I believe it will continue to decline gasoline consumption in the u.s. probably peaked in 2007 and is declining so oil is playing a less significant role every year right and and so 25 years ago there was a peak oil just like in the 1920s there was a peak pole and a hundred years before that there was a peak wood this is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems and what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades well a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear for starters and what goes on in the future well I think out ahead of us a few decades is Pete gas and beyond that peak renewables now tell you another little very important story about this picture now I'm not pretending that energy use in total isn't increasing it is that's another part of the story come talk to me about it we'll fill in some of the details but there's a very important message here this is 200 years of history and for 200 years we've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system energy systems of the world becoming progressively year-on-year decade on decade century round century becoming less carbon intense and that continues into the future with the renewables that we're developing today reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy by mid-century now that might be the end of the story okay we just replace it all with conventional renewables but I think actually there's more to the story than that and to tell the next part of the story this is looking out say 2100 and beyond what is the future of truly sustainable carbon free energy well we have to take a little excursion and we'll start in Central Texas here's piece of limestone picked it up outside of Marble Falls Texas it's about 400 million years old and it's just limestone nothing really special about it now here's a piece of chalk I picked this up at MIT it's a little younger and it's different than this limestone you can see that you wouldn't build a building out of this stuff and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this we have very different notes not different it's not different it's the same stuff calcium carbonate calcium carbonate what's different is how the molecules are put together now if you think that's kind of neat the story gets really neat right now off the coast of California comes this it's an abalone shell now millions of abalone every year make the shell oh by the way just in case you weren't already guessing calcium carbonate it's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this but it's not the same stuff it's different it's it's thousands of times maybe three thousand times tougher than this and why because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers making this beautiful iridescent mother-of-pearl very specialized material that the abalone self-assembles millions of millions of abalone all the time every day every year this is pretty incredible stuff all the same what's different how the molecules are put together now what does this have to do with energy here's a piece of coal and I'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting is this chalk now whether we're talking about fuels or energy carriers or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn't need to nature didn't need to because unlike the abalone shell the survival of a species didn't depend on building those materials until maybe now when it might just matter so when we think about the future of energy imagine what would it be like if instead of this we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently and so that is my story the oil will never run out it's not because we have a lot of it it's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills it's because well thousands of years ago people invented ideas they had ideas innovations technology and the Stone Age ended not because we ran out of stones it's ideas it's innovation it's technology that will end the age of oil long before we run out of oil thank you very much you

for the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk I'll try to spin a story about energy and oil is a convenient starting place the talk will be broadly about energy but oil is a good place to start and one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff you take about eight carbon aedra so carbon atoms about 20 hydrogen atoms you put them together at exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid very energy dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels it's great stuff now as far as it goes there's a lot of oil out there in the world right here's my little pocket map of where it's all located a bigger one for you to look at but this is it this is the oil in the world geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is this is about a hundred trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today now that's one story about oil and we could end it there and say well oil is going to last forever because well there's just a lot of it but there's actually more to the story than that oh by the way if you think you're very far from some of this oil a thousand meters below where you're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world come talk to me about it I'll fill in some of the details if you want so that's one of the stories of oil there's just a lot of it but what about oil where is it any energy system then here's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil and it's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years now here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about for the last 25 years oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy system there was one kind of peak oil in 1985 when oil represented 50% of global energy supply now it's about 35% it's been declining and I believe it will continue to decline gasoline consumption in the u.s. probably peaked in 2007 and is declining so oil is playing a less significant role every year right and and so 25 years ago there was a peak oil just like in the 1920s there was a peak pole and a hundred years before that there was a peak wood this is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems and what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades well a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear for starters and what goes on in the future well I think out ahead of us a few decades is Pete gas and beyond that peak renewables now tell you another little very important story about this picture now I'm not pretending that energy use in total isn't increasing it is that's another part of the story come talk to me about it we'll fill in some of the details but there's a very important message here this is 200 years of history and for 200 years we've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system energy systems of the world becoming progressively year-on-year decade on decade century round century becoming less carbon intense and that continues into the future with the renewables that we're developing today reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy by mid-century now that might be the end of the story okay we just replace it all with conventional renewables but I think actually there's more to the story than that and to tell the next part of the story this is looking out say 2100 and beyond what is the future of truly sustainable carbon free energy well we have to take a little excursion and we'll start in Central Texas here's piece of limestone picked it up outside of Marble Falls Texas it's about 400 million years old and it's just limestone nothing really special about it now here's a piece of chalk I picked this up at MIT it's a little younger and it's different than this limestone you can see that you wouldn't build a building out of this stuff and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this we have very different notes not different it's not different it's the same stuff calcium carbonate calcium carbonate what's different is how the molecules are put together now if you think that's kind of neat the story gets really neat right now off the coast of California comes this it's an abalone shell now millions of abalone every year make the shell oh by the way just in case you weren't already guessing calcium carbonate it's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this but it's not the same stuff it's different it's it's thousands of times maybe three thousand times tougher than this and why because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers making this beautiful iridescent mother-of-pearl very specialized material that the abalone self-assembles millions of millions of abalone all the time every day every year this is pretty incredible stuff all the same what's different how the molecules are put together now what does this have to do with energy here's a piece of coal and I'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting is this chalk now whether we're talking about fuels or energy carriers or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn't need to nature didn't need to because unlike the abalone shell the survival of a species didn't depend on building those materials until maybe now when it might just matter so when we think about the future of energy imagine what would it be like if instead of this we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently and so that is my story the oil will never run out it's not because we have a lot of it it's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills it's because well thousands of years ago people invented ideas they had ideas innovations technology and the Stone Age ended not because we ran out of stones it's ideas it's innovation it's technology that will end the age of oil long before we run out of oil thank you very much you

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about the peak of oil in its share of primary energy usage, while the generated MCQs are about kites, wind power, and electricity generation.

However, I can suggest that the closest match would be a question that is related to energy usage or oil consumption. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs meet this criteria.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. But if you insist on an index, I would say -1 or "No match found".

Please note that the generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic or transcript, and it's not possible to find a match with the provided generated MCQs.

for the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk I'll try to spin a story about energy and oil is a convenient starting place the talk will be broadly about energy but oil is a good place to start and one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff you take about eight carbon aedra so carbon atoms about 20 hydrogen atoms you put them together at exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid very energy dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels it's great stuff now as far as it goes there's a lot of oil out there in the world right here's my little pocket map of where it's all located a bigger one for you to look at but this is it this is the oil in the world geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is this is about a hundred trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today now that's one story about oil and we could end it there and say well oil is going to last forever because well there's just a lot of it but there's actually more to the story than that oh by the way if you think you're very far from some of this oil a thousand meters below where you're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world come talk to me about it I'll fill in some of the details if you want so that's one of the stories of oil there's just a lot of it but what about oil where is it any energy system then here's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil and it's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years now here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about for the last 25 years oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy system there was one kind of peak oil in 1985 when oil represented 50% of global energy supply now it's about 35% it's been declining and I believe it will continue to decline gasoline consumption in the u.s. probably peaked in 2007 and is declining so oil is playing a less significant role every year right and and so 25 years ago there was a peak oil just like in the 1920s there was a peak pole and a hundred years before that there was a peak wood this is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems and what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades well a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear for starters and what goes on in the future well I think out ahead of us a few decades is Pete gas and beyond that peak renewables now tell you another little very important story about this picture now I'm not pretending that energy use in total isn't increasing it is that's another part of the story come talk to me about it we'll fill in some of the details but there's a very important message here this is 200 years of history and for 200 years we've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system energy systems of the world becoming progressively year-on-year decade on decade century round century becoming less carbon intense and that continues into the future with the renewables that we're developing today reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy by mid-century now that might be the end of the story okay we just replace it all with conventional renewables but I think actually there's more to the story than that and to tell the next part of the story this is looking out say 2100 and beyond what is the future of truly sustainable carbon free energy well we have to take a little excursion and we'll start in Central Texas here's piece of limestone picked it up outside of Marble Falls Texas it's about 400 million years old and it's just limestone nothing really special about it now here's a piece of chalk I picked this up at MIT it's a little younger and it's different than this limestone you can see that you wouldn't build a building out of this stuff and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this we have very different notes not different it's not different it's the same stuff calcium carbonate calcium carbonate what's different is how the molecules are put together now if you think that's kind of neat the story gets really neat right now off the coast of California comes this it's an abalone shell now millions of abalone every year make the shell oh by the way just in case you weren't already guessing calcium carbonate it's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this but it's not the same stuff it's different it's it's thousands of times maybe three thousand times tougher than this and why because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers making this beautiful iridescent mother-of-pearl very specialized material that the abalone self-assembles millions of millions of abalone all the time every day every year this is pretty incredible stuff all the same what's different how the molecules are put together now what does this have to do with energy here's a piece of coal and I'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting is this chalk now whether we're talking about fuels or energy carriers or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn't need to nature didn't need to because unlike the abalone shell the survival of a species didn't depend on building those materials until maybe now when it might just matter so when we think about the future of energy imagine what would it be like if instead of this we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently and so that is my story the oil will never run out it's not because we have a lot of it it's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills it's because well thousands of years ago people invented ideas they had ideas innovations technology and the Stone Age ended not because we ran out of stones it's ideas it's innovation it's technology that will end the age of oil long before we run out of oil thank you very much you

**Transcript**:
So how many of you have ever been in a cave before? Okay, a few of you. When you think of a cave, most of you think of a tunnel going through solid rock. In fact, that's how most caves are. Around this half of the country, most of your caves are made of limestone. Back where I'm from, most of our caves are made from lava rock because we have a lot of volcanoes out there. But the caves I want to share with you today are made completely of ice, specifically glacier ice as formed in the side of the tallest mountain in the state of Oregon called Mount Hood. Now, Mount Hood's only one hour's drive from Portland, the largest city in Oregon where over two million people live. Now, the most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to find a new cave and be the first human to ever go into it. The second most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave. Now, these days, with so many people hiking around, it's pretty hard to find a new cave, so you can imagine how excited we were to find three new caves within sight of Oregon's largest city and realize that they have never been explored or mapped before. It was kind of like being an astronaut because we were getting to see things and go places that no one had ever seen or gone before. So, what is a glacier? Well, those of you that have ever seen or touched snow, you know that it's really light because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together and it's mostly air. If you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball, it gets really small, hard, and dense. Well, in a mountain like Hood where it snows over twenty feet a year, it crushes the air out of it and gradually forms it into hard, blue ice. Now, each year more and more ice stacks up on top of it and eventually gets so heavy that it starts to slide down the mountain under its own weight, forming a slow-moving river of ice. When an ice pack like that starts to move, we call it a glacier and we give it a name. The name of the glacier these caves were formed is the Sandy Glacier. Now, each year as new snow lands on the glacier, it melts in the summer sun, and it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice and they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier, forming big networks of caves, sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock. Now, the crazy thing about glacier caves is that each year new tunnels form, different waterfalls pop up or move around from place to place inside the cave. Warm water from the top of the ice is boring its way down, and warm air from below the mountain actually rises up, gets into the cave, and melts the ceilings back taller and taller. But the weirdest thing about glacier caves is that the entire cave is moving because it's formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that's slowly sliding down the mountain. Now, this is Brent McGregor, my cave exploration partner. He and I have both been exploring caves a long time and we've been climbing mountains a long time, but neither of us have ever really explored a glacier cave before. Back in 2011, Brent saw a YouTube video of a couple of hikers that stumbled across the entrance to one of these caves. There were no GPS coordinates for it, and all we knew was that it was somewhere out on the Sandy Glacier. So, in July of that year, we went out on the glacier, and we found a big crack in the ice. We had to build snow and ice anchors, so we could tie off ropes and repel down into the hole. This is me looking into the entrance crevasse. At the end of this hole, we found a huge tunnel going right up the mountain underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice. We followed this cave back for about a half mile until it came to an end. And then with the help of our survey tools, we made a three-dimensional map of the cave on our way back out. So, how do you map a cave? Well, cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps because they have pits and holes going to overlapping levels. To make a cave map, you have to set up survey stations every few feet inside the cave, and you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations. And you use a compass and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings. Now, those of you taking trigonometry, that particular type of math is very useful for making maps like this because it allows you to measure heights and distances without actually having to go there. In fact, the more I mapped and studied caves, the more useful I found all that math that I originally hated in school to be. So, when you're done surveying, you take all this data, you punch it into the computer, and you find someone that can draw really well, and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this. And it will show you both a bird's eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage, kind of like an ant farm view. We named this cave Snow Dragon Cave because it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow. Now, later this summer as more snow melted off the glacier, we found more caves, and we realized they were all connected. Not long after we mapped Snow Dragon, Brent discovered this new cave not very far away. The inside of it was coated with ice so we had to wear big spikes in our feet called crampons, so we could walk around without slipping. This cave was amazing! The ice in the ceiling was glowing blue and green because the sunlight from far above was shining through the ice and lighting it all up. Now, we couldn't understand why this cave was so much colder than Snow Dragon until we got to the end, and we found out why. There was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin going a 130 feet straight up to the surface of the glacier. Cold air from the top of the mountain was flowing down this hole, blasting through the cave, freezing everything inside of it. And we were so excited about finding this new pit, we actually came back in January the following year so we could be the first ones to explore it. It was so cold outside, we actually had to sleep inside the cave. Here's our camp on the left side of this entrance room. The next morning we climbed out of the cave and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier where we finally rigged and repelled this pit for the very first time. Brent named this cave Pure Imagination, I think, because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined. So, besides really cool ice, what else is inside these caves? Well, not too much lives in them because they're so cold, and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year, but there are some really cool things in there. There's weird bacteria living in the water that actually eat and digest rocks to make their own food to live under this ice. In fact, this past summer scientists collected samples of water and ice specifically to see if things called extremophiles, tiny lifeforms that have evolved to live in a completely hostile conditions, might be living under the ice, kind of like what they hope to find in the polar ice caps of Mars some day. Another really cool thing is that as seeds and birds land on the surface of the glacier and die, they get buried in the snow and gradually become part of the glacier, sinking deeper and deeper into the ice. As these caves form and melt their way up into the ice, they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling and fall into the cave floor where we end up finding them. For example, this is a nodal first seed we found. It's been frozen in ice for over a hundred years, and it's just now starting to sprout. This mallard duck feather was found over 1800 feet in the back of Snow Dragon Cave. This duck died on the surface of the glacier long, long ago, and its feathers have finally made it down through over a hundred feet of ice before falling inside the cave. And this beautiful quartz crystal was also found in the back of Snow Dragon. Even now Brent and I find it hard to believe that all these discoveries were essentially in our own backyard, hidden away just waiting to be found. Like I said earlier, the idea of discovery in this busy world we live in kind of seems like something you can only do with space travel now, but that's not true. Every year new caves get discovered that no one has ever been in before. So, it's actually not too late for one of you to become a discoverer yourself. You just have to be willing to look and go where people don't often go and focus your eyes and your mind to recognize the discovery when you see it because it might be in your own backyard. Thank you very much.

**Transcript**:
So how many of you have ever been in a cave before? Okay, a few of you. When you think of a cave, most of you think of a tunnel going through solid rock. In fact, that's how most caves are. Around this half of the country, most of your caves are made of limestone. Back where I'm from, most of our caves are made from lava rock because we have a lot of volcanoes out there. But the caves I want to share with you today are made completely of ice, specifically glacier ice as formed in the side of the tallest mountain in the state of Oregon called Mount Hood. Now, Mount Hood's only one hour's drive from Portland, the largest city in Oregon where over two million people live. Now, the most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to find a new cave and be the first human to ever go into it. The second most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave. Now, these days, with so many people hiking around, it's pretty hard to find a new cave, so you can imagine how excited we were to find three new caves within sight of Oregon's largest city and realize that they have never been explored or mapped before. It was kind of like being an astronaut because we were getting to see things and go places that no one had ever seen or gone before. So, what is a glacier? Well, those of you that have ever seen or touched snow, you know that it's really light because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together and it's mostly air. If you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball, it gets really small, hard, and dense. Well, in a mountain like Hood where it snows over twenty feet a year, it crushes the air out of it and gradually forms it into hard, blue ice. Now, each year more and more ice stacks up on top of it and eventually gets so heavy that it starts to slide down the mountain under its own weight, forming a slow-moving river of ice. When an ice pack like that starts to move, we call it a glacier and we give it a name. The name of the glacier these caves were formed is the Sandy Glacier. Now, each year as new snow lands on the glacier, it melts in the summer sun, and it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice and they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier, forming big networks of caves, sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock.

The next morning we climbed out of the cave and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier where we finally rigged and repelled this pit for the very first time. Brent named this cave Pure Imagination, I think, because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined. So, besides really cool ice, what else is inside these caves? Well, not too much lives in them because they're so cold, and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year, but there are some really cool things in there. There's weird bacteria living in the water that actually eat and digest rocks to make their own food to live under this ice. In fact, this past summer scientists collected samples of water and ice specifically to see if things called extremophiles, tiny lifeforms that have evolved to live in a completely hostile conditions, might be living under the ice, kind of like what they hope to find in the polar ice caps of Mars some day. Another really cool thing is that as seeds and birds land on the surface of the glacier and die, they get buried in the snow and gradually become part of the glacier, sinking deeper and deeper into the ice. As these caves form and melt their way up into the ice, they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling and fall into the cave floor where we end up finding them. For example, this is a nodal first seed we found. It's been frozen in ice for over a hundred years, and it's just now starting to sprout. This mallard duck feather was found over 1800 feet in the back of Snow Dragon Cave. This duck died on the surface of the glacier long, long ago, and its feathers have finally made it down through over a hundred feet of ice before falling inside the cave. And this beautiful quartz crystal was also found in the back of Snow Dragon. Even now Brent and I find it hard to believe that all these discoveries were essentially in our own backyard, hidden away just waiting to be found. Like I said earlier, the idea of discovery in this busy world we live in kind of seems like something you can only do with space travel now, but that's not true. Every year new caves get discovered that no one has ever been in before. So, it's actually not too late for one of you to become a discoverer yourself. You just have to be willing to look and go where people don't often go and focus your eyes and your mind to recognize the discovery when you see it because it might be in your own backyard. Thank you very much.

**Transcript**:
So how many of you have ever been in a cave before? Okay, a few of you. When you think of a cave, most of you think of a tunnel going through solid rock. In fact, that's how most caves are. Around this half of the country, most of your caves are made of limestone. Back where I'm from, most of our caves are made from lava rock because we have a lot of volcanoes out there. But the caves I want to share with you today are made completely of ice, specifically glacier ice as formed in the side of the tallest mountain in the state of Oregon called Mount Hood. Now, Mount Hood's only one hour's drive from Portland, the largest city in Oregon where over two million people live. Now, the most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to find a new cave and be the first human to ever go into it. The second most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave. Now, these days, with so many people hiking around, it's pretty hard to find a new cave, so you can imagine how excited we were to find three new caves within sight of Oregon's largest city and realize that they have never been explored or mapped before. It was kind of like being an astronaut because we were getting to see things and go places that no one had ever seen or gone before. So, what is a glacier? Well, those of you that have ever seen or touched snow, you know that it's really light because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together and it's mostly air. If you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball, it gets really small, hard, and dense. Well, in a mountain like Hood where it snows over twenty feet a year, it crushes the air out of it and gradually forms it into hard, blue ice. Now, each year more and more ice stacks up on top of it and eventually gets so heavy that it starts to slide down the mountain under its own weight, forming a slow-moving river of ice. When an ice pack like that starts to move, we call it a glacier and we give it a name. The name of the glacier these caves were formed is the Sandy Glacier. Now, each year as new snow lands on the glacier, it melts in the summer sun, and it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice and they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier, forming big networks of caves, sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock. Now, the crazy thing about glacier caves is that each year new tunnels form, different waterfalls pop up or move around from place to place inside the cave. Warm water from the top of the ice is boring its way down, and warm air from below the mountain actually rises up, gets into the cave, and melts the ceilings back taller and taller. But the weirdest thing about glacier caves is that the entire cave is moving because it's formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that's slowly sliding down the mountain. Now, this is Brent McGregor, my cave exploration partner. He and I have both been exploring caves a long time and we've been climbing mountains a long time, but neither of us have ever really explored a glacier cave before. Back in 2011, Brent saw a YouTube video of a couple of hikers that stumbled across the entrance to one of these caves. There were no GPS coordinates for it, and all we knew was that it was somewhere out on the Sandy Glacier. So, in July of that year, we went out on the glacier, and we found a big crack in the ice. We had to build snow and ice anchors, so we could tie off ropes and repel down into the hole. This is me looking into the entrance crevasse. At the end of this hole, we found a huge tunnel going right up the mountain underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice. We followed this cave back for about a half mile until it came to an end. And then with the help of our survey tools, we made a three-dimensional map of the cave on our way back out. So, how do you map a cave? Well, cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps because they have pits and holes going to overlapping levels. To make a cave map, you have to set up survey stations every few feet inside the cave, and you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations. And you use a compass and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings. Now, those of you taking trigonometry, that particular type of math is very useful for making maps like this because it allows you to measure heights and distances without actually having to go there. In fact, the more I mapped and studied caves, the more useful I found all that math that I originally hated in school to be. So, when you're done surveying, you take all this data, you punch it into the computer, and you find someone that can draw really well, and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this. And it will show you both a bird's eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage, kind of like an ant farm view. We named this cave Snow Dragon Cave because it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow. Now, later this summer as more snow melted off the glacier, we found more caves, and we realized they were all connected. Not long after we mapped Snow Dragon, Brent discovered this new cave not very far away. The inside of it was coated with ice so we had to wear big spikes in our feet called crampons, so we could walk around without slipping. This cave was amazing! The ice in the ceiling was glowing blue and green because the sunlight from far above was shining through the ice and lighting it all up. Now, we couldn't understand why this cave was so much colder than Snow Dragon until we got to the end, and we found out why. There was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin going a 130 feet straight up to the surface of the glacier. Cold air from the top of the mountain was flowing down this hole, blasting through the cave, freezing everything inside of it. And we were so excited about finding this new pit, we actually came back in January the following year so we could be the first ones to explore it. It was so cold outside, we actually had to sleep inside the cave. Here's our camp on the left side of this entrance room. The next morning we climbed out of the cave and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier where we finally rigged and repelled this pit for the very first time. Brent named this cave Pure Imagination, I think, because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined.

**Transcript**:
What do silk, DNA, wood, balloons, and Silly Putty all have in common? They're polymers. Polymers are such a big part of our lives that it's virtually impossible to imagine a world without them, but what the heck are they? Polymers are large molecules made of small units called monomers linked together like the railroad cars from a train. Poly means many, and mono means one, and mers or mero means parts. Many polymers are made by repeating the same small monomer over and over again while others are made from two monomers linked in a pattern. All living things are made of polymers. Some of the organic molecules in organisms are small and simple, having only one of a few functional groups. Others, especially those that play structural roles or store genetic information, are macromolecules. In many cases, these macromolecules are polymers. For example, complex carbohydrates are polymers of simple sugars, proteins are polymers of amino acids, and nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, which contain our genetic information, are polymers of nucleotides. Trees and plants are made of the polymer cellulose. It's the tough stuff you find in bark and stems. Feathers, fur, hair, and fingernails are made up of the protein keratin, also a polymer. It doesn't stop there. Did you know that the exoskeletons of the largest phylum in the animal kingdom, the arthropods, are made of the polymer chitin? Polymers also form the basis for synthetic fibers, rubbers, and plastics. All synthetic polymers are derived from petroleum oil and manufactured through chemical reactions. The two most common types of reactions used to make polymers are addition reactions and condensation reactions. In addition reactions, monomers simply add together to form the polymer. The process starts with a free radical, a species with an unpaired electron. The free radical attacks and breaks the bonds to form new bonds. This process repeats over and over to create a long-chained polymer. In condensation reactions, a small molecule, such as water, is produced with each chain-extending reaction. The first synthetic polymers were created by accident as by-products of various chemical reactions. Thinking they were useless, chemists mostly discarded them. Finally, one named Leo Baekeland decided maybe his useless by-product wasn't so useless after all. His work resulted in a plastic that could be permanently squished into a shape using pressure and high temperatures. Since the name of this plastic, polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, wasn't very catchy, advertisers called it Bakelite. Bakelite was made into telephones, children's toys, and insulators for electrical devices. With its development in 1907, the plastics industry exploded. One other familiar polymer, Silly Putty, was also invented by accident. During World War II, the United States was in desperate need of synthetic rubber to support the military. A team of chemists at General Electric attempted to create one but ended up with a gooey, soft putty. It wasn't a good rubber substitute, but it did have one strange quality: it appeared to be extremely bouncy. Silly Putty was born! Synthetic polymers have changed the world. Think about it. Could you imagine getting through a single day without using plastic? But polymers aren't all good. Styrofoam, for example, is made mainly of styrene, which has been identified as a possible carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency. As Styrofoam products are being made, or as they slowly deteriorate in landfills or the ocean, they can release toxic styrene into the environment. In addition, plastics that are created by addition polymerization reactions, like Styrofoam, plastic bags, and PVC, are built to be durable and food-safe, but that means that they don't break down in the environment. Millions of tons of plastics are dumped into landfills every year. This plastic doesn't biodegrade, it just breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces, affecting marine life and eventually making their way back to humans. Polymers can be soft or hard, squishy or solid, fragile or strong. The huge variation between means they can form an incredibly diverse array of substances, from DNA to nylon stockings. Polymers are so useful that we've grown to depend on them every day. But some are littering our oceans, cities, and waterways with effects on our health that we're only beginning to understand.

Polymers also form the basis for synthetic fibers, rubbers, and plastics. All synthetic polymers are derived from petroleum oil and manufactured through chemical reactions. The two most common types of reactions used to make polymers are addition reactions and condensation reactions. In addition reactions, monomers simply add together to form the polymer. The process starts with a free radical, a species with an unpaired electron. The free radical attacks and breaks the bonds to form new bonds. This process repeats over and over to create a long-chained polymer. In condensation reactions, a small molecule, such as water, is produced with each chain-extending reaction. The first synthetic polymers were created by accident as by-products of various chemical reactions. Thinking they were useless, chemists mostly discarded them. Finally, one named Leo Baekeland decided maybe his useless by-product wasn't so useless after all. His work resulted in a plastic that could be permanently squished into a shape using pressure and high temperatures. Since the name of this plastic, polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, wasn't very catchy, advertisers called it Bakelite. Bakelite was made into telephones, children's toys, and insulators for electrical devices. With its development in 1907, the plastics industry exploded. One other familiar polymer, Silly Putty, was also invented by accident. During World War II, the United States was in desperate need of synthetic rubber to support the military. A team of chemists at General Electric attempted to create one but ended up with a gooey, soft putty. It wasn't a good rubber substitute, but it did have one strange quality: it appeared to be extremely bouncy. Silly Putty was born! Synthetic polymers have changed the world. Think about it. Could you imagine getting through a single day without using plastic? But polymers aren't all good. Styrofoam, for example, is made mainly of styrene, which has been identified as a possible carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency. As Styrofoam products are being made, or as they slowly deteriorate in landfills or the ocean, they can release toxic styrene into the environment. In addition, plastics that are created by addition polymerization reactions, like Styrofoam, plastic bags, and PVC, are built to be durable and food-safe, but that means that they don't break down in the environment. Millions of tons of plastics are dumped into landfills every year. This plastic doesn't biodegrade, it just breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces, affecting marine life and eventually making their way back to humans. Polymers can be soft or hard, squishy or solid, fragile or strong. The huge variation between means they can form an incredibly diverse array of substances, from DNA to nylon stockings. Polymers are so useful that we've grown to depend on them every day. But some are littering our oceans, cities, and waterways with effects on our health that we're only beginning to understand.

**Transcript**:
What do silk, DNA, wood, balloons, and Silly Putty all have in common? They're polymers. Polymers are such a big part of our lives that it's virtually impossible to imagine a world without them, but what the heck are they? Polymers are large molecules made of small units called monomers linked together like the railroad cars from a train. Poly means many, and mono means one, and mers or mero means parts. Many polymers are made by repeating the same small monomer over and over again while others are made from two monomers linked in a pattern. All living things are made of polymers. Some of the organic molecules in organisms are small and simple, having only one of a few functional groups. Others, especially those that play structural roles or store genetic information, are macromolecules. In many cases, these macromolecules are polymers. For example, complex carbohydrates are polymers of simple sugars, proteins are polymers of amino acids, and nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, which contain our genetic information, are polymers of nucleotides. Trees and plants are made of the polymer cellulose. It's the tough stuff you find in bark and stems. Feathers, fur, hair, and fingernails are made up of the protein keratin, also a polymer.

**Transcript**:
You've probably heard of the human genome, the huge collection of genes inside each and every one of your cells. You probably also know that we've sequenced the human genome, but what does that actually mean? How do you sequence someone's genome? Let's back up a bit. What is a genome? Well, a genome is all the genes plus some extra that make up an organism. Genes are made up of DNA, and DNA is made up of long, paired strands of A's, T's, C's, and G's. Your genome is the code that your cells use to know how to behave. Cells interacting together make tissues. Tissues cooperating with each other make organs. Organs cooperating with each other make an organism, you! So, you are who you are in large part because of your genome. The first human genome was sequenced ten years ago and was no easy task. It took two decades to complete, required the effort of hundreds of scientists across dozens of countries, and cost over three billion dollars. But some day very soon, it will be possible to know the sequence of letters that make up your own personal genome all in a matter of minutes and for less than the cost of a pretty nice birthday present. How is that possible? Let's take a closer look. Knowing the sequence of the billions of letters that make up your genome is the goal of genome sequencing. A genome is both really, really big and very, very small. The individual letters of DNA, the A's, T's, G's, and C's, are only eight or ten atoms wide, and they're all packed together into a clump, like a ball of yarn. So, to get all that information out of that tiny space, scientists first have to break the long string of DNA down into smaller pieces. Each of these pieces is then separated in space and sequenced individually, but how? It's helpful to remember that DNA binds to other DNA if the sequences are the exact opposite of each other. A's bind to T's, and T's bind to A's. G's bind to C's, and C's to G's. If the A-T-G-C sequence of two pieces of DNA are exact opposites, they stick together. Because the genome pieces are so very small, we need some way to increase the signal we can detect from each of the individual letters. In the most common method, scientists use enzymes to make thousands of copies of each genome piece. So, we now have thousands of replicas of each of the genome pieces, all with the same sequence of A's, T's, G's, and C's. But we have to read them all somehow. To do this, we need to make a batch of special letters, each with a distinct color. A mixture of these special colored letters and enzymes are then added to the genome we're trying to read. At each spot on the genome, one of the special letters binds to its opposite letter, so we now have a double-stranded piece of DNA with a colorful spot at each letter. Scientists then take pictures of each snippet of genome. Seeing the order of the colors allows us to read the sequence. The sequences of each of these millions of pieces of DNA are stitched together using computer programs to create a complete sequence of the entire genome. This isn't the only way to read the letter sequences of pieces of DNA, but it's one of the most common. Of course, just reading the letters in the genome doesn't tell us much. It's kind of like looking through a book written in a language you don't speak. You can recognize all the letters but still have no idea what's going on. So, the next step is to decipher what the sequence means, how your genome and my genome are different. Interpreting the genes of the genome is the part scientists are still working on. While not every difference is consequential, the sum of these differences is responsible for differences in how we look, what we like, how we act, and even how likely we are to get sick or respond to specific medicines. Better understanding of how disparities between our genomes account for these differences is sure to change the way we think not only about how doctors treat their patients, but also how we treat each other.

You've probably heard of the human genome, the huge collection of genes inside each and every one of your cells. You probably also know that we've sequenced the human genome, but what does that actually mean? How do you sequence someone's genome? Let's back up a bit. What is a genome? Well, a genome is all the genes plus some extra that make up an organism. Genes are made up of DNA, and DNA is made up of long, paired strands of A's, T's, C's, and G's. Your genome is the code that your cells use to know how to behave. Cells interacting together make tissues. Tissues cooperating with each other make organs.

Well, a genome is all the genes plus some extra that make up an organism. Genes are made up of DNA, and DNA is made up of long, paired strands of A's, T's, C's, and G's. Your genome is the code that your cells use to know how to behave. Cells interacting together make tissues. Tissues cooperating with each other make organs. Organs cooperating with each other make an organism, you! So, you are who you are in large part because of your genome. The first human genome was sequenced ten years ago and was no easy task. It took two decades to complete, required the effort of hundreds of scientists across dozens of countries, and cost over three billion dollars. But some day very soon, it will be possible to know the sequence of letters that make up your own personal genome all in a matter of minutes and for less than the cost of a pretty nice birthday present. How is that possible? Let's take a closer look. Knowing the sequence of the billions of letters that make up your genome is the goal of genome sequencing. A genome is both really, really big and very, very small. The individual letters of DNA, the A's, T's, G's, and C's, are only eight or ten atoms wide, and they're all packed together into a clump, like a ball of yarn. So, to get all that information out of that tiny space, scientists first have to break the long string of DNA down into smaller pieces. Each of these pieces is then separated in space and sequenced individually, but how? It's helpful to remember that DNA binds to other DNA if the sequences are the exact opposite of each other. A's bind to T's, and T's bind to A's. G's bind to C's, and C's to G's. If the A-T-G-C sequence of two pieces of DNA are exact opposites, they stick together. Because the genome pieces are so very small, we need some way to increase the signal we can detect from each of the individual letters. In the most common method, scientists use enzymes to make thousands of copies of each genome piece. So, we now have thousands of replicas of each of the genome pieces, all with the same sequence of A's, T's, G's, and C's. But we have to read them all somehow. To do this, we need to make a batch of special letters, each with a distinct color. A mixture of these special colored letters and enzymes are then added to the genome we're trying to read. At each spot on the genome, one of the special letters binds to its opposite letter, so we now have a double-stranded piece of DNA with a colorful spot at each letter. Scientists then take pictures of each snippet of genome. Seeing the order of the colors allows us to read the sequence. The sequences of each of these millions of pieces of DNA are stitched together using computer programs to create a complete sequence of the entire genome. This isn't the only way to read the letter sequences of pieces of DNA, but it's one of the most common. Of course, just reading the letters in the genome doesn't tell us much. It's kind of like looking through a book written in a language you don't speak. You can recognize all the letters but still have no idea what's going on. So, the next step is to decipher what the sequence means, how your genome and my genome are different. Interpreting the genes of the genome is the part scientists are still working on. While not every difference is consequential, the sum of these differences is responsible for differences in how we look, what we like, how we act, and even how likely we are to get sick or respond to specific medicines. Better understanding of how disparities between our genomes account for these differences is sure to change the way we think not only about how doctors treat their patients, but also how we treat each other.

**Transcript**:
You've probably heard of the human genome, the huge collection of genes inside each and every one of your cells. You probably also know that we've sequenced the human genome, but what does that actually mean? How do you sequence someone's genome? Let's back up a bit. What is a genome? Well, a genome is all the genes plus some extra that make up an organism. Genes are made up of DNA, and DNA is made up of long, paired strands of A's, T's, C's, and G's. Your genome is the code that your cells use to know how to behave. Cells interacting together make tissues. Tissues cooperating with each other make organs. Organs cooperating with each other make an organism, you! So, you are who you are in large part because of your genome. The first human genome was sequenced ten years ago and was no easy task. It took two decades to complete, required the effort of hundreds of scientists across dozens of countries, and cost over three billion dollars. But some day very soon, it will be possible to know the sequence of letters that make up your own personal genome all in a matter of minutes and for less than the cost of a pretty nice birthday present. How is that possible? Let's take a closer look. Knowing the sequence of the billions of letters that make up your genome is the goal of genome sequencing. A genome is both really, really big and very, very small. The individual letters of DNA, the A's, T's, G's, and C's, are only eight or ten atoms wide, and they're all packed together into a clump, like a ball of yarn. So, to get all that information out of that tiny space, scientists first have to break the long string of DNA down into smaller pieces. Each of these pieces is then separated in space and sequenced individually, but how? It's helpful to remember that DNA binds to other DNA if the sequences are the exact opposite of each other. A's bind to T's, and T's bind to A's. G's bind to C's, and C's to G's. If the A-T-G-C sequence of two pieces of DNA are exact opposites, they stick together. Because the genome pieces are so very small, we need some way to increase the signal we can detect from each of the individual letters. In the most common method, scientists use enzymes to make thousands of copies of each genome piece. So, we now have thousands of replicas of each of the genome pieces, all with the same sequence of A's, T's, G's, and C's. But we have to read them all somehow. To do this, we need to make a batch of special letters, each with a distinct color. A mixture of these special colored letters and enzymes are then added to the genome we're trying to read. At each spot on the genome, one of the special letters binds to its opposite letter, so we now have a double-stranded piece of DNA with a colorful spot at each letter. Scientists then take pictures of each snippet of genome. Seeing the order of the colors allows us to read the sequence. The sequences of each of these millions of pieces of DNA are stitched together using computer programs to create a complete sequence of the entire genome. This isn't the only way to read the letter sequences of pieces of DNA, but it's one of the most common. Of course, just reading the letters in the genome doesn't tell us much. It's kind of like looking through a book written in a language you don't speak. You can recognize all the letters but still have no idea what's going on. So, the next step is to decipher what the sequence means, how your genome and my genome are different. Interpreting the genes of the genome is the part scientists are still working on. While not every difference is consequential, the sum of these differences is responsible for differences in how we look, what we like, how we act, and even how likely we are to get sick or respond to specific medicines. Better understanding of how disparities between our genomes account for these differences is sure to change the way we think not only about how doctors treat their patients, but also how we treat each other.

**Transcript**:
and I was so excited that element 114 has finally got its official name that we felt that I should try and say a few words in Russian because my father was born in Russia we've already made two videos about the discovery of this element first of all how the discovery was confirmed and people really established that 114 had been made and then the first time that the name was mentioned at the end of the 2011 International year of chemistry so what's new and what's new is that on the 30th of May this year 2012 the element's name was officially adopted and therefore we can make a new video to go in our Periodic Table of videos so this is the official video of the element depending whether you say it with a Russian accent or not is called flerovium or fium element 114 there is no official periodic table in the same way that there's a standard kilogram but when a name is suggested Ed such as the name fluvium was suggested in December last year then people are allowed a few months to point out if there are any problems in the case of element 112 cerium the symbol was changed from CP to CN during this discussion period in the case of flerovium nothing has changed and the element symbol is f l big F little L though in some fonts it looks like F1 which is possibly a problem now like the other super heavy elements these elements are synthesized by taking the nucleus of a heavy element or an atom of a heavy element and banging into it an element that is lighter and so in this case they take plutonium which is element 94 and to make 114 you need 20 so you take a nucleus of calcium which has atomic number 20 you accelerate calcium very rapidly and eventually after bombarding plutonium with millions and or hundreds of mli billions of atoms one of them will fuse together you can see it's quite hard you now have an element with a nucleus of atomic number 114 that's with 114 protons that flies off to be analyzed these experiments were done in the Russian Research Center dubna North of Moscow which was founded by academician fuu the earlier elements like element 105 there was huge nationalistic competition between us labs and Russian labs and arguing who discovered it first these elements 114 and 116 which were named at the same time are a beautiful example of international collaboration this element like the ones around it has only been seen in a number really quite small number of atoms so nobody has made any compound from it though if you look at the periodic table you will see it's in the same group as lead this cup here was made before the name was announced so it says has the old symbol uuq and you would expect the chemistry of fium to be rather like that of lead only rather more so so you might expect it to be a very dense and rather soft metal highly radioactive so you couldn't use it as weights for your fishing like people use lead but it would probably be poisonous even if it were not radioactive and its chemistry might be quite similar to lead though as you go down the periodic table you can get quite some surprises now the real question that you might all be asking is if you can only make a few atoms of this element why on Earth does it need a symol nobody is going to be writing textbooks about the chemistry fluvium with fluvium oxide or fium sulfate so why do you need this symbol and the answer is that the symbol probably isn't use useful in chemistry but it's very useful in physics because as you go to heavier elements say element 116 118 they will Decay via some of these other elements like 114 and so if you want to make charts like this one that I've got on my tie with the different elements and how they Decay away as they give out radioactive particles gamma rays you need the symbols and if you don't have the symbol then it's quite difficult to construct these so the symbol does have a use even though it's not particularly useful for day-to-day chemistry I've been to Russia quite frequently lots and lots of times to Moscow but not yet to dumna though it's one of the places that Brady and I really want to go I have heard of Florio of course and his Institute but I think that it is rather sad that although he was alive at the time that these elements were discovered the experiments were done that he died before the name was officially announced and so this is why at the beginning of the video I said that the name of this element is really his memorial and I think it's a very positive Memorial because it symbolizes how science has brought countries of the world together in a way although I didn't know him that I'm sure in his heart he really wanted can I ask you a question would you rather have an element named after you or win a Nobel Prize well I think that's that's a very interesting question

it is one of the few elements that is more or less totally useless protactinium is an element which is actually much more interesting than I expected the first interesting fact is that it is one of the elements whose existence was predicted by melif you've probably all heard how melif predicted the existence of gallium and Scandium because there were holes in his periodic table and he also worked out that there was a hole between thorium and uranium where he felt there should be an element now the reason that people don't make such a fuss about protactinium in the context of melive is that protactinium was only really tied down discovered properly in 1918 well after the death of Mel whereas he was here to celebrate gallium and Scandium and that made made him famous the problem with protactinium is that it exists in a very very small quantities in nature and it is called protactinium originally it was called Proto actinium because it decays by radioactivity to form actinium originally because Mel didn't know about the these series The lanthanides and actinides he put protactinium here so you would have after actinium you would have thorium protactinium and then uranium and so he thought that the chemistry of protactinium would be similar to that of tantalum and it turns out that it is quite similar and that was how it was isolated the chemical problem is that when people were looking at ores these are the minerals that contain Metals the ores of uranium there was some radioactivity which suggested that there may be another element which could Decay by emission of an alpha particle helium nucleus to make actinium so it would jump two spaces to the left to make actinium and the atomic number would go down by two the problem was how to isolate this material radioactive element from all the other radioactive elements that are found in minerals with uranium and as you probably know that radium and ponum were also been isolated from these minerals so there's a real mixture and it was the um Austrian chemist physicist Lisa mner working in the Institute together with Oto Han who eventually in 19118 found a chemical way of precipitating the elements of this group and at the same time as she precipitated those the protactinium was also precipitated because its chemistry was similar and she found some sign of the radioactivity in that material that she precipitated and that was deemed to be the discovery of protactinium and it was published in 1918 they proposed the name Proto actinium everybody found it difficult to say Proto actinium so it quickly got contracted to protactinium that's not easy to say either no but it's easier than Proto actinium all the elements above lead in the periodic table have a degree of radioactivity so if we had a lamp of protactinium here it would be extremely dangerous in terms of its r radioactive decay the isotope that's the particular form of protactinium that was discovered by Lisa miter had a um halflife of I think 32,000 years a few years earlier the chemist fagin discovered a an isotope that had a half life of only one and a half minutes which was so shortlived he called it the name brevium big firm brief so bre and so that in a way was the first discovery of protactinium but it turns out that there is a custom that if several different isotopes of an element are discovered whoever discovers the longest lived isotope wins and they're deemed the discoverer there are two other parts that I aspects I think interesting about protactinium the first one is just like Mel said it does form an oxide p25 in fact this is its most stable compound the second thing which is perhaps a more interesting fact for those of you who are real nerds for the periodic table is that it is one of the occasions where the atomic weight of the element you can see here 231 something is lower than the atomic weight of the elements before it there's a another quite well-known pair here that pottassium at 39 is slightly lighter than argon which is the element that precedes it so these inverted pairs meant that unfortunately men predicted the wrong atomic weight for protactinium it's 231 and he said it's 235 which is still not a bad guess there was an attempt to make quite a large amount of it many years ago in the UK where 60 tons of material were processed to make 125 G of protactinium and according to this book the people paid half a million dollars for the um starting material but they were only charging $33,000 a gram for what they made so if you do quick maths you can see even before you counting the labor they made a loss on the material why were they making it then I have no idea it is used for the dating of sediments at the bottom of the ocean people measure the ratio of the Isotopes of protactinium and thorium and from the value of this ratio they can tell approximately how old the sediment is at the bottom of the sea so you can argue whether or not that is really a use it is more perhaps an application than a use

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
I've only ever seen before a 1 gr sample of aridium which I bought myself for another video and here I've got a big piece of aridium this weighs 3.8 kilos and idium is the second densest metal that exists only osmium is denser but the difference in density is so small that you wouldn't really tell the difference it has one of the highest melting points as well and I'm really impressed by this it looks just like an ordinary piece of metal but it's really quite heavy I've got this sample because I'm at the Johnson ma Noble metal plant where they actually process this material they take the sponge which comes from the mines where they dig up the rocks and process it and turn it into metal objects and this piece of Rod is one of the intermediate stages to get this bar one has to process about 6 or 700,000 tons of rock a huge amount of rock nearly a million tons of rock just to make this why should people want idium it's very useful because it's high melting point and its strength because of its high melting point you can make it into crucibles this is a very little Crucible but if you want to you handle liquids at high temperature 2,000 de centigrade you have no choice you have to use an iridium Crucible so here is quite a small one might make quite a good vodka glass actually but the real crucibles that people use say for growing crystals of silicon and so on are really much bigger this is a sheet of aridium for making a crucible you make The Crucible in two pieces you have a smallish piece here that's the bottom you cut out a circle and then this piece is is wrapped around to form the sides this piece of metal which is really very heavy again will be rolled up and welded and what's unusual about this sheet of metal it's not very thick but it's absolutely rigid it doesn't Bend at all if you had a piece of Steel like this it would be beginning to feel slightly bendy you can feel that it has unusual properties it's not like a metal I felt before and it's very heavy and this density makes it very hard and rigid but you can imagine how much this is worth because the price of aridium is approaching £800 an ounce so these are very expensive materials and we're in a metal free zone we are not allowed to bring in any metal to make sure that nobody steals anything if you don't have any metal it makes it easy to screen you as you go out you have nothing metallic nothing that's an electrical conductor so it's easy to screen if you have lots of bits of metal you might be able to sneak something through so when I came here everything went my favorite pen even my belt from my trousers this is something I've never seen before this is where somebody actually chooses the name of an element so if you look down here I should incline to call the this metal idium so this is the first time that anybody ever wrote down the word idium now of course he might have written it in his notes but this is the first official record of anybody writing the word idium one of the other areas where you have very high temperatures are in the tips of spark plugs you know you put spark plugs into the tops of cylinders of petrol engines and when the spark ignites the explosion ignites the fuel air mixture then you get very high temperature and you don't want it to erode away you want the spark plug to work for thousands if not hundreds of thousands of miles and you do this by putting in a tiny idium tip these are the tips of the spark plugs like that they're really tiny and it's important to stress that modern technology depend depends on making these tiny tiny components of aridium and getting them in the right place so you use the metal you need at the really important point in a spark plug it's much less important what you make the nut from or the contact at this end but you've got to get it really right just there and then you get the maximum performance I also like these here these are the grains of aridium that are made from the sponge that comes from the Bine and the first stage of the processing is making these rather irregular sized grains which can then be melted again and cast into ingots before they make bars like this earlier on we were shown a whole tub full of grains of aridium and I could actually run it through my hands something I'll never do again probably but I really just want to pick this up again make the most of it well I've got the time it's like your periodic videoos mace yeah for once I can keep Brady in order iridium is found in very low concentrations on our planet but it's found in quite high concentrations on asteroids and meteorites and a physicist Lis Alvarez in the N early 1980s pointed out that there is a very thin layer geological layer in the so-called KT boundary in the rocks from 65 million years ago which is rich in idium it has 100 times the concentration of idium and this is believed to come from the asteroid that hit the earth and killed all the dinosaurs because it vaporized and put a layer of aridium around the world and by tracing this tiny layer of rock which contains higher levels of aridium the whole theory of how the dinosaurs disappeared from the world was developed it wasn't the idium that killed the dinosaurs though no they were killed by the explosion but it was the idium that left the signature that let us understand what had happened sequence which is around here you wouldn't write English quite like that nowadays this metal iridium here is the name idium and here he says from the Striking variety of colors which it gives while dissolving in and I can't read the name of the acid it could be muriatic acid

**Transcript**:
Element 113 is, again, labelled with this
new systematic method for the artificial elements. So you
have un-un-trium or it might be ununtrium, I don’t know,
which stands for 113. And you might actually ask, ‘Why should
anybody want to make a few atoms of these artificial elements?’
And I think the answer, I don’t know definitely, is
that there have been predictions that although the elements at
this part of the periodic table are very unstable, that there
may, at heavier elements, be one or two elements which are
surprisingly stable, might last for very much longer. They
are called ‘islands of stability’ that have been
predicted, and so people are working systematically to see whether
in fact there are one or two elements that are in fact really
quite stable even though they are super heavy. And when I was
a young researcher in the 1970s, somebody, I can’t
remember who it was, got very excited because they thought
in remnants of very ancient mineral mica, it’s a sort of
mineral that comes in layers, that they found some strange patterns,
which they thought was an indication of super heavy elements
decaying, perhaps as heavy as element 164. Enormously
heavier than anything anybody has been able to create in
the lab. It turned out not to be as exciting as they thought
and there was some other completely different explanation. But
it is testing theories and things like that that really
move science forward.

**Transcript**:
amorium is really a very radioactive element so it is handled in this glove box and I'm not qualified to use such equipment so Mark who works here will tell us about it so this is a this is a vial of amorium 241 which is one of the Isotopes of amorium and this was separated from some plutonium because one of the Isotopes of plutonium plutonium 241 decays into amarum 241 with a half life of 14 years it turns out you can make amarium a number of ways it's generated when nuclear weapons are detonated it's also found uh in spent nuclear waste from nuclear reactors so for example if you took a ton of material been used in a nuclear reactor and took it to one side there'd be about 100 G in that turn would be amorium this is actually ultraviolet visible spectroscopy cell and it goes into this holder which has two fiber optic connections to it and what happens is we pass light from the spectrometer through these Fiber Optic Cables through the solution and out the other side and the spectrometer provides a fingerprint of what element is in that solution and that fingerprint is very specific to amarium amarium is the only transuranium element that you'll likely to have a sample of in your house in fact you may have several samples because amorium is used in very small quantities nanograms 1 thousandth of a millionth of a gram in smoke detectors that we all have in our houses to prevent us being burnt to death if there's a fire they were meant to put it off hi you forgot to switch it off I've actually uh got uh Martin polyakov's uh old smoke detector you haven't taken a working one from his house we haven't taken the working one no that wouldn't be safe but we took one that stopped working this is the inside of the smoke detector and you can see here it actually says amarium well amarium is a strong emitter of gamma rays and alpha particles and these are used in a smoke detector because if you get particles of smoke the S stuff that makes smoke look white um they intercept the radiation and stop the radiation getting from the radioactive source to the detector in your smoke detector so in fact what's measuring is a drop in the current going between the source and the detector and the alarm goes off and it says that there's .9 micro curies now I don't know about you but I don't normally remember what .9 micro curries really means it means there's n 26 micrograms and you might sit there and think what on Earth does he mean by that well if you think of a grain of rice it weighs 100,000 times less than the grain of rice it's got quite a history to it as well it was first discovered in 1944 but this was Kept Secret for a whole year until it was eventually allowed out into the public domain and the reason it was Kept Secret is because it was part of the Manhattan Project when there was all of a search to generate nuclear weapons so people didn't want compet groups to understand how far ahead they were compared to the competition so they kept the discovery of an entire element in the periodic table secret for a whole year uh but then it was leaked out uh and then basically they had to tell everybody in nuclear fuel reprocessing that the objective is to produce a pure uranium and a pure plutonium product stream now here at cellfield those materials are put into storage and over time one of the Isotopes of plutonium plutonium 241 decays into an isotope of amarium amarium 241 and so over time amarium grows into these plutonium stocks so it's possible to separate the amorium from the plutonium by chemical methods when it was first prepared it was prepared because people predicted that these elements ought to be uh synthesizable it's just they didn't exist naturally Rel so of course this was a challenge to chemists there's a little bit of interesting story uh behind the the synthesis of these elements cuz they were quite arduous quite longwinded a piece of plutonium was coated onto some Platinum foil oxidized to plutonium dioxide put in a cyclotron once this was over with they would take this foil and they would dissolve what they wanted away with concentrated nitric acid and then they had to precipitate what they wanted as a hydroxide using an ammonium reagent and dissolved it in the chloric acid some curium was removed you then had the amorium and the people who did this process found it so tedious and so arduous that they actually referred to it as pandemonium which is Greek for uh all demons or hell what is interesting is that amorium is an element which may become more useful in the future it may be able to replace plutonium in batteries for spacecraft and so on So currently plutonium 238 is used but to be able to generate that within Europe would require very expensive in infrastructure to be put into place including a source of neptunium 237 generation building a reactor specifically for converting neptunium into plutonium 238 and it all becomes very expensive the production of plute 238 stopped in the US uh number of decades ago and they haven't uh resumed production to this date so stocks are running low European Space Agency would like to have an independent supply of these power sources so they've commissioned a program of work to look at an alternative to plutonium 238 and it's possible that amarium 241 could F fulfill this role amarum 241 doesn't produce the same amount of power but it could be used in smaller applications I don't like the names of elements that are named after countries because I feel chemistry is an international subject though I suppose that amarium although it's clearly derived from America doesn't sound terribly like America and therefore it's not bad as a name and once Something's Got a Name it's difficult to change it and everybody calls it amarium so we're stuck with it like that and rotate it around nothing much happens oh let me put it vertical and it stays where it is

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] this is the venue where as a young man some of the music that I wrote was first performed it was remarkably a pretty good sounding room with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere it actually sounded pretty good this is a song that was recorded there this is not talking heads in the picture anyway [Music] so the nature of the room meant that words could be understood the lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood the sound system was kind of decent and there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room so the rhythms could be pretty intact - pretty concise other places around the country had similar rooms this is Tootsie's orchid lounge in Nashville the music was in some ways different but in structure in form very much the same the clientele behavior was very much the same - and so the bands at Tootsie's or at CBGB's had to play loud enough - the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing since then I've played other places that are much nicer I've played the Disney Hall here and Carnegie Hall and places like that and it's been very exciting but I also noticed that sometimes the music that I had written or was writing at the time didn't sound all that great and some of those halls we managed but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited to the music I was making or had made so I asked myself do I write stuff for specific rooms do I have a place a venue in mind when I write is that a kind of model for creativity do we all make things with a venue or context in mind okay Africa most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in West Africa and the music there I would say the instruments the intricate rhythms the way it's played the setting the context it's all perfect it all works perfect the music works perfectly in that setting there's no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms the instruments are loud enough the that can be heard without amplification etc etc it's no accident it's perfect for that particular context and it would be a mess in a context like this this is a Gothic cathedral in a Gothic cathedral this kind of music is perfect it doesn't change key the notes are long is almost no rhythm whatsoever and the room flatters the music it actually improves it this is the room that Bach wrote some of his music for this is the organ it's not as big as a Gothic cathedral so he can write things were a little bit more intricate he can very innovatively actually change keys without risking huge distances [Music] this is a little bit later this is the kinds of rooms that Mozart wrote I think we're in like 1770 somewhere around there they're smaller even less reverberant so he can write really freely music that's very intricate and the it works it fits the room perfectly this is La Scala some around the same time I think was built around 1776 people in the audience and these opera houses when they were built they used to yell out to one another they used to eat drink and yell out to people on the stage just like they do with CBGB's in places like that if they liked an area they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore not at the end of the show but immediately and well that's that's was an opera experience this is the Opera House that vogner built for himself and the size of the room is not that big it's smaller than this but well vogner minute innovation he wanted a bigger band he wanted a little more bomb bass so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there [Music] okay this is Carnegie Hall obviously this kind of thing became popular the halls got bigger Carnegie Hall is fair size it's larger than some of the other Symphony halls and they're a lot more reverberant than La Scala around the same time according to Alex Ross who writes for The New Yorker this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet no more eating drinking and yelling at the stage or gossiping with one another during the show they had to be very quiet so those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls it meant that there could be extreme dynamics which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music quiet parts can be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting but because of the reverberation in those rooms like Carnegie Hall the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic in a little more textural with Mahler it looks like Bob Dylan but it's smaller that was Bob's last record yeah popular music coming along at the same time this is a jazz band according to Scott Joplin the bands were playing on riverboats and in clubs again it's noisy they're playing for dancers and there's certain sections of the song the songs had different sections and they that the dance was really liked and they say play that part again well there's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers so the band started to improvise new melodies been a new form of music was born these are played mainly in small rooms people are dancing shouting and drinking so the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that same thing goes true for okay that's beginning of the century for the whole 20th century popular music whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever it doesn't really change that much it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century when this became one of the primary venues for music and this was one way that the music got their microphones enabled singers in particular and musicians and composers to completely change the kind of music that they were writing so far a lot of the stuff that was on the radio is live music but singers like Frank Sinatra could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone other singers after him went even further funny [Music] sweet chet baker man this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone would have been impossible without recorded music as well and he's singing right into your ear he's whispering into your ears the effect is just electric it's like the guy is sitting next to you whispering who knows what into your ear so at this point music diverged there's live music and there's recorded music and they no longer have to be exactly the same now there's venues like this a discotheque and there's jukeboxes and bars where you don't even need to have a band it doesn't need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever and the sound systems are good people began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems and as with jazz the dancers like certain sections more than they did others so the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections [Music] pmc would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies and another new form of music was born live performance when it was incredibly successful ended up in what is probably acoustically the worst sounding venues on the planet sports stadiums basketball arenas and hockey arenas musicians that who ended up there did the best they could they wrote what is now called arena rock which is medium speed ballads [Music] they did the best they could given that this is what they're writing for the tempos are medium it sounds big it's more a social situation than a musical situation and in some ways the music that they're writing for this place works perfectly so there's more new venues one of the new ones is the automobile I grew up with a radio in a car but now that's evolved into something else the car is a whole venue the music that I would say is written for automobiles sound systems works perfectly on it it might not be what you want to listen to at home but it works great in the car has a huge frequency spectrum you know big bass and high end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle automobile music you can share with your friends there's one other kind of new venue the private mp3 player presumably this is just for Christian music you and in some ways just like Carnegie Hall or that when they were told the audience had to hush up because you can now hear every single detail in other ways it's more like the West African music because if the music and an mp3 player gets too quiet you turn it up in the next minute your ears are blasted out by a louder passage so that doesn't really work I think pop music mainly that's written today to some extent is written for these kind of players for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail but the dynamic doesn't change that much so I asked myself okay is this a model for creation this adaptation that we do and does it happen anywhere else well according to David Attenborough and some other people birds do it too that the birds in the canopy where the foliage is dense they're calls tend to be high-pitched short and repetitive and the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls so that they don't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor and birds like this Savannah sparrow they tend to have a buzzing type call and it turns out that sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the field and Savannah other birds like this can injure have adapted within the same species the Tanager and the east coast of the United States where the Forester little denser has one kind of call and the Tanager on the other side on the West has a different kind of call so birds do it too and I thought well if this is a model for creation if we make music primarily the form at least to fit these contexts and if we make art to fit gallery walls and museum walls and if we write software to fit existing operating systems is that how it works yeah I think it's it's evolutionary it's adaptive but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there this is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional romantic view the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion and then somehow it gets shaped into something and I'm saying well the passion is still there but the vessel that it's going to be injected into important to that is instinctively and intuitively created first we already know where that passion is going but this conflict of views is kind of interesting the writer thomas frank says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests that voters like a lot of us assume that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere that it's coming from the gut that it's passionate that it's more authentic and they'll vote for that so that if somebody can fake sincerity if they can fake passion they stand a better chance of being selected in that way which seems a little dangerous I'm saying the two the passion the joy are not mutually exclusive maybe what the world means now is for us to realize that we are like the birds we adapt we sing and like the birds the joy is still there even though we have changed what we do to fit the context thank you very much [Applause]

the music that I had written or was writing at the time didn't sound all that great and some of those halls we managed but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited to the music I was making or had made so I asked myself do I write stuff for specific rooms do I have a place a venue in mind when I write is that a kind of model for creativity do we all make things with a venue or context in mind okay Africa most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in West Africa and the music there I would say the instruments the intricate rhythms the way it's played the setting the context it's all perfect it all works perfect the music works perfectly in that setting there's no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms the instruments are loud enough the that can be heard without amplification etc etc it's no accident it's perfect for that particular context and it would be a mess in a context like this this is a Gothic cathedral in a Gothic cathedral this kind of music is perfect it doesn't change key the notes are long is almost no rhythm whatsoever and the room flatters the music it actually improves it this is the room that Bach wrote some of his music for this is the organ it's not as big as a Gothic cathedral so he can write things were a little bit more intricate he can very innovatively actually change keys without risking huge distances [Music] this is a little bit later this is the kinds of rooms that Mozart wrote I think we're in like 1770 somewhere around there they're smaller even less reverberant so he can write really freely music that's very intricate and the it works it fits the room perfectly this is La Scala some around the same time I think was built around 1776 people in the audience and these opera houses when they were built they used to yell out to one another they used to eat drink and yell out to people on the stage just like they do with CBGB's in places like that if they liked an area they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore not at the end of the show but immediately and well that's that's was an opera experience this is the Opera House that vogner built for himself and the size of the room is not that big it's smaller than this but well vogner minute innovation he wanted a bigger band he wanted a little more bomb bass so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there [Music] okay this is Carnegie Hall obviously this kind of thing became popular the halls got bigger Carnegie Hall is fair size it's larger than some of the other Symphony halls and they're a lot more reverberant than La Scala around the same time according to Alex Ross who writes for The New Yorker this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet no more eating drinking and yelling at the stage or gossiping with one another during the show they had to be very quiet so those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls it meant that there could be extreme dynamics which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music quiet parts can be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting but because of the reverberation in those rooms like Carnegie Hall the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic in a little more textural with Mahler it looks like Bob Dylan but it's smaller that was Bob's last record yeah popular music coming along at the same time this is a jazz band according to Scott Joplin the bands were playing on riverboats and in clubs again it's noisy they're playing for dancers and there's certain sections of the song the songs had different sections and they that the dance was really liked and they say play that part again well there's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers so the band started to improvise new melodies been a new form of music was born these are played mainly in small rooms people are dancing shouting and drinking so the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that same thing goes true for okay that's beginning of the century for the whole 20th century popular music whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever it doesn't really change that much it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century when this became one of the primary venues for music and this was one way that the music got their microphones enabled singers in particular and musicians and composers to completely change the kind of music that they were writing so far a lot of the stuff that was on the radio is live music but singers like Frank Sinatra could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone other singers after him went even further funny [Music] sweet chet baker man this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone would have been impossible without recorded music as well and he's singing right into your ear he's whispering into your ears the effect is just electric it's like the guy is sitting next to you whispering who knows what into your ear so at this point music diverged there's live music and there's recorded music and they no longer have to be exactly the same now there's venues like this a discotheque and there's jukeboxes and bars where you don't even need to have a band it doesn't need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever and the sound systems are good people began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems and as with jazz the dancers like certain sections more than they did others so the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections [Music] pmc would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies and another new form of music was born live performance when it was incredibly successful ended up in what is probably acoustically the worst sounding venues on the planet sports stadiums basketball arenas and hockey arenas musicians that who ended up there did the best they could they wrote what is now called arena rock which is medium speed ballads [Music] they did the best they could given that this is what they're writing for the tempos are medium it sounds big it's more a social situation than a musical situation and in some ways the music that they're writing for this place works perfectly so there's more new venues one of the new ones is the automobile I grew up with a radio in a car but now that's evolved into something else the car is a whole venue the music that I would say is written for automobiles sound systems works perfectly on it it might not be what you want to listen to at home but it works great in the car has a huge frequency spectrum you know big bass and high end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle automobile music you can share with your friends there's one other kind of new venue the private mp3 player presumably this is just for Christian music you and in some ways just like Carnegie Hall or that when they were told the audience had to hush up because you can now hear every single detail in other ways it's more like the West African music because if the music and an mp3 player gets too quiet you turn it up in the next minute your ears are blasted out by a louder passage so that doesn't really work I think pop music mainly that's written today to some extent is written for these kind of players for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail but the dynamic doesn't change that much so I asked myself okay is this a model for creation this adaptation that we do and does it happen anywhere else well according to David Attenborough and some other people birds do it too that the birds in the canopy where the foliage is dense they're calls tend to be high-pitched short and repetitive and the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls so that they don't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor and birds like this Savannah sparrow they tend to have a buzzing type call and it turns out that sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the field and Savannah other birds like this can injure have adapted within the same species the Tanager and the east coast of the United States where the Forester little denser has one kind of call and the Tanager on the other side on the West has a different kind of call so birds do it too and I thought well if this is a model for creation if we make music primarily the form at least to fit these contexts and if we make art to fit gallery walls and museum walls and if we write software to fit existing operating systems is that how it works yeah I think it's it's evolutionary it's adaptive but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there this is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional romantic view the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion and then somehow it gets shaped into something and I'm saying well the passion is still there but the vessel that it's going to be injected into important to that is instinctively and intuitively created first we already know where that passion is going but this conflict of views is kind of interesting the writer thomas frank says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests that voters like a lot of us assume that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere that it's coming from the gut that it's passionate that it's more authentic and they'll vote for that so that if somebody can fake sincerity if they can fake passion they stand a better chance of being selected in that way which seems a little dangerous I'm saying the two the passion the joy are not mutually exclusive maybe what the world means now is for us to realize that we are like the birds we adapt we sing and like the birds the joy is still there even though we have changed what we do to fit the context thank you very much [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] this is the venue where as a young man some of the music that I wrote was first performed it was remarkably a pretty good sounding room with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere it actually sounded pretty good this is a song that was recorded there this is not talking heads in the picture anyway [Music] so the nature of the room meant that words could be understood the lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood the sound system was kind of decent and there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room so the rhythms could be pretty intact - pretty concise other places around the country had similar rooms this is Tootsie's orchid lounge in Nashville the music was in some ways different but in structure in form very much the same the clientele behavior was very much the same - and so the bands at Tootsie's or at CBGB's had to play loud enough - the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down shouting out and doing whatever else they

**Transcript**:
Imagine being a fossil: touring the world's great museums, inspiring awe in onlookers of all ages, posing for hordes of fawning photographers. Sound like something you'd like? Well, good luck! At least 99.9% of creatures that have ever lived aren't preserved in the fossil record. But forget about them, everyone else will, and listen up! If you want your corpse in the exclusive 0.01% Club, the Hall of Preserved Fossil Fame, it will not be easy. You better work! Step one: die. It's a cold, hard fact of fossilization. Everything paleontologists find was once alive and, at some point, died. We'll skip the details and assume you had a long, fulfilling life so we can get to what is really important -- how you die. There are many ways to become a fossil, so let's highlight your top death options. You could get yourself trapped in tree sap, which, when hardens, turns into amber and can survive intact for millions of years. But unless you find a really big tree to sit under, amber preservation will likely remain the domain of insects and other very small animals. Generally, the right place to be if you want to end up a fossil is wherever sediment is actively being deposited, like a lake or an ocean floor. A mountaintop or prairie? Not good! You need to get buried, the faster the better, because the longer you hang around on the surface, the more likely you'll get eaten, scavenged, or otherwise destroyed before ever having a chance to get preserved. If you can get buried someplace with little to no oxygen, like a bog or a deep lake bottom, even better. That lack of oxygen will slow down your decay and give you more time to fossilize. So, let's say you're lucky enough to die and get buried in a shallow sea under muddy, sandy sediments. What's your next move? One option is a process called permineralization. While all your soft parts decay away, your bones get saturated with mineral-rich waters. Bit by bit, microscopic crystals precipitate out of these waters to fill in the empty spaces and pores in your bones. Otherwise, you'd better hope the sediments around you harden while your bones decay away and another sediment or mineral fills in the spaces your bones leave behind, creating a perfect cast of your skeleton. Over time, the sediments around your fossil will lithify or turn into rock. But you're not in the clear yet! Many things could happen to those sedimentary rocks that might destroy your chances of getting discovered. They could get uplifted into a mountain range and eroded away or carried along in an oceanic plate and subducted back into the Earth's mantle, melting your fossil into hot mush. Fingers crossed your rock surroundings will get gently lifted up by plate tectonics, sea levels will change, and you'll end up under dry land close to the surface, but not so close that erosion from wind and rain wipes you away before someone can come find you. The last step in this long process, an intrepid paleontologist has to come find you. Maybe she's a research scientist scouting for fossils your age and type or just an amateur collector hoping for a fortuitous find. She whacks away at layers of rock above you or spots your fossil exposed in a creek bank after a flood. And there you are, a magnificent scientific discovery, millions of years in the making! She and her colleagues gently extract you from the surrounding sediment, measure and photograph all the bits and pieces they find, and begin the complex task of reconstructing how and when you lived based on the evidence they find in your bones. Paleontologists will be some of your biggest fans along with all those admiring crowds at the museum. You made it! You spent years underground in obscurity, shedding blood, sweat, tears, and your internal organs. You worked yourself to the bone until your bones disintegrated and were replaced by minerals and sediments. But it was all worth it because you're a famous fossil! Now, you better hold that pose!

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine being a fossil: touring the world's great museums, inspiring awe in onlookers of all ages, posing for hordes of fawning photographers. Sound like something you'd like? Well, good luck! At least 99.9% of creatures that have ever lived aren't preserved in the fossil record. But forget about them, everyone else will, and listen up! If you want your corpse in the exclusive 0.01% Club, the Hall of Preserved Fossil Fame, it will not be easy. You better work! Step one: die. It's a cold, hard fact of fossilization. Everything paleontologists find was once alive and, at some point, died. We'll skip the details and assume you had a long, fulfilling life so we can get to what is really important -- how you die. There are many ways to become a fossil, so let's highlight your top death options. You could get yourself trapped in tree sap, which, when hardens, turns into amber and can survive intact for millions of years. But unless you find a really big tree to sit under, amber preservation will likely remain the domain of insects and other very small animals. Generally, the right place to be if you want to end up a fossil is wherever sediment is actively being deposited, like a lake or an ocean floor. A mountaintop or prairie? Not good! You need to get buried, the faster the better, because the longer you hang around on the surface, the more likely you'll get eaten, scavenged, or otherwise destroyed before ever having a chance to get preserved. If you can get buried someplace with little to no oxygen, like a bog or a deep lake bottom, even better. That lack of oxygen will slow down your decay and give you more time to fossilize. So, let's say you're lucky enough to die and get buried in a shallow sea under muddy, sandy sediments. What's your next move? One option is a process called permineralization. While all your soft parts decay away, your bones get saturated with mineral-rich waters. Bit by bit, microscopic crystals precipitate out of these waters to fill in the empty spaces and pores in your bones. Otherwise, you'd better hope the sediments around you harden while your bones decay away and another sediment or mineral fills in the spaces your bones leave behind, creating a perfect cast of your skeleton. Over time, the sediments around your fossil will lithify or turn into rock. But you're not in the clear yet! Many things could happen to those sedimentary rocks that might destroy your chances of getting discovered. They could get uplifted into a mountain range and eroded away or carried along in an oceanic plate and subducted back into the Earth's mantle, melting your fossil into hot mush. Fingers crossed your rock surroundings will get gently lifted up by plate tectonics, sea levels will change, and you'll end up under dry land close to the surface, but not so close that erosion from wind and rain wipes you away before someone can come find you. The last step in this long process, an intrepid paleontologist has to come find you. Maybe she's a research scientist scouting for fossils your age and type or just an amateur collector hoping for a fortuitous find. She whacks away at layers of rock above you or spots your fossil exposed in a creek bank after a flood. And there you are, a magnificent scientific discovery, millions of years in the making! She and her colleagues gently extract you from the surrounding sediment, measure and photograph all the bits and pieces they find, and begin the complex task of reconstructing how and when you lived based on the evidence they find in your bones. Paleontologists will be some of your biggest fans along with all those admiring crowds at the museum. You made it! You spent years underground in obscurity, shedding blood, sweat, tears, and your internal organs. You worked yourself to the bone until your bones disintegrated and were replaced by minerals and sediments. But it was all worth it because you're a famous fossil! Now, you better hold that pose!

you I'm Skylar Tibbits I'm the director of the self-assembly lab at MIT the self-assembly lab is housed at MIT International Design Center and we work on self-assembly and programmable matter or programmable materials specifically focused on industrial applications so traditionally smart materials are ways to program materials to have a memory or change shape and just by geometry and responding to energy you can get them to store information and reconfigure and we're specifically interested in passive energy sources like heat shaking gravity pneumatics fluids so with Stratasys we started working on a project called 4d printing and the idea was to take 3d printing and combine that with smart materials the reason we called it 4d printing is because we wanted to add time to 3d printing where materials change shape and reconfigure over time so when you 3d print something it's not done when you take it out of the bed but that's the beginning of its life and it can evolve and adapt and respond to you or how you're using it and it's not that we're trying to replace all forms of assembly but rather this is an alternative method that we could use in conjunction with existing methods of assembly and try to use them as a new tool in our tool belt on how we make things at all scales whether it be kind of the tinkerer DIY or really high precision industry applications and so we're trying to give a voice to materials to collaborate with people

**Transcript**:
I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that by far most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light we can stand on the earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes The Sun Burns our peripheral vision we see light reflected off the moon and in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies the known universe has come to us through light across vast eras in Cosmic history and with all of our modern telescopes we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe these sort of series of snapshots that go all the way back to the big bang and yet the universe is not a silent movie cu the universe isn't silent I'd like to convince you that the Universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on Space itself because space can wobble like a drum it can ring out a kind of recording throughout the Universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of Glorious visual composition that we have of the universe a sort of Sonic composition and uh while we've never heard the sounds from space we really should in the next few years start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there and so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe we turn our Focus to black holes and the promise they have because black holes can bang on SpaceTime like mallets on a drum and they have a very characteristic song which I'd like to play for you some of our predictions for what that song will be like now black holes are dark against a dark sky we can't see them directly they're not brought to us with light at least not directly we can see them indirectly because black holes are weak havoc on their environment they destroy Stars around them they churn up debris in their surroundings but they won't come to us directly through light we might one day see a Shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background but we haven't yet and yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen and that's because they bang on SpaceTime like a drum now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein to whom we owe so much Einstein realized that if space were empty if the universe were empty it would be like this picture except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it but if we were freely falling through the space even without this helpful grid we might be able to paint it ourselves because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines undeflected straight paths through the universe Einstein also realized and this is the real meat of the matter that if you put energy or mass in the universe it would curve space and a freely falling object would pass by let's say the sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in that space it was Einstein's great general theory of relativity now even light will be bent by those paths and you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun as the Earth is or the moon around the earth these are the natural Curves in space what Einstein did not realize was that if you took our sun and you crushed it down to 6 km so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to 6 km across you would make a black hole an object so dense that if light veered too close it would never escape a dark shadow against the universe it wasn't Einstein who realized this it was uh Carl schwar Shield who was a German Jew in World War I join the German Army already an accomplished scientist working on the uh Russian front who I like to imagine short shield in the war in the trenches you know calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire and then in between calculating Einstein's equations you know as you do in the trenches and he was reading Einstein's recently published general theory of relativity and he was thrilled by this Theory and he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary curves so strong that space would rain down into them space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole and even light could not escape this current light would be drag down the hole as everything else would be and all that would be left would be a shadow now he wrote to Einstein and he said as you will see the war has been kind to me enough uh between despite the heavy gunfire um I've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas and Einstein was very impressed with this exact solution and and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist um you know this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions and he took schwar Shield's idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week but Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical Oddity he did not believe they existed in nature he thought nature would protect us from their formation it was decades before the term black hole was coined and people realize that black holes are real astrophysical objects in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it's actually not massive enough but if we did a little thought experiment as Einstein was very fond of doing we could imagine putting the sun crushed down to 6 kilm and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit maybe 30 kilometers outside of of the Black Hole Sun and it would be self-illuminated because now the sun's gone we have no other source of light so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated and you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this uh crushed black hole this crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan more or less it would it might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth but you know basically that's what we're talking we're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan so we move this Earth very close 30 kmers outside and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole there's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe but you actually have to get very close to fall in but what's very impressive is that from our vantage point we can always see the Earth it cannot hide behind the black hole the light from the earth some of it falls in but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us so you can't hide anything behind a black hole If This Were battl Star Galactica and you're fighting the syons don't hide behind the black hole you know they can see you okay now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it's not massive enough but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy and if one were to eclipse the Milky Way this is what it would look like we would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy and its luminous dust lanes and if we were to fall towards this black hole we would see all of that light lensed around it and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't any more than light can escape but even though the black hole is dark from the outside it's not dark on the inside because all of the light from the Galaxy can fall in behind us and even though due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation our clocks would seem to slow down relative to Galactic time it would look as though the evolution of the Galaxy had been sped up and shot at us right before you know we were crushed to death by the black hole it would be like a um a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel but it's like a total death experience and there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole but black holes can be heard even if they're not seen uh imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes each one 10 times the mass of the Sun so now we're going to crush them down to 60 km across they can be spinning hundreds of times a second at the end of their lives they're going around each other very near the speed of light so they're Crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second and as they do so they not only curve space but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space an actual wave on SpaceTime space squeezes and stretch Es as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe and they travel out into the world uh into the cosmos at the speed of light this uh computer simulation is due to a relativity group at Nasa Goddard it took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem this was one of the groups it shows two black holes in orbit around each other again with these helpfully painted curves and if you can see it's kind of faint but if you can see the red waves emanating out those are the gravitational waves they are literally the sounds of space ringing and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coales to one spinning quiet black hole at the end of the day if you were standing near enough your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space you would literally hear the sound now of course your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully so you might have trouble understanding what's going on but um I'd like to play for you the sound uh that we predict this is from my group a slightly less glamorous um computer modeling but imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole the sound you're hearing is a light black hole banging on Space each time it gets close if it gets far away it's a little too quiet but it comes in like a mallet and it literally cracks space wobbling it like a drum and we can predict what the sound will be we know that as it falls in it gets faster and it gets louder and eventually we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy and it's gone now I've never heard it that loud it's actually more dramatic at home sounds kind of anticlimactic it's like ding ding ding um this is uh another sound from my group now I'm not showing you any images because black holes don't leave behind helpful Trails of ink and space is not painted showing you the curves but if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this you want to get moving want to get away from the sound both black holes are moving both black holes are getting closer together in this case they're both wobbling quite a lot and then they're going to merge and it's gone now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging that it chirps up at the end now that's our prediction for what we'll see luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach California and surely somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged and surely the space around us is ringing after maybe traveling a million light years or a million years at the speed of light to get to us but the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever here there are very industrious experiments being built on Earth one called ligo which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over 4 kilm it's a remarkably ambitious experiment and it's going to be Advanced sensitivity within the next few years to pick this up there's also a mission proposed for space which hopefully will launch in the next 10 years called Lisa and Lisa will be able to see super massive black holes black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun in this Hubble image we see two galaxies they look like they're frozen and some Embrace and each one probably har is a super massive black hole at its core but they're not frozen they're actually merging these two black holes are colliding and they will merge over a billion-year time scale it's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration but Lisa could see the final stages of two super massive black holes earlier in the universe's history the last 15 minutes before they fall together and it's not just black holes but it's also any big disturbance in the universe and the biggest of them all is the big bang you know when that expression was coined it was derisive like oh who would believe in a big bang you know but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang it might make a sound this animation from my friends at proton Studio shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside we don't ever want to do that actually we want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe so imagine you're inside the Big Bang it's everywhere it's all around you in the space is WI wobbling chaotically 14 billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us galaxies form and generations of stars form in those galaxies and around one star at least one star is a habitable planet and here we are frantically building these experiments doing these calculations writing these computer codes imagine a billion years ago two black holes collided that song has been ringing through space for all all that time we weren't even here you know it gets closer and closer 40,000 years ago we're still doing cave paintings it's like hurry build your instruments it's getting closer and closer and in 20 whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at Advanced sensitivity we'll build them we'll turn on the machines and bang we'll catch it the first song from space if it was the Big Bang that we were going to pick up it would sound like this it's a terrible sound it's literally the definition of noise it's white noise it's such a chaotic ringing but it's around us everywhere presumably if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe and if we pick it up it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation of our observable universe so within the next few years we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit render uh the universe in audio but if we detect those earliest moments it'll bring us that that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest most elusive questions if we run the movie of our universe backwards we know that there was a big bang in our past and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it but was our big bang the only big bang I mean we have to ask has it happened before will it happen again I mean in the spirit of rising to Ted's challenge to reignite wonder we can ask questions at least for this last minute that honestly might evade us forever but we have to ask is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history or is it possible that we're just a branch off of a Multiverse each branch with its own Big Bang in its past maybe some of them with black holes playing drums maybe some without you know maybe some with sensient life and maybe some without not in our past not in our future but some fundamentally connected to us so we have to wonder if there is a Multiverse in some other patch of that Multiverse are there creatures here's my Multiverse creatures are there other creatures in the Multiverse wondering about us and wondering about their own Origins and if they are I can imagine them uh as we are calculating writing computer code building instruments uh trying to detect that faintest sound of their Origins and wondering who else is out there thank you thank you

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that by far most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light we can stand on the earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes The Sun Burns our peripheral vision we see light reflected off the moon and in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies the known universe has come to us through light across vast eras in Cosmic history and with all of our modern telescopes we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe these sort of series of snapshots that go all the way back to the big bang and yet the universe is not a silent movie cu the universe isn't silent I'd like to convince you that the Universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on Space itself because space can wobble like a drum it can ring out a kind of recording throughout the Universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of Glorious visual composition that we have of the universe a sort of Sonic composition and uh while we've never heard the sounds from space we really should in the next few years start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there and so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe we turn our Focus to black holes and the promise they have because black holes can bang on SpaceTime like mallets on a drum and they have a very characteristic song which I'd like to play for you some of our predictions for what that song will be like now black holes are dark against a dark sky we can't see them directly they're not brought to us with light at least not directly we can see them indirectly because black holes are weak havoc on their environment they destroy Stars around them they churn up debris in their surroundings but they won't come to us directly through light we might one day see a Shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background but we haven't yet and yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen and that's because they bang on SpaceTime like a drum now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein to whom we owe so much Einstein realized that if space were empty if the universe were empty it would be like this picture except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it but if we were freely falling through the space even without this helpful grid we might be able to paint it ourselves because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines undeflected straight paths through the universe Einstein also realized and this is the real meat of the matter that if you put energy or mass in the universe it would curve space and a freely falling object would pass by let's say the sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in that space it was Einstein's great general theory of relativity now even light will be bent by those paths and you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun as the Earth is or the moon around the earth these are the natural Curves in space what Einstein did not realize was that if you took our sun and you crushed it down to 6 km so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to 6 km across you would make a black hole an object so dense that if light veered too close it would never escape a dark shadow against the universe it wasn't Einstein who realized this it was uh Carl schwar Shield who was a German Jew in World War I join the German Army already an accomplished scientist working on the uh Russian front who I like to imagine short shield in the war in the trenches you know calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire and then in between calculating Einstein's equations you know as you do in the trenches and he was reading Einstein's recently published general theory of relativity and he was thrilled by this Theory and he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary curves so strong that space would rain down into them space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole and even light could not escape this current light would be drag down the hole as everything else would be and all that would be left would be a shadow now he wrote to Einstein and he said as you will see the war has been kind to me enough uh between despite the heavy gunfire um I've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas and Einstein was very impressed with this exact solution and and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist um you know this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions and he took schwar Shield's idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week but Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical Oddity he did not believe they existed in nature he thought nature would protect us from their formation it was decades before the term black hole was coined and people realize that black holes are real astrophysical objects in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it's actually not massive enough but if we did a little thought experiment as Einstein was very fond of doing we could imagine putting the sun crushed down to 6 kilm and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit maybe 30 kilometers outside of of the Black Hole Sun and it would be self-illuminated because now the sun's gone we have no other source of light so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated and you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this uh crushed black hole this crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan more or less it would it might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth but you know basically that's what we're talking we're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan so we move this Earth very close 30 kmers outside and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole there's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe but you actually have to get very close to fall in but what's very impressive is that from our vantage point we can always see the Earth it cannot hide behind the black hole the light from the earth some of it falls in but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us so you can't hide anything behind a black hole If This Were battl Star Galactica and you're fighting the syons don't hide behind the black hole you know they can see you okay now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it's not massive enough but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy and if one were to eclipse the Milky Way this is what it would look like we would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy and its luminous dust lanes and if we were to fall towards this black hole we would see all of that light lensed around it and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't any more than light can escape but even though the black hole is dark from the outside it's not dark on the inside because all of the light from the Galaxy can fall in behind us and even though due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation our clocks would seem to slow down relative to Galactic time it would look as though the evolution of the Galaxy had been sped up and shot at us right before you know we were crushed to death by the black hole it would be like a um a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel but it's like a total death experience and there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole but black holes can be heard even if they're not seen uh imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes each one 10 times the mass of the Sun so now we're going to crush them down to 60 km across they can be spinning hundreds of times a second at the end of their lives they're going around each other very near the speed of light so they're Crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second and as they do so they not only curve space but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space an actual wave on SpaceTime space squeezes and stretch Es as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe and they travel out into the world uh into the cosmos at the speed of light this uh computer simulation is due to a relativity group at Nasa Goddard it took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem this was one of the groups it shows two black holes in orbit around each other again with these helpfully painted curves and if you can see it's kind of faint but if you can see the red waves emanating out those are the gravitational waves they are literally the sounds of space ringing and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coales to one spinning quiet black hole at the end of the day if you were standing near enough your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space you would literally hear the sound now of course your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully so you might have trouble understanding what's going on but um I'd like to play for you the sound uh that we predict this is from my group a slightly less glamorous um computer modeling but imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole the sound you're hearing is a light black hole banging on Space each time it gets close if it gets far away it's a little too quiet but it comes in like a mallet and it literally cracks space wobbling it like a drum and we can predict what the sound will be we know that as it falls in it gets faster and it gets louder and eventually we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy and it's gone now I've never heard it that loud it's actually more dramatic at home sounds kind of anticlimactic it's like ding ding ding um this is uh another sound from my group now I'm not showing you any images because black holes don't leave behind helpful Trails of ink and space is not painted showing you the curves but if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this you want to get moving want to get away from the sound both black holes are moving both black holes are getting closer together in this case they're both wobbling quite a lot and then they're going to merge and it's gone now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging that it chirps up at the end now that's our prediction for what we'll see luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach California and surely somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged and surely the space around us is ringing after maybe traveling a million light years or a million years at the speed of light to get to us but the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever here there are very industrious experiments being built on Earth one called ligo which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over 4 kilm it's a remarkably ambitious experiment and it's going to be Advanced sensitivity within the next few years to pick this up there's also a mission proposed for space which hopefully will launch in the next 10 years called Lisa and Lisa will be able to see super massive black holes black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun in this Hubble image we see two galaxies they look like they're frozen and some Embrace and each one probably har is a super massive black hole at its core but they're not frozen they're actually merging these two black holes are colliding and they will merge over a billion-year time scale it's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration but Lisa could see the final stages of two super massive black holes earlier in the universe's history the last 15 minutes before they fall together and it's not just black holes but it's also any big disturbance in the universe and the biggest of them all is the big bang you know when that expression was coined it was derisive like oh who would believe in a big bang you know but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang it might make a sound this animation from my friends at proton Studio shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside we don't ever want to do that actually we want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe so imagine you're inside the Big Bang it's everywhere it's all around you in the space is WI wobbling chaotically 14 billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us galaxies form and generations of stars form in those galaxies and around one star at least one star is a habitable planet and here we are frantically building these experiments doing these calculations writing these computer codes imagine a billion years ago two black holes collided that song has been ringing through space for all all that time we weren't even here you know it gets closer and closer 40,000 years ago we're still doing cave paintings it's like hurry build your instruments it's getting closer and closer and in 20 whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at Advanced sensitivity we'll build them we'll turn on the machines and bang we'll catch it the first song from space if it was the Big Bang that we were going to pick up it would sound like this it's a terrible sound it's literally the definition of noise it's white noise it's such a chaotic ringing but it's around us everywhere presumably if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe and if we pick it up it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation of our observable universe so within the next few years we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit render uh the universe in audio but if we detect those earliest moments it'll bring us that that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest most elusive questions if we run the movie of our universe backwards we know that there was a big bang in our past and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it but was our big bang the only big bang I mean we have to ask has it happened before will it happen again I mean in the spirit of rising to Ted's challenge to reignite wonder we can ask questions at least for this last minute that honestly might evade us forever but we have to ask is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history or is it possible that we're just a branch off of a Multiverse each branch with its own Big Bang in its past maybe some of them with black holes playing drums maybe some without you know maybe some with sensient life and maybe some without not in our past not in our future but some fundamentally connected to us so we have to wonder if there is a Multiverse in some other patch of that Multiverse are there creatures here's my Multiverse creatures are there other creatures in the Multiverse wondering about us and wondering about their own Origins and if they are I can imagine them uh as we are calculating writing computer code building instruments uh trying to detect that faintest sound of their Origins and wondering who else is out there thank you thank you

**Transcript**:
It's the first sense you use
when you're born. One out of every fifty of your genes
is dedicated to it. It must be important, right? Okay, take a deep breath
through your nose. It's your sense of smell, and it's breathtakingly powerful. As an adult, you can distinguish
about 10,000 different smells. Here's how your nose does it. Smell starts when you sniff molecules
from the air into your nostrils. 95% of your nasal cavity is used just to filter that air
before it hits your lungs. But at the very back of your nose is a region called
the olfactory epithelium, a little patch of skin
that's key to everything you smell. The olfactory epithelium has
a layer of olfactory receptor cells, special neurons that sense smells, like the taste buds of your nose. When odor molecules hit
the back of your nose, they get stuck in a layer of mucus
covering the olfactory epithelium. As they dissolve, they bind
to the olfactory receptor cells, which fire and send signals
through the olfactory tract up to your brain. As a side note, you can tell a lot about how good
an animal's sense of smell is by the size of its olfactory epithelium. A dog's olfactory epithelium is 20 times bigger
than your puny human one. But there's still a lot we don't know
about this little patch of cells, too. For example, our olfactory
epithelium is pigmented, and scientists don't really know why. But how do you actually tell
the difference between smells? It turns out that your brain has 40 million different
olfactory receptor neurons, so odor A might trigger neurons 3, 427, and 988, and odor B might trigger neurons 8, 76, and 2,496,678. All of these different combinations let you detect a staggeringly
broad array of smells. Olfactory neurons are always fresh
and ready for action. They're the only neuron in the body
that gets replaced regularly, every four to eight weeks. Once they are triggered,
the signal travels through a bundle called the olfactory tract to destinations all over your brain,
making stops in the amygdala, the thalamus, and the neocortex. This is different from how sight
and sound are processed. Each of those signals goes first
to a relay center in the middle of the cerebral hemisphere and then out to other
regions of the brain. But smell, because it evolved
before most of your other senses, takes a direct route
to these different regions of the brain, where it can trigger
your fight-or-flight response, help you recall memories,
or make your mouth water. But even though we've all got
the same physiological set-up, two nostrils and millions
of olfactory neurons, not everybody smells the same things. One of the most famous examples of this is the ability to smell
so-called "asparagus pee." For about a quarter of the population, urinating after eating asparagus means smelling a distinct odor. The other 75% of us don't notice. And this isn't the only case
of smells differing from nose to nose. For some people, the chemical
androstenone smells like vanilla; to others, it smells like sweaty urine, which is unfortunate because androstenone is commonly found
in tasty things like pork. So with the sweaty urine smellers in mind, pork producers will castrate male pigs to stop them from making androstenone. The inability to smell a scent
is called anosmia, and there are about 100 known examples. People with allicin anosmia
can't smell garlic. Those with eugenol anosmia
can't smell cloves. And some people can't smell anything at all. This kind of full anosmia
could have several causes. Some people are born
without a sense of smell. Others lose it after an accident
or during an illness. If the olfactory epithelium
gets swollen or infected, it can hamper your sense of smell, something you might have experienced
when you were sick. Not being able to smell anything
can mess with your other senses, too. Many people who can't smell at all also can't really taste
the same way the rest of us do. It turns out that how something tastes
is closely related to how it smells. As you chew your food,
air is pushed up your nasal passage, carrying with it the smell of your food. Those scents hit your olfactory epithelium and tell your brain a lot
about what you're eating. Without the ability to smell,
you lose the ability to taste anything more complicated
than the five tastes your taste buds can detect: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and savory. So, the next time you smell exhaust fumes, salty sea air, or roast chicken, you'll know exactly how you've done it and, perhaps, be a little more
thankful that you can.

could have several causes. Some people are born
without a sense of smell. Others lose it after an accident

gets swollen or infected, it can hamper your sense of smell, something you might have experienced
when you were sick. Not being able to smell anything
can mess with your other senses, too. Many people who can't smell at all also can't really taste
the same way the rest of us do. It turns out that how something tastes
is closely related to how it smells. As you chew your food,
air is pushed up your nasal passage, carrying with it the smell of your food. Those scents hit your olfactory epithelium and tell your brain a lot
about what you're eating. Without the ability to smell,
you lose the ability to taste anything more complicated
than the five tastes your taste buds can detect: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and savory. So, the next time you smell exhaust fumes, salty sea air, or roast chicken, you'll know exactly how you've done it and, perhaps, be a little more

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It's the first sense you use
when you're born. One out of every fifty of your genes
is dedicated to it. It must be important, right? Okay, take a deep breath
through your nose. It's your sense of smell, and it's breathtakingly powerful. As an adult, you can distinguish
about 10,000 different smells. Here's how your nose does it. Smell starts when you sniff molecules
from the air into your nostrils. 95% of your nasal cavity is used just to filter that air
before it hits your lungs. But at the very back of your nose is a region called
the olfactory epithelium, a little patch of skin
that's key to everything you smell. The olfactory epithelium has
a layer of olfactory receptor cells, special neurons that sense smells, like the taste buds of your nose. When odor molecules hit
the back of your nose, they get stuck in a layer of mucus
covering the olfactory epithelium. As they dissolve, they bind
to the olfactory receptor cells, which fire and send signals
through the olfactory tract up to your brain. As a side note, you can tell a lot about how good
an animal's sense of smell is by the size of its olfactory epithelium. A dog's olfactory epithelium is 20 times bigger
than your puny human one. But there's still a lot we don't know
about this little patch of cells, too. For example, our olfactory
epithelium is pigmented, and scientists don't really know why. But how do you actually tell
the difference between smells? It turns out that your brain has 40 million different
olfactory receptor neurons, so odor A might trigger neurons 3, 427, and 988, and odor B might trigger neurons 8, 76, and 2,496,678. All of these different combinations let you detect a staggeringly
broad array of smells. Olfactory neurons are always fresh
and ready for action. They're the only neuron in the body
that gets replaced regularly, every four to eight weeks. Once they are triggered,
the signal travels through a bundle called the olfactory tract to destinations all over your brain,
making stops in the amygdala, the thalamus, and the neocortex. This is different from how sight
and sound are processed. Each of those signals goes first
to a relay center in the middle of the cerebral hemisphere and then out to other
regions of the brain. But smell, because it evolved
before most of your other senses, takes a direct route
to these different regions of the brain, where it can trigger
your fight-or-flight response, help you recall memories,
or make your mouth water. But even though we've all got
the same physiological set-up, two nostrils and millions
of olfactory neurons, not everybody smells the same things. One of the most famous examples of this is the ability to smell
so-called "asparagus pee." For about a quarter of the population, urinating after eating asparagus means smelling a distinct odor. The other 75% of us don't notice. And this isn't the only case
of smells differing from nose to nose. For some people, the chemical
androstenone smells like vanilla; to others, it smells like sweaty urine, which is unfortunate because androstenone is commonly found
in tasty things like pork. So with the sweaty urine smellers in mind, pork producers will castrate male pigs to stop them from making androstenone. The inability to smell a scent
is called anosmia, and there are about 100 known examples. People with allicin anosmia
can't smell garlic. Those with eugenol anosmia
can't smell cloves. And some people can't smell anything at all. This kind of full anosmia

**Transcript**:
Penguins have long captured the imagination and the hearts of people the world over. But while popular culture depicts them as clumsy, adorable birds with endlessly abundant populations, the truth is that penguins are exceedingly graceful, often ornery, and their populations are in rapid free fall. Their real life situation is far more precarious than people think. And if current trends do not change, it may not be long before penguins can only be found in movies. There are many things about penguins that make them odd birds, so to speak. For one thing, they are one of the few bird species that cannot fly, having evolved from flight-capable birds about 60 million years ago. Surprisingly, their closest living relative is the albatross, a bird known for its enormous wingspan and extraordinary soaring abilities. It may seem strange that losing the ability to fly would be an evolutionary advantage, but the penguin's short, flipper-like wings and solid bones allow them to swim faster and dive deeper than any other bird on Earth, filling an ecological niche that no other bird can. Penguins inhabit the southern hemisphere, being one of the few bird species able to breed in the coldest environments. But contrary to popular belief, they are not restricted to cold regions nor are there any at the North Pole. In fact, only 4 of the 18 penguin species regularly live and breed in Antarctica. Most penguins live in subtemperate to temperate regions. And the Galapagos penguin even lives and breeds right near the equator off the coast of South America. They are also found in South Africa, Namibia, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as on a number of islands in the southern Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Antarctic Oceans. Although penguins spend 75% of their lives at sea, they must come to shore every year to reproduce and to molt their feathers. They do this in a variety of places, from the temporary ice sheets of the Antarctic to the beaches of South Africa and Namibia, to the rocky shores of subantarctic islands, to the craggy lava surfaces in the Galapagos. Different penguin species have different nesting practices. Some dig burrows into dirt, sand, or dried guano; some nest in tussock grasses; some build nests out of small rocks, sticks, and bones; while others don't build any nests at all. Although most penguins lay a clutch of two eggs, the two largest species, the King and the Emperor, lay a single egg that they incubate on top of their feet for approximately two months. Unfortunately, 15 of the 18 penguin species are currently listed as threatened, near-threatened, or endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In the last several decades, we have seen the world populations of most penguin species decline by up to 90%, with two of them, the Yellow-eyed and Galapagos penguins, down to just a few thousand birds. Penguins are an indicator species, the proverbial "canary in the coal mine." Simply put, if penguins are dying, it means our oceans are dying. And sadly, most of this decline is attributable to human activities. Historically, penguins have had to deal with multiple disturbances. The mass collection of penguin eggs and the harvesting of the seabird guano they nested in caused the dramatic decline of several penguin species. If you're wondering what humans would want with seabird poop, it was used as an ingredient in fertilizer and in gunpowder, being so valuable that in the 19th century, it was known as white gold. Current threats to penguins include the destruction of both marine and terrestrial habitats, introduced predators, entrapment in fishing nets, and pollution from plastics and chemicals. There have also been several large-scale oil spills over the past 50 years that have killed or impacted tens of thousands of penguins around the world. But the two major threats to penguins today are global warming and overfishing. Global warming impacts penguins in multiple ways, from interrupting the production of krill due to decreased sea ice formation in the Antarctic, to increasing the frequency and severity of storms that destroy nests, to shifting the cold water currents carrying the penguins' prey too far away from penguin breeding and foraging grounds. Even though humans may be the greatest threat to penguins, we are also their greatest hope. Many research and conservation projects are underway to protect penguin habitats and restore vulnerable populations. With a little help from us and some changes in the practices that impact our planet and oceans, there is hope that our tuxedo-clad friends will still be around in the next century.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 13, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Penguins have long captured the imagination and the hearts of people the world over. But while popular culture depicts them as clumsy, adorable birds with endlessly abundant populations, the truth is that penguins are exceedingly graceful, often ornery, and their populations are in rapid free fall. Their real life situation is far more precarious than people think. And if current trends do not change, it may not be long before penguins can only be found in movies. There are many things about penguins that make them odd birds, so to speak. For one thing, they are one of the few bird species that cannot fly, having evolved from flight-capable birds about 60 million years ago. Surprisingly, their closest living relative is the albatross, a bird known for its enormous wingspan and extraordinary soaring abilities. It may seem strange that losing the ability to fly would be an evolutionary advantage, but the penguin's short, flipper-like wings and solid bones allow them to swim faster and dive deeper than any other bird on Earth, filling an ecological niche that no other bird can. Penguins inhabit the southern hemisphere, being one of the few bird species able to breed in the coldest environments. But contrary to popular belief, they are not restricted to cold regions nor are there any at the North Pole. In fact, only 4 of the 18 penguin species regularly live and breed in Antarctica. Most penguins live in subtemperate to temperate regions. And the Galapagos penguin even lives and breeds right near the equator off the coast of South America. They are also found in South Africa, Namibia, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as on a number of islands in the southern Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Antarctic Oceans. Although penguins spend 75% of their lives at sea, they must come to shore every year to reproduce and to molt their feathers. They do this in a variety of places, from the temporary ice sheets of the Antarctic to the beaches of South Africa and Namibia, to the rocky shores of subantarctic islands, to the craggy lava surfaces in the Galapagos. Different penguin species have different nesting practices. Some dig burrows into dirt, sand, or dried guano; some nest in tussock grasses; some build nests out of small rocks, sticks, and bones; while others don't build any nests at all. Although most penguins lay a clutch of two eggs, the two largest species, the King and the Emperor, lay a single egg that they incubate on top of their feet for approximately two months. Unfortunately, 15 of the 18 penguin species are currently listed as threatened, near-threatened, or endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In the last several decades, we have seen the world populations of most penguin species decline by up to 90%, with two of them, the Yellow-eyed and Galapagos penguins, down to just a few thousand birds. Penguins are an indicator species, the proverbial "canary in the coal mine." Simply put, if penguins are dying, it means our oceans are dying. And sadly, most of this decline is attributable to human activities. Historically, penguins have had to deal with multiple disturbances.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Everyone knows that stories are made up of words, from short poems to epic novels. But did you know that a single word itself can tell an entire story? You see, just as we can look at a story's plot, setting, and characters, we can also study the history of an individual word, where it developed, and the cultures and people who helped shape it. Looking into the story of a word is like counting the rings of a tree. Newer words, like Google or cyborg, have shorter stories. But the older the word, the longer the story and the more it stands to reveal to us not only about itself, but about ourselves and our history. The oldest words in present-day English are those that come from Old English, the ancestor of our modern language whose first seeds were planted about 1500 years ago. Compared to languages like Greek or Chinese that date back thousands of years, English is just a sapling in the lexical forest. But the stories of its words often start long before English itself took root. One such word is the familiar word true, as in true stories. Let's take a look. True usually means factual, correct, or faithful to reality. It can also mean exact, properly positioned, upright, or straight. A true friend is loyal, reliable, faithful, and steadfast. The word true is a simple word, and we can add some affixes to grow its family tree with words like truer, truest, truly, truth, and untruth. But if we go in the other direction to look at the roots of true itself, we find even more relatives further up the family tree. The words trust, bethroth, and truce all derive from the same source as true, and these words all denote faithfulness or confidence. A thousand years ago, the word true looked and sounded different than it does today. In several Old English dialects, the word treow was a noun that meant good faith or trust, a pledge or a promise. But it also had another definition, tree, and that's no coincidence. If we trace the roots back even farther, we find that both meanings derive from a common origin, where some of the earliest expressions of the concept of truth were associated with the uprightness of an oak, the steadiness of a silver birch, and the fidelity of an orchard baring fruit year after year. This may sound like a stretch at first, but trees are the oldest living organisms on this planet. Some that would have been called treow long ago still stand today. The Fortingall Yew in Scotland is more than 2,000 years old. A Californian Bristlecone Pine is more than 5,000. And Utah's Pando-quaking Aspen Grove has a single root system that dates back more than 80 millennia. Trees have also held a sacred place in many cultures throughout history. The Celtic peoples who first inhabited the British Isles believed that trees housed deities. And, in fact, the ancient Druids take their name from the same ancient root as tree. Planting a tree is itself an act of faith and commitment. Not only are trees upright and prototypically straight, but they are actual, solid, and real, something you can see and touch. And they are as reliable and steadfast to us today as they were a millennium ago, nurturing us, sheltering us, and providing the pages of our books. Philosophers and poets, people in search of the truth, have often sought it in trees. "What did the tree learn from the Earth to be able to talk with the sky?" asked Pablo Neruda. "A tree falls the way it leans," says an old proverb. Just as trees mark our landscapes and witness our histories, the stories of words landscape our language, capturing the rains and sunshine of generations and sending roots and branches far and wide. As there is a whole orchard in a single seed, there is a whole story in a single word, and that's the truth.

for the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk I'll try to spin a story about energy and oil is a convenient starting place the talk will be broadly about energy but oil is a good place to start and one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff you take about eight carbon aedra so carbon atoms about 20 hydrogen atoms you put them together at exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid very energy dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels it's great stuff now as far as it goes there's a lot of oil out there in the world right here's my little pocket map of where it's all located a bigger one for you to look at but this is it this is the oil in the world geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is this is about a hundred trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today now that's one story about oil and we could end it there and say well oil is going to last forever because well there's just a lot of it but there's actually more to the story than that oh by the way if you think you're very far from some of this oil a thousand meters below where you're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world come talk to me about it I'll fill in some of the details if you want so that's one of the stories of oil there's just a lot of it but what about oil where is it any energy system then here's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil and it's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years now here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about for the last 25 years oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy system there was one kind of peak oil in 1985 when oil represented 50% of global energy supply now it's about 35% it's been declining and I believe it will continue to decline gasoline consumption in the u.s. probably peaked in 2007 and is declining so oil is playing a less significant role every year right and and so 25 years ago there was a peak oil just like in the 1920s there was a peak pole and a hundred years before that there was a peak wood this is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems and what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades well a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear for starters and what goes on in the future well I think out ahead of us a few decades is Pete gas and beyond that peak renewables now tell you another little very important story about this picture now I'm not pretending that energy use in total isn't increasing it is that's another part of the story come talk to me about it we'll fill in some of the details but there's a very important message here this is 200 years of history and for 200 years we've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system energy systems of the world becoming progressively year-on-year decade on decade century round century becoming less carbon intense and that continues into the future with the renewables that we're developing today reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy by mid-century now that might be the end of the story okay we just replace it all with conventional renewables but I think actually there's more to the story than that and to tell the next part of the story this is looking out say 2100 and beyond what is the future of truly sustainable carbon free energy well we have to take a little excursion and we'll start in Central Texas here's piece of limestone picked it up outside of Marble Falls Texas it's about 400 million years old and it's just limestone nothing really special about it now here's a piece of chalk I picked this up at MIT it's a little younger and it's different than this limestone you can see that you wouldn't build a building out of this stuff and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this we have very different notes not different it's not different it's the same stuff calcium carbonate calcium carbonate what's different is how the molecules are put together now if you think that's kind of neat the story gets really neat right now off the coast of California comes this it's an abalone shell now millions of abalone every year make the shell oh by the way just in case you weren't already guessing calcium carbonate it's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this but it's not the same stuff it's different it's it's thousands of times maybe three thousand times tougher than this and why because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers making this beautiful iridescent mother-of-pearl very specialized material that the abalone self-assembles millions of millions of abalone all the time every day every year this is pretty incredible stuff all the same what's different how the molecules are put together now what does this have to do with energy here's a piece of coal and I'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting is this chalk now whether we're talking about fuels or energy carriers or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn't need to nature didn't need to because unlike the abalone shell the survival of a species didn't depend on building those materials until maybe now when it might just matter so when we think about the future of energy imagine what would it be like if instead of this we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently and so that is my story the oil will never run out it's not because we have a lot of it it's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills it's because well thousands of years ago people invented ideas they had ideas innovations technology and the Stone Age ended not because we ran out of stones it's ideas it's innovation it's technology that will end the age of oil long before we run out of oil thank you very much you

**Transcript**:
for the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk I'll try to spin a story about energy and oil is a convenient starting place the talk will be broadly about energy but oil is a good place to start and one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff you take about eight carbon aedra so carbon atoms about 20 hydrogen atoms you put them together at exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid very energy dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels it's great stuff now as far as it goes there's a lot of oil out there in the world right here's my little pocket map of where it's all located a bigger one for you to look at but this is it this is the oil in the world geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is this is about a hundred trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today now that's one story about oil and we could end it there and say well oil is going to last forever because well there's just a lot of it but there's actually more to the story than that oh by the way if you think you're very far from some of this oil a thousand meters below where you're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world come talk to me about it I'll fill in some of the details if you want so that's one of the stories of oil there's just a lot of it but what about oil where is it any energy system then here's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil and it's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years now here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about for the last 25 years oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy system there was one kind of peak oil in 1985 when oil represented 50% of global energy supply now it's about 35% it's been declining and I believe it will continue to decline gasoline consumption in the u.s. probably peaked in 2007 and is declining so oil is playing a less significant role every year right and and so 25 years ago there was a peak oil just like in the 1920s there was a peak pole and a hundred years before that there was a peak wood this is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems and what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades well a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear for starters and what goes on in the future well I think out ahead of us a few decades is Pete gas and beyond that peak renewables now tell you another little very important story about this picture now I'm not pretending that energy use in total isn't increasing it is that's another part of the story come talk to me about it we'll fill in some of the details but there's a very important message here this is 200 years of history and for 200 years we've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system energy systems of the world becoming progressively year-on-year decade on decade century round century becoming less carbon intense and that continues into the future with the renewables that we're developing today reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy by mid-century now that might be the end of the story okay we just replace it all with conventional renewables but I think actually there's more to the story than that and to tell the next part of the story this is looking out say 2100 and beyond what is the future of truly sustainable carbon free energy well we have to take a little excursion and we'll start in Central Texas here's piece of limestone picked it up outside of Marble Falls Texas it's about 400 million years old and it's just limestone nothing really special about it now here's a piece of chalk I picked this up at MIT it's a little younger and it's different than this limestone you can see that you wouldn't build a building out of this stuff and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this we have very different notes not different it's not different it's the same stuff calcium carbonate calcium carbonate what's different is how the molecules are put together now if you think that's kind of neat the story gets really neat right now off the coast of California comes this it's an abalone shell now millions of abalone every year make the shell oh by the way just in case you weren't already guessing calcium carbonate it's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this but it's not the same stuff it's different it's it's thousands of times maybe three thousand times tougher than this and why because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers making this beautiful iridescent mother-of-pearl very specialized material that the abalone self-assembles millions of millions of abalone all the time every day every year this is pretty incredible stuff all the same what's different how the molecules are put together now what does this have to do with energy here's a piece of coal and I'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting is this chalk now whether we're talking about fuels or energy carriers or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn't need to nature didn't need to because unlike the abalone shell the survival of a species didn't depend on building those materials until maybe now when it might just matter so when we think about the future of energy imagine what would it be like if instead of this we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently and so that is my story the oil will never run out it's not because we have a lot of it it's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills it's because well thousands of years ago people invented ideas they had ideas innovations technology and the Stone Age ended not because we ran out of stones it's ideas it's innovation it's technology that will end the age of oil long before we run out of oil thank you very much you

**Transcript**:
So how many of you have ever been in a cave before? Okay, a few of you. When you think of a cave, most of you think of a tunnel going through solid rock. In fact, that's how most caves are. Around this half of the country, most of your caves are made of limestone. Back where I'm from, most of our caves are made from lava rock because we have a lot of volcanoes out there. But the caves I want to share with you today are made completely of ice, specifically glacier ice as formed in the side of the tallest mountain in the state of Oregon called Mount Hood. Now, Mount Hood's only one hour's drive from Portland, the largest city in Oregon where over two million people live. Now, the most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to find a new cave and be the first human to ever go into it. The second most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave. Now, these days, with so many people hiking around, it's pretty hard to find a new cave, so you can imagine how excited we were to find three new caves within sight of Oregon's largest city and realize that they have never been explored or mapped before. It was kind of like being an astronaut because we were getting to see things and go places that no one had ever seen or gone before. So, what is a glacier? Well, those of you that have ever seen or touched snow, you know that it's really light because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together and it's mostly air. If you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball, it gets really small, hard, and dense. Well, in a mountain like Hood where it snows over twenty feet a year, it crushes the air out of it and gradually forms it into hard, blue ice. Now, each year more and more ice stacks up on top of it and eventually gets so heavy that it starts to slide down the mountain under its own weight, forming a slow-moving river of ice. When an ice pack like that starts to move, we call it a glacier and we give it a name. The name of the glacier these caves were formed is the Sandy Glacier. Now, each year as new snow lands on the glacier, it melts in the summer sun, and it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice and they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier, forming big networks of caves, sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock. Now, the crazy thing about glacier caves is that each year new tunnels form, different waterfalls pop up or move around from place to place inside the cave. Warm water from the top of the ice is boring its way down, and warm air from below the mountain actually rises up, gets into the cave, and melts the ceilings back taller and taller. But the weirdest thing about glacier caves is that the entire cave is moving because it's formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that's slowly sliding down the mountain. Now, this is Brent McGregor, my cave exploration partner. He and I have both been exploring caves a long time and we've been climbing mountains a long time, but neither of us have ever really explored a glacier cave before. Back in 2011, Brent saw a YouTube video of a couple of hikers that stumbled across the entrance to one of these caves. There were no GPS coordinates for it, and all we knew was that it was somewhere out on the Sandy Glacier. So, in July of that year, we went out on the glacier, and we found a big crack in the ice. We had to build snow and ice anchors, so we could tie off ropes and repel down into the hole. This is me looking into the entrance crevasse. At the end of this hole, we found a huge tunnel going right up the mountain underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice. We followed this cave back for about a half mile until it came to an end. And then with the help of our survey tools, we made a three-dimensional map of the cave on our way back out. So, how do you map a cave? Well, cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps because they have pits and holes going to overlapping levels. To make a cave map, you have to set up survey stations every few feet inside the cave, and you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations. And you use a compass and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings. Now, those of you taking trigonometry, that particular type of math is very useful for making maps like this because it allows you to measure heights and distances without actually having to go there. In fact, the more I mapped and studied caves, the more useful I found all that math that I originally hated in school to be. So, when you're done surveying, you take all this data, you punch it into the computer, and you find someone that can draw really well, and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this. And it will show you both a bird's eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage, kind of like an ant farm view. We named this cave Snow Dragon Cave because it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow. Now, later this summer as more snow melted off the glacier, we found more caves, and we realized they were all connected. Not long after we mapped Snow Dragon, Brent discovered this new cave not very far away. The inside of it was coated with ice so we had to wear big spikes in our feet called crampons, so we could walk around without slipping. This cave was amazing! The ice in the ceiling was glowing blue and green because the sunlight from far above was shining through the ice and lighting it all up. Now, we couldn't understand why this cave was so much colder than Snow Dragon until we got to the end, and we found out why. There was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin going a 130 feet straight up to the surface of the glacier. Cold air from the top of the mountain was flowing down this hole, blasting through the cave, freezing everything inside of it. And we were so excited about finding this new pit, we actually came back in January the following year so we could be the first ones to explore it. It was so cold outside, we actually had to sleep inside the cave. Here's our camp on the left side of this entrance room. The next morning we climbed out of the cave and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier where we finally rigged and repelled this pit for the very first time. Brent named this cave Pure Imagination, I think, because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined. So, besides really cool ice, what else is inside these caves? Well, not too much lives in them because they're so cold, and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year, but there are some really cool things in there. There's weird bacteria living in the water that actually eat and digest rocks to make their own food to live under this ice. In fact, this past summer scientists collected samples of water and ice specifically to see if things called extremophiles, tiny lifeforms that have evolved to live in a completely hostile conditions, might be living under the ice, kind of like what they hope to find in the polar ice caps of Mars some day. Another really cool thing is that as seeds and birds land on the surface of the glacier and die, they get buried in the snow and gradually become part of the glacier, sinking deeper and deeper into the ice. As these caves form and melt their way up into the ice, they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling and fall into the cave floor where we end up finding them. For example, this is a nodal first seed we found. It's been frozen in ice for over a hundred years, and it's just now starting to sprout. This mallard duck feather was found over 1800 feet in the back of Snow Dragon Cave. This duck died on the surface of the glacier long, long ago, and its feathers have finally made it down through over a hundred feet of ice before falling inside the cave. And this beautiful quartz crystal was also found in the back of Snow Dragon. Even now Brent and I find it hard to believe that all these discoveries were essentially in our own backyard, hidden away just waiting to be found. Like I said earlier, the idea of discovery in this busy world we live in kind of seems like something you can only do with space travel now, but that's not true. Every year new caves get discovered that no one has ever been in before. So, it's actually not too late for one of you to become a discoverer yourself. You just have to be willing to look and go where people don't often go and focus your eyes and your mind to recognize the discovery when you see it because it might be in your own backyard. Thank you very much.

What do silk, DNA, wood, balloons, and Silly Putty all have in common? They're polymers. Polymers are such a big part of our lives that it's virtually impossible to imagine a world without them, but what the heck are they? Polymers are large molecules made of small units called monomers linked together like the railroad cars from a train. Poly means many, and mono means one, and mers or mero means parts. Many polymers are made by repeating the same small monomer over and over again while others are made from two monomers linked in a pattern. All living things are made of polymers. Some of the organic molecules in organisms are small and simple, having only one of a few functional groups. Others, especially those that play structural roles or store genetic information, are macromolecules. In many cases, these macromolecules are polymers. For example, complex carbohydrates are polymers of simple sugars, proteins are polymers of amino acids, and nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, which contain our genetic information, are polymers of nucleotides. Trees and plants are made of the polymer cellulose. It's the tough stuff you find in bark and stems. Feathers, fur, hair, and fingernails are made up of the protein keratin, also a polymer. It doesn't stop there. Did you know that the exoskeletons of the largest phylum in the animal kingdom, the arthropods, are made of the polymer chitin? Polymers also form the basis for synthetic fibers, rubbers, and plastics. All synthetic polymers are derived from petroleum oil and manufactured through chemical reactions. The two most common types of reactions used to make polymers are addition reactions and condensation reactions. In addition reactions, monomers simply add together to form the polymer. The process starts with a free radical, a species with an unpaired electron. The free radical attacks and breaks the bonds to form new bonds. This process repeats over and over to create a long-chained polymer. In condensation reactions, a small molecule, such as water, is produced with each chain-extending reaction. The first synthetic polymers were created by accident as by-products of various chemical reactions. Thinking they were useless, chemists mostly discarded them. Finally, one named Leo Baekeland decided maybe his useless by-product wasn't so useless after all. His work resulted in a plastic that could be permanently squished into a shape using pressure and high temperatures. Since the name of this plastic, polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, wasn't very catchy, advertisers called it Bakelite. Bakelite was made into telephones, children's toys, and insulators for electrical devices. With its development in 1907, the plastics industry exploded. One other familiar polymer, Silly Putty, was also invented by accident. During World War II, the United States was in desperate need of synthetic rubber to support the military. A team of chemists at General Electric attempted to create one but ended up with a gooey, soft putty. It wasn't a good rubber substitute, but it did have one strange quality: it appeared to be extremely bouncy. Silly Putty was born! Synthetic polymers have changed the world. Think about it. Could you imagine getting through a single day without using plastic? But polymers aren't all good. Styrofoam, for example, is made mainly of styrene, which has been identified as a possible carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency. As Styrofoam products are being made, or as they slowly deteriorate in landfills or the ocean, they can release toxic styrene into the environment. In addition, plastics that are created by addition polymerization reactions, like Styrofoam, plastic bags, and PVC, are built to be durable and food-safe, but that means that they don't break down in the environment. Millions of tons of plastics are dumped into landfills every year. This plastic doesn't biodegrade, it just breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces, affecting marine life and eventually making their way back to humans. Polymers can be soft or hard, squishy or solid, fragile or strong. The huge variation between means they can form an incredibly diverse array of substances, from DNA to nylon stockings. Polymers are so useful that we've grown to depend on them every day. But some are littering our oceans, cities, and waterways with effects on our health that we're only beginning to understand.

Polymers can be soft or hard, squishy or solid, fragile or strong. The huge variation between means they can form an incredibly diverse array of substances, from DNA to nylon stockings. Polymers are so useful that we've grown to depend on them every day. But some are littering our oceans, cities, and waterways with effects on our health that we're only beginning to understand.

**Transcript**:
You've probably heard of the human genome, the huge collection of genes inside each and every one of your cells. You probably also know that we've sequenced the human genome, but what does that actually mean? How do you sequence someone's genome? Let's back up a bit. What is a genome? Well, a genome is all the genes plus some extra that make up an organism. Genes are made up of DNA, and DNA is made up of long, paired strands of A's, T's, C's, and G's. Your genome is the code that your cells use to know how to behave. Cells interacting together make tissues. Tissues cooperating with each other make organs. Organs cooperating with each other make an organism, you! So, you are who you are in large part because of your genome. The first human genome was sequenced ten years ago and was no easy task. It took two decades to complete, required the effort of hundreds of scientists across dozens of countries, and cost over three billion dollars. But some day very soon, it will be possible to know the sequence of letters that make up your own personal genome all in a matter of minutes and for less than the cost of a pretty nice birthday present. How is that possible? Let's take a closer look. Knowing the sequence of the billions of letters that make up your genome is the goal of genome sequencing. A genome is both really, really big and very, very small. The individual letters of DNA, the A's, T's, G's, and C's, are only eight or ten atoms wide, and they're all packed together into a clump, like a ball of yarn. So, to get all that information out of that tiny space, scientists first have to break the long string of DNA down into smaller pieces. Each of these pieces is then separated in space and sequenced individually, but how? It's helpful to remember that DNA binds to other DNA if the sequences are the exact opposite of each other. A's bind to T's, and T's bind to A's. G's bind to C's, and C's to G's. If the A-T-G-C sequence of two pieces of DNA are exact opposites, they stick together. Because the genome pieces are so very small, we need some way to increase the signal we can detect from each of the individual letters. In the most common method, scientists use enzymes to make thousands of copies of each genome piece. So, we now have thousands of replicas of each of the genome pieces, all with the same sequence of A's, T's, G's, and C's. But we have to read them all somehow. To do this, we need to make a batch of special letters, each with a distinct color. A mixture of these special colored letters and enzymes are then added to the genome we're trying to read. At each spot on the genome, one of the special letters binds to its opposite letter, so we now have a double-stranded piece of DNA with a colorful spot at each letter. Scientists then take pictures of each snippet of genome. Seeing the order of the colors allows us to read the sequence. The sequences of each of these millions of pieces of DNA are stitched together using computer programs to create a complete sequence of the entire genome. This isn't the only way to read the letter sequences of pieces of DNA, but it's one of the most common. Of course, just reading the letters in the genome doesn't tell us much. It's kind of like looking through a book written in a language you don't speak. You can recognize all the letters but still have no idea what's going on. So, the next step is to decipher what the sequence means, how your genome and my genome are different. Interpreting the genes of the genome is the part scientists are still working on. While not every difference is consequential, the sum of these differences is responsible for differences in how we look, what we like, how we act, and even how likely we are to get sick or respond to specific medicines. Better understanding of how disparities between our genomes account for these differences is sure to change the way we think not only about how doctors treat their patients, but also how we treat each other.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You've probably heard of the human genome, the huge collection of genes inside each and every one of your cells. You probably also know that we've sequenced the human genome, but what does that actually mean? How do you sequence someone's genome? Let's back up a bit. What is a genome? Well, a genome is all the genes plus some extra that make up an organism. Genes are made up of DNA, and DNA is made up of long, paired strands of A's, T's, C's, and G's. Your genome is the code that your cells use to know how to behave. Cells interacting together make tissues. Tissues cooperating with each other make organs. Organs cooperating with each other make an organism, you! So, you are who you are in large part because of your genome. The first human genome was sequenced ten years ago and was no easy task. It took two decades to complete, required the effort of hundreds of scientists across dozens of countries, and cost over three billion dollars. But some day very soon, it will be possible to know the sequence of letters that make up your own personal genome all in a matter of minutes and for less than the cost of a pretty nice birthday present. How is that possible? Let's take a closer look. Knowing the sequence of the billions of letters that make up your genome is the goal of genome sequencing. A genome is both really, really big and very, very small. The individual letters of DNA, the A's, T's, G's, and C's, are only eight or ten atoms wide, and they're all packed together into a clump, like a ball of yarn. So, to get all that information out of that tiny space, scientists first have to break the long string of DNA down into smaller pieces. Each of these pieces is then separated in space and sequenced individually, but how? It's helpful to remember that DNA binds to other DNA if the sequences are the exact opposite of each other. A's bind to T's, and T's bind to A's. G's bind to C's, and C's to G's. If the A-T-G-C sequence of two pieces of DNA are exact opposites, they stick together. Because the genome pieces are so very small, we need some way to increase the signal we can detect from each of the individual letters. In the most common method, scientists use enzymes to make thousands of copies of each genome piece. So, we now have thousands of replicas of each of the genome pieces, all with the same sequence of A's, T's, G's, and C's. But we have to read them all somehow. To do this, we need to make a batch of special letters, each with a distinct color. A mixture of these special colored letters and enzymes are then added to the genome we're trying to read. At each spot on the genome, one of the special letters binds to its opposite letter, so we now have a double-stranded piece of DNA with a colorful spot at each letter. Scientists then take pictures of each snippet of genome. Seeing the order of the colors allows us to read the sequence. The sequences of each of these millions of pieces of DNA are stitched together using computer programs to create a complete sequence of the entire genome. This isn't the only way to read the letter sequences of pieces of DNA, but it's one of the most common. Of course, just reading the letters in the genome doesn't tell us much. It's kind of like looking through a book written in a language you don't speak. You can recognize all the letters but still have no idea what's going on. So, the next step is to decipher what the sequence means, how your genome and my genome are different. Interpreting the genes of the genome is the part scientists are still working on. While not every difference is consequential, the sum of these differences is responsible for differences in how we look, what we like, how we act, and even how likely we are to get sick or respond to specific medicines. Better understanding of how disparities between our genomes account for these differences is sure to change the way we think not only about how doctors treat their patients, but also how we treat each other.
